<P>
   IRAN-ELECTION (Tehran, Iran) _ The confident mood of the
reformers who seem headed for victory in Iran's parliamentary
elections was on full show Sunday at the home of perhaps the most
outspoken clerical advocate of change and democracy, Abdullah
Nouri. Early tallies and various prognoses indicated that reformers
and moderates who could be expected to back President Mohammad
Khatami will have a significant, probably even dominant, place in
the new 290-seat parliament. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   MILOSEVIC-CRACKDOWN (Prague, Czech Republic) _ The government of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ its support sliding in an
election year _ has sharply intensified attacks on Serbia's
democratic opposition and the media, calling them traitors and
using a draconian press law to intimidate and impoverish
independent publications. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-IMF (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ A new Brazilian government
plan to spend more than $22 billion on social programs in the next
decade has led to a squabble with the International Monetary Fund,
which argues the money should be used to reduce Brazil's
indebtedness rather than to fight poverty. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-LAUNDERING (Jerusalem) _ Almost uniquely among developed
democracies, Israel has not made money laundering a crime, though
it is now taking steps in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-TRAIL (Bangkok, Thailand) _ The government of Vietnam
has announced that it plans to turn the faint remnants of the Ho
Chi Minh Trail into a highway, linking the north and the south for
peaceful commerce as it once did for wartime supply and transport.

   JAPAN-FATIGUE (Saku, Japan) _ When the Japanese government
announced this week that one-third of the working age population
was suffering from chronic fatigue, few stress-haunted denizens of
Tokyo could have been taken aback. What is far more surprising is
that quiet little towns like these are being hit every bit as hard
by a poorly understood condition that leaves many of its victims
incapacitated for months or years on end. By Howard W. French.

   FLA-HOMESTEAD-REBUILD (Homestead, Fla.) _ Homestead has still
not reclaimed its old self. Andrew chased out much of the white
middle class, obliterated an Air Force base that poured more than
$400 million a year into the area's economy and reduced houses,
trailer parks and 3,000 acres of lime groves to a horizon of
sticks. Still, in the rubble of Hurricane Andrew, an entirely
different Homestead has begun to bloom, a transformed community
that says much about the changes that are sweeping small towns
across this state and much of the South. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   CANADIAN-GENERAL (Fort Hood, Texas) _ Soldiers on this sprawling
post in central Texas snap to salute when Maj. Gen. Rick J. Hillier
strides by. He is, after all, deputy commander of the Army's 3rd
Corps and its 57,000 troops. But there is something unusual about
this lanky officer that gives soldiers pause. First there is his
clipped accent, which sounds even stranger down here in Texas. And
then there is his uniform, his forest-green beret and the two maple
leaves he wears instead of a general's stars. Hillier, second in
charge of one of the Army's four corps, a senior officer overseeing
the operations of three Army divisions, is a Canadian. By Steven
Lee Myers.

<P>
   MICH-VOTERS (Roseville, Mich.) _ With time, money, political
momentum and the Republican machine working against him, John M.
McCain is trying to corral an unlikely coalition of moderate
suburban Republicans and poor urban Democrats, along with feisty
blue-collar independents. But showing the confidence of a
frontrunner whose believes his core of support is secure, George W.
Bush signaled that he would compete for some of the same voters. By
James Bennett
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-BACKGROUND (Phoenix, Ariz.) _ When Sen. John McCain of
Arizona describes the people who shaped his life, he invariably
dwells on the influence of his father and grandfather, both
distinguished Navy admirals and larger-than-life figures. Less
widely known are the roles played by two other powerful men in
launching the Republican presidential aspirant's political career.

   OILPRICES (Washington) _ For the past year, even as the price of
oil tripled to $30 a barrel from a record low of $10, policy
makers, economists and many in the oil industry itself hewed
closely to the same line: Oil doesn't matter much anymore.
Technology, which depends much less on energy than manufacturing
does, now drives economic growth. Such thinking was, and to a
certain extent remains, conventional wisdom. But it has taken only
a few weeks of $2 a gallon home heating oil, $20 airline ticket
surcharges, and $75 to gas up Ford Expeditions to make people
wonder if oil is really so irrelevant. By Joseph Kahn.

who said he was a multimillionaire to one of 50 female contestants
vying to be his wife. But even as Fox executives basked in the
publicity from the ratings-rich ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'', they were faced with questions _ and not just
about the propriety of having a woman agree to marry a man she had
seen for about a minute. They had to explain how the groom _ a
comedian named Rick Rockwell with a penchant for stunts (he once
told jokes for 30 straight hours in an attempt to make the Guinness
record book) _ could be taken seriously as a wealthy man in need of
a wif.

houses where he buys and sells them. Suddenly he has a lot of

major art auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's. He and other
disgruntled customers contend that they were overcharged because of
collusion by the two rival auction houses, and they are basing
their suits in a criminal antitrust investigation being conducted
by the Justice Department. The fallout is likely to be not just
embarrassing but also expensive for Sotheby's and Christie's, which
could end up paying their irate clients tens of millions of

DAVID LETTERMAN MAKES EMOTIONAL RETURN TO `LATE SHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gap-toothed grin is back.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight marks the return of David Letterman to CBS' ``Late
Show,'' five weeks after he had emergency surgery on a blocked
artery in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million viewers _ or about three times the usual
``Late Show'' audience _ are expected to watch the broadcast, which
was taped Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The show began with an emotional entrance by Letterman, 52, who
told jokes and recounted details about his operation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the program was unplanned and unscripted. No top 10 list
was read, and instead of the usual comedy bit from his desk,
Letterman simply spoke at length about his ordeal. In a moment that
touched many of those who saw it, Letterman fought back tears as he
thanked the medical staff that performed the quintuple bypass.
</P>
<P>
   More than one veteran of the ``Late Show'' staff commented that
it was among the finest hours they'd seen their boss deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Regis Philbin, with whom Letterman discussed his heart exam on
the show before his surgery, was his first guest on the broadcast.
Actor Robin Williams, who clowned around in hospital scrubs, and
comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who is also a longtime friend of
Letterman's rival, ``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, also appeared.
The musical act was the Foo Fighters, a favorite of Letterman's.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Rob Burnett said that he had tried to fly
Letterman's mother, Dorothy, to New York to appear on the broadcast
but that bad weather in Indianapolis scotched that plan. She may be
brought out later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenging task,'' Burnett said. ``There were a lot
of things Dave wanted to get accomplished. He wanted to talk about
what had happened to him and do it in a funny way, but at the same
time a very real way. And I think he did that very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, some audience members commented to the press (who are
not allowed at tapings) that Letterman looked thin. However, this
is not an uncommon response for people seeing the 6-foot-4-inch
star in person for the first time. Burnett said Letterman looked
healthy and was feeling no ill effects either after the taping or
the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Letterman was jogging three miles a day and ``feeling
great,'' Burnett said. He has, however, been told to switch his
coffee to decaf.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said Letterman would tape a show Wednesday and probably
another Friday for broadcast the same days. ``Late Show'' will use
guest hosts on Tuesday (Bill Cosby) and Thursday (Kathie Lee
Gifford).
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Letterman to do three shows next week _ on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When or whether he will return to a five-night-a-week schedule
are still open questions. For his NBC program, Letterman taped
shows four days a week, with repeat broadcasts airing Monday
nights. That practice now is carried on by his successor, Conan
O'Brien.

<P>
   DETROIT _ The bitterness that seeped into the Republican
presidential battle in South Carolina threatened to envelop its
Michigan counterpart Sunday as John McCain accused front-runner
George W. Bush of being more impostor than reformer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who finds his campaign on the ropes after losing to Bush
in South Carolina on Saturday, accused Bush of trying to co-opt the
reform mantle he has so carefully cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's a reformer,'' McCain said while campaigning in
Michigan, ``I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did his best to avoid mentioning McCain during the day, but
fired back when told that the Arizona senator had challenged his
reform credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Senator McCain spent a lot of time talking
about me, and what I want to do is talk about where I want to lead
the country,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush again accused McCain of trying to tar him with comparisons
to Bill Clinton, which he called an unpardonable sin in GOP
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be okay in a Democratic primary, but that's as low as
it gets in a Republican primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate spent the day criss-crossing the state in a
furious attempt to get out the vote before Michigan's primary on
Tuesday. McCain is once again banking on a heavy turnout among
independents and Democrats who are permitted to vote in the
Michigan GOP electon.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the key will be to bring out conservative Republicans,
something he did in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   `Anytime you lose one, you need to win one, and I think we need
to win one now,'' said state Sen. Joe Schwarz, R-Battle Creek, one
of McCain's state chairmen. ``I expect the stops to be pulled out
here on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recent polls show that Michigan is up for grabs. A
``Detroit Free Press'' survey conducted just before the South
Carolina primary had McCain clinging to a two-point lead over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush arrived here from the Palmetto State riding a wave of
momentum, and benefits from the presence of a large paid staff and
healthy advertising campaign. McCain has mostly had to rely on free
media and an army of 2,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to carry Michigan,'' Bush told reporters before
ducking into services at the Central Wesleyan Church in Holland,
Mich. ``I feel confident of that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has anything to overcome, it could be the trail of
personal ties he left behind in South Carolina, where he was
criticized for visiting the Bob Jones University, a school that has
a reputation for its anti-Catholic bias and race-based policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, defected from
Bush's campaign and threw his support to McCain, in part because of
Bush's decision to deliver a speech at the South Carolina
university.
</P>
<P>
   Bush grew testy in response to questions about the reasons for
King's defection, noting to reporters at one point, ``My little
brother Jeb is Catholic.'' &UR; Roman
 &UR; Catholics are the largest denomination in
 &UR; Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain expected to win his home state of Arizona, most eyes
are on Michigan and its rich payoff of 57 delegates. If McCain
loses again, even his supporters concede it will be difficult to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt it's critical, but I think he's going to
win,'' Schwarz said. ``Demographically, this is a good state for
McCain. It's the first state that's a real slice of life. It's the
first state that has a lot of caucasian ethnics and it's the home
of the Reagan Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Reagan Democrats have been the target of an advertisement
paid for by Jeffrey Fieger, the lawyer for assisted suicide
advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Fieger also was the 1998 Democratic
candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Fieger urges Democrats to come out and vote against
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush supporter, and Bush himself,
calling them ``dumb and dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has disavowed the ad, but Bush nevertheless
sought to use it as evidence that Democrats are trying to
infiltrate the GOP election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I can do about that except this,'' Bush told
about 300 supporters at Detroit's Lawrence Technical School. ``We
can rally our friends and neighbors. We can rally our kinds of
folks to go to the polls to say to Kevorkian's lawyer, `You're not
going to get to pick who the nominee of the Republican Party
is'.'' &QL;

healthy advertising campaign. McCain has mostly had to rely on free
media and an army of 2,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to carry Michigan,'' Bush told reporters before
ducking into services at the Central Wesleyan Church in Holland,
Mich. ``I feel confident of that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has anything to overcome, it could be the trail of
personal ties he left behind in South Carolina, where he was
criticized for visiting the Bob Jones University, a school that has
a reputation for its anti-Catholic bias and race-based policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, defected from
Bush's campaign and threw his support to McCain, in part because of
Bush's decision to deliver a speech at the South Carolina
university.
</P>
<P>
   Bush grew testy in response to questions about the reasons for
King's defection, noting to reporters at one point, ``My little
brother Jeb is Catholic.'' &UR; Roman
 &UR; Catholics are the largest denomination in
 &UR; Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain expected to win his home state of Arizona, most eyes
are on Michigan and its rich payoff of 57 delegates. If McCain
loses again, even his supporters concede it will be difficult to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt it's critical, but I think he's going to
win,'' Schwarz said. ``Demographically, this is a good state for
McCain. It's the first state that's a real slice of life. It's the
first state that has a lot of caucasian ethnics and it's the home
of the Reagan Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Reagan Democrats have been the target of an advertisement
paid for by Jeffrey Fieger, the lawyer for assisted suicide
advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Fieger also was the 1998 Democratic
candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Fieger urges Democrats to come out and vote against
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush supporter, and Bush himself,
calling them ``dumb and dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has disavowed the ad, but Bush nevertheless
sought to use it as evidence that Democrats are trying to
infiltrate the GOP election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I can do about that except this,'' Bush told
about 300 supporters at Detroit's Lawrence Technical School. ``We
can rally our friends and neighbors. We can rally our kinds of
folks to go to the polls to say to Kevorkian's lawyer, `You're not
going to get to pick who the nominee of the Republican Party
is'.'' &QL;

TRIPLETT FINALLY WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And you thought Gilligan would never get off his
island.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett, as famous for his crumpled hat as for his 11-year
PGA Tour winless streak, broke through on try No. 266 Sunday,
finishing with a 4-under-par 67 for a 12-under total of 272 and a
one-stroke victory over Jesper Parnevik in the Nissan Ope n at
Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' said Triplett, who fought off
rain, playing partner Parnevik and the glare from Parnevik's pink
pants to outlast the tour's tightest-bunched final-round field in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the event's remaining 71 players were within
reach of third-round leader David Sutherland at the start of
Sunday's play. Seven of them held or shared the lead - including s
3-4 finishers Robin Freeman (68-274) and Russ Cochran (69-275)
before Triplett took charge with birdies midway through his round.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Armour III, Bob Tway, Brandel Chamblee, Craig Spence, and
Sutherland also had their turns at the top during the morning, and
the tournament remained a wide-open competition until Triplett
birdies holes 9 and 10 to forge a three-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   He never trailed again but had to survive his own brief
breakdown follow ing a rainbreak, then needed to outlast a hard
charge by Parnevik, whose closing 22-foot birdie putt forced
Triplett to make a 4-foot par-saver to avoid a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring good nature of the popular Triplett, 37, left
Parnevik a bit conflicted as he watched his opponent attempt a putt
that - if missed - would keep the Swede in contention for the
tournament's $555,000 first-place check.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was standing over that putt, I was hoping he would
make it,'' said Parnevik, laughing. ``But inside I was shouting,
`No! You want to be in a playoff.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the nicest guys on tour and I'm really happy for
him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett was happy for his play throughout a final round in
which some of the tour's most-celebrated players struggled with the
weather and with greens that remained bumpy from early and
late-week rain.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods,'' who entered the tournament with six wins in his
past seven starts, closed with a 72 to finish 279 and tie for 18th.
David Duval, ranked No. 3 in the world, shot 74 for a 281 that tied
him for 31st. Defending Nissan champion Ernie Els, a two-time U.S.
Open winner, had a final-round 76 and finished next to last at 288.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those closer to the lead entering the final round fared
little better, including Sutherland, who closed 72 to finish 280
and tie for 25t h. Armour was 71 for 276 and a share of fifth,
Chamblee shot 72-277 to tie first-round leader J.T. Hayes (71).
</P>
<P>
   Triplett, meanwhile, emerged a mudder and a closer, impressing
Parnevik, whose back-nine charge included three birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My caddie kept saying, `Doesn't this guy know he's never won?'
'' Parnevik said. ``He was peppering every pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the one for the biggest his biggest putt of the day,
the last one on 18, when Triplett first had to convince himself
that Parnevik would make his much-more-difficult 22-footer for
birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The par putt) was an inside left read and I knew the only
thing that could hurt me would be a bad stroke,'' Triplett said.
``So I made sure I made a good stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, he made a good comeback from a 12th hole bogey
that resul ted from brief lack of focus following the rainbreak.
</P>
<P>
   That bogey reduced Triplett's once-three-stroke lead to one
stroke ahead of Cochran and Freeman, but Triplett bounced right
back to birdie two holes later, then held off the challenge from
Parnevik as Freeman and Cochran started to run out of holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't give myself very any birdie opportunities,''
said Freeman, who was near the lead throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett had enough birdies, barely, totaling six to offset a
bogey on each nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well all day,'' Triplett said, ``but I knew it would
be
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland, like Triplett searching for his first victory, wound
up disappointed he couldn't make a better showing with what he
called a great opportunity:
</P>
<P>
   ``I putted terribly the first 12 holes,'' said Sutherland, who
was celebrating his 34th birthday. ``I must have had three or four
3-putts. That sort of took the fun out of it... but I sure had a
good seat for a hell of a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland admitted he might have learned something about
competing in the final round but added, ``I would have rather
learned about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something Triplett now knows about, although he worried
about it while trying not to think ahead while slogging up the 18th
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a playoff,'' he said. ``I've never really
been in the lead or this close to the lead that late in the day and
it kept gnawi ng at me''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to his Sunday success?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is staying out of your own way,'' Triplett said,
``and I did a good job of that today.''

TEAM EFFORT HELPS JARRETT WIN DAYTONA 
</HEADLINE>
 500-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ A gentle cascade of confetti and imitation
dollar bills fell upon Dale Jarrett, crew chief Todd Parrott, car
owner Robert Yates, and their entire crew as they stood in Victory
Lane at Daytona International Speedway and basked in their total
team victory in Sunday's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Now this was a Happy Hour celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a departure from the glum scene only 24 hours
before when Jarrett drove his badly limping car into the garage
area after a four-car mishap with 10 minutes remaining in Saturday
afternoon's Happy Hour session, the last practice before NASCAR's
crown jewel event.
</P>
<P>
   The car Jarrett had driven to the pole position and to victories
in the Bud Shootout and the 25-lap qualifier sat in the garage,
whimpering with a wrinkled nose, a dinged left front corner of the
hood, and dented front and rear bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   But Parrott rallied his troops _ summoning three fabricators
from the team's shop in Charlotte, N.C., to repair the nose _ and
began working feverishly in the garage that night to smooth out the
body work until NASCAR officials chased them out at 10:30 p.m.
While Jarrett slept soundly in his motorcoach in the infield, the
crew returned to the garage at 4:45 the next morning and began
delicate repairs to the nose, the most critical part of the car's
aerodynamics, which took six hours to complete. According to
Parrott's calculations, 15-20 people did 12 hours worth of repairs
to 35 percent to 40 percent of the car's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had the people that could put it back together,''
Parrott said. ``The big thing for me was, were there any demons in
there that I missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he promised Jarrett his No. 88 Ford Quality Care Taurus
would drive like new when they rolled it to the starting line at 11
a.m., Parrott wasn't certain of that until ``(Jarrett) took the
lead and sat there for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was eating at my stomach and I was getting ready to get
sick, because he hadn't said anything to me over the radio,''
Parrott admitted. ``So, finally, I had to ask him and when he said
everything was fine, I knew we'd be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, the defending NASCAR Winston Cup champion who led three
times for 89 laps, went to the front for the third and final time
when he made a strong move to the low line to pass Johnny Benson on
a restart after the race's fifth caution. Benson, who was 10 miles
away from winning his first Winston Cup race, muttered ``damn it''
over his radio when he got hung out in the draft by Jarrett and
fell back in the pack to finish 12th.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Spencer slammed into the wall exiting Turn 4 to
induce the race's sixth and final yellow on the next lap, Jarrett's
third career Daytona 500 triumph was sealed. He earned a record
$2,277,975 payday, which included a $1 million Winston No Bull 5
bonus that also made an instant millionaire of Melissa Brown, a
42-year-old data entry operator from Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of emotion in about a 24-hour period has been pretty
incredible,'' said Jarrett, who became the fourth driver to win
three or more Daytona 500s. ``Everything had gone so smoothly for
us since we got here about 10 days ago and then (Saturday)
afternoon, in making our last run, getting involved in that little
accident and bending the car up . . . just knowing the time and
effort that not only was put forth but that it actually takes to
make on these cars fast here looked to be taken right out of our
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parrott refused to let this race slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dale came into the garage, I could just see it in his
eyes that he was all torn up about it,'' Parrott said. ``I could
see all the adrenaline and all the momentum we had built up
starting to go away from him, and I didn't want to see that happen,
so I did everything I could to make sure that it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, as a result, wound up leading a conga line of five
Fords across the finish line, including runner-up Jeff Burton,
third-place Bill Elliott, fourth-place Rusty Wallace, and
fifth-place Mark Martin, who was irked at Jarrett for apparently
reneging on a late-race deal they had made to work together. Martin
was hung out high on Turn 2 of Lap 187 and was shuffled back in the
lead pack from second to sixth when Jarrett went low to protect
from losing track position to Burton and Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got lied to,'' said Martin, who led once for 65 laps. ``I
just asked to have a chance and today we had a chance. I'd rather
have tried to win and lost than not tried. I could have sat there.
I did get lied to, but it was a good run.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett openly apologized to Martin afterward in his
celebration, saying it was his only regret of the day. ``I didn't
lie to Mark Martin,'' Jarrett countered. ``I know that he felt like
that and there's nothing I can say that's going to change his mind.
If I were in the same position I'd feel the same way, probably;
when I looked up in the mirror and saw the 99 (Burton) and he had
the 94 (Elliott) behind him, I knew I was getting ready to lose my
position.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jarrett came across the finish and took the checkered under
caution, Martin sped up and pulled alongside the winner. Asked if
Martin offered his congratulations or shook his fist, Jarrett
chuckled. ``When Mark pulled up beside me he didn't shake his fist
and he didn't give me the finger,'' Jarrett said. ``He just threw
his hands up like, `What happened?' and I totally understand that.
I would've been the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was going to tarnish Jarrett's victory on this day.
Spare him the grief. After all he and his team had been through in
the previous 24 hours, they were deserving of a little happiness.

LAPD CORRUPTION CASE COULD GET EVEN WORSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT AND GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The District Attorney's Office has resisted
charging a few dirty cops caught up in the widening LAPD scandal in
the belief prosecutors can prove a criminal conspiracy existed
among Rampart Division officers to frame and abuse suspects, the
Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Such an ambitious _ and risky _ strategy would implicate more
officers than filing individual charges against each cop, and would
allow the District Attorney's Office to use evidence, including
hearsay, that normally would not be admissible in court, according
to several legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   Officers who participated in the conspiracy _ even tangentially,
by looking the other way _ could be found culpable for every crime
committed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, rather than charging one cop for perjury, another
for falsifying a police report, and a third for attempted murder,
all of the officers could be charged for participating in a
conspiracy to break the law and subsequently prosecuted for every
crime committed during the conspiracy. Those found guilty would be
imprisoned for the combined sentences of all the crimes in the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a good strategy,'' said Laurie Levenson, dean of
Loyola University's Law School and a former federal prosecutor.
``You certainly don't want to have to try these cases piecemeal or
individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory is that these are not random acts of criminality.
These are planned, concerted and supported acts of misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen LAPD officers have been fired or relieved of
duty in connection with the investigation triggered by sworn
statements by corrupt-cop-turned-informant Rafael Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez agreed to incriminate himself and other officers in
exchange for a lenient prison sentence for stealing eight pounds of
cocaine from an LAPD evidence room. He is scheduled to be sentenced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks maintains his investigators have
given the District Attorney's Office enough evidence to prosecute
three dirty cops connected to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism from Parks and Mayor Richard Riordan, District
Attorney Gil Garcetti has refused to file charges against the cops,
saying more needs to be done to build stronger cases that will win
long prison sentences for the officers prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Garcetti said no police officers will be indicted in
the foreseeable future. He declined to comment on the prosecutorial
strategies being developed by his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using all of our resources on this,'' said Sandi
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the office. ``It's really too soon to
comment on legal strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   A criminal conspiracy generally is defined as an agreement among
two or more people to break the law, according to Charles
Weisselberg, a law professor at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime is the actual conspiracy agreement itself and the
people involved are usually charged with the crimes that occurred
through the conspiracy,'' Weisselberg said.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal conspiracy does not have to be explicit or formally
agreed to, he explained. Those involved in the scheme could share
an unspoken understanding, Weisselberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the LAPD corruption probe said the nature of
the conspiracy that would be alleged by prosecutors has not been
determined. But they added it probably would rest upon civil rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who has been cooperating with investigators since last
September, has painted a picture of a criminal syndicate of dirty
cops in the Rampart CRASH unit. Ironically, the cops behaved much
like the notorious street gangs they were supposed to police.
</P>
<P>
   If the District Attorney's Office files conspiracy charges
against the cops, the statute of limitations for all the crimes
committed would extend from the last act of the conspiracy or the
last attempt to cover up the conspiracy, said Levenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does also is puts more pressure on the officers to
cooperate with the prosecutors and go against each other,'' she
said. ``You won't have them watching to see if an ax falls on the
other guys. The finger pointing will start and benefit the
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting officers to cooperate would prove critical to the
prosecution since the theory of a conspiracy among Rampart officers
rests almost solely on the testimony of Perez, who lacks
credibility because he told his story in exchange for leniency on
drug charges that carried a 14-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   According to Perez's testimony, which has been obtained by the
Daily News, police officers gained entrance into the Rampart
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit only after they
proved themselves.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the ``probation'' period, Perez said,
criminal acts were often required to prove loyalty, secret code
words and other rituals were used to communicate the acceptance of
misdeeds, and a strict loyalty test _ based on the willingness to
lie _ was administered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you're taught,'' Perez said. ``This is how
it goes. ... When you're there, supervisors, other officers, the
senior officers, they tell you what the history of Rampart CRASH
is. And they tell you how they do things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're either in or you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The syndicate was so tight that cops were not only breaking the
law out on the street, but also routinely participating in illegal
activities inside the Rampart detectives station at Third and
Union, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, Perez said he hid narcotics in a green cooler in
the officers' cot room and his partner, Nino Durden, used an
electric metal engraving tool to remove serial numbers from at
least 10 guns that he was stockpiling to plant on shooting victims
or innocent arrestees.
</P>
<P>
   Station-house beatings also happened, according to official
records.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in Rampart's CRASH unit was closely guarded and
carefully orchestrated, Perez told investigators.

BRYANT'S DEFENSE SPARKS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- Riddle me this: If a defender shuts down Allen
Iverson, also known as The Answer, does that make him the answer to
the Answer, or the question that The Answer can't answer?
</P>
<P>
   It's a point to ponder, because maybe the Lakers' Kobe Bryant is
in need of a cutesy nickname after making The Answer appear as
irrelevant as an umlaut in a Spanish dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the signature defensive performance of his young
career, Bryant held the NBA's scoring leader scoreless for the
entire second half Sunday evening, and led the Lakers to a gritty
87-84 victory at First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, averaging 30.9 points, finished with 16 after going 0
for 11 i n the final two quarters against the taller (seven
inches), longer and sufficiently quick Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Questions, answers, dangling participles, whatever. Bryant made
sure to slap a few exclamation points on the statement -- he
blocked Iverson's shot four times, including three swats in the
final 8:17 as the Lakers fought back from a five-point deficit in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in coach Phil Jackson's short tenure, the best defense
Bryant has played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that to him,'' Jackson said, ``but he said he felt that
it wasn't as good as he's played before. Kobe might downplay it. He
said he didn't have to work that hard, he had to work harder at the
offensive end in some regard.''
</P>
<P>
   But if not this game, then when?
</P>
<P>
   ``I dont know,'' Bryant said, then smiled, ``I just felt like
picking an argument (with Jackson).''
</P>
<P>
   No one debated the importance of Bryant's stand, however -- ``a
great defensive game,'' said Ron Harper. The Lakers hadn't beaten
the Sixers since Iverson joined them, and he picked the Lakers
apart for 41 points a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the blocks, Bryant said, ``I knew he was going to try to get
the basket, and I just moved my puppies, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a thrill playing defense, period,'' he said,
``especially with our rotations today. We did a good job. Whenever
he drove baseline or drove to the middle, Shaq, Robert (Horry) and
A.C. (Green), everybody stepped up and really cloogged the lane up,
and made key rotations out to their players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers certainly were not going to win with offense Sunday.
Glen Rice hit 7 of 11 for 18 points, the other stars struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal was 9 for 22 from the field, though he just
missed a triple-double, with 22 points, 16 rebounds and seven
assists. Bryant, bothered by a sprained index finger on his
shooting hand, had just 10 points through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   He found his stroke just in time, though, scoring eight points
in the fourth. After O'Neal tied the game at 81, Bryant hit two
straight jumpers to complete a 9-0 Lakers run, giving them an 85-81
advantage with 1:28 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Snow's 3-pointer pulled the Sixers within a point with 35.5
seconds left, but when Iverson went for the go-ahead basket, Bryant
stuffed the attempt and grabbed the ball. He then hit two free
throws for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson got one last chance, taking the inbounds pass with 1.7
seconds, but his 26-foot attempt was rejected by O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with four blocks. Bryant had five blocks to go
with 18 points and seven assists as he enjoyed a rare victory in
his hometown. The Lakers hadn't won here since November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well. He had a lot of help,'' O'Neal said of Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson admitted surprise as holding Iverson without a point in
the second half, but dismissed it somewhat as ``a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   A major achievement? ``It's cool,'' Bryant said. ``I'm more
proud of the win, though, because we haven't won here in a while.
... I really wasn't thinking about (defending Iverson), to tell you
the truth. It's like I told you guys, I really don't care. I just
go out there and do the job and try to win the basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did, overcoming a 51-39 rebounding deficit and a
20-point game from Theo Ratliff to win their seventh straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ere able to finish that one just by playing defense and
staying around until we could find an offensive combination that
worked for us,'' Jackson said. ``We knew it was going to be a
defensive battle.''

LOS ANGELES: told investigators.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's not a supervisor's doing, despite what anybody may
think,'' Perez said. ``We vote them in. We have a round table. And
we discuss this person. We talk to people who he's worked with, uh,
and find out the type of person that he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other avenue into CRASH was to be sponsored by a member
of the unit, Perez said. ``And if that person's gonna sponsor him
in, that person's gonna have to work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers who were willing to break the law were tacitly
considered to be ``in the loop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New recruits were carefully watched, in essence given a tryout.
Those who didn't go along with prescribed Rampart CRASH methods _
beating and framing innocent victims, lying in court, or at least
looking the other way _ ``washed out,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   To protect themselves further, members of the Rampart CRASH unit
never allowed cops outside of their ranks, especially patrol
officers, to accompany them during searches of buildings or other
areas, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to use any of the patrol guys, because if
something goes down, you don't want them involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who we have in CRASH. And we know that we can trust
them. If anything happens, and we cover it up, we know these guys
that are with us, they're solid. We don't have to worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they're, they're gonna be able to ... go along with
the program ... whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the language used by the Rampart CRASH officers had a
conspiratorial flavor, according to Perez's 2,000 pages of
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Perez said, if he and others referred to another
cop as ``solid,'' it meant that the officer could be trusted to
commit crimes or cover up someone else's crime and never tell a
prosecutor or high-ranking supervisor outside of ``the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the term ``squared away'' referred to a cop who
``knows how we do things here,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk in sort of riddles,'' he explained. ``You know, you
kind of just make innuendoes about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, there was an unspoken, but fierce loyalty among those
in the special anti-gang unit, reminiscent of the solidarity
required of street gangs. CRASH officers called it the ability to
``take it to the box,'' Perez told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ```Take it to the box' is saying that I don't care if Officer
Perez gets arrested, he will never get in front of a DA and in
front of a, uh, Internal Affairs supervisor and say this guy did
this and this guy did that,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep me in custody a year and never said a word. Everybody's
confident. He won't say a thing,'' Perez said, spilling his guts to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   As the conspiracy progressed, Perez testified, officers and
their immediate sergeants increasingly cooperated to hide evidence
of the illegal activity. Crime scenes were commonly cleaned up
before commanders and non-CRASH personnel arrived, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Perez's December testimony to investigators, Sgt.
Edward Ortiz played a crucial role in helping the dirty cops create
believable stories. Ortiz allegedly was so exacting in his deviant
behavior that he insisted the cops agree upon the supposed tactical
maneuvers used in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough that a shooting or arrest appeared to be
legitimate; the tactics leading up to the shooting or arrest also
had to appear justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the bottom line. If _ if something happened, if you
were in a bad position, you're gonna be in a good position by the
time the shooting team got there,'' Perez said. ``Whatever it is _
the guy didn't have a gun, we'll get a gun there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do whatever we have to, to make it look like a justified
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Perez believes lieutenants and captains in the
Rampart Division should have been able to tell something was
seriously amiss. Just looking at the kinds of arrests being made by
CRASH officers would have tipped them off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Common threads existed in most of the fabricated reports. Guns
always were reported as loaded, and time after time weapons were
reportedly found on every person at a scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that they know _ if they even glance at the report,
you know they know. You know that they know,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean not once ... did I hear a supervisor say, well, this
arrest is questionable. How is it that you guys have a party and
you guys all see five of these people running out of the house and
they're carrying the guns and dropped them?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the officers were glorified by their commanders as the
``chosen people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always: 'Great job. Continue to do what you're doing.
Just don't tell us how you're doing it,''' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' numerous arrests were rewarded with picnics and
beer parties, some at the ``benches'' or Police Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulate each other and pat ourselves on the back,'' Perez
said. ``That's how the lessons start. That's your learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now we know that we can do this in front of you, and you
can be trusted. We know that you're not gonna go to Internal
Affairs and say, uh, you know this is happening.''

WILLIAMS STILL THE WORD IN BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
 WILLIAMS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNANDO, Fla. _ One baseball player left here saying, ``Man,
the whole thing gave me the chills.'' The player had sat under a
huge tent for hours, listening to testimonials. The words had
inspired him, as if he were in church being moved by a sermon.
Which, technically, he was.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference was that this was a Sunday afternoon
baseball revival. On one side of a stage you saw Carlton Fisk,
George Brett, Wade Boggs, Robin Yount, Al Kaline, and Jim Lonborg.
Across from them you saw Gaylord Perry, Buck O'Neil, Monte Irvin,
Johnny Pesky, Dom DiMaggio, and Bob Feller. In the middle was the
leader of the congregation, (Rev.) Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can understand why the witness to the good news, Red Sox
first baseman Brian Daubach, had the chills.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be formal, you can say this was a ceremony to
honor the players who were added to Williams's Hitters Hall of
Fame. Fisk, Boggs, Lonborg, and Daubach were among the honorees.
Truth is, this was more pilgrimage than ceremony. It was a long and
pleasant baseball bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   After Daubach and Florida's Preston Wilson were honored as
Williams's Rookies of the Year, Daubach took a seat next to
Williams. The young man asked the older one, ``What's the story
with the red seat (in right field at Fenway Park)?'' Williams
smiled and said, ``Aw, that's nothin'. I hit a lot of balls farther
than that one; that was a curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole afternoon was like that. Everyone had a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Lonborg explained the magic of 1967 to Daubach by pointing out
that the Sox had a strong finish to '66. ``So everyone was feeling
good in the offseason,'' Lonborg, now a dentist, said. ``That makes
a big difference. You can take that momentum and carry it to the
next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach listened and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lasorda, the perfect choice for master of ceremonies, was
talking _ to anyone who wanted to listen _ about media absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue now is the length of the games,'' he said. ``Do
you think the average family of five is keeping track of how long
the games are? The only people who care about that are the writers.
You know why? They want to finish early so they can have more time
to drink!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Brett would say that Williams's .406 is nearly
untouchable. Robin Roberts laughed about the time Williams, so
angry that Roberts got him out, spit at the pitcher. ``If I had
known he was going to do that,'' Roberts said, ``I would have given
him a pitch right down the middle.'' O'Neil, who played in the
Negro Leagues with the Kansas City Monarchs, recalled a beautiful
moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in Kansas City, we could always hear the best jazz,'' he
said. ``The musicians would come in and jam for hours and hours.
One night, a young man walked in and started playing. Everybody
said, `Who is that?' The kid had a unique sound. You know who it
was? The great Charlie Parker. He was just a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   I would be willing to bet (friendly, of course) that you could
bring the most historically ignorant major leaguer here and he
would not only be humbled, he would be curious about those who
contributed before him. I don't mean for that to be taken in a
mawkish, weren't-those-the-good-days way. It's just that any
profession runs a little better when the current employees
understand its history.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who is only 26, may have had the most accurate line of
the day. As he accepted his award, the outfielder looked at the
Hall of Famers accompanying him and said, ``These people are truly
the geniuses of what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   A 19-year-old catcher from Charlestown, N.H., understood that in
'67. Fisk was in Ocala, Fla., a minor leaguer trying to get better.
He picked up a bat, positioned his hands and began to swing. He
paused when he heard Williams's mortified voice. Ted didn't like
the way the young catcher was holding the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez!'' he screamed at Fisk, while showing him the proper
positioning. ``And then,'' Fisk said, ``he told me to go off to the
side and start swinging on some tires.'' Fisk swung on the tires
until his hands were raw, but The Kid had made his point: You have
to be scientific when you hit. Williams not only did that, he wrote
a book about it. Fisk said he watched him bring the book, ``The
Science of Hitting,'' to life in '67. Williams had already retired
by then. He was helping Sports Illustrated do a story on hitting
by, well, illustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk stood behind him and watched him hit to the left side of
the infield. ``He was saying, `I could have gotten a hit there any
time I wanted,' '' Fisk said with a laugh. And then he watched him
hit to the right. Next, it was time for him to assault a fence in
right. The retired hitter cursed himself the whole time, telling
himself he could do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the greatest ambassador that baseball has today,''
Lasorda said of Williams. When Lasorda said that, Williams began
gesturing at Lasorda, saying that the former Dodgers manager
deserved that title. ``He is baseball from head to toe,'' Williams
said of Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost time to leave the revival tent. But before
leaving, Williams pointed to a covered field nearby. He said Little
Leaguers will be playing there soon, and that he hopes a few of
them will one day join his Hall of Fame.

BECK'S FASTBALL HAS SOME ACCELERATION 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BECK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ So this is why Jimy Williams and Joe Kerrigan
never could reach Rod Beck during the offseason: He was in the
garage.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox didn't know this, but Beck is a major gearhead. With
his brother-in-law, Sandy Neyer, Beck has formed a drag racing team
back home in Arizona that takes its name _ Nine's Mine Motorsports
LLC _ directly from Beck's principal mode of making a living, as a
closer. He owns a 1993 Corvette with two $50,000 engines that can
cover a quarter-mile track in 6.3 seconds, at speeds approximating
220 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine's Mine, like the ninth inning's mine,'' said Beck, who
enters this season with 260 saves, ranking him sixth among active
pitchers. ``And that's LLC, in case anybody wants to sue me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck estimates he has invested $300,000 in the enterprise. He
entered the car in four races last year, and plans to run it on the
West Coast ProMod Association circuit this spring. The first race,
he said, will be in three weeks in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Neyer does the driving. Beck sent both Neyer and his
crew chief to school to master these cars, which are the types that
require parachutes as braking mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll drive when I retire,'' Beck said, ``The biggest thrill
for me is buying the car and building and rebuilding the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest I've ever gone?'' He laughed. ``I don't want to
say, because I'm still under contract. Probably 160. Most of my
experience has come in illegal street racing. I got started in this
during the strike in '94. I was sitting around with nothing to do,
and had a '69 (Chevy) Nova sitting in my garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't into cars in high school. I was into baseball. My
brother Rick was the car nut. But I had some fun tinkering with the
Nova, and six years later, here I am. I always told my brother that
one day I'd have a car that could beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in years, the ninth inning has not been
promised to Beck, who had a career-low 10 saves last season, one in
which he had surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow in May and
was traded from the Cubs to the Sox at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he walked out of the Sox bullpen in Fenway Park,
on the same day he flew in from San Diego, Beck got a save. He also
pitched a heroic four innings in an epic, 13-inning win in
Cleveland in September. But the enduring memory he left Sox fans
with came in Game 1 of the ALCS, when Bernie Williams of the
Yankees hit a massive home run off Beck in the bottom of the 10th
to send the Sox to a crushing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Beck refuses to blame his elbow for his late-season
ineffectiveness, which left the Red Sox sufficiently alarmed to
declare Derek Lowe the closer entering this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame nothing on my arm,'' he said. ``I don't make
excuses. If you put the ball where you want it, you're going to get
a hitter out. You saw Pedro (Martinez) against Cleveland. He was
hurt, but he changed speeds and location and was just as
dominating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get excited and want to get a guy out so fast,
you don't take the proper steps to get there. I wanted to bust
(Williams) in so bad, but I flew open and the ball tailed back over
the plate. And who says he wasn't looking there, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Beck says he has been working out since Thanksgiving at the
Cubs' complex in Arizona and that his elbow feels as good as it has
``since high school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the same guy who saved 48 games for the Giants in
'93,'' said Beck, who will be 32 this August. ``I don't know if I
can light up the clock (speed gun) the way I did back then, but
this is as good a health I've been in for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to extend my elbow to the point I can now
for years and years. In that respect, I feel pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Sox intend to use Beck to set up Lowe, and as a
closer when Lowe has pitched two innings the night before. Does
Beck believe he has a chance to change Williams's mind about his
role?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to,'' he said, ``but I'm not going to create a
controversy over it. The best man's going to win. If he's better
for the job, fine. I have a firm belief that once you make a
decision, stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beck acknowledged that the Red Sox might be stronger if he
can close, which would leave the Sox able to capitalize on Lowe's
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can give you starts, too,'' Beck said. ``He's one of those
pitchers who can do anything you ask him to, at any point in the
ballgame. There aren't too many guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he wants to see how Beck throws before he makes
any decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's let Beck pitch,'' he said Sunday. ``He's almost a year
recovered from his operation. We know he has the mentality (of a
closer). All you have to do is look at his numbers. But will he be
able to get back to that degree? I don't know. Physically, I don't
know. But looking at him, you can see he's already been trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck already has met his Seoul brother, Korean reliever Sang
Lee, whose hair rivals Beck's in length. ``But he got it cut,''
Beck said. ``When I saw pictures of him, it was down to here.''
</P>
<P>
   He put his hand between his shoulder blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe I'll borrow his orange dye.''
</P>
<P>
   And given Lee's fender bender on the way to work Saturday, maybe
Beck could offer him a ride, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ As if Bruins coach Pat Burns
hadn't been through enough during this disappointing season. The
hits just keep coming. A couple of weeks ago, he was criticized by
owner Jeremy Jacobs. Sunday, it came from former Bruin and current
Channel 38 broadcaster Phil Esposito.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's Boston Herald, columnist Jim Baker wrote that
Esposito believes Burns may be trying to get himself fired. It was
a small item, but it evoked a titanic reaction from Burns following
the club's workout at GM Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later it's got to stop,'' said Burns. ``Now they're
saying I'm trying to get fired. I called (Esposito) and left him a
message. He said something, too, on Friday that I didn't let the
players be themselves or something. That's all right _ there you're
doing an (analysis). If you want to analyze that, that's fine. I
can disagree with it, which I do. But to say I'm trying to get
myself fired, that's BS. Call me anything you want but that's
calling me a crook. I'm not a crook and I'm not dishonest. I'm out
here every single day trying to win hockey games, certainly not to
get fired. I'm still a young guy who has a coaching career ahead of
me. Why would I do something stupid like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he realizes he's not immune from criticism and he
doesn't mind when shots are taken _ until they cross a certain
line. He believes Esposito went way over the line that separates
analysis from character assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can question my coaching abilities, that's fine; you can
question the way I look, that's fine; but to question my
credibility when I come to work every day, that I won't take,''
said Burns. ``I don't want to get into Phil's past and I'm sure he
doesn't want me to. He's trying to say I'm trying to get myself
fired so I can sit home? That's the biggest line of crap I've ever
heard in my life. To say I'm a crook? People who know me know
better than that. You're questioning the whole integrity of myself
and the whole integrity of the game. That's (expletive)
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barring a significant improvement overnight, it's possible Ray
Bourque might be sidelined Monday night when the Bruins take on the
Canucks. Bourque, who suffered a whiplash-type muscle strain in his
neck last week against Toronto, practiced Sunday but said he's
still having trouble turning his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty stiff,'' he said. ``It was a long flight and
hopefully another day will help. We're going to work on it and
hopefully it will feel better. If I can't (turn), you can't move
quick or see. I wouldn't want to be in that position. You can't do
certain things because you can't move. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had planned to arrive here Saturday. But weather
conditions grounded their charter flight and they were forced to
wait a day, arriving Sunday instead. The pilot of the originally
scheduled flight felt the runway at Hanscom was too slick to
attempt a takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making that call,'' said Burns. ``I can control the
four-by-four but I can't control the wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burns said it was a disappointing development since he
had hoped to give his club the edge by arriving early, especially
since the Canucks were playing in Ottawa Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good plan,'' said Burns. ``But like everything else .
. . We were going to come out here (Saturday) and have a good
practice and have another one here (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they arrived late for their scheduled workout Sunday
and ended up begging for a half-hour of ice time from a group of
kids who were there to skate. In exchange, the kids were invited to
watch practice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe will get the start for Boston. Rob Tallas,
who is still bothered by a fractured left ring finger suffered
against Toronto, is slowly making progress. He went through the
workout with Dafoe and goalie John Grahame. Burns said he isn't
sure how the goalie game plan will go this week with four games in
six nights. It's possible Grahame will see some action, but Burns
said it depends on how Dafoe fares Monday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A smile flashed across Adriana Spears's face when
she was called for her third foul with 6:33 left to play. Not that
she was happy to have committed the foul, she was happy that she
had done her job.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College freshman hit layups, pulled down rebounds,
and drew fouls in possibly the best game of her young career as the
19th-ranked Eagles defeated the Pittsburgh Panthers, 66-52, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Spears wasn't the high scorer, she played a
career-high 25 minutes, scored a career-high 11 points, grabbed 6
rebounds, handed out 3 assists, and made 2 blocks. So you had to
excuse the 6-foot-1-inch forward for that smile when she picked up
her third personal.

<P>
   ``She really went out there and sparked us, especially in the
second half, not just with her play, but emotionally, the way she
was going after the ball,'' said senior point guard Cal Bouchard,
the game's high scorer with 20 points. Bouchard was 3 for 4 from
3-point range and 5 for 5 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (21-6 overall, 10-3 Big East) were slow getting to
Pittsburgh this weekend after their flight from Boston was
canceled, and Saturday's game had to be pushed back a day. BC flew
late Saturday night instead and arrived at Fitzgerald Field House
Sunday to face the Panthers (14-10, 5-8) before 441.
</P>
<P>
   BC marched out to a 10-4 lead, highlighted by three straight
field goals by Jamie Cournoyer (15 points). But then the Eagles
went cold as Pittsburgh went on a 6-0 run sparked by a 3-pointer by
freshman guard Brooke Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   A jumper by Bouchard gave the Eagles the lead at 12-10, but
Pittsburgh responded a minute later with a basket by freshman Mandy
Wittenmyer to tie the game. A rebound basket by Spears followed by
a Bouchard 3-pointer gave the Eagles their biggest lead of the half
at 17-12. But the Panthers clawed back and pulled ahead, 25-23,
with 2:37 to go in the half.
</P>
<P>
   A Celeste Barkley free throw opened up a 3-point lead for
Pittsburgh, but BC answered with a Kim Mackie free throw, a jumper
by Bouchard, and a layup by Spears to close the half in front,
28-26.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Cathy Inglese said she wasn't really surprised by the
first-half struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just weren't focused at first; it took us a while
to settle down,'' she said. ``We had to come out and play with more
emotion, more intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   So she switched from a man-to-man defense to a zone, which
seemed to befuddle the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles started to pull away after a 3-pointer by Bouchard
made it 35-28. Pittsburgh came back to within 1, but BC followed
with a 10-0 run to widen the lead to 45-34 with 12:07 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Pittsburgh came the rest of the way was 8 as the
Panthers shot just 38 percent from the floor and hit just one free
throw after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half we looked staggered,'' said Pittsburgh coach
Traci Waites. ``They found our weakness and exploited it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Monique Toney, who hit three 3-pointers, was the Panthers'
high scorer with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Spears just shrugged when asked if playing more than half the
game felt different than logging minutes in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I know what I'm supposed to do,'' she said. ``Get the
offensive boards, bang around, box them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bouchard: ``We have different people who can step up on
different nights, and this was definitely her night.''

KIWIS' WIN: FIRST IN A SERIES? 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ In the calm after the storm, two stories
were told on this dozing waterfront. Two stories of the same race.
</P>
<P>
   The postrace cacophony created by thousands of boat horns and
fans at Viaduct Basin Saturday night sounded as if the coronation
of the 30th Cup winner was at hand, though it was just one race in
the best-of-nine series.
</P>
<P>
   And with a lay day Sunday, all there was for race fans to chew
on was the opener, and the different versions of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   According to the skipper of Prada, Francesco de Angelis, the
first race showed only that New Zealand won the first race,
although that was the minority view.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand beat Prada by 1 minute 17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As de Angelis and his tactician, Torben Grael, told it, Saturday
was clearly a ``no passing lane day.'' Actually, there was one
passing lane on the first leg. But as the big black bow of the
Kiwis came at them at 9.5 knots on starboard tack, the Italians
decided not to cross the Kiwis to take the favored right side of
the course. They probably could and should have.
</P>
<P>
   It happened during a tacking duel that began about 20 minutes
into the race. Prada was riding on the left side of the New Zealand
boat, and as the two tacked to cross once, then twice, Luna Rossa
seemed to have enough space to cross New Zealand's bow, something
it would have done, perhaps, against any other opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Grael, ``The second cross was the best one for us, but
still it would have been very scary to cross them, especially
against those very experienced guys. It was early in the race and
we shouldn't risk a cross like that. We tacked to leeward and we
lost after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The match-racing textbook backs Grael's call not to cross. Early
in a big money race, the risk of fouling out was just too great.
Only in retrospect did it become clear that that was the only
moment the Italians could have taken control of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The textbook also says the lead boat in a race between equals
should be able to extend its lead because of its ability to control
tactics and pick shifts.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand did extend its lead in every leg but one, Leg 4, the
second run. It was there that Prada sailed a lower, faster line to
take 38 seconds out of the Kiwi lead, narrowing the margin to 25
seconds at the mark _ the only leg New Zealand has lost in all 36
it has sailed in America's Cup match races since May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand side of the story comes down to this simple
belief: The Kiwis' innovative International America's Cup Class
yacht, much different from the challenger norm, is more than fast
enough to beat Prada, 5-0. A few would give the Italians one or two
wins because of days of fluky shifts.
</P>
<P>
   No one innovation has been credited for the ``leap ahead'' that
Kiwi designer Laurie Davidson predicted weeks ago. Was it the
knuckle bow that, despite its ugliness, gives the Kiwis more
waterline?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the ``millennium rig,'' a bendy mast supported by just
three, rather than five, sets of spreaders for less drag? Or the
upwind detachment of the top-mast backstay, again making for less
drag?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new super lightweight form-fitting sailing suits
make the Kiwis sleeker, or maybe their electronic communication
system, allowing skipper Russell Coutts to talk into the ear of his
foredeck crew a noisy 75 feet away, helps clarify the moves on
Black Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any or all of that makes the Kiwis the 5-0 Cup killers
their backers now proclaim them to be remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that this remote South Pacific nation of 3 1/2
million has sea water in its veins. In splendid isolation, New
Zealand has matched and perhaps trumped the best the rest of the
world has to offer from design offices in wealthy capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Winning) was not easy,'' said Kiwi mainsheet trimmer Warwick
Fleury, who became a team spokesman when Coutts and tactician Brad
Butterworth decided to avoid the postrace news conference. ``Races
like that in those conditions come down to whoever gets a jump.
Once a boat gets ahead, it is able to extend, especially upwind. If
Prada had been able to squeak across (in Leg 1) then it may have
been a different result.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the only part of the Kiwi line the sailors of the
red-striped bullet Luna Rossa were happy to hear. During the
anxious wait Sunday until Monday's second race, it was about the
only hope they had.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Rudy Tomjanovich searched for words and answers. He could not find
them. His eyes seemed to search the room, the hallways. He waited
silently, patiently forming words carefully but unhappily.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, with the Rockets' 113-111 overtime defeat to the Spurs
on Sunday still painfully churning in his stomach, he forced out a
few sentences like bitter spit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a lot of effort put into the game,'' he said before
pausing to collect himself again, ``and I just didn't feel we got a
fair break. That's about all I've got to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about what he considered unfair, Tomjanovich said again,
``That's all I have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich never specifically mentioned the officials or even
individual plays that had him and most of the 16,285 in Compaq
Center in an uproar. It was all he could do to speak of Hakeem
Olajuwon's ``phenomenal'' return to the starting lineup, Kenny
Thomas' brilliant defensive effort on Tim Duncan, or Steve Francis'
51-minute marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're trying to make me feel better ,'' he said of what
got the Rockets into overtime, unable to finish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had come back from their Friday-night whipping in
San Antonio to give the defending world champions all they could
handle. But they could hardly say a word about what they had done
right or what finally went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the last game, the comment I gave was that this game was
going to be different; it was going to be a war,'' Spurs coach
Gregg Popovich said. ``I was right. The Rockets were great, the
fans were great, and we were thrilled to come away with a
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets scored more points against the Spurs than anyone had
all season. They held Duncan in check most of the night, and after
he got rolling to his NBA Finals standards, they shut him down
again. Olajuwon had his best performance since November, scoring 21
points, grabbing nine rebounds and blocking four shots. The Rockets
led by eight in the fourth quarter. They led by a field goal with
90 seconds left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   They did virtually everything they would have included on a
pre-game checklist and still were beaten. And like so many victims
of the Spurs' find-a-way way, they were lost when trying to
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game we should win,'' Olajuwon said. ``There's not
an excuse for losing this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets took a 107-105 overtime lead when Francis split
Duncan and David Robinson on a drive with 3:13 left. But with the
game on the line, the Spurs typically applied the defensive clamps.
It took the Rockets three minutes to score again.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets hit the overtime wall, Avery Johnson tied the
score with a jumper with 1:17 left. Duncan made a pair of free
throws with 35.5 seconds left for a 109-107 San Antonio lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets set up Francis to create on a drive, and he said he
saw an uncovered Kenny Thomas. But Duncan slapped away Francis'
pass on the baseline. Terry Porter picked up the loose ball, and
his two free throws gave the Spurs a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody was open,'' Francis said. ``I just couldn't hit him.
He was wide-open, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon scored on a spin to the basket with 12.6 seconds left.
But by then the Rockets had to foul, and Mario Elie made a pair of
free throws with 10.9 seconds left to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had reason to believe they should have taken the
victory much earlier. The Spurs led by 10 in the first quarter and
by five with three minutes left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets led by 13 in the second half and by eight in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Rockets took their eight-point fourth quarter lead,
the Spurs put the ball and game in Duncan's hands and let him carry
them. He scored the next seven points and set up four more. After
scoring just eight points through three quarters, he led the Spurs
with 25.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final three minutes of regulation, Thomas threw
himself at that speeding train and stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had given the Spurs a 103-98 lead with a spin move. But
Thomas then harassed him into a turnover. He immediately drew a
foul on Duncan inside, and with a contact lens missing, he made one
free throw to cut the deficit to 103-101.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was fouled but missed both free throws. The Spurs
grabbed the rebound and went back to Duncan as a matter of course,
but Thomas stopped him again. Thomas so completely cut off every
Duncan option that the All-Star Game's co-Most Valuable Player held
the ball too long in the lane and was called for three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets isolated Cuttino Mobley on the right side, and he
quickly beat Porter off the dribble to nail a 14-footer and tie the
game with 6.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was more than enough time for the Spurs to get
the ball to Duncan. He made his move and went up from 14 feet, but
this time Olajuwon rushed over to help and swatted the shot safely
away with 2.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets set up a final play to shoot for the win, but the
Spurs cut off every option the Rockets had planned, forcing the
inbounds pass to Olajuwon. His hurried 18-footer missed, sending
the game to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the moment the Rockets bemoaned most. It barely
made the list. And as they searched for answers, about the best
they found was Tomjanovich's lament, ``You can always make one more
play.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have done it. But that fact did not make it any
easier to take.

HE FINALLY HAS THAT WINNING FEELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The whisper of a wintry wind over nervous silence.
A four-foot putt rattling into a cup. The sudden shrill roar of a
smallish Sunday gallery. A fist thrust as high in the gray sky as a
limber man of 6-foot-3 can reach.
</P>
<P>
   And then an unusually joyous congratulatory handshake from a
beaten opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett had always tried to imagine the sights, sounds and
feelings he experienced late on the final afternoon of the Nissan
Open at Riviera Country Club. He had tried for so long to imagine
the moment when he'd finally win a PGA tournament that he had begun
to believe it might never arrive.
</P>
<P>
   And now here it was.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Cathi, had always kidded him about not having a fist
pump like Tiger Woods', and now here he was with his right arm in
the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger says he doesn't plan his fist pumps, they just kind of
happen, and now I know what he means,'' Triplett said a few minutes
later. ``You've got a lot of emotion built up, and at the end it's
got to come out. I just hoped it would come out the right way. I
hoped I wouldn't faint.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Triplett, a genial Washington state native with
graying sandy hair and kind blue eyes, had merely been a happy and,
by most measures, successful member of the PGA Tour. He had earned
$4,270,878 in 10 seasons, a record for a player who had never
actually won a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   With that money, he had provided for his family of four, and he
had paid his dues plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent three years in the 1980s playing in Asia, Australia
and Canada. He had put in his time on ``the miniest mini-tours,''
testing himself in events named the Hagen Oaks Pro Scratch and the
Winnemucca Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm halfway around the world playing for $18,000 for first
(place). Getting sick, riding on the buses two hours each way to
the golf course,'' he said of the Asian tour, which left him with
stories so good, he can't tell them in polite company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid you in cash _ `whip-out,' right after the end. You
like driving the back roads with $17,000 in American hundred-dollar
bills in your back pocket? In a taxi? And the (driver) doesn't
speak a word of English? `Take me to the Black Angus.' `Yeah,
right.' Two hours later, where is it?''
</P>
<P>
   The rain in which most of Sunday's round was played was growing
stronger as Triplett spoke, beating on the roof of the Riviera
press room like a snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Taiwan it rained 13 out of 14 days, and we played every
day,'' he said. ``This is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering where his career began made what happened Sunday
``so sweet for me,'' Triplett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played at every level. Except the buy.com Tour (formerly the
Nike Tour). They didn't have that when I started, that's how old I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   At 37, Triplett is a veteran of 266 PGA Tour events. Saturday,
after finishing the third round tied for second, a stroke behind
David Sutherland, he remarked that after that many failures, it was
hard to imagine (begin ital)this(end ital) might be the week.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, people would ask, ``How many years you
been out here?'' They didn't have to add, ``without winning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say four, five ... six ... seven ...,'' Triplett said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, it dawned on him that this 0-fer was
dragging on. The realization came when he made a tournament cut for
the 150th time, earning the qualifying exemption known officially
as ``Veteran Member.''
</P>
<P>
   A second-place finisher five times in his decade of play, he
couldn't remember going to the final nine holes in the lead before
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But on a day when seven men held or shared the lead at some
point, and when the Woods threat came uncoiled early, Triplett
opened a three-shot lead when he birdied the par-4 ninth hole. By
the time he ambled to the final holes, he was two ahead of Jesper
Parnevik and wondering how he would respond to the pressure.
Triplett hadn't won even a non-PGA Tour event since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would get rocky coming in, knew I'd be fighting it,
and I was,'' he said of the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik was watching him and found him ``very calm, very
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his familiar floppy white hat, Triplett wore a soft,
closed- mouthed smile. He looked at the crowd, savored the
long-awaited moment.
</P>
<P>
   He even managed a smile when Parnevik holed a 22-foot birdie
putt at 18, forcing Triplett to sink his downhill 4-footer to win
without a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, knowing Triplett's story, knowing him as ``a very
humble guy (who) never ticks anybody off,'' found himself kind of
rooting for his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Triplett is the kind of guy who already considered
himself a success, win or no win, because of his family. The kind
of guy who said: ``I can't wait to get home (to Scottsdale, Ariz.)
and see them. But I would have felt that way if I'd shot an 82.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he also admitted, ``It's not as good a career if you
don't win a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The green fell silent. Triplett smacked the putt straight into
the back of the hole. The gallery, shrunk by the exodus that
followed Tiger's round, saluted with shouts and applause. Triplett
threw that hand in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik shook it happily.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody handed Triplett a check for ... how much was it? he
asked later.
</P>
<P>
   So that's what winning is like. He'll have to do it more often. &QL;

A FAMILY, SCHOOL ARE REUNITED

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bringing closure to the Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble
family feud could have been more important than having each of the
basketball players' numbers retired Saturday night at Loyola
Marymount University.
</P>
<P>
   We remember the two as close, if not closer, than brothers. Then
it was abruptly ripped apart with subsequent lawsuits against the
university and resentment toward the attention Kimble received.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost as tragic as Gathers' death itself.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' family alienated many at LMU, a community that would
have supported them without any legal pressure. Thankfully, those
people understood how the Gathers' sudden loss turned their world
upside down and, when it was time to honor Hank and Bo, they didn't
keep any grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' family appreciated that Saturday night when reunited
with the LMU family for the first time in a decade. And Gathers'
mother, Lucille Cheeseboro, even said during the ceremony that
she'll be back to visit LMU, which she said she considers ``her
second home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look back on that now, we see a lot of regrets and a
lot of people's feelings that we may have hurt,'' said Hank's
brother, Derrick afterward. ``We can put all that behind us,
finally, and say, `Thank you, Loyola for accepting my brother and
the Gathers family as family.'''

LITTLE DRAMA FOR TIGER FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the charge that never came, the great rally
that wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful still followed, no matter the elements, waiting for
the dramatic finish they were certain awaited.
</P>
<P>
   Only Tiger Woods never did make a move. Never did get close
enough at the Riviera Country Club on Sunday to make the leaders
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his past eight tournaments, Woods never
developed as a real factor. Instead of a charge, there was only a
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had conditioned his faithful to expect drama, to
anticipate a final surge towards the top of the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   But the only movement was so uncharacteristic it was almost
unrecognizable. He started the day six under, three strokes back of
leader David Sutherland. He birdied No.3, and his afternoon had
peaked.
</P>
<P>
   He bogied seven, eight and nine, and was out.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who had won six consecutive tournaments before
finishing second last week, had tumbled out of contention at the
Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad round,'' Woods said. ``I didn't really have
it going this entire week. If I had putted a little bit better, I'd
have been right there for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't have everything, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, there you have it. Not even Mr. Nike can have everything.
On a sometimes windy, rainy and cold afternoon, Woods made like a
mortal.
</P>
<P>
   He began the day with promise. Despite not playing at his best
in the first three rounds, no one was running away with the
tournament and Woods lurked nervously near.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit frustrating, but given the way I played
this week, I really should not have been where I was today,'' Woods
said. ``I should have been a little worse. I still hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods played in a snappy red Nike vest, over a black Nike polo
shirt and wore a black Nike cap. When the rains fell, he donned a
black Nike nylon jacket that matched his black Nike nylon pants.
Fighting a little cold, he frequently went to a hankie, where
surprisingly, no small swoosh mark was identified. Opportunities
still await.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped a 12-foot putt for the birdie on No.3, to fall seven
shots under. Putting had been a tricky problem for Woods on the
thick poa annua greens throughout the tournament. Putts kept
ringing around the cup and spinning out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those weeks where I hit so many good putts that
lipped out,'' Woods said.``A perfect example is the last hole. A
perfect putt that looks dead center from 2 feet out, all of a
sudden it dies and lips out.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' tournament hopes started to die on the seventh. He hit a
poor drive, that left him in the rough and needing to send his
second shot over a pair of trees. It landed in the rough 20 feet to
the right of the green. His wedge shot flew past the cup and onto
the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Woods slammed his club to the turf, his only display of emotion
on the day.
</P>
<P>
   After bogeying seven, he did the same on eight when he missed a
simple 2-foot putt. On No. 9, he went over the green, chipped 12
feet past the cup and left with his third consecutive bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kirk Triplett birdied four of his first nine holes
and was taking control.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was falling from condition for the first time since last
August when he tied for 37th at the Sprint International.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't manage another birdie until the 13th hole, where he
had double-bogeyed the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another good putt,'' he said. ``I'll be honest with
you, it hits a huge piece of poa 10 feet out it hopped straight
left. I thought I would miss it left, and then it hops back to the
right and now I think I'm going to miss it on the right edge, then
about 6 inches it dives har d left and back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potluck out there on those greens right now. They're
really bumpy. There's so much moisture in the greens, the poa is
just growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods knew he was disappearing, and several times gambled and
used his driver when others were playing safe with irons, but it
never paid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Woods finished one over, seven shots back of Triplett. For a
change, the day ended without the Woods charge.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ It was great to be Mitch Meluskey last spring.
Catcher Brad Ausmus had been traded by the Astros to Detroit to
create a roster spot for Meluskey, who spent most of the spring
answering questions about how it felt to be considered a Rookie of
the Year candidate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expectations were high, and pressure was great, but nothing ever
materialized, thanks to a shoulder injury that limited Meluskey's
rookie season to 10 games. There is nothing fun or easy about
starting over, which he no doubt will find out over the next
several weeks of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey is no longer a lock to make the team. In fact, he
entered spring training as the No. 3 catcher _ in the mind of
manager Larry Dierker _ on a team that likely will carry only two
players at that position.
</P>
<P>
   Having signed a two-year, $2.4 million contract and with seven
years of big-league experience, Tony Eusebio is a lock for one of
the positions. Paul Bako, who was recalled from Class AAA New
Orleans and hit .256 after Meluskey's injury, is out of options,
meaning he would have to clear waivers _ an unlikely possibility _
before the Astros could send him to the minors. Thus, Bako has an
inside track to the other spot.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave Meluskey? Fighting an uphill battle and
needing to do some serious eye-opening to make the opening-day
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it looks like Eusebio and Bako, because Mitch has
options,'' Dierker said. ``But Mitch can't be ignored. He's in a
position to force his way onto the team. Mitch understands the
situation, and I think he's more relaxed this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the pressure is off this spring. Last year, he was
the subject of a great deal of attention. He had a lot of people
from the media interviewing him, and that was the first time he had
ever faced anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spring it seems like the pressure is off because he's not
the fair-haired boy, the Rookie of the Year candidate or anything
like that. He's just another guy trying to win a job.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it appears the deck is somewhat stacked against
the 26-year-old Meluskey. However, he doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel at a disadvantage at all,'' said Meluskey, who
declared his shoulder a non-issue. ``I guess I'm still kind of one
of their guys. I don't know if my (value) went down because I got
hurt last year. I really am not too worried about it. There could
still be moves. If I just go out and play my game, everything will
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the possibility of opening the season at Class
AAA New Orleans, where Meluskey hasn't played since 1998?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very, very, very, unbelievably, terribly
disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bako knew the feeling last spring. He outhit Meluskey .333 to
.222 and doubled Meluskey's production in home runs and RBIs, yet
he still began the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I kind of felt like I was the odd guy out and that I
was really going to have to open some eyes to make the team,'' Bako
said. ``I thought I did that, but I was still the odd guy out. This
year I feel that, hopefully, I have a better crack at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Eusebio is the only catcher in the mix who is
totally secure. Throughout his career, Eusebio has outlasted
several catchers acquired to take his job.
</P>
<P>
   His patience was rewarded this offseason with the first
multiyear contract of his career. Despite a fragile set of knees,
Eusebio started 83 games behind the plate in 1999 and hit .272 with
33 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get a two-year contract for the last two
or three years,'' Eusebio said. ``I guess now was the time. I've
been with the organization a long time, and I've appreciated
everything they've done for me, but I feel like I was entitled to
that contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few teams interested in me _ the Yankees and St.
Louis _ but I've been with the Astros all of my life, and I wanted
to make a deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key questions regarding the Astros going into last
season was whether the team would suffer a defensive drop-off at
catcher after Ausmus was traded. Ausmus, nicknamed ``The Officer''
because of his penchant for controlling traffic on the basepaths,
is one of the top defensive catchers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be wasted worry. Astros catchers threw out 31
percent of the runners who attempted to steal against them,
fifth-best in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can produce more runs than we did last year, but as
far as throwing out runners and helping the pitchers out, I think
we did a pretty good job,'' Bako said. ``Our pitching was good _ if
not great _ all year, and I'd like to think (the catchers) had
something to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to keeping baserunners honest, the Astros' catchers
also contributed to the pitching staff's 3.83 earned run average,
which ranked third in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker no doubt would take a repeat of that kind of work from
his duo behind the plate. It's just a matter of which catchers will
form the tandem.

SHAQ STRUGGLES ON OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- Shaquille O'Neal put the finish on a victory
Sunday after having a decidedly rough start.
</P>
<P>
   His block of Allen Iverson's 3-pointer closed out the Lakers'
victory o ver the Philadelphia 76ers. But despite being an assist
short of a triple-double, O'Neal faltered on offense, missing 13 of
22 shots from the field. He even cooled at the foul line, hitting 4
of 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just funny kind of rims,'' O'Neal said. ``They were just
bouncing off the rims, so I was just trying to draw and kick and
get everybody else involved.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, with a career-high-tying nine assists. And with power
forwards Robert Horry and A.C. Green combining for just four
rebounds (all by Green), O'Neal held the Lakers in the game with 16
boards.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's only career triple-double came in Orlando, and with
blocks, not assists. He might have done it Sunday if not for
several missed shots by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that really matters,'' he said. ``I'm just glad that
we were able to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not worried about the shooting trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have two bad games in a row, so I'll be extra, extra
ready in New Jersey (on Tuesday). I'm just going to blame it on
`one of those days.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant suffered a sprained index finger on his
right (shooting) hand in Orlando on Friday and received treatment
both before (electric stimulation) and after (ice) Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bothering me,'' said Bryant, admitting it affected his
game `` a little bit. It wasn't at first until I got smacked on it.
... It'll be fine. Just use more of my legs on my shot, that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said his latest return to Philadelphia, where he played
high sch ool ball, wasn't as big a deal as previous trips here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so intent on shutting everybody up (before). A lot
calmer (now) ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With most of his family now in L.A., Bryant only needed eight
tickets for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice just to come back home and get a feel again for
Philly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back to routine: After giving a rare start to Derek Fisher on
Friday at Orlando, coach Phil Jackson went back to Ron Harper on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want us to be flexible enough to do that on occasion,
that we're not so rote, and so staid in our habits that we can't
make changes in our lineup and still play well,'' Jackson said.
``(It's important for) guys to be ready to play when they come off
the bench or go back to the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's lineup change was the Lakers' first since Dec. 12, when
Devean George started in place of an ill Glen Rice.

<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Upon entering the clubhouse at the Astros' spring
training home for the first time, Octavio Dotel got the good news
he had been assigned a locker stall right next door to an old
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that the friend is Jose Lima, and that means if
Dotel wants to get in a single word, he's almost got to make a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Jose,'' said Dotel. ``I've known him from playing
together for several years in the Dominican Republic. He's always
talking, always going, and that's all right with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been here in the Astros organization for a while, and I
will be listening to him to find out what I need to do to fit in
with this team and what I need to do to grow and become the kind of
pitcher that he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Call the class Lima 101, and if the 24-year-old Dotel, who came
with Roger Cedeno from New York in the Mike Hampton trade, is
willing to sit in the front row and learn the ropes from Professor
Merengue and the coaching staff, that will be fine with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   For in Dotel, the Astros' brass see similarities to Lima that
are more than just a common native land. Both have live arms. Both
have plenty of competitive fire. But what has enabled Lima to
advance over the past two seasons to a level where he could record
16 and 21 wins respectively is that he came to a greater
understanding of what it means to be a pitcher rather than just a
battler and a thrower.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it worked for Jose, then I can see that what they might
want me to do can work,'' said Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in his first major-league season, Dotel posted an 8-3
record in 19 starts for the Mets and was 7-1 after the All-Star
break. He possesses a 92-94-mph fastball that was rated the best in
the Class AAA International League in 1998, and his hard curveball
gives him two overpowering pitches. He showed flashes of
brilliance, striking out a batter per inning and holding opposing
hitters to a .226 average.
</P>
<P>
   But Dotel also walked 49 batters in 85 innings, gave up 12 home
runs and at times got himself into trouble by falling behind in the
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen of him, he's got a great off-speed
pitch,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker. ``But he does not have
great control, and yet he's still been able to win games. That
tells you he's a fighter. But to improve, to really be more than a
fighter, to be a dominant pitcher, you've got to learn some of the
basic philosophies. You've got to learn to pitch, not just
overpower or see every batter as a personal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Astros would be happy if Dotel could emulate
Lima and learn that getting a batter to hit a ground ball to
shortstop or second base by using just a couple of pitches is
better than fighting through eight or nine pitches to get a
strikeout. And they want him to work on developing a changeup.
</P>
<P>
   The learning process, according to pitching coach Vern Ruhle,
involves a great deal more than just constant preaching. It is
breaking down the elements to give a pitcher several focal points
every time he throws the ball, much like a golfer has a swing
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's a real interesting topic for a fan,'' Ruhle
said. ``But what I'm talking about is getting a guy to focus on the
mitt, to think about his stride, to be aware of the location of his
shoulder and his elbow on every pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea isn't to make them all identical. Guys have different
styles, from Lima to Shane Reynolds to Scott Elarton. What you're
trying to do is to get them to kind of be their own coach out there
on the mound, to be able to check what they're doing, to know if
what they're doing is the right thing, even if the result isn't
always positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, a guy can pitch a two- or three-hitter for eight
innings, make one bad pitch in the ninth to give up a homer, and he
gets a loss next to his name. You get down. The clubhouse is quiet.
But you have to be able to look back at the outing and say that
what you did was right and stay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't take it personally and go back out in your next start
trying to mow every batter down.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Lima a few years of Ruhle's influence to understand
the concept fully, and the hope is that he can now help pass the
message along to Dotel a little more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They traded Mike Hampton, the best pitcher they had, to get
me,'' Dotel said. ``That makes me feel good and tells me what they
think of me. I thought I had a good first year in New York. But if
they have a way to make me better, no problem. I'll listen.''
</P>
<P>
   To Dierker, to Ruhle, to Lima monologues from the next locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to have a teammate, a friend, be able to say,
`Hey, I went through this,''' said Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   For Professor Merengue, then, class is in session.

KINGS' SEESAW WON'T STOP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON -- Kings coach Andy Murray didn't have much of an
appetite a little after midnight Sunday morning as he sat picking
at a hamburger in the team's Buffalo hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In 24 hours the Kings had gone from the emotional peak of
beating the mighty Detroit Red Wings to a 4-1 loss against the
struggling Sabres. This was heartburn NHL style.
</P>
<P>
   On one restaurant TV was a replay of his game against the Sabres
that ended a five-game winning streak and made King Vladimir
Tsyplakov -- with one goal and two assists -- a hero in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Another TV was playing the late game between Calgary and
Edmonton, two teams seemingly headed in opposite directions in the
Western Conference but both critical to the Kings playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rule anything out,'' Murray warned after slumping
Calgary jumped out to a 2-0 lead. ``The only thing that you can
predict is the unpredictability.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton, which hosts the Kings tonight, had entered the weekend
series with Calgary leading the Northwest Division. The Flames were
winless in their previous 10 games. On a five-game trip, they lost
them all by one goal, including three in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton had a seven-point lead over Calgary in the Western
Conference and more importantly in the bitter battle between the
two small market clubs in the province of Alberta. The Oilers
seemed to be pulling away.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Calgary won the first game 4-2, but the Flames early
lead in Saturday's game evaporated with 35 seconds left in
regulation on a goal by Todd Marchant. The crowd in Edmonton went
wild, but even before the noise died down, Marc Savard scored a
minute into overtime and the Flames had swept.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary now is only three points behind Edmonton, which has been
bumped by Colorado in the Northwest and now hold the eighth and
final playoff spot in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (28-23-7) are sixth, one point ahead of San Jose. The
Sharks host the Kings on Saturday and there is not telling where
all this will be by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shame that it turned out the way it did for us,''
Oilers forward Bill Guerin said after the second game. ``These are
going to be tough points to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the same about his team's performance Saturday night
Buffalo. The Sabres had scored most than two goals just once in its
previous 13 games. But after the Kings took a 1-0 lead in the first
period on Ziggy Palffy's 23rd goal, the Sabres former MVP
goaltender Dominik Hasek shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think they were going to score a lot of goals
against us,'' Luc Robitaille said. ``But we know anytime you go up
against Hasek, it's going to be a tough night.''
</P>
<P>
   No one had a tougher than Robitaille, who had chance to give the
Kings the lead early in the second, but his backhander hit the
post. A second chance in front of Hasek also failed later in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever seen Luc miss those shots,'' Murray
said. ``In this league, you just never know.''

WEST NEXT ON PRIMARY JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once the presidential circus wraps things up in
Michigan, attention will turn west and north over the next two
weeks for the March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries, with California
the biggest prize of all.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York _ along with 13 other states and
territories _ hold primaries and caucuses March 7 that will almost
certainly determine the major parties' presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``California could become the make-or-break state,'' said Kam
Kuwata, who is managing the campaign of Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., and is not involved in any of the presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley, have had the luxury since the New Hampshire
primary of being able to crisscross the nation without worrying
about any other elections leading up to Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading Republican candidates _ Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain _ have both been helped and hurt
by the glare of public scrutiny as they have battled fiercely in
South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with those efforts, all four have begun the
traditional California campaign, with the start of television
commercials that are expected to cost $1.5 million a week at their
peak.
</P>
<P>
   Recent independent polls show Gore and Bush with large leads in
the state, but McCain has been moving up, particularly among
independents and crossover Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   All the campaigns are planning to have their candidates in the
state during the coming two weeks, although specific details are up
in the air as each adjusts to his needs in shoring up efforts
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Bush campaign has only a firm commitment from
the candidate to be in Los Angeles on Wednesday, with discussions
of other events in the first week of March.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has declined an invitation to debate McCain on March 2 in
Los Angeles, but is looking at other offers, spokeswoman Margita
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had seven different invitations and there will be a
California debate,'' Thompson said. ``We think we continue to have
strength in California and it will carry through to March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the effort is expected to be targeted to Republican
areas of the state, such as Orange County and the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley also are expected to vary their campaigns with
trips across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recently completed a four-day campaign swing in
California, while Gore was in the state three days.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to return toward the end of the month,
wrapping appearances around their March 1 debate in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing the California election this year is that voters can
cast a ballot for any candidate, regardless of political party.
However, only the votes of registered party members will be counted
to determine the delegates that will go to the national conventions
this summer to select the parties' nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of confusion is that the GOP has a
winner-take-all system, while Democratic delegates are assigned
proportionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think California will be watched as the bellwether of the
election,'' Kuwata said. ``While there will be a lot of attention
paid to the overall results, it will be Republicans electing a
Republican and Democrats electing a Democrat.''

STARS TAP WINNING FORMULA, BEAT AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Colorado Avalanche saw its crowd turn against the
team midway through Sunday's game. Boos cascading down from
everywhere, the Avs' five shots probably a big reason why.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we like to hear,'' Dallas Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of the Stars' theme song, to go along with their
philosophy of score early (which winger Scott Thornton did), don't
allow anything but dump-and-chase after (which they mostly didn't)
and get big saves from goalie Ed Belfour when needed (which they
did).
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and win a game that many will criticize as boring,
which the Stars also did, 2-1 against Colorado on Sunday at the
Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very entertaining, I'm sure for the fans,'' Stars
center Mike Modano said. ``It's not very exciting for people
watching on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily the way they want to play or would play if
they were healthy. But it's the way they've had to play because
they aren't. The story is the same as Game 4, Game 34 and Game 57,
just change the names on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Stars played without Jamie Langenbrunner (neck), Joe
Nieuwendyk (shoulder), Jere Lehtinen (ankle), Brian Skrudland
(chest) and Shawn Chambers (knee), but the team still sits atop the
Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what is really good for us is we've kept pace with the
rest of the NHL,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We've done it
mostly with `D.' ... We've struggled offensively all year, but
we've been great defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   They were again Sunday. They allowed the Avalanche four shots in
the first period, six in the second. And in the third period, when
Colorado unleashed a 14-shot barrage, Belfour turned them away. He
would've had his fourth shutout had it not been for Avs winger Alex
Tanguay's power-play goal with 10.7 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing worse is one second or a half,'' Belfour said.
``They got a whack at it in front and then another whack, and it
went in.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get the shutout. He did get the redemption for what he
considered a bad performance in Friday's 4-3 loss to Phoenix. That,
coupled with a chance to prevent Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy from
moving to second on the all-time regular-season win list, provided
Belfour with plenty of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy didn't dress because of a groin injury, and aside from a
couple of minutes, Belfour was never really challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas Stars hockey at its best,'' Matvichuk said.
</P>
<P>
   The goals were provided by Thornton, his first since being
traded to the Stars on Jan. 22, and Modano, his 10th goal in the
past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to finally get that first one out of the way,''
said Thornton, who attributes his increased scoring chances to
playing on a line with Brett Hull. ``He's been feeding me in the
last two games. I've got a lot of opportunities. I knew one was
going to go in sooner or later. That's what I kept telling him.
Odds are I'll score one of these days so keep passing it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's goal, which came at 10:50 of the first period, was
important because it let the Stars settle into their defensive
style. Modano's goal, which came at 11:44 of the third period, was
significant because it kept one of their most consistent offensive
threats hot, which is important because they can't seem to score
more than two goals a game. And while Modano admits the
zero-to-no-risk style might not be very exciting for the TV
audience, not to mention Sunday's Avalanche crowd, he certainly
isn't apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado defenseman Aaron Miller said there where ``times
where the fans were falling asleep,'' it's exactly what the Stars
want to hear. nn

LANGENBRUNNER SEES CAUSE FOR ALARM (CLOCK)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ From now until the end of the season, Dallas Stars
winger Jamie Langenbrunner will use the alarm clock test to see if
he's OK to play.
</P>
<P>
   If he wakes up and the herniated disc in his neck feels good
enough for him to play, he will. If it doesn't, he won't. Sunday,
he didn't. He missed his second consecutive game, but a myelogram
taken last week revealed that the disc is getting better and the
injury is an irritated nerve root.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the frustrating part,'' Langenbrunner said, ``because
you have to give it time, and time is not necessarily something we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   He missed 11 games in January and February with a disc injury,
but Stars trainer Dave Surprenant said the test showed that had
healed. Langenbrunner said he isn't considering surgery, which had
been mentioned as an option, but will probably have to put up with
the day-to-day status for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he expects Langenbrunner to play
Monday against Nashville. JUST IN CASE
</P>
<P>
   The Stars decided to dress seven defensemen and 11 forwards
Sunday, instead of the usual six and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars weren't sure if captain Derian Hatcher, who was
playing in his second game after missing nine weeks with a
lacerated calf, would be able to play the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't afford for Derian to hit the wall and have us go
down to five guys against this group,'' Hitchcock said. ``In
talking with Derian, this is a tough time for him. The first game
he played on emotion. He's still a step-and-half or two steps
behind where he wants to be, and we felt we had to protect
ourselves.'' Hatcher played 20 minutes Sunday, third among the
Stars' defensemen. EXTRA, EXTRA
</P>
<P>
   Maybe nobody felt the bite of the decision to play a forward
short more than center Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   He was the forward getting double shifted.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up playing 25:14, more than any other Stars player and
only four seconds less than Colorado's Sandis Ozolinsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough place to do that with this altitude,'' Modano
said. ``You have to be smart about it. ... Sometimes, if I got out
there a little too long, I'd be sucking wind hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't effect him too much, though, as he scored a goal in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we had a day off (Saturday),'' Ken Hitchcock joked.
DEFENDING THE CUP
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't had the best luck with travel this season.
</P>
<P>
   They've been flying by the seat of their pants to get planes
ever since the company they charter their flights with went
bankrupt earlier in the season. They're plane from Dallas to Denver
was late Saturday. They're plane from Denver to Nashville was late
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be like in (the movie) ``Major League,'' when they get
that bad plane with propellers,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor
joked.
</P>
<P>
   Or the other end of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   When their charter plane got stuck in the Northeast because of
weather Saturday, the charter company sent presidential hopeful
George W. Bush's plane to take the team to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Stars notice a difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's late like the rest of them,'' Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said. nn

ROOKS, RODMAN PACE MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>

By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It took three chances for Dennis Rodman to get a
victory with the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman grabbed 16 rebounds and Sean Rooks made some big-time
plays as the Mavericks knocked off Vince Carter and the Toronto
Raptors, 100-96, before a sellout crowd of 19,800 Sunday at Air
Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mavericks' first victory in three tries with Rodman
in the lineup. Rodman, who was returning from a one-game
suspension, fouled out with 22 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good win,'' Rodman said. ``I played very good,
didn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   Rooks, a little-used reserve center, took advantage of Rodman's
foul troubles and the absence of Shawn Bradley to play a key role
in the Mavericks gaining their sixth victory in their last seven
road games.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley missed the game with blurred vision _ he may play Monday
at Indiana _ but Rooks saw to it that the Mavericks didn't skip a
beat. Rooks scored 10 points, snatched three rebounds and blocked
four shots in 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks had six points, three blocks and two rebounds in the
fourth quarter. Coach Don Nelson presented Rooks the game ball.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the fourth period, Rooks completed a three-point play
and scored another basket inside to keep the Mavericks in the game.
Then when Rodman fouled out, Rooks was put back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Antonio Davis missed two free throws that would have
tied the game, and Rooks rebounded the second miss. Rooks made one
of two free throws for a 99-96 lead, then came up with the game's
defensive gem when he batted away a Tracy McGrady pass intended for
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley picked up the loose ball and scored the game's
final point seconds later on a free throw. And, just for good
measure, Rooks swatted away a Muggsy Bogues drive in the waning
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just good to be out on the floor,'' said Rooks, who
didn't play in the previous three games. ``I'm always watching the
games, so it's just good that someone had a little bit of
confidence in me today.''
</P>
<P>
   The confidence of the Mavericks continues to soar as they chase
Minnesota for the eighth playoff spot in the Western Conference.
The Timberwolves lost Sunday to New Jersey, 91-89, so the Mavericks
are six games behind Minnesota. The Denver Nuggets are one game
ahead of the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unexpected win here,'' Nelson said. ``We were
worried about this game. The blending of our team is starting to
come together. Both Rooks and Dennis Rodman stepped it up
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos scored eight of his 23 points in the second
period to help the Mavericks erase a 10-point deficit. Finley
shared game-high scoring honors with Ceballos with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fired up every day,'' Finley said. ``Whether it's Vince
Carter or Jack Haley, I'm going to go in there and give 110
percent. He's a good player and he's been playing great ball all
year. We just didn't want to get him going, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Erick Strickland and Finley closely guarded Carter, who scored
24 points and had five rebounds and seven assists before fouling
out with 35.1 seconds left and the Mavericks ahead, 96-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I did anything significant, except try to make
him take tough shots,'' said Strickland, who finished with 18
points. ``He made some shots, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the crucial part of the game I made him take some tough
shots and we got some breaks and some rebounds and that helped us
to pull ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pulling away resulted from the unexpected play of
Rooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what this proves?'' Rooks said. ``Shawn is out right
now, so I'm just going to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on. I just try to go out there and
help our guys out, and I'm very happy that things turned out the
way they turned out. They could have turned out a lot worst for
me.'' nn

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: What Bush Lost in South Carolina
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush's big win in South Carolina revived his candidacy
but at the cost of the inclusive campaign that had been the high
promise of his early run for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   One of the appeals of the Bush candidacy to defeat-fatigued
Republicans and to the general electorate alike had been the
governor's proven ability in Texas to draw Hispanic and even some
African-American voters to a party estranged from both.
</P>
<P>
   But to pull South Carolina out, Bush, like a troubled machine
defaulting to its zero setting, lapsed to the race hustle GOP
presidential nominees have frequently resorted to since Richard
Nixon's so-called ``southern strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reintroduced himself to South Carolina, post New Hampshire,
with a much-ballyhooed speech at Bob Jones University, a racist
school that into the bargain also harbors sometimes a virulent
anti-Catholicism. Atop his waffling on the state's Confederate
battle flag issue, the meaning was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was following in what has become a disturbing tradition
among Republican presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon co-opted Alabama Gov. George Wallace's white-backlash
politics by, among other mimicking positions, opposing the busing
that was the only means for desegregation in many school districts.
Nixon skipped Wallace's overt racial demagoguery, but the message
got through.
</P>
<P>
   To kick off his successful presidential candidacy, Ronald
Reagan, who had opposed every civil rights law in its time, went to
a Mississippi county infamous for Klan activity, where three civil
rights workers had been murdered, and declared for states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush was elected president behind the TV-ad specter of
recidivist convict Willie Horton, an implied charge that hapless
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis would turn violent black men
loose on nice white people.
</P>
<P>
   The only failed GOP presidential campaigns since Nixon have been
ones that didn't work the race angle _ Gerald Ford's, Bush's second
and Bob Dole's.
</P>
<P>
   (At least George W. shunned invitations to denounce immigration
and, for the record, John McCain wasn't exactly clean. He took a
dive on the flag issue, too, and one of his top advisers edits a
magazine, Southern Partisan, that trades in Old South stereotypes,
Confederacy nostalgia and faux scholarship of the sort that argues
slavery was mainly a happy bond between benign masters and
grateful, uh, workers.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this connects to dubious performances in recent
Republican Congresses. The GOP Senate has rejected black and
Hispanic judicial nominees at twice the rate of whites. And the
House leadership recently passed over a bipartisan task force's
preferred candidate for chaplain, a Catholic priest_ he would have
been the first _ for still another Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Bush at first seemed to understand that national leadership
these days requires a broader embrace. He will have a difficult
time after South Carolina seeming anything better than merely
unctuous in such claims.

HEADY TIMES FOR BUYERS AND SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is that time of year again.
</P>
<P>
   We flock to showrooms and honor (in New England, at least) dead
presidents by kicking tires (though these days be careful because,
with low-profile tires all the rage, there's not much rubber
between rim and ground), checking out seats, sound systems, and
dashboards, slamming doors to see if they are solid, and generally
dreaming summer dreams in the dead of winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time of sales in the auto industry _ sales being taken
two ways, one being actions the auto dealers hope to make, the
other being perceived deals on this year's crop of cars, SUVs,
pickup trucks, and myriad amalgams of all three that have become
the rage.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times to be a seller of cars. They are selling
in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also heady times to be buyers of cars. That is
because today's vehicles are more exciting, more dependable, safer
(when driven properly), and more imaginatively designed than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Very good autos can be purchased for $12,000 (not a lot of money
in today's auto market); superb sedans can be found for $18,000 to
$25,000; mid-luxury cars that are finer than any true luxury car
built 10 years ago can be found in the mid-30s to mid-40s; and the
high-end luxury cars, $50,000 to upwards of $80,000 come with a
sportiness aimed at appealing to young, suddenly wealthy drivers
even as they continue to appeal to the older driver who has longed,
and saved, for years for such a car.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks are cars are SUVs. Convertibles are making a big
comeback, mostly as sports cars. Power is a seller, but so too will
be ``green'' cars such as the hybrids offered by Honda and Toyota,
autos that combine electric and gasoline motors and drive like your
everyday auto. Their big selling point? They recharge their own
batteries while rolling, so there is no need to plug them in when
batteries run low.
</P>
<P>
   Because manufacturers have learned to ``share'' platforms within
their model lines, they save money that allows them to offer
wonderful, relatively limited creations that might never see the
light of day if they had to be developed from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Chrysler can bring out its PT Cruiser, part
panel-truck, part gangster car. It's why Ford can offer a four-door
pickup truck on the platform of its F150 pickup. The possibilities
seem endless. So what to do?
</P>
<P>
   Here, in several categories, are the cars I've already driven,
or am particularly looking forward to driving, in the year ahead.
When you shop, ask yourself a few questions: What will I use this
car for most of the time? Is there some exciting and esoteric use
that I am paying thousands extra to obtain but which I'll seldom
utilize? And, particularly in the low- and mid-luxury ranges, is
one car is really $5,000 or $10,000 better than another. Many are
not. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trucks &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --If you are a truck fan _ a big truck fan _ drive a Toyota
Tundra. You will be amazed at its smooth ride, its powerful and
amazingly quiet engine. It comes with four doors and seating for
five. It's got a decent size bed. It's got Toyota longevity and
reliability written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   --Chevrolet Silverado. It, too, has a four-door model available
and seats six comfortably. It comes with four engine options _ from
a 200-horsepower V6 to 300-h.p. V8 _ and an Autotrac system that
sends power to the front wheels (on four-wheel drive models) when
extra grab is needed up there.
</P>
<P>
   --Dodge Dakota. Smaller sibling to the Ram, but available with
four doors, seating for six (there's a pattern developing in pickup
trucks here) and a range of engines, though I doubt many 120 h.p.
V4s will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   --Ford SuperCrew. Need I say it: four doors, lots of room, lots
of power. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUVs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, a word of warning here. Don't buy one of these for your
kids because you think they'll be safer in one. If you do buy an
SUV, special driving lessons for young drivers is in order. I am a
fan of Sport Utility Vehicles _ in the right hands. You cannot
drive them as if they are cars. You cannot drive fast the way you
can in a car, nor can you do sudden stops and quick lane changes at
higher speeds as you can in a car. You can haul lots of people and
gear, go places cars can't go, and make them an important part of
your traveling life _ if you are careful. Thankfully, auto
manufacturers are starting to catch onto the inherent dangers that
come when bad or inexperienced drivers get behind the wheel of an
SUV and are responding with automatic driver assist systems, better
suspensions, and wonderful yaw control systems. Some good SUVS
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Honda CR-V. Marginally a true SUV, but a great rig for bad
weather with its all-wheel drive, good suspension, and stability.
Don't plan on going off-road in one, but even most true SUVs never
get there.
</P>
<P>
   --Nissan Xterra. The least expensive true SUV you'll find, if a
dealer isn't gouging because of its popularity. A throwback to the
days when SUVs were tough, spartan, actually did go off-road, and
were affordable. If a dealer asks you to pay well over $20,000 for
one, walk away.
</P>
<P>
   --BMW X5. Perhaps the finest SUV on the market today. It's a
high-performance car on the road; a beast off the road. It is
stable, corners in a way others do not, and has all the feel of
luxury of a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   --Subaru Forester. Another marginal SUV, but wonderful on ice
and snow, quiet, reliable, and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   --Land Rover Discovery. A real SUV in swank clothing. Wonderful
suspension, roomy interior, good in mud, snow, forest, and field. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Minivans &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minivans are a market in flux, to some extent. Who needs a
minivan when you can haul the kids, the lumber, the groceries, the
loam for the lawn, all in a four-door pickup truck that rides like
a car? But there are some good ones and they will sell:
</P>
<P>
   --Ford Windstar. Smooth, powerful, sliding doors on both sides
(de rigeur, I'd say) and it has some of the best crash-test results
of any minivan ever.
</P>
<P>
   --Honda Odyssey. Bigger than ever _ and that means a lot of
space inside _ and right up there with the Chrysler products. Dual
sliding doors and a third seat that disappears (Voila!) into the
floor for good cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   --Mazda MPV. Thankfully, it's been redesigned with front-wheel
drive and that's a smart move. It also has two sliders, a
disappearing seat like the Odyssey, but is just a bit smaller
overall.
</P>
<P>
   --Chrysler Town &AMP; Country, Dodge Caravans. Without these, we'd
not have the others. They're big, powerful, and roomy. Did I
mention dual sliders? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sedans &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is where we urge you to shop carefully, folks. They come
small, medium or large, from low-cost to high-cost. When you're
shopping for a sedan, try out lots of them; many are good, many are
good deals, and many are not worth the extra cash that makes them
more expensive than comparable models, even in their own line.
</P>
<P>
   --Nissan Maxima. It's scheduled for a redesign over the next
couple of years, but its 222-h.p. V6 is one of the finest engines
on the market and its price _ the low $20s _ is appealing because
it is as good as many cars costing $8,000 to $10,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   --Lincoln LS. A sporty, European-feel, American luxury sedan.
The Lincoln LS is a breakthrough and if you're looking at foreign
sport sedans, drive one of these, too.
</P>
<P>
   --Chrysler 300M. American 1950s raw power meets 2000 world-
class styling.
</P>
<P>
   --Ford Focus. Another breakthrough car. At $12,500 to start, it
comes in hatchback, four-door, and wagon models. Smooth,
surprisingly roomy, and a real treat at this price.
</P>
<P>
   --Toyota Camry. Simply, it's the Model T of this age.
Affordable, dependable, reliable. For the masses.
</P>
<P>
   --Chevrolet Monte Carlo. It has great sporty looks with a
performance package to make you feel like you, too, are on the
NASCAR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   --Volkswagen Passat. Soon to come equipped with all-wheel drive.
Smooth, zippy, comfortable, and reliable. Need two cars? Pair this
one up with a Jetta in your garage.
</P>
<P>
   --Any BMW, Saab, Volvo, Mercedes, Acura, Audi or Lexus. In this
pack, it's all a matter of want and wallet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Station Wagons &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're making a comeback. Some favorites:
</P>
<P>
   --Saab 9-5. It's not big, but roomy enough. Powerful, quiet,
wonderful in snow and ice, and hey, I love that glove compartment
that chills drinks to 42 degrees using the car's air conditioning
system.
</P>
<P>
   --Volvo wagons. The 40 series at around $25,000 with a
turbocharged four-cylinder is a fine car; the Cross Country may be
the best all-around New England car you could buy.
</P>
<P>
   --BMW 5401. Rugged, fast, smooth, quiet. What would you expect? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sports cars &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roadsters are the rage with more and more ragtops appearing
every day. In this market, you can go wild with desire, wilder with
your wallet. A few favorites:
</P>
<P>
   --Honda S2000. I drove this one to Pennsylvania and the Pocono
racetrack. Redlines at 9 grand. Fast, six speeds, snappy as a
rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   --Porsche Carrera 4. Probably the finest car I have ever driven.
So subtle, yet so powerful. Its driver assist system, when on,
won't let you make the car fishtail.
</P>
<P>
   --Acura NSX. Another pricey option. Aluminum, horsepower, you
can feel every pebble in the road. The most fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   --Mazda Miata. Without this car, we wouldn't be writing about
the comeback of the sports car. Definitely a car for the
afficianado.
</P>
<P>
   --Audi TT coupe and convertible. Not the easiest car to get
into, but once you are wearing it, it's like you're driving inside
a computer game.
</P>
<P>
   --BMW Z3. Snappy, corners like it's on rails, odd appearance
grows on you until you love it.

ARE NEW MODELS WORTH THE WAIT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long gone are the days when all the vehicle manufacturers
introduced all their new models in the fall. Now it's a year-round
happening. Gone, too, are the days when manufacturers kept new
models under wraps until introduction day. You don't need to look
at spy photos of new models (as happened a few decades ago); now
the manufacturers are putting them out in full view to look at,
marvel about, and think about, long before they are available in
the showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   While some models being shown now are brand new and offer
innovative features, others are redesigns of existing models with
better features.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking to buy, in the case of the DaimlerChrysler
minivans, for example, you might want to hold off until the new
2001 models are available.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring Oldsmobile introduced its 2001 Aurora at the New
York Auto Show. ``The all-new Aurora has everything consumers
demand from a premiere luxury sedan,'' says John Gatt, brand
manager for the Aurora. ``We've improved on everything that defines
the Aurora's heritage _ exhilarating power and performance, precise
ride and handling, and an overall presence that is incredibly
distinctive.'' Unlike the first Aurora introduced in 1994, the new
model will offer a choice of two engines, a V-8 and a V-6.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac has been showing its EVOQ a lot. But this
405-horsepower, $80,000 sports vehicle won't be available until
2003. In this case, Cadillac is working on its image and wants
younger buyers to think Cadillac when they head to the showrooms.
While some of the present styling of Cadillac models still say
older buyer, under the sheet metal is some pretty impressive
performance and innovations.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler PT Cruiser is another vehicle that's been on view
since last spring. Now its actually going on sale in March. Is it a
sedan, minivan, or truck? Chrysler says it's a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Rover is a long-established name in Great Britain, but hasn't
been sold in the States for quite some time. Now BMW (which owns
Rover) confirms the Mini is heading our way. Rumor has it showing
up in fall 2001, and may be sold in BMW showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Acura, which did not offer a CL coupe this year, will have an
all-new model, the 2001 Acura 3.2 CL. This one is based on the
Acura TL sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen is adding its 4Motion, all-wheel-drive to its Passat
sedans and wagons, a feature VW hasn't offered in more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus will bring out the LS 430 to replace its flagship LS 400.
The new model, coming in the fall, will be packed with safety
innovations and comfort. Its amenities are almost mind boggling: a
climate-control system that senses if more sunlight is hitting one
side of the car than the other, and adjusts the cooling system
accordingly; a driver's seat with dual lumbar controls; and options
that include air suspension, navigation system, front seats with
separate heating and cooling elements, power adjustable rear seats
with heat and massage, rear air conditioning and more.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is already showing off its 2001 minivans. Even
though the company leads the field when it comes to minivans, it is
taking no chances on losing sales to other makers. So it's out to
prove that there's no minivan to consider other than a Chrysler or
Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   The new minvans look a lot like this year's models but just
consider the changes: power sliding doors at last, but not like
those on GM models, these can be closed manually; an optional power
liftgate in back that opens and closes electrically, an industry
first; quieter, more powerful engines; stronger bodies; and more
inside features, such as a console that can be moved from the front
to the second row of seating, more cargo room, a cargo organizer to
handle grocery bags, and other items. And the company is retooling
just about everything for better fit and more durability.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into trucks or SUVs, look what's coming:
</P>
<P>
   The Isuzu VX-02 is scheduled to be in showrooms sometime late
this year or early next year. Isuzu takes its futuristic VehiCROSS
one step better by chopping off the top for that open air look. In
addition, the VehiCross has a powerful 215-horsepower V6 engine and
an active control switch on the dash that lets you choose from
off-road to highway driving.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is giving its Frontier a tougher looking exterior to set
it apart from other makes; otherwise mechanically it is the same.
It will come in two and four-door versions, extended cab and
four-wheel drive versions.
</P>
<P>
   GM will offer new pickups with four full-sized doors as well as
heavy-duty versions of Chevrolet Silverado and the GM Sierra
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 77 years, Buick is introducing a truck
(SUV) that will offer the cargo capabilities of a truck and the
easy ride of a sedan. The Buick Rendezvous will sell for around
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac is coming out with the Aztek, a sport utility clearly
aimed at the young at heart. This 2001 model is expected in
showrooms this summer and will be offered in both front-drive and
all-wheel-drive models.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is entering into the full-sized sport utility world with
the Sequoia, based on the Tundra pickup platform. The Sequoia is
almost identical in size to the Ford Expedition. Interestingly, the
Sequoia will be priced less than the smaller Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which has purchased Hummer, now says it will
offer a smaller version of this vehicle in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is coming out with a few new models. Among them is the Ford
Explorer Sport Trac that will offer seating for five, four doors,
and a short cargo bed that can be extended with a flip-out cage.
Another is the Ford Escape, a small SUV and the sixth in the
company's line. Ford is aiming this July model at those with an
``active lifestyle.'' Among its features is a slide out roof rack
that goes into the rear hatch for mountain bikes or skis.
</P>
<P>
   Other SUVs being introduced at this year's Detroit Auto Show
include the Hyundai Santa Fe, a redesigned Mitsubishi Montero, and
the new, small Daewoo Korando, that will be among the lowest priced
SUVs in America.
</P>
<P>
   And Acura, which did not offer an SUV this year, has previewed
its MD-X which will replace the SLX that was built by Isuzu. The
MD-X will share its platform with the Honda Odyssey minivan and
have an independent rear suspension. It goes on sale in the fall
and is aimed right at the Lexus RX300.
</P>
<P>
   With models like this in the pipeline, it almost makes you want
to wait.

BUICK, WOODS DRIVE ON; RENDEZVOUS SUV INTRODUCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks at Buick must have been giddy with joy over the
increased interest Tiger Woods brought to the Buick Invitational
golf tournament in San Diego last week.
</P>
<P>
   National media attention was focused on the tournament as Woods
made his run at an astounding seventh straight PGA Tour victory _
he finished in a tie for second after briefly tying for the lead _
on the very weekend Buick was introducing three television
commercials featuring Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The spots are the first Woods has made with the carmaker since
signing an endorsement deal in December. They hit the airwaves even
as Woods was gaining ground on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger and Buick are a natural combination,'' says Anthony H.
Derhake, Buick's golf brand manager. ``Tiger broadens our audience
appeal, and we expect to attract new customers to Buick as a
result. This also reinforces Buick's recognized strong connection
with golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots have serious and comic overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The serious commercial features Buick's support of the Tiger
Woods Foundation to bring golf to inner-city children. In it, a
grandfather helps his grandson line up _ and sink _ a putt on a
city sidewalk. Talk about fast greens!
</P>
<P>
   In another, Woods banks a shot off a TV tower supporting two
doubting announcers, dropping them into a water hazard, then offers
them a towel as he drives off, er Regal-ly. The third shows Woods
teaching adult campers how to play golf and ``drive'' the way he
does _ in a Buick of course. For Buick, the jackpot was earned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Buick
</P>
<P>
   The GM Division introduced its Rendezvous SUV at last week's
Chicago Auto Show. It's the first Buick truck model in 77 years.
Buick didn't put a price on it, but best guesses are it will sell
for less than $30,000, well below the similar-sized Lexus RX 300
and Mercedes M-Class. Like its GM sibling, the Pontiac Aztek, it

on demand. A third row of seats can make this a seven-passenger
vehicle, or the third seat can fold flat for storage.

   Most manufactures were showing off their four-door compact
pickups at the Chicago show _ except Ford, GM, Toyota, Nissan all
arrived with their new models with four regular-sized doors.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Ford unveiled its 2001 Ranger _ the country's
top-selling compact pickup for the past 13 years. It had two
regular doors and two mini-doors.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or madness?
</P>
<P>
   Ford truck boss Jim O'Connor said Ford already has its Explorer
Sport Trac (a four-door SUV with a short pickup bed) in production
and almost ready for the showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ford takes great pains to separate pickups from
SUVs, the inference is obvious: Want four doors? Try the Sport
Trac.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Ford is hesitant to hurt interest in this ballyhooed
SUV; question is, will Ranger sales suffer in that effort?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ranger comes in enough body and door styles with both
two- and four-wheel drive to have plenty of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor doesn't sound too upset. Ford this month forecast that
it would sell 17 million vehicles in the United States this year _
up from its original goal of 16.1 million units. And this after a
record-breaking 1999. Pickup trucks, minivans, and SUVs account for
two-thirds of Ford sales.

   BMW held a winter carnival in East Rutherford, N.J., letting 100
would-be buyers experience a two-hour Ultimate Driving Experience
behind the wheel of its new $50,000 X5 Sports Activity Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   We had a chance to try a similar trek at the New England Motor
Press Winter Driving Awards several weeks back so it's a lock that
those lucky 100 had a great time, even though they were accompanied
by a professional driver.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has a simple plan for tracking the program's success. It
will match the names of participants against future buyers.

   Well, we have platinum series credit cards, so why not a
Platinum Series Lexus? The company has introduced a Platinum series
LS 400 premium luxury sedan ($55,969), GS 400 sport luxury sedan
($49,894), S 300 sport luxury sedan ($42,344) and an ES300
affordable luxury sedan at $34,924.
</P>
<P>
   The series feature special paint colors, enhanced interiors,
distinctive wheels and badging, and are well-equipped (read loaded)
with factory options. Plus, Lexus will toss in a two-year American
Express Platinum Card.

   All the Hondas I've had experience with were clean-running
vehicles. But the company is doing more. The 2000 Accord EX has
become the first car sold with California's Super Ultra Low
Emission Vehicle (SULEV) certification. (It will be priced $100
over the Accord it replaces.) The SULEV standards are the world's
strictest and go into effect beginning with the 2004 model year.
According to the California Air Resources Board, a SULEV engine
emits only 2.3 pounds of hydrocarbons during 100,000 miles of
driving, roughly the same as spilling a quart of gasoline.

   DaimlerChrysler's PT Cruiser, introduced as a concept car a year
ago, is just now in production in Mexico. It will be available this
spring and priced at $16,000 (including destination charge) with
the top-end Limited model coming in at $19,995. The car is
intriguing because it boasts full-size car interior space in a
compact body. (It's built on the Neon platform).
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing DaimlerChrysler chairman Robert J. Eaton may be right
when he said, ``There isn't a cooler truck _ or car _ available
anywhere for the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Kudos to D/C for its ``Fit for a Kid'' program that offers free
public child safety seat inspections. Anyone who has purchased a
family vehicle with an eye towards its safety features owes it to
themselves to take advantage of this offer by calling their local
dealer or clicking on www.fitforakid.org. An inspection takes 20 to
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge folks will continue to expand their R/T lineup with a
Stratus R/T coupe with a 200-horsepower V-6 engine, specially tuned
suspension, and 17-inch performance tires. It also will be
available with a five-speed manual.

AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR CAR IS REALLY WORTH?

 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Here's something to keep in mind when
you're out cruising the dealerships and checking out the present
crop of new cars for sale.
</P>
<P>
   While your mind is keyed on what you'd like to drive out of the
lot, the used car manager is more interested in the wheels you'll
be leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon spent with Bill Dame, the used car manager for Fox
Toyota, provided an intriguing insight into a person who is vital
to the operation of a dealership, but who doesn't have a specific
job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can ever train to do this job. It's not part of a
career path,'' says Dame who has been sitting on the sales desk at
Fox for 3 1/2 years. ``You either can do it or you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame's resume includes a stint as an Air Force mechanic, a
father-in-law who owned a body shop, a thorough knowledge of cars
(he did a frame-off restoration of a big block (427 c.i.) 1967
Chevrolet that he still drives), and a regular presence at auto
auctions for more than 30 years. He took this job after retiring
from the Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Dame knows is his numbers. His desktop may be clean,
but one drawer down he's got the latest auction sheets, plus the
most recent NADA, Kelley, Galves, and Edmund's guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying in this business that you can shake the book
all day and no money will fall out of it,'' he says. ``You look at
the book and you've immediately got three prices: Average trade,
average loan, and retail. Then you talk to five wholesalers and get
five more different prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame uses the guides for reference, but he really studies the
local auction sheets because they're more accurate reflections of
his marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the prices that the guidebooks use in their next
edition so it's the most up-do-date and localized information I can
get,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dame's job is to put a price on cars, he's in the
people business. In the course of several hours, he'll have chatted
with salesmen, mechanics, customers, wholesalers, and Jack Fox, the
dealership's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jack asks me to keep an eye out for a car, I remember it,''
says Dame. ``I may not remember yesterday's lunch but I remember
what I paid for every car I ever (personally) bought, what I put
into that car, and what I sold it for.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his role with the dealership, Dame makes one thing clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not trading in your car,'' he says. ``You're asking me
to buy it. I have to dispose of it. I have to ask myself: `Can I
sell this car for more than I have in it or do I have to get rid of
it.' I don't want it sitting around,'' he adds. ``Once we buy the
car, I have to decide whether it goes on our lot for sale or if we
sell it on the wholesale market.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame makes a lot of judgments in a single glance.
</P>
<P>
   That first glance tells him whether the car is ``desirable''
with a reasonable amount of mileage on its odometer. It tells him
whether it's a color that will sell readily: beige, sage, black,
white, and silver sell best; the red family not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In real estate, they say, `location, location, location,' ''
says Dame. ``In this business, it's `condition, condition,
condition.' A nice car is a nice car.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Dame decides a car is desirable and his gut tells him
there's no obvious mechanical problems, the car has one more hurdle
before it winds up on the Fox lot _ the shop's evaluation of how
much it will take to put the car in A-1 condition for resale. ``If
we can then sell it for more than we have in it, we do it;
otherwise, it goes to the wholesalers,'' says Dame.
</P>
<P>
   After nixing one offer, Dame says, ``Sure, I was born at night,
but not last night.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound harsh, but it's the reality of a bottom-line
business, one in which the price of new cars is readily available
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good part is that people come in really attuned to the car
they want,'' says Dame. ``The Internet is a tool _ a great tool _
and gives you good figures for MSRP and dealer cost, but it's far
from complete. We have to add to our base cost, a delivery charge _
and it's different for every model at every dealership _ plus local
dealer association advertising costs. If a customer will take that
figure and add the 3 percent the Internet folks say is a fair
profit, we'll make that deal all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Szumita, the general sales manager, interjects to ask, ``Did
you show him the Internet customer?''
</P>
<P>
   Dame opens a door to reveal a poster of an aging bag lady. The
inscription reads: ``On the Internet, she's 25, blonde, blue-eyed
and 36-24-36.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame's resources are more immediate _ the local corps of auto
wholesalers. ``These guys know all kinds of vehicles,'' he says.
``When I describe a car to them, I'm perfectly honest. They don't
know whether I'm figuring on keeping the car or offering it to
them. Our relationship is based on a mutual trust.''
</P>
<P>
   A salesman gives Dame a slip. He needs to appraise a 1997 Jeep
Cherokee Sport with 38,000 miles on it that is being traded on a
2000 RAV-4 SUV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect example of an off-breed (non-Toyota)
appraisal,'' says Dame. ``At 38,000 miles it's out of warranty,''
he notes, checking paint, tires, overall appearance, and myriad
intangibles at a glance to determine the car's ``desirability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this car has been repainted, it was done professionally
because I can't see it; and if I can't, you can't, either. He does
find a rough spot on a fender seam that has had a minor repair. But
. . . there's a lot of wax on this car. It's been kept clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting in, he appraises interior condition and options with a
similar glance. ``There aren't many extras on this car, but there
are enough (to make it desirable).'' He takes a look ahead and
says, ``The hood is nice and right on this car. That's another good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   A short ride around the block tells him that the engine and
transmission are OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would resell on my lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now to put a price on this car.
</P>
<P>
   ``A figure jumped into my head at first sight, and nothing I've
seen so far has changed it,'' says Dame. ``I think I'll have to
offer $13,000 for the car. A quick check of the books and a call to
one of his wholesalers, pretty much sets the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Then a snappy looking Mustang rolls into the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Jimmy,'' says Dame of another wholesaler. ``He's on his
way back from the auction. He must have had a bad day and wants to
see if there's anything for him here (the dealership parks all cars
to be wholesaled in a back lot), but there isn't anything out there
today.'' Dame waves him inside. ``He's (Jimmy) a real smart guy,''
he says. ``Watch us play each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The two talk back and forth, agreeing that the market is better
for the Sport than a Grand Cherokee these days, but Jimmy, who
actually had a good day at the auction, thinks Dame is paying way
too much for the Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have liked it for a lot less,'' says Dame, ``but this one
is going on my lot. In fact, I think we might have a buyer for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the real bottom line of his game.

SMALL CARS ARE BIG THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a car that's big enough for family and friends but
won't break the budget? This is your year.
</P>
<P>
   For too long ``small'' cars were actually, well, tiny. And they
lacked power, features, and interest. Then along came Ford and
Toyota with new ideas about small vehicles. In today's market,
those small cars are joined by a couple of moderately priced
alternative fuel vehicles as well as an all-new Chevrolet Impala
and completely redesigned Ford Taurus, all great choices that are
selling for less than $20,000. There are some great options, such
as the Toyota Echo, which starts at just under $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus replaces the Escort (which is still available,
however) with a car that is bigger and has more power and features.
For around $13,000 the base-level Focus, with extra space and power
along with a leather-wrapped steering wheel that tilts and
telescopes, is priced comparably with the Escort.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is also giving consumers more car for the dollar. The
Echo, which replaces the Tercel, is roomier than the higher-priced
Corolla. And, the Echo's engine includes variable-valve timing, a
feature first introduced on the Lexus LS400.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet's new Impala comes with air conditioning, power
windows, power locks and mirrors as standard features. There's also
a six-speaker sound system, heated power seats and mirrors
available.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has given its Taurus a new look as well as adding many
safety features, including side head protection, an inside trunk
release latch to prevent entrapment, and ``smart'' airbags that
open either partially or fully depending on the seat position. And
it's the first sedan to offer adjustable pedals to allow short
drivers to move away from the air bag.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, Nissan has given its Sentra a
redesign that should change its image as an entry-level car. The
new Sentra looks a bit like family members Altima and Maxima: it's
larger than its previous version, has more power, and better
handling.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 seller in this group, that is, under $18,000, and the
best-selling car in the country, is the Toyota Camry, which comes
with lots of options and choices. That funny looking Volkswagen
Beetle offers a nice ride and is considered one of the safest cars
being built. The Oldsmobile Alero offers room and a lot of features
for its price. If you want great mileage, the Toyota
Corolla/Chevrolet Prizm will give you 31 miles to the gallon, and
that's city driving. Others models to check out include Ford
Contour and Mustang, Dodge Stratus, Mitsubishi Galant, Volkswagen
Jetta and Golf, Hyundai Sonata (remember that great warranty),
Subaru Legacy and Pontiac Grand Am. Another good choice is the
Subaru Impreza, the lowest-priced all-wheel-drive car around.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn, which converted a lot of people to its value-priced cars
and no-hassle buying, now has a new model that is larger and
roomier. It's a vehicle current Saturn owners can move up to rather
than switching to some other make. The Saturn LS comes in both
sedan and wagon and has an optional V6 engine, the same engine
found in Saabs and the Cadillac Catera.
</P>
<P>
   Another model few have heard of but might consider in the budget
market is the Daewoo Nubira. This $13,000 sedan comes with air
conditioning, power windows, and a keyless entry. The Korean Daewoo
has been in the United States for almost two years with three
models that are packed with extras at a low price. Later this year,
Daewoo will introduce a sport utility vehicle. One of Daewoo's
problems has been its limited dealerships, all company owned. Now
the financially hard-pressed firm is bringing its line to other
dealerships. If you're worried about its staying power, both GM and
Ford are reportedly looking to buy into the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai has changed dramatically, and offers the best warranty
around (five years or 60,000 miles). New this year is the Accent,
costing about $10,000; it has great handling thanks to a fully
independent suspension, a feature found in more expensive cars. Of
course, if you want some real fun, check out the Hyundai Tiburon
($13,500); nice styling, good performance and all at a good price.
</P>
<P>
   All these cars are competing with the Honda Civic, one of the
top-selling cars in America.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of choices in the under $12,000 range. Among
them: the Chevrolet Metro, which can get you up to 39 miles per
gallon in the city; the redesigned Dodge/Plymouth Neon, a big car
for the buck. Kia, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Suzuki are other players
in the low-price field.
</P>
<P>
   It's the end of the line for Plymouth. And for some the
questions might be: Will there be parts if I buy one? Will the 2000
Plymouth become a collector's car? And, why buy one if the make is
going out of business?
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth has served a good number of generations of Americans
quite well. And, if you're looking for an inexpensive vehicle with
a good reputation, there's no reason not to consider a Plymouth
this year. Parts will be available. Remember, a Plymouth is
basically a Dodge and a Chrysler. Most of the parts from the
engine, to the drive train to the body are the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Plymouth nameplate is disappearing simply because
DaimlerChrysler realized it was spending money on the Plymouth name
for no reason.

A CAR BUFF SIZES UP THE 2000 MODELS, Z TO A

 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   It happens every February.
</P>
<P>
   The roads are sloppy, the cars are filthy.
</P>
<P>
   You brush against a fender in the parking lot and your coat is
covered with road grime.
</P>
<P>
   You open your car's door, cringe at the accumulated salt and
sand on the mats, and wonder if you'll ever get it truly clean when
spring finally arrives.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the New Car Genie sneaks out of some crevice in your
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't hurt just to look. You don't have to buy a new car.
Maybe you'll walk through the showrooms, see all the shiny new cars
and walk back outside and this car will look like a carriage
instead of a pumpkin,'' says the little voice.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It hits me every year at this time. Do I need a new car? Not
really. I'm driving a 1997 model that runs well, performs well, has
low mileage and hasn't had to be repaired once other than regularly
scheduled maintenance. So why look?
</P>
<P>
   Because that's me.
</P>
<P>
   My kids are grown up. I don't have extravagant tastes. And I
really enjoy driving a nice car. And looking is fun. If that makes
me a voyeur of Voyagers, so be it. It doesn't cost a whole lot and
provides me with days of entertainment. From A (as-in-Acura) to V
(as-in-Volvo), you show me the dealership, and there's something
inside I'd like to see and drive. What follows is by no means a
list of the best-selling or most popular cars, just the one model
I'd look at first at each dealership.
</P>
<P>
   We could take this from the top, but I was in the military and
had a drill sergeant who always ran the alphabet in reverse, so,
even though it isn't Veterans Day, let's work backwards in his
memory.
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO _ Our eyes are on the 40 series. The S (sedan) and V
(wagon) models are ``entry-level'' Volvos. Our auto friends from
Sweden see what Camry and Accord have done and want a piece of that
mid-price marketplace. Of course, summer is coming (eventually), so
we'll take a peek at the C70 convertible on our way out.
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN _ The Beetle is hard to overlook, as is the
Cabriolet. But the well-optioned Passat, with a V6 and great
handling, is what we'll checkout. It might be the one to put some
sizzle back in your driving.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA _ You already know about the Camry, Avalon, Tundra and
RAV4, don't you? This month, we want to see the new Celica. It's
not a Supra, but this car looks promising. Besides, I have to see
if there's enough headroom to sit in it with a sunroof. And, are
you ready for a six-speed manual transmission?
</P>
<P>
   SUZUKI _ A much-begrimed Grand Vitara SUV with a V6 marched me
up two hills covered by 6 inches of unplowed snow and ice to my
house in the middle of January's biggest storm. It isn't generally
rated at the top of its class, but it earned a place in my heart.
I'd like to look at one that's showroom clean.
</P>
<P>
   SUBARU _ One of my favorite stops. On this trip, we want to
check out the Outback Limited Sedan. It looks like a nice mid-sized
sedan, but under the sheet metal is the all-wheel drive that will
take you any place you reasonably want to go. A vastly
underappreciated vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   SATURN _ We owe it to ourselves to check out the new mid-size L
series. The question is simple: Do you get enough car for what you
save in price? The answer may be yes.
</P>
<P>
   SAAB _ Gotta see the hot rods. The 9-3 Viggen and the 9-5 Aero.
You want torque? They've got torque.
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC _ A friend-of-a-friend came home with a new Bonneville
SSEI. It's big, a bit pricey, but I wanted to beg for the keys.
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE _ I get the shakes every time I walk into a store where
there isn't anything for sale under $40,000. But isn't that Boxster
about the neatest thing you see on the road?
</P>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH _ Daniels LeSaffre Motors in Melrose always was a
regular stop. Plymouth's nameplate is on the way out, but we'll
still drop in to see the Chryslers.
</P>
<P>
   OLDSMOBILE _ The marque always has stood for class, and we're
going to check out the entry-level Alero. On the road, they never
fail to catch my eye. This is a chance to see one up close. The
Aurora has always been a favorite, but a new design is coming by
summer.
</P>
<P>
   NISSAN _ How can a company that makes such great cars (and which
sell so well in New England) have such financial problems
elsewhere? The new Maxima is worth a look, but we're going to check
out the updated Altima and see if it's a hidden jewel.
</P>
<P>
   MITSUBISHI _ Get me to an Eclipse. It's no longer just a kids'
car. The turbo will be missed, but this is a great design with a
solid V6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   MERCURY _ Let's test-drive a no-longer-ovalized Sable. I
apparently was one of the few who wasn't bothered by the
Taurus/Sable Oval Era. The Sable's adjustable pedals are a bit of
future shock.
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES _ The sticker shakes are back. So let's go right to the
top and check out the $85,000 CL500. The absolute state of the art,
top of the line. Besides, if you grip the wheel tightly enough, the
shakes go away.
</P>
<P>
   MAZDA _ I want to revisit the Protege ES, one of those cars that
always has felt ``right.'' A great blend of price, economy, and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   LINCOLN _ A Lincoln with a 5-speed manual? This I've got to see.
</P>
<P>
   LEXUS _ Risking another case of the shakes, I've always wanted
to drive a GS 300 or GS 400.
</P>
<P>
   LAND ROVER _ What the heck. Let's drive the Range Rover _ at
nearly $60,000, it's as unique in its own way as a Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   KIA _ The Sportage is a low-budget SUV with sensational looks
covering an economy vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   JEEP _ A good time to revisit the Cherokee, in many ways the
father of all SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUAR _ I'm almost afraid to stop here (Mrs. G loves Jags). But
the new S-type is to love.
</P>
<P>
   IZUZU _ Remember those Amigo ads last year? They left a lasting
impression.
</P>
<P>
   INFINITI _ The new I30 is on my list for its looks. It probably
will stay there for its performance.
</P>
<P>
   HYUNDAI _ A must stop. The funky Tiburon is a low-cost sports
car. I love it, even though it's built for short- to medium-sized
folks (and I don't qualify for those categories).
</P>
<P>
   HONDA _ I want to check out both the hybrid gas-electric Insight
and S2000, but, even if they're not in stock, revisiting the Accord
is always worth a stop.
</P>
<P>
   GMC _ Time to think big. I once owned (and loved) a Suburban.
Now the GMC version is the Yukon XL. (Does that mean extra long?)
</P>
<P>
   FORD _ This is truck and SUV city, but our tour is aiming
smaller _ at the new Focus. Small money, small car, and we want to
check out the package. With everyone else buying big, sometimes
it's nice to look in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   DODGE _ The Caravan and Grand Caravan. Even without kids in the
family, these remain prime people-movers. A young couple of our
acquaintance just bought a bright red one for weekend excursions
and mountain-bike transporting.
</P>
<P>
   DAEWOO _ The Lanos. At under $9,000, it's a basic car _ and it's
got to be checked out.
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER _ Great designs across the board, but we're headed for
the 300M and hopefully a road test.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET _ People are buying Malibus and liking them. It's a
good month to check out what the excitement is about.
</P>
<P>
   CADILLAC _ The new DeVille DTS. Technology meets luxury meets
big sedan.
</P>
<P>
   BUICK _ Have to see how the Park Avenue compares to the
Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   BMW _ The X5, BMW's all-new SUV, is expensive ($49,400). They've
managed to make it look _ and perform _ like a pure BMW. How? Don't
question. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   AUDI _ The A4 Quattro. A great blend of value and performance
with either the 1.8-turbocharged, 4-cylinder or 2.8-liter V6
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ACURA _ This trip winds up with a car I'd buy _ the 3.2 TL.
Another car that does everything right. At $28,000 (with only a
Navigation system as an option), it's a great value to boot.

NAVIGATE AND TELECOMMUNICATE FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR CAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I'm driving an Acura RL with a dash mounted navigation
system. From Chatham, I program it to go to Boston, or more
precisely to The Boston Globe, and it does so flawlessly, always
keeping me informed as to how much further I have to travel and any
turns I must make . . . that is, until I decide to get off I-93 one
exit earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the woman's voice that gives the directions senses that
I am about to do it my way, and get off at Exit 14 instead of Exit
15. Suddenly the voice announces ``Stay on 93.'' I don't, and
instead of reprimanding me, the system suddenly recalculates the
route, noting I am already on Morrissey Boulevard and takes me
right to the front door of the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems are showing up on more and more vehicles, but
such toys are expensive _ around $2,000 _ and while I like them and
find they can be useful, they're still not ready for prime time
driving. In cities like Boston, they can get you around, but you
must know the territory. Yes, the Globe is in Boston but I had to
program it for Dorchester, the section of the city where the
building is located. This navigation system doesn't know all of the
streets. For Chatham, I programmed it to start from a house near
where I live and it did give me the option to head to the town
hall. When I head to Woonsocket, R.I., it knows the street where
I'm going, but no house numbers. Heading to Uxbridge, it knew where
the town center was, but not where the house we were heading to was
located.
</P>
<P>
   One nifty device is OnStar. Of course, you have to buy a GM
vehicle to get one. Onstar, which is linked to a cell phone, also
uses global navigation to assist you, but here you have a real
person who can not only locate where you are, but help you if you
get lost or are in an accident. Better still, if you should be in
an accident and the air bags deploy, the system automatically seeks
help. GM is smartly packaging it with many models, but you'll still
have to pay a monthly service charge. Call it insurance. It's also
good in helping you find hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and
other places.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers StarTAC, the first fully integrated digital
cellular phone system in a car. Among its features are a
multi-function dashboard and steering wheel control, allowing
drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road;
integrated radio system that mutes the sound while on the phone and
can also pause the CD or cassette player, and voice recognition
capabilities. It is also portable so it can go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has also expanded the use of its TeleAid system to most
of its models. The system, like OnStar, provides both convenience
and emergency information at the touch of a button. It uses Global
Positioning to aid in locating the vehicle, should you become lost
or in an accident. TeleAid also provides drivers with a real person
to help them with vehicle questions.
</P>
<P>
   Voice recognition controls are an option on the new Jaquar
S-Type. The driver can just speak to use the cell phone, control
the temperature or the navigation system of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's new Seville has a radio that also offers e-mail,
stock quotes, and traffic information. Should a traffic alert
occur, the radio will broadcast it even if the CD is playing. If
you don't know where to find traffic information on the dial, the
radio will do it at the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   If having Internet access while driving is in your plans,
perhaps you should hold off for a while. Ford, GM and
DaimlerChrysler are all working to put e-mail availability in
vehicles. Ford and GM are working on voice recognition systems
that, when you say ``get e-mail'' or ``read e-mail,'' will deliver.
DaimlerChrysler plans a ``bring your own laptop'' approach and is
designing a system that includes a small screen, microphone and
cellular phone modem in its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision technology is another Cadillac feature that is
found on the new DeVille. With the system, potential safety hazards
out of range of the car's headlights, are illuminated on the
windshield in front of the driver. The system not only allows the
driver to see three to five times farther than the range of their
low-beam headlights, but also helps reduce the glare of oncoming
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   The new Volvo S40 comes with an optional front-seat laptop
computer table. The very safety conscientious Volvo posts a warning
that the table should only be used when the car is parked.
</P>
<P>
   Already available on General Motors and other minivans are
entertainment systems allowing the gang in the back to watch
videos, play Nintendo or listen to their own music.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort is also being upgraded. Many models now offer dual-zone
climate controls to keep both the driver and front-seat passenger
comfortable. The Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited goes one step farther
by using an infrared sensor to detect the skin temperature of the
riders in the front seat to keep them at precisely the right level
programmed into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up in the 2001 Lexus LS 430 will be a system that allows
rear passengers to also select their own temperature setting. And,
the 2001 DamilerChrysler minivans will offer three separate
temperature zones, one for each row of seats.
</P>
<P>
   Heated front seats are found in many makes, but a few, including
Saab and the Cadillac Catera, also offer rear passengers heated
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Seats are key to driving safety, if you're not comfortable
seated behind the wheel, you could tire easily. If your vehicle is
used by others, getting one with power seats that can be set for
each individual driver is a handy feature. Many vehicles offer
lumbar supports that certainly could help your back on a long
drive. Cadillac even has a seat that gives a massage as you drive.
</P>
<P>
   Saab has an extra option ventilated seat for those hot sticky
days, and its also heated for colder times..
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Navigator has a climate-controlled seat as an
option. The seat has a fan that directs ambient air to two ceramic
thermoelectric devices located in the seat's back and cushions,
which then release or absorb heat, depending on the flow of
electric current to them. The warm or cool air is directed through
perforations in the seat upholstery. There are five different
heating and cooling settings.
</P>
<P>
   Other niceties being found on 2000 models include the storage
bin found on the roof of the Nissan Xterra. It is self draining so
you can throw those muddy hiking boots up there. The Xterra has lot
of other neat storage ideas, including an inside bike rack. The
Ford Taurus and Mercury Stable have trunk hooks to hang those
plastic grocery bags, no more loose cans rolling around in the
trunk. The Pontiac Bonneville SSEi comes with an emergency package
with rain suit, first-aid kit, gloves, light, and an air hose to
pump air into low tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon, has a smart gauge to read the fuel supply. No more
guessing how much is left in the tank, the gauge continuously reads
the fuel-tank float level every six seconds, comparing it with
stored historical data to calculate a ``real-time'' reading for the
gauge to give a more accurate assessment of the fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   Some cars come with automatic gauges to read the tire pressure,
warning the driver if a tire has low pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz now has a sensor in the oil pump that analyzes oil
for impurities such as water, fuel, and metal. It sends its
information to the car's Flexible Service system which then decides
when to flag the driver. With this, Mercedes says, some drivers may
only have to change their oil every 20,000 miles. Not bad, but
better still is Mercede's free maintenance during its
four-year/50,000-mile warranty. That cuts ownership costs even
more.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of gasoline skyrocketing these days, Cadillac is
giving buyers of its high-performance Northstar V-8 engine equipped
vehicles a bonus _ it now runs on regular gasoline instead of the
high-priced 93 octane. Even Cadillac owners can appreciate the
savings of 20 to 30 cents or more a gallon.

 &HT;    Welcome to car-wreck TV
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Some television shows possess the simple
hypnotic drawing power of a bad car wreck. People see something
horrible happening to other people and yet they can't look away.
Even people who possess good intentions, love for humanity and
average decency cannot fail to slow down and point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' is car-wreck
television.
</P>
<P>
   About 22 million people dropped the remote to see this
high-stakes ``Dating Game.'' A third of all women under 35 who were
watching television that night watched the nuptials. The show's Web
site
</P>
<P>
   crashed under the traffic from women who want to be on the next
installment. (Or maybe the Web site just crashed because Web sites
do that all the time. Publicists used to say their switchboards
``lighted up like a Christmas tree,'' but that's yesterday's
viewer-response cliche.)
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the show is summed up in the title. About 50
women were considered for the wife job. The multimillionaire,
without the aid of a human resources department, pared their number
to 10, then five. The winner, a nurse from California _ who
presumably had failed to find an anesthesiologist to marry the
old-fashioned way _ was awarded the prize of getting married on
</P>
<P>
   national television.
</P>
<P>
   It was a true ``Truman Show'' moment, when real life, palpable
greed, show biz and media blend in one metal-twisting pile up. But
will this story really conclude with a Vegas minister and closing
credits?
</P>
<P>
   One might hope, but be real. This is a cultural phenomenon. As I
write this, the tabloids have airlifted reporters around the world
to pick up where this story left off. If the happy couple have
their act together _ something I would in no way presume _ they
already have retained an agent. Book and movie rights and maybe a
product endorsement or two should be tied up before they set foot
in the honeymoon suite. Those whom television game-show producers
have joined together, let no man sunder from royalties.
</P>
<P>
   But the happy couple also needs time. It takes most couples some
time together before they get a sense of whether their life
partnership is going to be a situation comedy, a gripping family
drama, a hokey soap opera, a dark mystery in which everyone is a
suspect, or just another blues number played late at night from a
plywood stage in a dark and smoky barroom.
</P>
<P>
   If things don't work out, the couple might go before a TV judge
and let the television audience interactively divide their
properties. A Web site poll could decide who drives away in the BMW
and who gets to keep the set of Dale Earnhardt coffee mugs.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the beginning of a whole media-convergent life. A
Web site could record their domestic life with a 24-hour Web-cam.
Their ghost-written book could give a heartwarming account of their
secrets for a successful marriage. Then, after the book tour and
paperback editions run their course, they would be followed by a
dark tell-all account of lives gone horribly wrong. After rehab,
there's a career in motivational speaking to encourage people to
get their lives together, too.
</P>
<P>
   Should something unfortunate happen along the way, the funeral
could be pay-for-view and Judge Judy could do the probate.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, imitators have already whipped out their cell phones
and are packaging deals for cheap knock-offs that lack the dignity
and class of the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Zeroaire Who is Living with His Momma and
Leaves his Laundry on the Floor'' could be produced for a fraction
of the cost. It would be like Jerry Springer, only legally binding.
Have your people call my people.
</P>
<P>
   I would offer my own services for ``Who Wants to Marry a
Divorced Hundredaire with Two Smart-Mouthed Teen-aged Kids and an
Ugly Dog'' but the Web site taking offers crashed under the
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there is such a thing as car-wreck TV too gruesome to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Is marriage a game show? Should poor ratings be legally
recognized grounds for divorce? In the brave new world of media
convergence, these questions must be answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire'' is only an early
symptom of what's ahead. Stay tuned.

 &HT;    Does civil disobedience equal good citizenship?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Don't you occasionally wonder what some folks
are usingfor walking-around sense? And aren't you particularly
annoyed when it's those very same folks who are making decisions
that affect all the rest of us who weren't invited to be on the
committee?
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's state board of education has been meeting in Columbus to
review a list of what educators believe high school seniors need to
know in order to pass a 12th-grade proficiency test. Proposed
questions in the citizenship section of this test would require
students to ``illustrate how the evolution of democratic principles
(e.g., civil rights widening franchise) can occur through civil
disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil disobedience'' is defined as a ``refusal to obey
governmental demands or commands, especially as a nonviolent and
usually collective means of forcing concessions from the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   And the problem is: One board member, a conservative writer and
lecturer from a Dayton suburb, has nixed any question about civil
disobedience on the test because the words in themselves are, as
she reads them,
</P>
<P>
   ``inflammatory language.''
</P>
<P>
   Right away, I'm thinking if that's the case then we probably
ought to deep-six the Ten Commandments too; they're loaded with
inflammatory language. All that killing and coveting. My oh my.
</P>
<P>
   Then I'm reminded of a faded photograph of my grandmother, chin
set and petticoat hanging down below her hem, marching down the
street with a bunch of other matrons, demanding that women be
allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Civil disobedience? You betcha!
</P>
<P>
   The board member, obviously on a _ Duh _ roll, asks two
questions: `` Civil disobedience is now regarded as good
citizenship?'' and, ``Are we trying to promote civil
disobedience?''
</P>
<P>
   Good grief.
</P>
<P>
   The answers are simple. Yes. No.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Civil disobedience is occurring when a bunch of folks
exercise their legal right to gather and non-violently protest
drinking fountains that come in pairs labeled: White Only, and
Colored Only, and buses that demand equal fares but admonish:
Colored Seat from Rear.
</P>
<P>
   Civil disobedience is what kick-started this country into
existence. If some of our ancestors hadn't seen fit to protest
taxation without representation, we'd still be rolled back on our
complacent haunches, sending part of our
</P>
<P>
   paychecks to England to keep the Queen in silly hats.
</P>
<P>
   And no. Although I'm not privy to a copy of the proposed
proficiency questions, I'd bet my new shoes that not one of them
urges teens to get out there and bust up a storefront as a
prerequisite for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The esteemed board member is obviously confusing civil
disobedience with criminal acts, and although it may be a little
obscure to her, most 12th-graders will figure it out _ no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell's ``1984'' remains the most terrifying book I have
ever read. I hated teaching it to high schoolers _ but I did. They
had to know what happens to a society that gives over its will to
the government in exchange for the
</P>
<P>
   guarantee of a mindless existence. They had to experience the
feeling of being a cipher where ``Big Brother'' watched their every
move. They had to learn the fate of independent thinkers in such a
world.
</P>
<P>
   The board member, not to be dissuaded by her colleagues, insists
that civil disobedience is ``...the antithesis of our way of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Give it a rest, lady. Anyone who ever paid attention in history
class knows that civil disobedience, in its true sense, is the very
basis of our government and if it hadn't been for my grandmother
and her civil disobedience, you'd
</P>
<P>
   still be in the suburbs dusting figurines.

 &HT;    If we called it something other than a drug war, we might win
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ You could almost hear the choppers of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was authorizing a $1.6 billion package to
combat drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much in war terms. Compare it to the $26.3 billion
Lyndon Johnson asked for the war effort in Southeast Asia in 1968.
But it compares favorably with the $125 million sought in 1964 for
efforts in Vietnam. Johnson soon realized it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   He and a pliant Congress were committing our nation to a war on
someone else's turf, against an impulse as much as an army. The
impulse was hard for Americans to hack: Marxism as self-betterment.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and reefer will make you Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   But after a war that stretched over three decades, the West came
to the conclusion that short of going nuclear, there was no
defeating a popular impulse in Southeast Asia with military might.
</P>
<P>
   And half the battle was at home. Washington was losing that as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The American drug war has a home front and a foreign theater,
too. On neither front are we winning.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was a tortuous groping through alien lands. But in
complexity and intractability, the drug war makes that war look
like red coats vs. blue coats, wide-open knoll, at 40 paces.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam we believed we could bomb the enemy to the peace
table. In the drug war we've come to believe that we can
incarcerate the enemy into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   These days you rub your eyes at the official assessments. Was
that Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey speaking, or was it Robert McNamara?
McGeorge Bundy?
</P>
<P>
   To combat the foe in Southeast Asia we built whole cities: fully
contained planned residential communities. We called them military
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Now we do the same for the drug war. We call them prisons.
</P>
<P>
   America now has over 2 million people in prison, a city the size
of Dallas. Of that, roughly half are in on drug charges, a city the
size of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   What a human toll _ not just the nickel-and-dime users wasting
away on obscene federal mandatory minimums. Think of children and
families, the geometry of loss that extends out into infinity with
dysfunction and more crime to come, those fatherless children
society bemoans.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the real tragedy, though. Of the billions we spend on our
drug war, our only truly effective weapon _ treatment to get people
straight _ commands only a third of the federal drug budget.
Treatment is something with the same infinite geometry _ people
freed of the dope that possesses their brains, free to be
self-sufficient and productive. And yet we spend money on military
adventures overseas. Even McCaffrey, a military man, has come to
admit the general folly of this.
</P>
<P>
   Education is something that works, too, but we know some people
won't listen, even as the clang of cellblock doors sounds for
others in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Some day the drug war will end, after countless more lives have
been trashed and lost at the dictum of leaders who admit to doing
what the prisoners have done, just not getting caught at it.
</P>
<P>
   Some day we'll look back at the decades of waste and misery and
admit our national mistake. We'll reduce, rather than lengthen,
sentences. We'll turn to treating drug abuse as a health problem.
We might even do what pushers fear most: take away their profit by
regulating some drugs that are illegal now.
</P>
<P>
   We know drugs kill and debilitate. But is today's
lock-'em-up-forever solution any more salutary to the nation's
health?
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Lewis wrote recently, there's never a shift in policy
about the drug war because any shift would make our leaders
``vulnerable to a charge that they are `soft on crime.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, any shift in policy made one vulnerable to the
charge of being ``soft on communism.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still lives to lose before we find our way back from
the jungle.

   WACO, Texas _ Is Britney Spears too sexy too soon?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The question is asked on the cover of the Feb. 14 People
magazine. The answer is self-evident in the work and wardrobe _
like a V-neck down to the belly button at the American Music Awards
_ of the just-now-18-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Spears has it all _ a voice, a personality, a spark. She can
sing like a bird, dance like Solid Gold. She's a nice person from
every indication. She's also a legal Why advise her on how
to comport herself?
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that someone can come to realize and address
influences that commonly cause misery.
</P>
<P>
   She would be a wonderful role model to have except for clothes
that send many parents into conniption and chosen lyrics that would
make a peep-show barker blush.
</P>
<P>
   At this point someone asks the Charles Barkley question: Me a
role model? For better of worse, Britney Spears is. It could be for
better.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we want it or not, young people are watching, are
modeling.
</P>
<P>
   There's absolutely no reason to single out Spears as the root of
any evil. She's just a symptom of times that seem to take many
youngsters on a fast lane to disaster. Particularly one worries
about little girls growing up with the feeling that sexy is of the
essence.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's on television or in the checkout line, where curvy,
low-cut cover girls pose with chests that might as well advertise,
``This place for rent,'' little girls are bombarded by a particular
conditioning. We shudder to think how the little boys are being
conditioned, but we can guess.
</P>
<P>
   Children grow up soon enough. It can be tragic when they fall
under the command of physical maturity that arrives before
emotional maturity does. That's why teen pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases are such major problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even parents who exercise the utmost discretion find their
efforts thwarted repeatedly during so-called family movies, during
off-the-wall TV teasers and whatever visual cues await at the
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Just the way of the world? Maybe. But it doesn't mean we have to
drink it all in without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears didn't ask to be the focal point of such a
debate, but she's it. And she could be an ally for the better.
She's got the smarts, the talent and, we think, the good heart to
say, ``Whoops, we've been overselling sexiness,'' and make the
world a better place by example. Whatever she does, little girls
and boys will be watching.

 &HT;    Home intercoms make you want to scream
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We're all for improving family communications,
but sticking a home intercom system in every bedroom and paging the
family down for dinner wins our annoying gadget of the week award.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing traditional foot-stair movement in favor of calling
people in your own house is not only lazy, it's usually accompanied
by a squawking burst of feedback caused by having the intercom
units placed too closely together. For centuries, families have
been held together by one common denominator that crosses all
racial, cultural and generational lines: really loud yelling. If
you want the kids to come downstairs for dinner, bang on the wall
and yell their names at high decibels.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-home primal-scream therapy has kept us sane for this long.
Don't let technology take away your right to scream.

 &HT;    Bringing NASCAR home
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR games are for gearhead geeks; that's why Electronic
Arts' NASCAR Rumble ($50; www.ea.com; for the Playstation) was such
a welcome addition to our collection of driving games. This NASCAR
game injects a little humor and a whole lot of arcade action into
really cool game. You take on the role of a NASCAR star and guide
him to championships using cars, trucks and hot rods. Throughout
the game are cool powerups (including Nitro, Freeze and Sonic
Boom), hidden cars and hidden courses. The great thing about this
game is that EA has taken the serious racing game and added a bunch
of Wahoooo! to it.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Want some action with those pretty graphics? Activision's
Battlezone II: Combat Commander ($50; www.activision. com) delivers
the goods with gorgeous, other-worldly landscapes to cruise around
in and fight through with combat ships and on foot. But what about
the game play? Unlike 1998's Battlezone, the sequel eschews some of
the strategic elements to focus on the action, which isn't
necessarily a bad decision. The game plays very smoothly,
especially on faster machines. Unfortunately, the story isn't as
strong as the 1950s revisionism of the first game, and some of the
game missions are a little disappointing. But with a mix of
first-person shooting and spaceship combat, the game has some
fantastic moments and is worth a look.

 &HT;    A Furby fix sans fuzz
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nothing says ``annoying fur-based creature''
like Furby, the Gremlin-like creature that took toy stores by storm
last year. Now, with the Furby CD-ROM Game ($10 for Windows,
www.hasbrointer-active. com), you can have a Furby of your own
sitting right on your desktop, chattering all the live-long day.
Even with five game activities, a Furby-to-English dictionary and a
set of virtual pet tools, the CD-ROM can get repetitive very
quickly. But for $10, it's cheaper than the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   IT MIGHT BE YOUR TYPE
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of odd typing out a passage from ``All the President's
Men'' to wacky game-show music, but that's one of the exercises
offered in Typing Tutor ($30 for Windows and PowerMac;
www.simon-andschuster.com). In addition to various arrays of finger
workouts, there are eight games designed to make learning how to
type a more painless process. Bottom line: Diverting enough, but
between the activities are the same drills any typist-in-training
has had to go through.

 &HT;    Inquiring minds eagerly cater to that box on the desk
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was once a time when I was a computer hobbyist.
My first computer came as a box of parts to be assembled _ an old
Altair that was as worthless as my most shiftless relative. But the
idea wasn't to use the computer to do work. Instead, it was enough
that rows of red lights flashed on its panel and there were toggle
switches to throw.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, computers became more common and even
occasionally useful. By the time I was working as an advertising
copywriter, I wrote such masterpieces as ``Free Gift Inside'' using
a Macintosh computer. It was almost reliable and even encouraged my
laziness with cryptic error messages such as: ``Work session too
long, please quit.'' When that message appeared, I eagerly obeyed,
heading for the Mexican restaurant on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone has a computer. And most of us are eager to do
right by them. We subscribe to computer magazines, watch computer
shows on television, buy books that openly call us dummies.
</P>
<P>
   We seem almost desperate to be well thought of by that box on
our desk.
</P>
<P>
   I often get e-mails from readers who worry about the darnedest
things, agonizing over questions that frankly don't much matter as
far as the health of the computer. But since the questions do
matter greatly as far as the mental health of the readers, let's
look at some useless computer questions. I'll tell you my own
answer to these subjective questions, but keep the good news in
mind. It really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Should I turn off my computer or leave it on all the time? Turn
it on when you begin using it for the day and leave it on. When it
is time to go to sleep or leave for an extended period, turn it
off. It's true turning a computer on and off isn't good for a
computer, but the damage is slight and gradual. Turning it off when
you are away for extended periods protects the computer from big _
and much more harmful _ surges that happen when the power comes
back on.
</P>
<P>
   Which is better, an AMD or an Intel processor chip? I prefer the
Intel chip. But the AMD chip, especially its new Athlon, is an
excellent chip. It outperforms the Intel chip in many benchmark
tests. Both chips perform the same functions in much the same way.
But Intel is the standard, and most software is written
specifically for it. I doubt you'd ever have trouble with the
Athlon and _ if you prefer it _ that's fine. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Should I buy a Macintosh or a Windows PC? I use both and am
comforted by the fact neither is used to provide the computing
power for a heart/lung machine. If you use one or the other at
work, buy the same kind for use at home. If you don't use a
computer at work and don't have a personal preference, buy the kind
your most computer-savvy friend owns. That way, when you have
trouble _ and you will _ you'll know someone who can help.
</P>
<P>
   How powerful a computer do I need? Most computers for sale these
days are plenty powerful enough for word processing, e-mail and the
Web. If you play games, get the most powerful computer you can
afford. Games demand more from a computer than almost any other
task.
</P>
<P>
   Should I buy a brand-name computer, or is it OK to buy an
off-brand? The guts of a well-made off-brand computer (note the
well-made) are identical to the guts of a well-made brand-name
computer. What you are often paying for (besides the obvious markup
to pay for the advertising and marketing that created that brand
name) is the assurance of good technical support and customer
service. If you feel comfortable judging the merits of the parts
used in the off-brand computer and don't feel you need a lot of
hand-holding, it's safe to save the money. If you want hand-holding
and the assurance that comes with a brand name, buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Now you are free to worry about more important things, like how
you're going to pay for that new computer.

 &HT;    Storing photos on Web easy, even without a page
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that digital pictures are so common, many people
enjoy sharing these instant memories with friends.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a home page on the Web, that's easy to do. You can
either make the photos available to anyone who drops by your
personal page or place them in hidden directories so that just your
friends and family can see them.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you don't have a personal Web page, there are free
and easy ways to share your photos using the Web. There's a real
advantage to this over sending the photos as e-mail attachments
since _ if you want to send photos to nine friends _ that's a
lengthy process for you, and even to the friends who must take the
time to download them.
</P>
<P>
   By using the Web, you upload the photos one time, and your
friends can view the pictures when they have the time and the
inclination.
</P>
<P>
   One site that provides free storage place for photos to be
shared has a terrific name that says it all: The Digital Fridge.
You'll find the site at www.thedigitalfridge
</P>
<P>
   .com/. You can either post your pictures to areas called
``digital fridges,'' where anyone can see the photo, or put the
picture in a private area where a password is needed to view it.
You don't need fancy software to upload your pictures, nor do your
friends need it to view them. The community photo areas, by the
way, are divided into categories such as family, pets, sports and
work, as well as many others.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Zing _ Free Online Photo Albums, E-mail
Greeting Cards and Digital Picture Storage. It's located at
www.zing.com/. There are some similarities with the first site,
including ease of use and the fact the Web site automates the
process of uploading photos (an important service, since many
novice computer users freeze at the thought of uploading or
downloading information).
</P>
<P>
   But Zing takes things beyond the ability of sharing your photos
with friends over the Web. You also can order regular prints of
your digital images (at prices that are comparable with what you'd
pay locally) and create photo greeting cards, using stock images
that you find at the site or with your own pictures. You also have
the option, again, of buying printed versions of your cards.
</P>
<P>
   MyFamily.com is geared to, you guessed it, families. The site,
at www.myfamily.com, lets you store photos on a free Web page.
You'll get automated help in creating family photo albums (as well
as other services geared to families, including help creating a
family tree). This is another free site, and it's packed with
features, including the ability to share computer files as well as
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other sites reviewed here, the money comes from
advertising you'll see on the site and added services that are
offered for money. For instance, this site has a gift center where
you can order family-oriented gifts.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL MEMORIES AT WWW
</P>
<P>
   .globalmemories.com/ makes no bones about it: You pay to use
this site as a way to share your photos.
</P>
<P>
   But the reasoning _ no telling whether it's a good enough reason
or not _ is that you also can store videos here for sharing. Videos
take up a lot more space than still photographs.
</P>
<P>
   For $99 you can store five minutes of video and 10 photographs
for six months. (There are other price plans, too. Check out the
Web site for a complete list of prices).
</P>
<P>
   There also are related services offered, including video
production work.

 &HT;    Don't despair if you haven't seen the movie or read the book
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We are supposedly a nation too busy for anything but
work. Banks have become ATMs. Grocery stores stick prepared dinners
up front so workers can grab something quickly on the way home. Gas
stations let you pay at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice. But it's just toying with efficiency, really. If we
indeed are a harried nation, we should get serious about it.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, for example. Who has time to sit in the dark for two
hours? Why not get a nice summary so you can nod knowingly when the
latest trendy, independent film that sweeps the nation is talked
about at work?
</P>
<P>
   A Web site is here to help.
</P>
<P>
   www.rinkworks.com/movieaminute/ can trim the fat from your
leisure time; it will boil that latest plot down to a digestible
few sentences.
</P>
<P>
   As the promotional copy on the front of the Web site reads:
``Let's face it. There's a lot of movies out there and very little
time to watch them in. ... We've taken several classic and
contemporary movies and extracted the important stuff, cutting out
all the filler. (You'd be surprised how much filler there is
sometimes.) With our ultra-condensed versions of your favorite
films, you can experience whole movies in just one minute!''
</P>
<P>
   A movie such as last summer's ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a
horror flick about three people getting lost in the woods then
dying, was shot with a hand-held camera. It became infamous for
sending viewers speed-walking out of the theater, queasy from
motion sickness. The Web site reduces it to three tolerable
components:
</P>
<P>
   Actors: A twig! I'm scared!
</P>
<P>
   Audience: Get me some Dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   Actors: Thump.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   More interested in the classics? How about ``It's a Wonderful
Life?'' The 1946 Frank Capra film is a holiday season staple. But
with shopping and wrapping and party-going, who has time to let
Jimmy Stewart figure out the meaning of life? The Web site helps by
reducing the story to the important points:
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart: I'm useless.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Travers: Don't say that. The happiness of the entire
universe depends on your existence.
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart: Hooray!
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``When Harry Met Sally,'' a film about two people
who annoy each other while falling in friendship before finally
falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I hate you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: That's your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I think I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: I might love you.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I hate you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: Please don't.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: I love you, too.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   The idea works well for books, too. The folks at Rinkworks.com
reduce tedious and time-consuming classic literature and bedtime
stories to something to be enjoyed in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cat in the Hat,'' a Dr. Seuss classic about two kids and a
mischievous cat, has lots of rhyming words that can trip up a
reader. Thanks to the Web site, the essential elements are
presented rhyme-free.
ly and Me: We're bored.
</P>
<P>
   (The Cat in the Hat shows up and wrecks the entire house. He
cleans it up just before Mom gets home.)
</P>
<P>
   Sally and Me: Let us never speak of boredom again.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   Adult stories fit the format as well. Already a short book,
Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' a story about an
old man's struggle to haul in a big fish, is reduced to a three
tight, symbolism-free sentences: An old man catches a fish that's
too big for his boat. The fish gets eaten by sharks. Then he goes
home and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Or take ``Moby Dick,'' another story of one man's (Captain Ahab)
obsession with a large fish. It's required reading for most
schoolkids. But with ESPN and MTV and Ricki Lake and Sega, who has
time?
</P>
<P>
   Ishmael: Call me Ishmael.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahab: Crew, we will seek the white whale and kill it,
because I am insane.
</P>
<P>
   Crew: Alas, your destructive obsession will be our undoing.
</P>
<P>
   (They almost find the white whale. Then they almost find the
white whale. Then they find it.)
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahab: I stab at thee. I stab at thee.
</P>
<P>
   (Everybody dies except Ishmael, although this is no surprise,
because it was foreshadowed CONTINUALLY from the BEGINNING.)
</P>
<P>
   The end.

 &HT;    WinZip a big help in extracting files
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An e-mail of the sort I just love to get came last
week. To begin with, it asked a question I could answer, and those
are always the best kinds of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, it came from a 72-year-old lady working with her first
computer, and on the Internet, no less.
</P>
<P>
   My correspondent was having trouble extracting zipped files she
had downloaded from the Internet. Her downloads were winding up on
her desktop, and so were her extracted files. I hope my advice
helped, and it struck me others might be able to make use of it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't too long ago I was still using good old PKZIP and its
brethren for archiving and unarchiving files. Now the market is
flooded with programs operating under license from that venerable
utility, making it Windows-friendly and much more user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these is WinZip, and in fact my correspondent was
using it. I don't know which version she is using, but I'm using
the latest, which is Version 8.
</P>
<P>
   The other utility I use in this process is Windows Explorer (not
Internet Explorer), which is simply the housekeeping program that
comes with Windows 95 and 98. It's on your Start/Programs menu.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea, if you're going to be downloading programs
from the Internet, to use Windows Explorer to make a directory in
which to store them. It's also a good idea, by the way, to have
Norton Anti-Virus or some similar program checking them as they
come in.
</P>
<P>
   When you choose to download something from the Web, your browser
will present a dialog box asking you where to store it. Store it,
of course, in the directory you made for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is downloaded, start up Windows Explorer again. Find
your download directory on the left side of the split screen and
double-click on it. This will present a list of files on the right
side.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the zipped file you wish to unzip and double-click on it.
</P>
<P>
   If WinZip is installed, this will start it. It will present a
list of the files in the archive. If you wish to extract all of
them, simply click on the Actions menu and select Extract. You'll
get a dialog box asking where you want to put the extracted files.
You can have them sent to some other directory if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to extract all of them, just highlight the
ones you want before pulling down the Actions menu and then change
the order from All Files to Selected Files.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have WinZip, you can go to www.winzip.com and
download Version 7 or the beta Version 8. It's shareware, so if you
like it send in your $29. I assure you it's well worth the money.

 &HT;    Home intercoms make you want to scream
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We're all for improving family communications,
but sticking a home intercom system in every bedroom and paging the
family down for dinner wins our annoying gadget of the week award.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing traditional foot-stair movement in favor of calling
people in your own house is not only lazy, it's usually accompanied
by a squawking burst of feedback caused by having the intercom
units placed too closely together. For centuries, families have
been held together by one common denominator that crosses all
racial, cultural and generational lines: really loud yelling. If
you want the kids to come downstairs for dinner, bang on the wall
and yell their names at high decibels.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-home primal-scream therapy has kept us sane for this long.
Don't let technology take away your right to scream.

 &HT;    Bringing NASCAR home
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR games are for gearhead geeks; that's why Electronic
Arts' NASCAR Rumble ($50; www.ea.com; for the Playstation) was such
a welcome addition to our collection of driving games. This NASCAR
game injects a little humor and a whole lot of arcade action into
really cool game. You take on the role of a NASCAR star and guide
him to championships using cars, trucks and hot rods. Throughout
the game are cool powerups (including Nitro, Freeze and Sonic
Boom), hidden cars and hidden courses. The great thing about this
game is that EA has taken the serious racing game and added a bunch
of Wahoooo! to it.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Want some action with those pretty graphics? Activision's
Battlezone II: Combat Commander ($50; www.activision. com) delivers
the goods with gorgeous, other-worldly landscapes to cruise around
in and fight through with combat ships and on foot. But what about
the game play? Unlike 1998's Battlezone, the sequel eschews some of
the strategic elements to focus on the action, which isn't
necessarily a bad decision. The game plays very smoothly,
especially on faster machines. Unfortunately, the story isn't as
strong as the 1950s revisionism of the first game, and some of the
game missions are a little disappointing. But with a mix of
first-person shooting and spaceship combat, the game has some
fantastic moments and is worth a look.

 &HT;    A Furby fix sans fuzz
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nothing says ``annoying fur-based creature''
like Furby, the Gremlin-like creature that took toy stores by storm
last year. Now, with the Furby CD-ROM Game ($10 for Windows,
www.hasbrointer-active. com), you can have a Furby of your own
sitting right on your desktop, chattering all the live-long day.
Even with five game activities, a Furby-to-English dictionary and a
set of virtual pet tools, the CD-ROM can get repetitive very
quickly. But for $10, it's cheaper than the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   IT MIGHT BE YOUR TYPE
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of odd typing out a passage from ``All the President's
Men'' to wacky game-show music, but that's one of the exercises
offered in Typing Tutor ($30 for Windows and PowerMac;
www.simon-andschuster.com). In addition to various arrays of finger
workouts, there are eight games designed to make learning how to
type a more painless process. Bottom line: Diverting enough, but
between the activities are the same drills any typist-in-training
has had to go through.

 &HT;    Inquiring minds eagerly cater to that box on the desk
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was once a time when I was a computer hobbyist.
My first computer came as a box of parts to be assembled _ an old
Altair that was as worthless as my most shiftless relative. But the
idea wasn't to use the computer to do work. Instead, it was enough
that rows of red lights flashed on its panel and there were toggle
switches to throw.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, computers became more common and even
occasionally useful. By the time I was working as an advertising
copywriter, I wrote such masterpieces as ``Free Gift Inside'' using
a Macintosh computer. It was almost reliable and even encouraged my
laziness with cryptic error messages such as: ``Work session too
long, please quit.'' When that message appeared, I eagerly obeyed,
heading for the Mexican restaurant on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone has a computer. And most of us are eager to do
right by them. We subscribe to computer magazines, watch computer
shows on television, buy books that openly call us dummies.
</P>
<P>
   We seem almost desperate to be well thought of by that box on
our desk.
</P>
<P>
   I often get e-mails from readers who worry about the darnedest
things, agonizing over questions that frankly don't much matter as
far as the health of the computer. But since the questions do
matter greatly as far as the mental health of the readers, let's
look at some useless computer questions. I'll tell you my own
answer to these subjective questions, but keep the good news in
mind. It really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Should I turn off my computer or leave it on all the time? Turn
it on when you begin using it for the day and leave it on. When it
is time to go to sleep or leave for an extended period, turn it
off. It's true turning a computer on and off isn't good for a
computer, but the damage is slight and gradual. Turning it off when
you are away for extended periods protects the computer from big _
and much more harmful _ surges that happen when the power comes
back on.
</P>
<P>
   Which is better, an AMD or an Intel processor chip? I prefer the
Intel chip. But the AMD chip, especially its new Athlon, is an
excellent chip. It outperforms the Intel chip in many benchmark
tests. Both chips perform the same functions in much the same way.
But Intel is the standard, and most software is written
specifically for it. I doubt you'd ever have trouble with the
Athlon and _ if you prefer it _ that's fine. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Should I buy a Macintosh or a Windows PC? I use both and am
comforted by the fact neither is used to provide the computing
power for a heart/lung machine. If you use one or the other at
work, buy the same kind for use at home. If you don't use a
computer at work and don't have a personal preference, buy the kind
your most computer-savvy friend owns. That way, when you have
trouble _ and you will _ you'll know someone who can help.
</P>
<P>
   How powerful a computer do I need? Most computers for sale these
days are plenty powerful enough for word processing, e-mail and the
Web. If you play games, get the most powerful computer you can
afford. Games demand more from a computer than almost any other
task.
</P>
<P>
   Should I buy a brand-name computer, or is it OK to buy an
off-brand? The guts of a well-made off-brand computer (note the
well-made) are identical to the guts of a well-made brand-name
computer. What you are often paying for (besides the obvious markup
to pay for the advertising and marketing that created that brand
name) is the assurance of good technical support and customer
service. If you feel comfortable judging the merits of the parts
used in the off-brand computer and don't feel you need a lot of
hand-holding, it's safe to save the money. If you want hand-holding
and the assurance that comes with a brand name, buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Now you are free to worry about more important things, like how
you're going to pay for that new computer.

 &HT;    Storing photos on Web easy, even without a page
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that digital pictures are so common, many people
enjoy sharing these instant memories with friends.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a home page on the Web, that's easy to do. You can
either make the photos available to anyone who drops by your
personal page or place them in hidden directories so that just your
friends and family can see them.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you don't have a personal Web page, there are free
and easy ways to share your photos using the Web. There's a real
advantage to this over sending the photos as e-mail attachments
since _ if you want to send photos to nine friends _ that's a
lengthy process for you, and even to the friends who must take the
time to download them.
</P>
<P>
   By using the Web, you upload the photos one time, and your
friends can view the pictures when they have the time and the
inclination.
</P>
<P>
   One site that provides free storage place for photos to be
shared has a terrific name that says it all: The Digital Fridge.
You'll find the site at www.thedigitalfridge
</P>
<P>
   .com/. You can either post your pictures to areas called
``digital fridges,'' where anyone can see the photo, or put the
picture in a private area where a password is needed to view it.
You don't need fancy software to upload your pictures, nor do your
friends need it to view them. The community photo areas, by the
way, are divided into categories such as family, pets, sports and
work, as well as many others.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Zing _ Free Online Photo Albums, E-mail
Greeting Cards and Digital Picture Storage. It's located at
www.zing.com/. There are some similarities with the first site,
including ease of use and the fact the Web site automates the
process of uploading photos (an important service, since many
novice computer users freeze at the thought of uploading or
downloading information).
</P>
<P>
   But Zing takes things beyond the ability of sharing your photos
with friends over the Web. You also can order regular prints of
your digital images (at prices that are comparable with what you'd
pay locally) and create photo greeting cards, using stock images
that you find at the site or with your own pictures. You also have
the option, again, of buying printed versions of your cards.
</P>
<P>
   MyFamily.com is geared to, you guessed it, families. The site,
at www.myfamily.com, lets you store photos on a free Web page.
You'll get automated help in creating family photo albums (as well
as other services geared to families, including help creating a
family tree). This is another free site, and it's packed with
features, including the ability to share computer files as well as
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other sites reviewed here, the money comes from
advertising you'll see on the site and added services that are
offered for money. For instance, this site has a gift center where
you can order family-oriented gifts.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL MEMORIES AT WWW
</P>
<P>
   .globalmemories.com/ makes no bones about it: You pay to use
this site as a way to share your photos.
</P>
<P>
   But the reasoning _ no telling whether it's a good enough reason
or not _ is that you also can store videos here for sharing. Videos
take up a lot more space than still photographs.
</P>
<P>
   For $99 you can store five minutes of video and 10 photographs
for six months. (There are other price plans, too. Check out the
Web site for a complete list of prices).
</P>
<P>
   There also are related services offered, including video
production work.

 &HT;    What a girl wants: Grammys
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The genie in Christina Aguilera's bottle must have amnesia.
Instead of granting the standard three wishes, it provided the
19-year-old pop singer with a lifetime of achievements.
</P>
<P>
   First, in June of 1998 the former ``New Mickey Mouse Club''
member took a bow on the ``Mulan'' soundtrack, performing
``Reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to a record deal and the 1999 summer release of her
album ``Christina Aguilera.'' It has sold more than 5 million
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Aguilera could take home two Grammy Awards. She's up
for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Recording
for the single ``Genie in a Bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   On her way to a concert in Washington, D.C.,
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera found a moment to talk:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would a Grammy Award just be more icing on an incredible year
for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: So many of my dreams have come true already, and I am so
appreciative. Yes! Yes! A Grammy would be a great thing. But in so
many ways, I already feel like I've won.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you feel at the American Music Awards when you sang
in front of your vocal inspiration, Mariah Carey?
</P>
<P>
   A: She had a seat in the front row, but she wasn't there when I
performed. And, you know, I'm glad you said ``vocal inspiration''
because she is that. But I want people to see me, not her. That
night I was so focused on people hearing what I could do live. I
don't want to be just another teen act.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the sexiness of so many teen acts out
now?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's kind of all in how people take it. Like, I know what I
meant by ``rub me the right way'' (in ``Genie in a Bottle'') _
treat me right _ but people took it to mean something else. As long
as my intentions are good, that's my concern.

 &HT;    And the Oscar Jr. goes to...
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise and Bruce Willis. Hollywood's
hottest leading man is a 13 1/2-inch tall, gold-plated guy named
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   He's an Academy Award. Since 1927, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences _ a group of more than 6,000 movie industry
people _ has given him to the year's best movies, actors and
actresses, among other categories. ``Oscar'' is actually his
nickname. It was given by Bette Davis, one of the most popular
stars in the history of movies. Supposedly, she thought the skinny,
bald statue looked like her husband!
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars almost always go to grown-up actors and serious,
grown-up movies. But this year might be different _ a kid is in the
running to win an award! He's 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment. He's
nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category for his part in
``The Sixth Sense,'' a very scary movie. (Maybe some of our older
readers saw it _ it's rated PG-13.)
</P>
<P>
   If you were giving out Oscars, what would be your choices? Would
``Stuart Little'' be best movie? Would you give a best actor Oscar
to Jake Lloyd, who played Anakin Skywalker in ``Star Wars: Episode
1 _ The Phantom Menace?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth year we've asked Georgia kids to award
``Oscar Juniors'' to the movies they liked the most. This year,
we've thought up a few new categories: Who was the coolest cartoon
hero of 1999? What was the scariest scene? Who was the silliest
grown-up?
</P>
<P>
   We've included a list of nominations here. It's easy to vote _
you can even do it over the phone or on your computer. Just call
404-222-2062 and follow the instructions. Or you can log on to
www.ajc.com and follow the directions there. You can even mark your
choices on this page and mail it to us at Oscar Jrs., P.O. Box
4689, Atlanta, GA 30302. The deadline to vote is 5 p.m. Feb. 28.
We'll award the Oscar Juniors on March 28.

 &HT;    From slave to entrepreneur _ Atlanta's first black millionaire
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alonzo Herndon is one of the greatest success stories
in the history of Atlanta. He started life as a slave, but grew up
to become a wealthy businessman _ the city's first African-American
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Herndon was born in 1858 on a plantation near Social Circle, 40
miles east of Atlanta. The Civil War soon broke out and all the
slaves were freed. Herndon's mother decided to stay in the area and
keep doing farm work. Her son didn't like farm work. He wanted more
out of life.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 20, Herndon left home with $11 in his pocket and
started walking toward Atlanta. ``I knew my mother would never
consent to my leaving the farm,'' he later wrote, ``so I took my
little hand trunk on my shoulder and stole silently away in the
darkness of night.''
</P>
<P>
   Herndon found a job as a barber's apprentice and learned how to
cut hair. He worked in several shops around downtown Atlanta.
Customers liked him and followed him wherever he took his clippers.
In 1902, he opened his own establishment on Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   Herndon's was one of the biggest and fanciest barbershops in the
United States. There were 25 chairs sitting atop marble floors and
mirrors down both walls. You could get a shave, a shower and a
massage. The owner's name was etched in gold letters above the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Herndon used his earnings to launch a new company that sold
insurance to African-Americans. He built the Atlanta Life Insurance
Co. into one of the largest black-owned businesses in the South. He
became a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   The Herndon family erected a mansion near what is now the
Atlanta University Center and filled it with fine furniture. They
hosted music and drama recitals. They traveled to Europe and
brought back beautiful art. At a time when many white people
believed their race was superior, the Herndons were living proof
that people of color could be as cultured as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Herndon died in 1927, but his legacy lives on. He gave
much of his fortune to the Herndon Foundation, an organization that
grants money to good causes. His company, Atlanta Life, remains a
thriving business. Herndon Stadium, the Herndon Homes housing
project and Herndon Elementary are all named for him.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to learn about Alonzo Herndon is the Herndon Home
museum, near the Atlanta University Center. Herndon and his wife,
Adrienne, a teacher at the university, designed and built the house
in 1910. Their only child, Norris, lived there until his death in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the mural paintings on the living room walls. They
depict Herndon's life, starting with a scene of young Alonzo
standing in a field with a hoe in his hand. Herndon was proud of
where he came from, proud of his success, proud of his race.

 &HT;    Don't despair if you haven't seen the movie or read the book
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We are supposedly a nation too busy for anything but
work. Banks have become ATMs. Grocery stores stick prepared dinners
up front so workers can grab something quickly on the way home. Gas
stations let you pay at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice. But it's just toying with efficiency, really. If we
indeed are a harried nation, we should get serious about it.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, for example. Who has time to sit in the dark for two
hours? Why not get a nice summary so you can nod knowingly when the
latest trendy, independent film that sweeps the nation is talked
about at work?
</P>
<P>
   A Web site is here to help.
</P>
<P>
   www.rinkworks.com/movieaminute/ can trim the fat from your
leisure time; it will boil that latest plot down to a digestible
few sentences.
</P>
<P>
   As the promotional copy on the front of the Web site reads:
``Let's face it. There's a lot of movies out there and very little
time to watch them in. ... We've taken several classic and
contemporary movies and extracted the important stuff, cutting out
all the filler. (You'd be surprised how much filler there is
sometimes.) With our ultra-condensed versions of your favorite
films, you can experience whole movies in just one minute!''
</P>
<P>
   A movie such as last summer's ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a
horror flick about three people getting lost in the woods then
dying, was shot with a hand-held camera. It became infamous for
sending viewers speed-walking out of the theater, queasy from
motion sickness. The Web site reduces it to three tolerable
components:
</P>
<P>
   Actors: A twig! I'm scared!
</P>
<P>
   Audience: Get me some Dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   Actors: Thump.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   More interested in the classics? How about ``It's a Wonderful
Life?'' The 1946 Frank Capra film is a holiday season staple. But
with shopping and wrapping and party-going, who has time to let
Jimmy Stewart figure out the meaning of life? The Web site helps by
reducing the story to the important points:
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart: I'm useless.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Travers: Don't say that. The happiness of the entire
universe depends on your existence.
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart: Hooray!
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``When Harry Met Sally,'' a film about two people
who annoy each other while falling in friendship before finally
falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I hate you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: That's your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I think I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: I might love you.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I hate you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: Please don't.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: I love you, too.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   The idea works well for books, too. The folks at Rinkworks.com
reduce tedious and time-consuming classic literature and bedtime
stories to something to be enjoyed in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cat in the Hat,'' a Dr. Seuss classic about two kids and a
mischievous cat, has lots of rhyming words that can trip up a
reader. Thanks to the Web site, the essential elements are
presented rhyme-free.
</P>
<P>
   Sally and Me: We're bored.
</P>
<P>
   (The Cat in the Hat shows up and wrecks the entire house. He
cleans it up just before Mom gets home.)
</P>
<P>
   Sally and Me: Let us never speak of boredom again.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   Adult stories fit the format as well. Already a short book,
Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' a story about an
old man's struggle to haul in a big fish, is reduced to a three
tight, symbolism-free sentences: An old man catches a fish that's
too big for his boat. The fish gets eaten by sharks. Then he goes
home and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Or take ``Moby Dick,'' another story of one man's (Captain Ahab)
obsession with a large fish. It's required reading for most
schoolkids. But with ESPN and MTV and Ricki Lake and Sega, who has
time?
</P>
<P>
   Ishmael: Call me Ishmael.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahab: Crew, we will seek the white whale and kill it,
because I am insane.
</P>
<P>
   Crew: Alas, your destructive obsession will be our undoing.
</P>
<P>
   (They almost find the white whale. Then they almost find the
white whale. Then they find it.)
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahab: I stab at thee. I stab at thee.
</P>
<P>
   (Everybody dies except Ishmael, although this is no surprise,
because it was foreshadowed CONTINUALLY from the BEGINNING.)
</P>
<P>
   The end.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceAUSTIN, Texas _
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Charles Schulz's family?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jane Bayles
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Schulz's family in care of United Features
Syndicate, 200 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y. 10016
</P>
<P>
   Q: I used to buy extra-long double bed sheets from the Sears
catalog, but that is discontinued. I really need to find some place
to buy these _ mine are thin as paper. _ J. Linton
</P>
<P>
   A: Order extra-long double sheets from Tall Paul's Tall Mall
(OK, he's into rhyme) at (802) 223-4915. Owner Paul Hartmann is
6-foot-11 himself. The Vermont retailer also stocks extra-long king
or queen sheets as well as Adirondack chairs with deep seats and
higher backs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This past week I saw a novelty dispenser I wish to obtain.
Dilbert is sitting at a computer console, tie askew and all.M&AMP;M
candies are loaded into the rear of the screen. It appeared that as
the mouse was touched, M&AMP;Ms were dispensed. Can you help? _ Sammy
H. Claiborne
</P>
<P>
   A: The Dilbert M&AMP;M dispenser ($14.99 plus shipping and handling
and tax) is available online at www.umstore.com or by phone at
(888) 221-3397 (item number 12058). Chocolate and a smile will help
you through any workday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We watched the ``MacGyver'' series, also the ``Equalizer''
series, now discontinued. May we please have the ages of both men,
and what they are doing now? Any other info on both men would be
appreciated! _Betty Taylor
</P>
<P>
   A: Good taste in television heroes. Richard Dean Anderson, Angus
MacGyver from 1985-1992, just turned 50. He performed as a mime,
played in bands and played hockey before he turned to acting.
Anderson has a daughter with current girlfriend, Apryl Prose. His
most recent project was 1997's ``Stargate SG-1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Equalizer,'' played by Edward Woodward (not his real name
or his name in the series), was born in Croydon, Surrey, England,
and is rapidly approaching 70. (Great accent!) His most recent
project was starring in television's ``C15: The New Professionals''
(1998). He has three children, Tim, Pete and Sarah, with his wife,
Michele Dotrice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a wooden cabinet that contains books, encyclopedias,
maps, photos and a lot of paper. Every time I open it, I smell
mildew. How can I get rid of the mold and smell without having to
discard the books? _ Olga Salas
</P>
<P>
   A: Wood cabinets are not the best place to store such items.
Take all the books and papers out and wipe the cabinet down with a
weak bleach solution (nine parts water, one part bleach). The books
need circulating air to prevent mold and mildew. Take the books
outside and wipe them off with a soft cloth or vacuum them. When
the cabinet is dry, reshelve the books and see if you have
forestalled the mildew. If not, consider removing the cabinet
doors. That's the advice of Christine Wiseman at SoliNET,
Southeastern Library Network. Need to read more? Get a free copy of
``Attack of the Giant Spore'' from Solinet by calling (800)
999-8558 or write 1438 W. Peachtree Road, Suite 200, Atlanta, Ga.
30309.
</P>
<P>
   One more paper storage tip: Place ``micro chamber'' paper from
Conservation Resources International at (800) 634-6932 between maps
and so on to protect paper from moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you please settle something for me and hubby? How do
the lawyer TV shows work? When someone loses a lawsuit, does the
person who loses pay or does the show pay? Just curious since there
are so many on now, and I watch them all.
</P>
<P>
   _Pat D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Two of the entertaining judgment shows (``Judge Judy'' and
``Judge Joe Brown'') confirmed the judgment amount is paid by the
show. A spokesperson for Brown's show says both parties receive a
$100 fee for being on the show in addition to travel expenses. Not
a bad deal _ if you don't mind airing a grievance in front of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last time my husband and I did not get in the census. How do
I get my name entered into the census along with my husband and any
other family members? _Mary Anderson
</P>
<P>
   A: Census day is April 1. According to officials, wait until
your neighbors receive forms in mid-March (everyone should receive
bar-coded census forms). As a last resort, ``be counted'' sites
will be set up where you can pick up blank forms (locations to be
announced).
</P>
<P>
   UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   Need motivation to not clean a room? Ace Hardware's America's
Messiest Room Contest. Grand prize? A room makeover by a
professional and organizing supplies worth up to $5,000 and a
$5,000 Ace gift certificate. Your messy room could catch the eye of
disheveled contest judge and broadcaster John Madden. Send a messy
room photo (child or adult bedroom, garage, kitchen, basement,
attic, home office, workroom, playroom, closet or dorm room) and a
brief (25 words maximum) explanation of how getting the room
organized will help in dealing with the new millennium. Entries
must be postmarked by than Feb. 29 and mailed to America's Messiest
Room Contest, 625 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 2400, Chicago, Ill.
60611. Check www.acehardware.com for details.
</P>
<P>
   4 DIGITS AREN'T ENOUGH ZIP FOR YOUR MAIL
</P>
<P>
   Q: How specific an area is defined by the last four digits in a
nine-digit ZIP code? If the digits of a residential address were
added to the first nine, would this be sufficient for use as an
address or a return address? Think of all the time this would save
to come up with questions like this for you! _John Nemetz
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope. Barbara Pokorny, U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman, notes
the ``plus 4'' designation is not necessarily unique to your
residence. It could be one side of a street or a bank of mail
boxes. Several residences in your area may share this code.
Remember, a carrier reads the address and the ZIP code. ``Plus 4''
along with your house number would not provide enough information
to deliver or return your mail.

(OK, he's into rhyme) at (802) 223-4915. Owner Paul Hartmann is
6-foot-11 himself. The Vermont retailer also stocks extra-long king
or queen sheets as well as Adirondack chairs with deep seats and
higher backs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This past week I saw a novelty dispenser I wish to obtain.
Dilbert is sitting at a computer console, tie askew and all.M&AMP;M
candies are loaded into the rear of the screen. It appeared that as
the mouse was touched, M&AMP;Ms were dispensed. Can you help? _ Sammy
H. Claiborne
</P>
<P>
   A: The Dilbert M&AMP;M dispenser ($14.99 plus shipping and handling
and tax) is available online at www.umstore.com or by phone at
(888) 221-3397 (item number 12058). Chocolate and a smile will help
you through any workday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We watched the ``MacGyver'' series, also the ``Equalizer''
series, now discontinued. May we please have the ages of both men,
and what they are doing now? Any other info on both men would be
appreciated! _Betty Taylor
</P>
<P>
   A: Good taste in television heroes. Richard Dean Anderson, Angus
MacGyver from 1985-1992, just turned 50. He performed as a mime,
played in bands and played hockey before he turned to acting.
Anderson has a daughter with current girlfriend, Apryl Prose. His
most recent project was 1997's ``Stargate SG-1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Equalizer,'' played by Edward Woodward (not his real name
or his name in the series), was born in Croydon, Surrey, England,
and is rapidly approaching 70. (Great accent!) His most recent
project was starring in television's ``C15: The New Professionals''
(1998). He has three children, Tim, Pete and Sarah, with his wife,
Michele Dotrice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a wooden cabinet that contains books, encyclopedias,
maps, photos and a lot of paper. Every time I open it, I smell
mildew. How can I get rid of the mold and smell without having to
discard the books? _ Olga Salas
</P>
<P>
   A: Wood cabinets are not the best place to store such items.
Take all the books and papers out and wipe the cabinet down with a
weak bleach solution (nine parts water, one part bleach). The books
need circulating air to prevent mold and mildew. Take the books
outside and wipe them off with a soft cloth or vacuum them. When
the cabinet is dry, reshelve the books and see if you have
forestalled the mildew. If not, consider removing the cabinet
doors. That's the advice of Christine Wiseman at SoliNET,
Southeastern Library Network. Need to read more? Get a free copy of
``Attack of the Giant Spore'' from Solinet by calling (800)
999-8558 or write 1438 W. Peachtree Road, Suite 200, Atlanta, Ga.
30309.
</P>
<P>
   One more paper storage tip: Place ``micro chamber'' paper from
Conservation Resources International at (800) 634-6932 between maps
and so on to protect paper from moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you please settle something for me and hubby? How do
the lawyer TV shows work? When someone loses a lawsuit, does the
person who loses pay or does the show pay? Just curious since there
are so many on now, and I watch them all.
</P>
<P>
   _Pat D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Two of the entertaining judgment shows (``Judge Judy'' and
``Judge Joe Brown'') confirmed the judgment amount is paid by the
show. A spokesperson for Brown's show says both parties receive a
$100 fee for being on the show in addition to travel expenses. Not
a bad deal _ if you don't mind airing a grievance in front of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last time my husband and I did not get in the census. How do
I get my name entered into the census along with my husband and any
other family members? _Mary Anderson
</P>
<P>
   A: Census day is April 1. According to officials, wait until
your neighbors receive forms in mid-March (everyone should receive
bar-coded census forms). As a last resort, ``be counted'' sites
will be set up where you can pick up blank forms (locations to be
announced).
</P>
<P>
   UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   Need motivation to not clean a room? Ace Hardware's America's
Messiest Room Contest. Grand prize? A room makeover by a
professional and organizing supplies worth up to $5,000 and a
$5,000 Ace gift certificate. Your messy room could catch the eye of
disheveled contest judge and broadcaster John Madden. Send a messy
room photo (child or adult bedroom, garage, kitchen, basement,
attic, home office, workroom, playroom, closet or dorm room) and a
brief (25 words maximum) explanation of how getting the room
organized will help in dealing with the new millennium. Entries
must be postmarked by than Feb. 29 and mailed to America's Messiest
Room Contest, 625 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 2400, Chicago, Ill.
60611. Check www.acehardware.com for details.
</P>
<P>
   4 DIGITS AREN'T ENOUGH ZIP FOR YOUR MAIL
</P>
<P>
   Q: How specific an area is defined by the last four digits in a
nine-digit ZIP code? If the digits of a residential address were
added to the first nine, would this be sufficient for use as an
address or a return address? Think of all the time this would save
to come up with questions like this for you! _John Nemetz
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope. Barbara Pokorny, U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman, notes
the ``plus 4'' designation is not necessarily unique to your
residence. It could be one side of a street or a bank of mail
boxes. Several residences in your area may share this code.
Remember, a carrier reads the address and the ZIP code. ``Plus 4''
along with your house number would not provide enough information
to deliver or return your mail.

A CAR BUFF SIZES UP THE 2000 MODELS, Z TO A 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens every February.
</P>
<P>
   The roads are sloppy, the cars are filthy.
</P>
<P>
   You brush against a fender in the parking lot and your coat is
covered with road grime.
</P>
<P>
   You open your car's door, cringe at the accumulated salt and
sand on the mats, and wonder if you'll ever get it truly clean when
spring finally arrives.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the New Car Genie sneaks out of some crevice in your
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't hurt just to look. You don't have to buy a new car.
Maybe you'll walk through the showrooms, see all the shiny new cars
and walk back outside and this car will look like a carriage
instead of a pumpkin,'' says the little voice.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It hits me every year at this time. Do I need a new car? Not
really. I'm driving a 1997 model that runs well, performs well, has
low mileage and hasn't had to be repaired once other than regularly
scheduled maintenance. So why look?
</P>
<P>
   Because that's me.
</P>
<P>
   My kids are grown up. I don't have extravagant tastes. And I
really enjoy driving a nice car. And looking is fun. If that makes
me a voyeur of Voyagers, so be it. It doesn't cost a whole lot and
provides me with days of entertainment. From A (as-in-Acura) to V
(as-in-Volvo), you show me the dealership, and there's something
inside I'd like to see and drive. What follows is by no means a
list of the best-selling or most popular cars, just the one model
I'd look at first at each dealership.
</P>
<P>
   We could take this from the top, but I was in the military and
had a drill sergeant who always ran the alphabet in reverse, so,
even though it isn't Veterans Day, let's work backwards in his
memory.
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO _ Our eyes are on the 40 series. The S (sedan) and V
(wagon) models are ``entry-level'' Volvos. Our auto friends from
Sweden see what Camry and Accord have done and want a piece of that
mid-price marketplace. Of course, summer is coming (eventually), so
we'll take a peek at the C70 convertible on our way out.
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN _ The Beetle is hard to overlook, as is the
Cabriolet. But the well-optioned Passat, with a V6 and great
handling, is what we'll checkout. It might be the one to put some
sizzle back in your driving.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA _ You already know about the Camry, Avalon, Tundra and
RAV4, don't you? This month, we want to see the new Celica. It's
not a Supra, but this car looks promising. Besides, I have to see
if there's enough headroom to sit in it with a sunroof. And, are
you ready for a six-speed manual transmission?
</P>
<P>
   SUZUKI _ A much-begrimed Grand Vitara SUV with a V6 marched me
up two hills covered by 6 inches of unplowed snow and ice to my
house in the middle of January's biggest storm. It isn't generally
rated at the top of its class, but it earned a place in my heart.
I'd like to look at one that's showroom clean.
</P>
<P>
   SUBARU _ One of my favorite stops. On this trip, we want to
check out the Outback Limited Sedan. It looks like a nice mid-sized
sedan, but under the sheet metal is the all-wheel drive that will
take you any place you reasonably want to go. A vastly
underappreciated vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   SATURN _ We owe it to ourselves to check out the new mid-size L
series. The question is simple: Do you get enough car for what you
save in price? The answer may be yes.
</P>
<P>
   SAAB _ Gotta see the hot rods. The 9-3 Viggen and the 9-5 Aero.
You want torque? They've got torque.
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC _ A friend-of-a-friend came home with a new Bonneville
SSEI. It's big, a bit pricey, but I wanted to beg for the keys.
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE _ I get the shakes every time I walk into a store where
there isn't anything for sale under $40,000. But isn't that Boxster
about the neatest thing you see on the road?
</P>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH _ Daniels LeSaffre Motors in Melrose always was a
regular stop. Plymouth's nameplate is on the way out, but we'll
still drop in to see the Chryslers.
</P>
<P>
   OLDSMOBILE _ The marque always has stood for class, and we're
going to check out the entry-level Alero. On the road, they never
fail to catch my eye. This is a chance to see one up close. The
Aurora has always been a favorite, but a new design is coming by
summer.
</P>
<P>
   NISSAN _ How can a company that makes such great cars (and which
sell so well in New England) have such financial problems
elsewhere? The new Maxima is worth a look, but we're going to check
out the updated Altima and see if it's a hidden jewel.
</P>
<P>
   MITSUBISHI _ Get me to an Eclipse. It's no longer just a kids'
car. The turbo will be missed, but this is a great design with a
solid V6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   MERCURY _ Let's test-drive a no-longer-ovalized Sable. I
apparently was one of the few who wasn't bothered by the
Taurus/Sable Oval Era. The Sable's adjustable pedals are a bit of
future shock.
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES _ The sticker shakes are back. So let's go right to the
top and check out the $85,000 CL500. The absolute state of the art,
top of the line. Besides, if you grip the wheel tightly enough, the
shakes go away.
</P>
<P>
   MAZDA _ I want to revisit the Protege ES, one of those cars that
always has felt ``right.'' A great blend of price, economy, and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   LINCOLN _ A Lincoln with a 5-speed manual? This I've got to see.
</P>
<P>
   LEXUS _ Risking another case of the shakes, I've always wanted
to drive a GS 300 or GS 400.
</P>
<P>
   LAND ROVER _ What the heck. Let's drive the Range Rover _ at
nearly $60,000, it's as unique in its own way as a Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   KIA _ The Sportage is a low-budget SUV with sensational looks
covering an economy vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   JEEP _ A good time to revisit the Cherokee, in many ways the
father of all SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUAR _ I'm almost afraid to stop here (Mrs. G loves Jags). But
the new S-type is to love.
</P>
<P>
   IZUZU _ Remember those Amigo ads last year? They left a lasting
impression.
</P>
<P>
   INFINITI _ The new I30 is on my list for its looks. It probably
will stay there for its performance.
</P>
<P>
   HYUNDAI _ A must stop. The funky Tiburon is a low-cost sports
car. I love it, even though it's built for short- to medium-sized
folks (and I don't qualify for those categories).
</P>
<P>
   HONDA _ I want to check out both the hybrid gas-electric Insight
and S2000, but, even if they're not in stock, revisiting the Accord
is always worth a stop.
</P>
<P>
   GMC _ Time to think big. I once owned (and loved) a Suburban.
Now the GMC version is the Yukon XL. (Does that mean extra long?)
</P>
<P>
   FORD _ This is truck and SUV city, but our tour is aiming
smaller _ at the new Focus. Small money, small car, and we want to
check out the package. With everyone else buying big, sometimes
it's nice to look in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   DODGE _ The Caravan and Grand Caravan. Even without kids in the
family, these remain prime people-movers. A young couple of our
acquaintance just bought a bright red one for weekend excursions
and mountain-bike transporting.
</P>
<P>
   DAEWOO _ The Lanos. At under $9,000, it's a basic car _ and it's
got to be checked out.
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER _ Great designs across the board, but we're headed for
the 300M and hopefully a road test.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET _ People are buying Malibus and liking them. It's a
good month to check out what the excitement is about.
</P>
<P>
   CADILLAC _ The new DeVille DTS. Technology meets luxury meets
big sedan.
</P>
<P>
   BUICK _ Have to see how the Park Avenue compares to the
Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   BMW _ The X5, BMW's all-new SUV, is expensive ($49,400). They've
managed to make it look _ and perform _ like a pure BMW. How? Don't
question. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   AUDI _ The A4 Quattro. A great blend of value and performance
with either the 1.8-turbocharged, 4-cylinder or 2.8-liter V6
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ACURA _ This trip winds up with a car I'd buy _ the 3.2 TL.
Another car that does everything right. At $28,000 (with only a
Navigation system as an option), it's a great value to boot.

SMALL CARS ARE BIG THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a car that's big enough for family and friends but
won't break the budget? This is your year.
</P>
<P>
   For too long ``small'' cars were actually, well, tiny. And they
lacked power, features, and interest. Then along came Ford and
Toyota with new ideas about small vehicles. In today's market,
those small cars are joined by a couple of moderately priced
alternative fuel vehicles as well as an all-new Chevrolet Impala
and completely redesigned Ford Taurus, all great choices that are
selling for less than $20,000. There are some great options, such
as the Toyota Echo, which starts at just under $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus replaces the Escort (which is still available,
however) with a car that is bigger and has more power and features.
For around $13,000 the base-level Focus, with extra space and power
along with a leather-wrapped steering wheel that tilts and
telescopes, is priced comparably with the Escort.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is also giving consumers more car for the dollar. The
Echo, which replaces the Tercel, is roomier than the higher-priced
Corolla. And, the Echo's engine includes variable-valve timing, a
feature first introduced on the Lexus LS400.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet's new Impala comes with air conditioning, power
windows, power locks and mirrors as standard features. There's also
a six-speaker sound system, heated power seats and mirrors
available.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has given its Taurus a new look as well as adding many
safety features, including side head protection, an inside trunk
release latch to prevent entrapment, and ``smart'' airbags that
open either partially or fully depending on the seat position. And
it's the first sedan to offer adjustable pedals to allow short
drivers to move away from the air bag.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, Nissan has given its Sentra a
redesign that should change its image as an entry-level car. The
new Sentra looks a bit like family members Altima and Maxima: it's
larger than its previous version, has more power, and better
handling.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 seller in this group, that is, under $18,000, and the
best-selling car in the country, is the Toyota Camry, which comes
with lots of options and choices. That funny looking Volkswagen
Beetle offers a nice ride and is considered one of the safest cars
being built. The Oldsmobile Alero offers room and a lot of features
for its price. If you want great mileage, the Toyota
Corolla/Chevrolet Prizm will give you 31 miles to the gallon, and
that's city driving. Others models to check out include Ford
Contour and Mustang, Dodge Stratus, Mitsubishi Galant, Volkswagen
Jetta and Golf, Hyundai Sonata (remember that great warranty),
Subaru Legacy and Pontiac Grand Am. Another good choice is the
Subaru Impreza, the lowest-priced all-wheel-drive car around.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn, which converted a lot of people to its value-priced cars
and no-hassle buying, now has a new model that is larger and
roomier. It's a vehicle current Saturn owners can move up to rather
than switching to some other make. The Saturn LS comes in both
sedan and wagon and has an optional V6 engine, the same engine
found in Saabs and the Cadillac Catera.
</P>
<P>
   Another model few have heard of but might consider in the budget
market is the Daewoo Nubira. This $13,000 sedan comes with air
conditioning, power windows, and a keyless entry. The Korean Daewoo
has been in the United States for almost two years with three
models that are packed with extras at a low price. Later this year,
Daewoo will introduce a sport utility vehicle. One of Daewoo's
problems has been its limited dealerships, all company owned. Now
the financially hard-pressed firm is bringing its line to other
dealerships. If you're worried about its staying power, both GM and
Ford are reportedly looking to buy into the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai has changed dramatically, and offers the best warranty
around (five years or 60,000 miles). New this year is the Accent,
costing about $10,000; it has great handling thanks to a fully
independent suspension, a feature found in more expensive cars. Of
course, if you want some real fun, check out the Hyundai Tiburon
($13,500); nice styling, good performance and all at a good price.
</P>
<P>
   All these cars are competing with the Honda Civic, one of the
top-selling cars in America.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of choices in the under $12,000 range. Among
them: the Chevrolet Metro, which can get you up to 39 miles per
gallon in the city; the redesigned Dodge/Plymouth Neon, a big car
for the buck. Kia, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Suzuki are other players
in the low-price field.
</P>
<P>
   It's the end of the line for Plymouth. And for some the
questions might be: Will there be parts if I buy one? Will the 2000
Plymouth become a collector's car? And, why buy one if the make is
going out of business?
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth has served a good number of generations of Americans
quite well. And, if you're looking for an inexpensive vehicle with
a good reputation, there's no reason not to consider a Plymouth
this year. Parts will be available. Remember, a Plymouth is
basically a Dodge and a Chrysler. Most of the parts from the
engine, to the drive train to the body are the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Plymouth nameplate is disappearing simply because
DaimlerChrysler realized it was spending money on the Plymouth name
for no reason.

AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR CAR IS REALLY WORTH? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Here's something to keep in mind when
you're out cruising the dealerships and checking out the present
crop of new cars for sale.
</P>
<P>
   While your mind is keyed on what you'd like to drive out of the
lot, the used car manager is more interested in the wheels you'll
be leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon spent with Bill Dame, the used car manager for Fox
Toyota, provided an intriguing insight into a person who is vital
to the operation of a dealership, but who doesn't have a specific
job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can ever train to do this job. It's not part of a
career path,'' says Dame who has been sitting on the sales desk at
Fox for 3 1/2 years. ``You either can do it or you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame's resume includes a stint as an Air Force mechanic, a
father-in-law who owned a body shop, a thorough knowledge of cars
(he did a frame-off restoration of a big block (427 c.i.) 1967
Chevrolet that he still drives), and a regular presence at auto
auctions for more than 30 years. He took this job after retiring
from the Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Dame knows is his numbers. His desktop may be clean,
but one drawer down he's got the latest auction sheets, plus the
most recent NADA, Kelley, Galves, and Edmund's guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying in this business that you can shake the book
all day and no money will fall out of it,'' he says. ``You look at
the book and you've immediately got three prices: Average trade,
average loan, and retail. Then you talk to five wholesalers and get
five more different prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame uses the guides for reference, but he really studies the
local auction sheets because they're more accurate reflections of
his marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the prices that the guidebooks use in their next
edition so it's the most up-do-date and localized information I can
get,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dame's job is to put a price on cars, he's in the
people business. In the course of several hours, he'll have chatted
with salesmen, mechanics, customers, wholesalers, and Jack Fox, the
dealership's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jack asks me to keep an eye out for a car, I remember it,''
says Dame. ``I may not remember yesterday's lunch but I remember
what I paid for every car I ever (personally) bought, what I put
into that car, and what I sold it for.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his role with the dealership, Dame makes one thing clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not trading in your car,'' he says. ``You're asking me
to buy it. I have to dispose of it. I have to ask myself: `Can I
sell this car for more than I have in it or do I have to get rid of
it.' I don't want it sitting around,'' he adds. ``Once we buy the
car, I have to decide whether it goes on our lot for sale or if we
sell it on the wholesale market.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame makes a lot of judgments in a single glance.
</P>
<P>
   That first glance tells him whether the car is ``desirable''
with a reasonable amount of mileage on its odometer. It tells him
whether it's a color that will sell readily: beige, sage, black,
white, and silver sell best; the red family not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In real estate, they say, `location, location, location,' ''
says Dame. ``In this business, it's `condition, condition,
condition.' A nice car is a nice car.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Dame decides a car is desirable and his gut tells him
there's no obvious mechanical problems, the car has one more hurdle
before it winds up on the Fox lot _ the shop's evaluation of how
much it will take to put the car in A-1 condition for resale. ``If
we can then sell it for more than we have in it, we do it;
otherwise, it goes to the wholesalers,'' says Dame.
</P>
<P>
   After nixing one offer, Dame says, ``Sure, I was born at night,
but not last night.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound harsh, but it's the reality of a bottom-line
business, one in which the price of new cars is readily available
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good part is that people come in really attuned to the car
they want,'' says Dame. ``The Internet is a tool _ a great tool _
and gives you good figures for MSRP and dealer cost, but it's far
from complete. We have to add to our base cost, a delivery charge _
and it's different for every model at every dealership _ plus local
dealer association advertising costs. If a customer will take that
figure and add the 3 percent the Internet folks say is a fair
profit, we'll make that deal all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Szumita, the general sales manager, interjects to ask, ``Did
you show him the Internet customer?''
</P>
<P>
   Dame opens a door to reveal a poster of an aging bag lady. The
inscription reads: ``On the Internet, she's 25, blonde, blue-eyed
and 36-24-36.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame's resources are more immediate _ the local corps of auto
wholesalers. ``These guys know all kinds of vehicles,'' he says.
``When I describe a car to them, I'm perfectly honest. They don't
know whether I'm figuring on keeping the car or offering it to
them. Our relationship is based on a mutual trust.''
</P>
<P>
   A salesman gives Dame a slip. He needs to appraise a 1997 Jeep
Cherokee Sport with 38,000 miles on it that is being traded on a
2000 RAV-4 SUV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect example of an off-breed (non-Toyota)
appraisal,'' says Dame. ``At 38,000 miles it's out of warranty,''
he notes, checking paint, tires, overall appearance, and myriad
intangibles at a glance to determine the car's ``desirability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this car has been repainted, it was done professionally
because I can't see it; and if I can't, you can't, either. He does
find a rough spot on a fender seam that has had a minor repair. But
. . . there's a lot of wax on this car. It's been kept clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting in, he appraises interior condition and options with a
similar glance. ``There aren't many extras on this car, but there
are enough (to make it desirable).'' He takes a look ahead and
says, ``The hood is nice and right on this car. That's another good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   A short ride around the block tells him that the engine and
transmission are OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would resell on my lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now to put a price on this car.
</P>
<P>
   ``A figure jumped into my head at first sight, and nothing I've
seen so far has changed it,'' says Dame. ``I think I'll have to
offer $13,000 for the car. A quick check of the books and a call to
one of his wholesalers, pretty much sets the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Then a snappy looking Mustang rolls into the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Jimmy,'' says Dame of another wholesaler. ``He's on his
way back from the auction. He must have had a bad day and wants to
see if there's anything for him here (the dealership parks all cars
to be wholesaled in a back lot), but there isn't anything out there
today.'' Dame waves him inside. ``He's (Jimmy) a real smart guy,''
he says. ``Watch us play each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The two talk back and forth, agreeing that the market is better
for the Sport than a Grand Cherokee these days, but Jimmy, who
actually had a good day at the auction, thinks Dame is paying way
too much for the Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have liked it for a lot less,'' says Dame, ``but this one
is going on my lot. In fact, I think we might have a buyer for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the real bottom line of his game.

 &HT;    GEORGIA TEENAGER FINDS HIS OWN WAY TO KILL KUDZU
 &HT;    720&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government scientists who say they have isolated a
fungus that destroys kudzu may have competition from an unexpected
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For a science fair project, an 18-year-old Georgia high school
student has identified another kudzu-killing fungus and developed a
way to use it against the vine that has enveloped so much of the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Farris, a senior at Houston County High School, in Warner
Robins, has won numerous honors for his work with a kudzu-attacking
fungus called ``Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.''
</P>
<P>
   He was among a small group of teen scientists invited to present
the results of their research at the annual meeting here last week
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, who has participated in science fair competitions since
seventh grade, noticed a patch of kudzu on growing beside
Interstate 75 three years ago, and it got him thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea came to me that if I could find a naturally occurring
pathogen on kudzu, I might use it as a biological control of the
weed,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Mrs. Katie Farris, was driving the car as they
passed the kudzu patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, 'Momma, I'm going to try to find a way to control
kudzu,' `` Katie Farris recalled. ``And I said, 'Oh, Jeremy, how
can you possibly even think of such a thing.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The thought of controlling kudzu would have struck just about
anyone in Georgia, even Jeremy Farris's mother, as blue-sky
fantasy. Since it was introduced into the United States in the late
1800s, kudzu has spread over an estimated 7 million acres, from
Florida to New York to Texas. Infestations are particularly heavy
in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers recently announced
they had identified a different fungus that kills virtually 100
percent of kudzu vines when applied to them in high concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, the older of the two sons of Jerry and Katie Farris,
does not claim such a high ``kill rate'' for the Colletotrichum
organism.
</P>
<P>
   However, he believes it is potentially an effective control for
the weed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Farris said she and her husband, Jerry Farris, a vocational
rehabilitation counselor at the Veterans Administration Medical
Center in Dublin, Ga., were not surprised when Jeremy threw himself
into a search for a natural enemy of kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He amazes us,'' she said. ``When he sets a goal for himself,
he's driven. He's very goal-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Unaware that the USDA scientists also were looking for a way to
control kudzu, Farris began searching through patches of the vine
for signs of anything that might be attacking it.
</P>
<P>
   He isolated several types of fungus from small, seemingly
insignificant spots on kudzu leaves. He grew the various fungi in a
laboratory and applied each to kudzu vines in a greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used something that is called 'Koch's postulate,''' he
explained. ``That means that if you grow an organism in the
laboratory and inoculate it onto a plant, then re-isolate it from
the damaged plant, logically it is the organism you placed on the
plant and it is pathogenic to the host.''
</P>
<P>
   This process led him to the Colletotrichum fungus, which causes
kudzu to develop lesions on leaves and stems.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate problem lay in the fact that the fungus also
attacks peaches, pecans and apples, Farris said.

   Farris developed a special laboratory culture containing
ground-up kudzu leaves and used it to grow the fungus. He applied
each laboratory crop to kudzu vines, re-isolated it and grew it
again in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Over many generations, the fungus appeared to develop an
increased virulence against the vine and a reduced appetite for
fruit and nut trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It causes the leaves of kudzu to be covered with brown (dying)
areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of Charles Reilly, a plant pathologist at an
agricultural research laboratory in Byron, Ga., Farris determined
that his fungus is a ``stress pathogen'' for kudzu, meaning it
attacks plants that have already been stressed by drought or some
other adverse circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he said, he worked out a system under which a dilute
herbicide mixture is used to stress the plants, followed by an
application of fungus spores.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Farris is an Eagle Scout and captain of his school cross-country
team (''Regional champions this year,'' he said.) He is on the
school mathematics and academic teams.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to enter Georgia Tech in Atlanta later this year and is
applying for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Houston County High School chemistry teacher Laura Byrd
describes Farris as ``a very interesting kid, a typical American
boy, very laid-back and friendly, not the kind of kid you would
look at and say he was a nerd or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you get him talking about his project, he turns into a
different person,'' Byrd added. ``He is extremely knowledgeable
about this fungus of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton G. Sutherlin, a teacher at Warner Robins Middle School,
has known Farris for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught this kid in the seventh grade and continue to work
with him and encourage him,'' Sutherlin said. ``It is not often
that a teacher gets the honor and privilege and satisfaction of
watching a flower bloom. Man, what a rush.''

HEADY TIMES FOR BUYERS AND SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is that time of year again.
</P>
<P>
   We flock to showrooms and honor (in New England, at least) dead
presidents by kicking tires (though these days be careful because,
with low-profile tires all the rage, there's not much rubber
between rim and ground), checking out seats, sound systems, and
dashboards, slamming doors to see if they are solid, and generally
dreaming summer dreams in the dead of winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time of sales in the auto industry _ sales being taken
two ways, one being actions the auto dealers hope to make, the
other being perceived deals on this year's crop of cars, SUVs,
pickup trucks, and myriad amalgams of all three that have become
the rage.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times to be a seller of cars. They are selling
in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also heady times to be buyers of cars. That is
because today's vehicles are more exciting, more dependable, safer
(when driven properly), and more imaginatively designed than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Very good autos can be purchased for $12,000 (not a lot of money
in today's auto market); superb sedans can be found for $18,000 to
$25,000; mid-luxury cars that are finer than any true luxury car
built 10 years ago can be found in the mid-30s to mid-40s; and the
high-end luxury cars, $50,000 to upwards of $80,000 come with a
sportiness aimed at appealing to young, suddenly wealthy drivers
even as they continue to appeal to the older driver who has longed,
and saved, for years for such a car.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks are cars are SUVs. Convertibles are making a big
comeback, mostly as sports cars. Power is a seller, but so too will
be ``green'' cars such as the hybrids offered by Honda and Toyota,
autos that combine electric and gasoline motors and drive like your
everyday auto. Their big selling point? They recharge their own
batteries while rolling, so there is no need to plug them in when
batteries run low.
</P>
<P>
   Because manufacturers have learned to ``share'' platforms within
their model lines, they save money that allows them to offer
wonderful, relatively limited creations that might never see the
light of day if they had to be developed from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Chrysler can bring out its PT Cruiser, part
panel-truck, part gangster car. It's why Ford can offer a four-door
pickup truck on the platform of its F150 pickup. The possibilities
seem endless. So what to do?
</P>
<P>
   Here, in several categories, are the cars I've already driven,
or am particularly looking forward to driving, in the year ahead.
When you shop, ask yourself a few questions: What will I use this
car for most of the time? Is there some exciting and esoteric use
that I am paying thousands extra to obtain but which I'll seldom
utilize? And, particularly in the low- and mid-luxury ranges, is
one car is really $5,000 or $10,000 better than another. Many are
not. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trucks &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --If you are a truck fan _ a big truck fan _ drive a Toyota
Tundra. You will be amazed at its smooth ride, its powerful and
amazingly quiet engine. It comes with four doors and seating for
five. It's got a decent size bed. It's got Toyota longevity and
reliability written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   --Chevrolet Silverado. It, too, has a four-door model available
and seats six comfortably. It comes with four engine options _ from
a 200-horsepower V6 to 300-h.p. V8 _ and an Autotrac system that
sends power to the front wheels (on four-wheel drive models) when
extra grab is needed up there.
</P>
<P>
   --Dodge Dakota. Smaller sibling to the Ram, but available with
four doors, seating for six (there's a pattern developing in pickup
trucks here) and a range of engines, though I doubt many 120 h.p.
V4s will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   --Ford SuperCrew. Need I say it: four doors, lots of room, lots
of power. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUVs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, a word of warning here. Don't buy one of these for your
kids because you think they'll be safer in one. If you do buy an
SUV, special driving lessons for young drivers is in order. I am a
fan of Sport Utility Vehicles _ in the right hands. You cannot
drive them as if they are cars. You cannot drive fast the way you
can in a car, nor can you do sudden stops and quick lane changes at
higher speeds as you can in a car. You can haul lots of people and
gear, go places cars can't go, and make them an important part of
your traveling life _ if you are careful. Thankfully, auto
manufacturers are starting to catch onto the inherent dangers that
come when bad or inexperienced drivers get behind the wheel of an
SUV and are responding with automatic driver assist systems, better
suspensions, and wonderful yaw control systems. Some good SUVS
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Honda CR-V. Marginally a true SUV, but a great rig for bad
weather with its all-wheel drive, good suspension, and stability.
Don't plan on going off-road in one, but even most true SUVs never
get there.
</P>
<P>
   --Nissan Xterra. The least expensive true SUV you'll find, if a
dealer isn't gouging because of its popularity. A throwback to the
days when SUVs were tough, spartan, actually did go off-road, and
were affordable. If a dealer asks you to pay well over $20,000 for
one, walk away.
</P>
<P>
   --BMW X5. Perhaps the finest SUV on the market today. It's a
high-performance car on the road; a beast off the road. It is
stable, corners in a way others do not, and has all the feel of
luxury of a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   --Subaru Forester. Another marginal SUV, but wonderful on ice
and snow, quiet, reliable, and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   --Land Rover Discovery. A real SUV in swank clothing. Wonderful
suspension, roomy interior, good in mud, snow, forest, and field. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Minivans &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minivans are a market in flux, to some extent. Who needs a
minivan when you can haul the kids, the lumber, the groceries, the
loam for the lawn, all in a four-door pickup truck that rides like
a car? But there are some good ones and they will sell:
</P>
<P>
   --Ford Windstar. Smooth, powerful, sliding doors on both sides
(de rigeur, I'd say) and it has some of the best crash-test results
of any minivan ever.
</P>
<P>
   --Honda Odyssey. Bigger than ever _ and that means a lot of
space inside _ and right up there with the Chrysler products. Dual
sliding doors and a third seat that disappears (Voila!) into the
floor for good cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   --Mazda MPV. Thankfully, it's been redesigned with front-wheel
drive and that's a smart move. It also has two sliders, a
disappearing seat like the Odyssey, but is just a bit smaller
overall.
</P>
<P>
   --Chrysler Town &AMP; Country, Dodge Caravans. Without these, we'd
not have the others. They're big, powerful, and roomy. Did I
mention dual sliders? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sedans &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is where we urge you to shop carefully, folks. They come
small, medium or large, from low-cost to high-cost. When you're
shopping for a sedan, try out lots of them; many are good, many are
good deals, and many are not worth the extra cash that makes them
more expensive than comparable models, even in their own line.
</P>
<P>
   --Nissan Maxima. It's scheduled for a redesign over the next
couple of years, but its 222-h.p. V6 is one of the finest engines
on the market and its price _ the low $20s _ is appealing because
it is as good as many cars costing $8,000 to $10,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   --Lincoln LS. A sporty, European-feel, American luxury sedan.
The Lincoln LS is a breakthrough and if you're looking at foreign
sport sedans, drive one of these, too.
</P>
<P>
   --Chrysler 300M. American 1950s raw power meets 2000 world-
class styling.
</P>
<P>
   --Ford Focus. Another breakthrough car. At $12,500 to start, it
comes in hatchback, four-door, and wagon models. Smooth,
surprisingly roomy, and a real treat at this price.
</P>
<P>
   --Toyota Camry. Simply, it's the Model T of this age.
Affordable, dependable, reliable. For the masses.
</P>
<P>
   --Chevrolet Monte Carlo. It has great sporty looks with a
performance package to make you feel like you, too, are on the
NASCAR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   --Volkswagen Passat. Soon to come equipped with all-wheel drive.
Smooth, zippy, comfortable, and reliable. Need two cars? Pair this
one up with a Jetta in your garage.
</P>
<P>
   --Any BMW, Saab, Volvo, Mercedes, Acura, Audi or Lexus. In this
pack, it's all a matter of want and wallet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Station Wagons &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're making a comeback. Some favorites:
</P>
<P>
   --Saab 9-5. It's not big, but roomy enough. Powerful, quiet,
wonderful in snow and ice, and hey, I love that glove compartment
that chills drinks to 42 degrees using the car's air conditioning
system.
</P>
<P>
   --Volvo wagons. The 40 series at around $25,000 with a
turbocharged four-cylinder is a fine car; the Cross Country may be
the best all-around New England car you could buy.
</P>
<P>
   --BMW 5401. Rugged, fast, smooth, quiet. What would you expect? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sports cars &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roadsters are the rage with more and more ragtops appearing
every day. In this market, you can go wild with desire, wilder with
your wallet. A few favorites:
</P>
<P>
   --Honda S2000. I drove this one to Pennsylvania and the Pocono
racetrack. Redlines at 9 grand. Fast, six speeds, snappy as a
rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   --Porsche Carrera 4. Probably the finest car I have ever driven.
So subtle, yet so powerful. Its driver assist system, when on,
won't let you make the car fishtail.
</P>
<P>
   --Acura NSX. Another pricey option. Aluminum, horsepower, you
can feel every pebble in the road. The most fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   --Mazda Miata. Without this car, we wouldn't be writing about
the comeback of the sports car. Definitely a car for the
afficianado.
</P>
<P>
   --Audi TT coupe and convertible. Not the easiest car to get
into, but once you are wearing it, it's like you're driving inside
a computer game.
</P>
<P>
   --BMW Z3. Snappy, corners like it's on rails, odd appearance
grows on you until you love it.

ARE NEW MODELS WORTH THE WAIT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long gone are the days when all the vehicle manufacturers
introduced all their new models in the fall. Now it's a year-round
happening. Gone, too, are the days when manufacturers kept new
models under wraps until introduction day. You don't need to look
at spy photos of new models (as happened a few decades ago); now
the manufacturers are putting them out in full view to look at,
marvel about, and think about, long before they are available in
the showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   While some models being shown now are brand new and offer
innovative features, others are redesigns of existing models with
better features.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking to buy, in the case of the DaimlerChrysler
minivans, for example, you might want to hold off until the new
2001 models are available.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring Oldsmobile introduced its 2001 Aurora at the New
York Auto Show. ``The all-new Aurora has everything consumers
demand from a premiere luxury sedan,'' says John Gatt, brand
manager for the Aurora. ``We've improved on everything that defines
the Aurora's heritage _ exhilarating power and performance, precise
ride and handling, and an overall presence that is incredibly
distinctive.'' Unlike the first Aurora introduced in 1994, the new
model will offer a choice of two engines, a V-8 and a V-6.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac has been showing its EVOQ a lot. But this
405-horsepower, $80,000 sports vehicle won't be available until
2003. In this case, Cadillac is working on its image and wants
younger buyers to think Cadillac when they head to the showrooms.
While some of the present styling of Cadillac models still say
older buyer, under the sheet metal is some pretty impressive
performance and innovations.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler PT Cruiser is another vehicle that's been on view
since last spring. Now its actually going on sale in March. Is it a
sedan, minivan, or truck? Chrysler says it's a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Rover is a long-established name in Great Britain, but hasn't
been sold in the States for quite some time. Now BMW (which owns
Rover) confirms the Mini is heading our way. Rumor has it showing
up in fall 2001, and may be sold in BMW showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Acura, which did not offer a CL coupe this year, will have an
all-new model, the 2001 Acura 3.2 CL. This one is based on the
Acura TL sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen is adding its 4Motion, all-wheel-drive to its Passat
sedans and wagons, a feature VW hasn't offered in more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus will bring out the LS 430 to replace its flagship LS 400.
The new model, coming in the fall, will be packed with safety
innovations and comfort. Its amenities are almost mind boggling: a
climate-control system that senses if more sunlight is hitting one
side of the car than the other, and adjusts the cooling system
accordingly; a driver's seat with dual lumbar controls; and options
that include air suspension, navigation system, front seats with
separate heating and cooling elements, power adjustable rear seats
with heat and massage, rear air conditioning and more.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is already showing off its 2001 minivans. Even
though the company leads the field when it comes to minivans, it is
taking no chances on losing sales to other makers. So it's out to
prove that there's no minivan to consider other than a Chrysler or
Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   The new minvans look a lot like this year's models but just
consider the changes: power sliding doors at last, but not like
those on GM models, these can be closed manually; an optional power
liftgate in back that opens and closes electrically, an industry
first; quieter, more powerful engines; stronger bodies; and more
inside features, such as a console that can be moved from the front
to the second row of seating, more cargo room, a cargo organizer to
handle grocery bags, and other items. And the company is retooling
just about everything for better fit and more durability.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into trucks or SUVs, look what's coming:
</P>
<P>
   The Isuzu VX-02 is scheduled to be in showrooms sometime late
this year or early next year. Isuzu takes its futuristic VehiCROSS
one step better by chopping off the top for that open air look. In
addition, the VehiCross has a powerful 215-horsepower V6 engine and
an active control switch on the dash that lets you choose from
off-road to highway driving.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is giving its Frontier a tougher looking exterior to set
it apart from other makes; otherwise mechanically it is the same.
It will come in two and four-door versions, extended cab and
four-wheel drive versions.
</P>
<P>
   GM will offer new pickups with four full-sized doors as well as
heavy-duty versions of Chevrolet Silverado and the GM Sierra
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 77 years, Buick is introducing a truck
(SUV) that will offer the cargo capabilities of a truck and the
easy ride of a sedan. The Buick Rendezvous will sell for around
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac is coming out with the Aztek, a sport utility clearly
aimed at the young at heart. This 2001 model is expected in
showrooms this summer and will be offered in both front-drive and
all-wheel-drive models.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is entering into the full-sized sport utility world with
the Sequoia, based on the Tundra pickup platform. The Sequoia is
almost identical in size to the Ford Expedition. Interestingly, the
Sequoia will be priced less than the smaller Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which has purchased Hummer, now says it will
offer a smaller version of this vehicle in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is coming out with a few new models. Among them is the Ford
Explorer Sport Trac that will offer seating for five, four doors,
and a short cargo bed that can be extended with a flip-out cage.
Another is the Ford Escape, a small SUV and the sixth in the
company's line. Ford is aiming this July model at those with an
``active lifestyle.'' Among its features is a slide out roof rack
that goes into the rear hatch for mountain bikes or skis.
</P>
<P>
   Other SUVs being introduced at this year's Detroit Auto Show
include the Hyundai Santa Fe, a redesigned Mitsubishi Montero, and
the new, small Daewoo Korando, that will be among the lowest priced
SUVs in America.
</P>
<P>
   And Acura, which did not offer an SUV this year, has previewed
its MD-X which will replace the SLX that was built by Isuzu. The
MD-X will share its platform with the Honda Odyssey minivan and
have an independent rear suspension. It goes on sale in the fall
and is aimed right at the Lexus RX300.
</P>
<P>
   With models like this in the pipeline, it almost makes you want
to wait.

NAVIGATE AND TELECOMMUNICATE FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR CAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I'm driving an Acura RL with a dash mounted navigation
system. From Chatham, I program it to go to Boston, or more
precisely to The Boston Globe, and it does so flawlessly, always
keeping me informed as to how much further I have to travel and any
turns I must make . . . that is, until I decide to get off I-93 one
exit earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the woman's voice that gives the directions senses that
I am about to do it my way, and get off at Exit 14 instead of Exit
15. Suddenly the voice announces ``Stay on 93.'' I don't, and
instead of reprimanding me, the system suddenly recalculates the
route, noting I am already on Morrissey Boulevard and takes me
right to the front door of the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems are showing up on more and more vehicles, but
such toys are expensive _ around $2,000 _ and while I like them and
find they can be useful, they're still not ready for prime time
driving. In cities like Boston, they can get you around, but you
must know the territory. Yes, the Globe is in Boston but I had to
program it for Dorchester, the section of the city where the
building is located. This navigation system doesn't know all of the
streets. For Chatham, I programmed it to start from a house near
where I live and it did give me the option to head to the town
hall. When I head to Woonsocket, R.I., it knows the street where
I'm going, but no house numbers. Heading to Uxbridge, it knew where
the town center was, but not where the house we were heading to was
located.
</P>
<P>
   One nifty device is OnStar. Of course, you have to buy a GM
vehicle to get one. Onstar, which is linked to a cell phone, also
uses global navigation to assist you, but here you have a real
person who can not only locate where you are, but help you if you
get lost or are in an accident. Better still, if you should be in
an accident and the air bags deploy, the system automatically seeks
help. GM is smartly packaging it with many models, but you'll still
have to pay a monthly service charge. Call it insurance. It's also
good in helping you find hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and
other places.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers StarTAC, the first fully integrated digital
cellular phone system in a car. Among its features are a
multi-function dashboard and steering wheel control, allowing
drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road;
integrated radio system that mutes the sound while on the phone and
can also pause the CD or cassette player, and voice recognition
capabilities. It is also portable so it can go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has also expanded the use of its TeleAid system to most
of its models. The system, like OnStar, provides both convenience
and emergency information at the touch of a button. It uses Global
Positioning to aid in locating the vehicle, should you become lost
or in an accident. TeleAid also provides drivers with a real person
to help them with vehicle questions.
</P>
<P>
   Voice recognition controls are an option on the new Jaquar
S-Type. The driver can just speak to use the cell phone, control
the temperature or the navigation system of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's new Seville has a radio that also offers e-mail,
stock quotes, and traffic information. Should a traffic alert
occur, the radio will broadcast it even if the CD is playing. If
you don't know where to find traffic information on the dial, the
radio will do it at the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   If having Internet access while driving is in your plans,
perhaps you should hold off for a while. Ford, GM and
DaimlerChrysler are all working to put e-mail availability in
vehicles. Ford and GM are working on voice recognition systems
that, when you say ``get e-mail'' or ``read e-mail,'' will deliver.
DaimlerChrysler plans a ``bring your own laptop'' approach and is
designing a system that includes a small screen, microphone and
cellular phone modem in its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision technology is another Cadillac feature that is
found on the new DeVille. With the system, potential safety hazards
out of range of the car's headlights, are illuminated on the
windshield in front of the driver. The system not only allows the
driver to see three to five times farther than the range of their
low-beam headlights, but also helps reduce the glare of oncoming
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   The new Volvo S40 comes with an optional front-seat laptop
computer table. The very safety conscientious Volvo posts a warning
that the table should only be used when the car is parked.
</P>
<P>
   Already available on General Motors and other minivans are
entertainment systems allowing the gang in the back to watch
videos, play Nintendo or listen to their own music.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort is also being upgraded. Many models now offer dual-zone
climate controls to keep both the driver and front-seat passenger
comfortable. The Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited goes one step farther
by using an infrared sensor to detect the skin temperature of the
riders in the front seat to keep them at precisely the right level
programmed into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up in the 2001 Lexus LS 430 will be a system that allows
rear passengers to also select their own temperature setting. And,
the 2001 DamilerChrysler minivans will offer three separate
temperature zones, one for each row of seats.
</P>
<P>
   Heated front seats are found in many makes, but a few, including
Saab and the Cadillac Catera, also offer rear passengers heated
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Seats are key to driving safety, if you're not comfortable
seated behind the wheel, you could tire easily. If your vehicle is
used by others, getting one with power seats that can be set for
each individual driver is a handy feature. Many vehicles offer
lumbar supports that certainly could help your back on a long
drive. Cadillac even has a seat that gives a massage as you drive.
</P>
<P>
   Saab has an extra option ventilated seat for those hot sticky
days, and its also heated for colder times..
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Navigator has a climate-controlled seat as an
option. The seat has a fan that directs ambient air to two ceramic
thermoelectric devices located in the seat's back and cushions,
which then release or absorb heat, depending on the flow of
electric current to them. The warm or cool air is directed through
perforations in the seat upholstery. There are five different
heating and cooling settings.
</P>
<P>
   Other niceties being found on 2000 models include the storage
bin found on the roof of the Nissan Xterra. It is self draining so
you can throw those muddy hiking boots up there. The Xterra has lot
of other neat storage ideas, including an inside bike rack. The
Ford Taurus and Mercury Stable have trunk hooks to hang those
plastic grocery bags, no more loose cans rolling around in the
trunk. The Pontiac Bonneville SSEi comes with an emergency package
with rain suit, first-aid kit, gloves, light, and an air hose to
pump air into low tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon, has a smart gauge to read the fuel supply. No more
guessing how much is left in the tank, the gauge continuously reads
the fuel-tank float level every six seconds, comparing it with
stored historical data to calculate a ``real-time'' reading for the
gauge to give a more accurate assessment of the fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   Some cars come with automatic gauges to read the tire pressure,
warning the driver if a tire has low pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz now has a sensor in the oil pump that analyzes oil
for impurities such as water, fuel, and metal. It sends its
information to the car's Flexible Service system which then decides
when to flag the driver. With this, Mercedes says, some drivers may
only have to change their oil every 20,000 miles. Not bad, but
better still is Mercede's free maintenance during its
four-year/50,000-mile warranty. That cuts ownership costs even
more.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of gasoline skyrocketing these days, Cadillac is
giving buyers of its high-performance Northstar V-8 engine equipped
vehicles a bonus _ it now runs on regular gasoline instead of the
high-priced 93 octane. Even Cadillac owners can appreciate the
savings of 20 to 30 cents or more a gallon.

BUICK, WOODS DRIVE ON; RENDEZVOUS SUV INTRODUCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks at Buick must have been giddy with joy over the
increased interest Tiger Woods brought to the Buick Invitational
golf tournament in San Diego last week.
</P>
<P>
   National media attention was focused on the tournament as Woods
made his run at an astounding seventh straight PGA Tour victory _
he finished in a tie for second after briefly tying for the lead _
on the very weekend Buick was introducing three television
commercials featuring Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The spots are the first Woods has made with the carmaker since
signing an endorsement deal in December. They hit the airwaves even
as Woods was gaining ground on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger and Buick are a natural combination,'' says Anthony H.
Derhake, Buick's golf brand manager. ``Tiger broadens our audience
appeal, and we expect to attract new customers to Buick as a
result. This also reinforces Buick's recognized strong connection
with golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots have serious and comic overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The serious commercial features Buick's support of the Tiger
Woods Foundation to bring golf to inner-city children. In it, a
grandfather helps his grandson line up _ and sink _ a putt on a
city sidewalk. Talk about fast greens!
</P>
<P>
   In another, Woods banks a shot off a TV tower supporting two
doubting announcers, dropping them into a water hazard, then offers
them a towel as he drives off, er Regal-ly. The third shows Woods
teaching adult campers how to play golf and ``drive'' the way he
does _ in a Buick of course. For Buick, the jackpot was earned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Buick
</P>
<P>
   The GM Division introduced its Rendezvous SUV at last week's
Chicago Auto Show. It's the first Buick truck model in 77 years.
Buick didn't put a price on it, but best guesses are it will sell
for less than $30,000, well below the similar-sized Lexus RX 300
and Mercedes M-Class. Like its GM sibling, the Pontiac Aztek, it
will offer a 185-horsepower V6 engine with optional all-wheel drive
on demand. A third row of seats can make this a seven-passenger
vehicle, or the third seat can fold flat for storage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most manufactures were showing off their four-door compact
pickups at the Chicago show _ except Ford, GM, Toyota, Nissan all
arrived with their new models with four regular-sized doors.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Ford unveiled its 2001 Ranger _ the country's
top-selling compact pickup for the past 13 years. It had two
regular doors and two mini-doors.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or madness?
</P>
<P>
   Ford truck boss Jim O'Connor said Ford already has its Explorer
Sport Trac (a four-door SUV with a short pickup bed) in production
and almost ready for the showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ford takes great pains to separate pickups from
SUVs, the inference is obvious: Want four doors? Try the Sport
Trac.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Ford is hesitant to hurt interest in this ballyhooed
SUV; question is, will Ranger sales suffer in that effort?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ranger comes in enough body and door styles with both
two- and four-wheel drive to have plenty of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor doesn't sound too upset. Ford this month forecast that
it would sell 17 million vehicles in the United States this year _
up from its original goal of 16.1 million units. And this after a
record-breaking 1999. Pickup trucks, minivans, and SUVs account for
two-thirds of Ford sales.

   BMW held a winter carnival in East Rutherford, N.J., letting 100
would-be buyers experience a two-hour Ultimate Driving Experience
behind the wheel of its new $50,000 X5 Sports Activity Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   We had a chance to try a similar trek at the New England Motor
Press Winter Driving Awards several weeks back so it's a lock that
those lucky 100 had a great time, even though they were accompanied
by a professional driver.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has a simple plan for tracking the program's success. It
will match the names of participants against future buyers.

   Well, we have platinum series credit cards, so why not a
Platinum Series Lexus? The company has introduced a Platinum series
LS 400 premium luxury sedan ($55,969), GS 400 sport luxury sedan
($49,894), S 300 sport luxury sedan ($42,344) and an ES300
affordable luxury sedan at $34,924.
</P>
<P>
   The series feature special paint colors, enhanced interiors,
distinctive wheels and badging, and are well-equipped (read loaded)
with factory options. Plus, Lexus will toss in a two-year American
Express Platinum Card.

   All the Hondas I've had experience with were clean-running
vehicles. But the company is doing more. The 2000 Accord EX has
become the first car sold with California's Super Ultra Low
Emission Vehicle (SULEV) certification. (It will be priced $100
over the Accord it replaces.) The SULEV standards are the world's
strictest and go into effect beginning with the 2004 model year.
According to the California Air Resources Board, a SULEV engine
emits only 2.3 pounds of hydrocarbons during 100,000 miles of
driving, roughly the same as spilling a quart of gasoline.

   DaimlerChrysler's PT Cruiser, introduced as a concept car a year
ago, is just now in production in Mexico. It will be available this
spring and priced at $16,000 (including destination charge) with
the top-end Limited model coming in at $19,995. The car is
intriguing because it boasts full-size car interior space in a
compact body. (It's built on the Neon platform).
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing DaimlerChrysler chairman Robert J. Eaton may be right
when he said, ``There isn't a cooler truck _ or car _ available
anywhere for the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Kudos to D/C for its ``Fit for a Kid'' program that offers free
public child safety seat inspections. Anyone who has purchased a
family vehicle with an eye towards its safety features owes it to
themselves to take advantage of this offer by calling their local
dealer or clicking on www.fitforakid.org. An inspection takes 20 to
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge folks will continue to expand their R/T lineup with a
Stratus R/T coupe with a 200-horsepower V-6 engine, specially tuned
suspension, and 17-inch performance tires. It also will be
available with a five-speed manual.

IRA STANCE ON ARMS STYMIES LEADERS OF BRITAIN, IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On Wednesday afternoon, Feb. 16, as Sinn Fein leaders
Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness huddled with the prime ministers
of Britain and Ireland trying to find a way out of the impasse that
imperils the Northern Ireland peace process, one aide to Tony Blair
suggested that maybe it was time for the IRA and the British to
talk directly.
</P>
<P>
   The process had ground to a halt because the Irish Republican
Army refuses to say if or when it will disarm, and because the
Ulster Unionists refuse to share power with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, as long as the IRA keeps its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   According to some who were in the room, McGuinness, Sinn Fein's
chief negotiator, who was once the IRA's chief of staff, closed his
eyes and shook his head. The IRA, he said, would not talk to the
British about disarming ``in a million years.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of two nations were left trying to figure a way out
of a Catch-22. After the power-sharing government was suspended
last week, the IRA said it would not even discuss disarming until
the government is restored. And the unionists say they won't allow
the government to be restored until the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA considers itself an undefeated army, and undefeated
armies don't discuss turning in weapons with an enemy it fought to
a stalemate. That would be a surrender.
</P>
<P>
   And, the IRA and Sinn Fein point out, the IRA was not a
signatory to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, the compromise that
created the political institutions that are supposed to transform
Northern Ireland into a peaceful, democratic society after 30 years
of the Troubles. That agreement said the IRA and pro-British
loyalist paramilitary groups should disarm by May, but purposely
left open the date that the process would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders are technically correct in saying there was no
violation of the agreement to justify last week's decision by
British Secretary of State Peter Mandelson to restore direct rule
from London after just 72 days of local government.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a political reality in the deliberately vague
wording of the Good Friday Agreement. And the political reality is
that everyone involved in the peace process _ not just the
Protestant unionists and the British government but moderate
Catholic nationalists from Northern Ireland and the Irish
government _ expect the IRA, at the very least, to commit itself to
disarming by a specific date. Everyone, that is, except
republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They consider disarmament a red herring meant only to humiliate
the IRA and delay addressing the grievances that are at the root of
the conflict, such as discrimination against Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinn Fein says it is responsible only for the 18 percent
of the population that votes for it, the reality is that everyone
else considers it the political wing of the IRA. It may be that
Adams and McGuinness, despite their best efforts, cannot deliver
IRA disarmament, but the peace process has rested on the premise
that they could.
</P>
<P>
   And while the IRA is not a signatory to the Good Friday
Agreement, it has benefited from it. Most of the 400 IRA prisoners
held at the time it was signed have been released. By July, all of
them are supposed to be. The 13,000-member Royal Ulster
Constabulary, which is more than 90 percent Protestant and which
republicans see as the military wing of unionism, upholding a
system that has treated them like second-class citizens, is being
reformed.
</P>
<P>
   Most crucially, the agreement, with the support of both
governments, enshrines the principle that if a majority of Northern
Ireland ever chooses to merge with the Irish Republic, Britain
would accept that decision. The IRA's holy grail, a united Ireland,
is achievable by democratic means.
</P>
<P>
   While the IRA is undoubtedly worried about a bloody split in its
own ranks if it begins to disarm, its refusal to budge on weapons
also serves a tactical purpose. Republicans have been arguing that
they might make an offer on disarming in return for a scaling down
of the British military presence.
</P>
<P>
   But while British and Irish senior security officials privately
acknowledge they are more concerned about the IRA using its weapons
than merely holding them _ reasoning it could rearm itself or use
fertilizer bombs _ they also believe the threat from dissident
republicans and loyalists remains too great to scale down just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has repeatedly said that republicans are committed to
disarming, and see it as essential to the success of the peace
process. The difference, Adams and other Sinn Fein leaders say, is
that it has to be done voluntarily, without deadlines set by the
unionists or the British.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's threat to resign
as leader of the power-sharing government that led Mandelson to
suspend the assembly instead. In an interview, Mandelson insisted
he had no alternative, and that Trimble's resignation would have
led to a collapse that would have made it harder to restore local
government, and virtually ensured that Trimble's moderate
leadership team would be replaced with hard-liners who do not want
to share power with nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandelson's decision to back the unionists led republicans,
and even some moderates, to claim that Britain had caved in again
into a unionist veto.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, republicans and unionists wield what amounts to veto
power. Either side can halt the peace process whenever it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Blair, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and, by
trans-Atlantic telephone, President Clinton are trying to bring
leverage on both sides, but mainly on republicans, to find a way
around the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   A senior US official here said ``nothing is off the table,''
including the cutting back on what has been the unfettered access
to the United States by Sinn Fein officials. Such a sanction,
however, would mean little to the IRA, and would actually bolster
IRA hard-liners who oppose the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been wary of being seen to take sides, White
House officials acknowledge the president had expected more out of
the IRA than the last-minute, conditional pledge to eventually put
its weapons ``beyond use,'' which failed to forestall the
suspension of the power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments hope cooler heads will prevail
in the next two or three weeks. But Mandelson said the drift cannot
continue indefinitely, because dissidents are likely to step in to
fill the vacuum with violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that's the only thing Peter Mandelson and Gerry
Adams agree on.

HAIDER'S NO HITLER, IF THAT IS ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KLAGENFURT, Austria _ Joerg Haider, the man who has been
described by some as the next Hitler, presides over a remote
province here that has about as many people as Worcester and,
leaving aside the surrounding snow-capped peaks, even looks
something like it.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office, here in this unexceptional city
surrounded by exceptional mountains, his collar open, the
50-year-old Haider looks more like the provincial governor he is
than the monster some warn he could become.
</P>
<P>
   And if one listens carefully, and then considers Haider's views
in the bigger context of world affairs, it raises the question of
whether his demonization has been overblown.
</P>
<P>
   As he rattles off the policies of his far-right Freedom Party,
Haider's anti-immigration stance sounds as if it could be lifted
from Pat Buchanan, or any politician whose constituency includes
the border with Mexico. His complaints of an unelected European
Commission dictating to member states about areas once the domain
of national sovereignty sound exactly like those voiced by
Euroskeptics in the eminently respectable British Conservative
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Haider sounds like many other conservatives and even,
when he talks about giving more money to stay-at-home mothers or
expounds on his opposition to the death penalty, like some
liberals.
</P>
<P>
   This is the next Hitler? Hitler exploited a postwar depression
in Europe's biggest country, where millions who were out of work or
needed someone to blame for their problems willingly followed his
fascist regime into an attempt at world domination and genocide of
European Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   Austria is a democratic country of 8 million people, with one of
the smallest unaligned armies in Europe. The country's unemployment
rate, at 4.2 percent, is the third-lowest in Europe, and it is one
of the most affluent countries in Europe. The retirement age is 57,
and people are complaining the government wants to raise it to 59.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Haider has cynically blamed foreigners for
Austria's woes, and has repeatedly played down the evils of the
Third Reich, portraying ordinary Nazis as misguided but basically
honorable people whose only real sin was to bet on the wrong horse.
But then, given that Haider's parents were among those ordinary
Austrians who enthusiastically joined the Nazis, it seems no
surprise that he will not denounce them. How many politicians
would?
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking things about the Haider phenomenon is
how many Jews in Austria distinguish between his xenophobia and his
alleged fascism _ finding him guilty of the first, but not the
second. Simon Wiesenthal, the illustrious Nazi hunter from Vienna,
insists that Haider is neither a fascist nor an anti-Semite.
Instead, he sees a right-wing populist who tells people what they
want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Haber, the courtly manager of Vienna's Jewish Museum,
recently found himself in the awkward position of telling Israelis
that their fears about Haider were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was visiting my daughter in Tel Aviv, where she lives, and I
was arguing with people all over the place,'' Haber explained,
shaking his head at the thought as he nursed a coffee in the
museum's quiet cafe. ``In Israel, I had to say it's not as
dangerous as it seems. But I learned to be more sensitive. I
understand the outrage, especially among Holocaust survivors and
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, nearly all of Austria's Jewish population has
lived in Vienna. There were 185,000 Jews in Vienna before the Nazis
annexed a willing Austria in 1938. Most fled, but some 60,000 died
in Nazi concentration camps. Today, there are just 12,000 Jews in
Vienna. The refusal of most Austrian Jews to compare Haider to
Hitler, says Haber, is because they know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling Haider a Nazi is not only inaccurate, it cheapens what
being a Nazi means,'' Haber said. ``I am very concerned about
Haider's antipathy toward foreigners. Having black hair and a
mustache here, you have problems. But this is not just a problem
with Haider. It's a problem in Austria as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even the Social Democrats, the liberals who ruled in
coalition with the mainstream conservative People's Party for much
of the last half-century, got tough on immigration in recent years.
Party spokesmen sheepishly explain the main motivation was to
prevent Haider from gaining power by exploiting public fears about
foreigners taking jobs and upsetting Austria's relatively stable
society.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Haider's followers are more worrying than he is. Thomas
Prinzhorn, whom Haider proposed for the new Cabinet, last year
claimed the previous government gave immigrants free hormone
injections ``to increase their fertility.'' Austrian President
Thomas Klestil, who figuratively held his nose when he approved the
new coalition government, refused to approve Prinzhorn's
appointment. Another one of Haider's aides whom Klestil refused to
approve for the Cabinet was behind last year's Freedom Party
campaign posters that warned of ``over-foreignization,'' a phrase
popularized by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Freedom Party houses some virulent racists, it
is hard to find any difference, in substance, between what they are
saying about immigrants and what most right-wing parties now in
opposition throughout most of Europe are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-foreigner sentiment is common. People in polite circles in
London, Paris, and Dublin dismiss most immigrants as freeloaders
who are responsible for increases in crime and taxes. Compared to
Austria, there has been more violence directed at foreigners in
several other European countries, including in some that have
denounced the rise of the Freedom Party and advocated sanctions by
the European Union against Haider.
</P>
<P>
   While European leaders who have canceled bilateral meetings with
the Austrian government say they have a moral duty to ostracize
Austria, there is also self-interest. Haider's party could
single-handedly veto the first batch of Eastern European countries
up for EU membership, three of which border Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, nearly 10 percent of whose population is foreign-born,
has the third-highest proportion of immigrants in Europe and fears
being swamped with workers from neighboring Hungary, Slovenia, and
the Czech Republic. But open borders are part of the price of EU
membership, which Austrians knew when 66 percent of them voted to
join the EU in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The international outcry over Haider has bolstered his
popularity at home _ including among people who didn't vote for
him, but who object to what they view as interference from the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most disturbing is that Haider's party could become so
popular, and xenophobia so socially acceptable, when Austria is
enjoying a period of prosperity and low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens,'' asks Walter Famler, who edits and publishes
the literary magazine Wesennpest, ``when things get bad here?''
</P>
<P>
   While it is unlikely to ever get as bad as when Hitler rose to
power, there is another Austrian politician Famler recalls when the
question of Haider's rise to power is considered.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the last century, a populist Vienna mayor named
Karl Lueger blamed foreigners for everything wrong in Austria. Like
Haider, Lueger was charismatic and a good orator. Unlike Haider, he
never apologized for his insensitive remarks, nor felt the
constraining force of world opinion, nor had to worry about
sanctions from his European neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lueger, Vienna's enlightened society, famed for its cafes,
opera, and civility gave way to a place where racism was openly
spouted and tolerated. Within 10 years of Lueger's election, a
young Adolf Hitler came to Vienna and began airing his theories on
Aryan superiority at the Cafe Sperl. An aspiring artist, Hitler was
rejected from Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, but the oratory skills
he acquired at Vienna's cafes served him well when he moved to
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider is not Hitler, but more like Karl Lueger,'' says
Famler.
</P>
<P>
   More historically accurate, perhaps, but Famler acknowledged
that even that comparison is not terribly reassuring.

ANTI-GOVERNMENT RHETORIC TURNS PERSONAL IN NEVADA

<P>
   Former Forest Supervisor Gloria Flora of the Humboldt-Toiyabe
National Forest resigned late November not only to get the U.S.
Forest Service's attention to the climate of hostility and
harassment surrounding Forest Service employees in the Elko area of
Nevada, but also to make the public aware.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, she said, ``I also wanted the public
in Nevada to pay particular attention to how some of their citizens
were behaving, including how some of their elected officials were
behaving.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Forest Service report on the situation, USFS
employees were refused service at restaurants and gas stations.
Their wives and children were cursed and verbally abused in
schools, at school bus stops, and in grocery stores. A bulldozer
operator at a mining operation tried to run down one USFS employee.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials, including members of Congress, were
bad-mouthing the Forest Service and its employees.
</P>
<P>
   The local newspaper, Elko Daily Free Press, added fuel to the
fire. One of its editorials defined ``fed bashing'' as ``roughly
standing up for the rights of the citizens.'' Another editorial
called Forest Service employees ``thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems to have been forgotten in the bombast is that USFS
employees were only following federal laws passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Flora paid a high price for alerting top officials of the Forest
Service and the public about the seriousness of the situation. She
ended 22 years of service in the Forest Service with her
resignation. There's no going back.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter of resignation, Flora addressed the climate of
hostility in the Elko area: ``People in rural communities who do
respect the law and accept responsibility for complying with it are
often rebuked or ridiculed. They are compared to collaborators with
the Vichy government in Nazi-controlled France! People who support
the federal government or conservation of natural resources ask
that they not be identified for fear of retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Flora is optimistic about what her resignation has set into
motion. It has begun a dialogue among leaders in Elko and
discussions in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service conducted an inquiry among its employees
working in the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest and issued a
report. And on Feb.
</P>
<P>
   18, U.S. Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck arrived in Elko to
talk to USFS employees and community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Flora commented on the antagonism between some elected leaders
in the West and the federal agencies that manage public lands:
``This issue is very critical, not just as a situation in Nevada.
We see pieces and parts of this kind of uncivil rhetoric and the
threats, and these thinly veiled threats of armed insurrection and
all these ultra-right wing kinds of attitudes. I think people need
to examine them and say how do these attitudes assist in solving
the dilemmas that we have facing us on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is room for everyone's opinion, but I don't think that
people's opinion, even if they are very far to the left or very far
to the right, should be expressed in such a way that it precludes
others from expressing theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   She agreed with the USFS report that blames some of the problems
on the Forest Service itself. When the Humboldt and Toiyabe
national forests were put under one administration and Flora made
the forest supervisor, there were fewer USFS employees left in
smaller communities and in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed in public lands management _ expectations of
public lands have changed, budgets have been cut, employee numbers
have been reduced, workloads have increased, and much of the work
isn't in the field as it once was. People now want information so
that data collection and organization is a major part of the work
USFS employees do. Yet most of the public still wants to see the
forest ranger in the field.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pivotal issues in the Elko-Forest Service conflict
has been the Forest Service closing the mile-and-a-half Jarbidge
South Canyon Road, which leads to a trail head. Dirt from the road
silts up a stream of bull trout, which can kill off the fish.
</P>
<P>
   The county claims it's the county's road. Elko County Manager
George Boucher said, ``The road brought on the dissension,'' but
that other Forest Service policy decisions caused the community's
irate responses and finally a breakdown of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Elko City Manager Linda Ritter said the anti-government
sentiment among some of the people in the county comes from
frustration with the Forest Service. She thinks Flora's resignation
over the climate of hostility ``blew the entire issue out of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck flew to Nevada to try to bridge the rift between the
Forest Service and the people of Elko County. He held separate
meetings to talk to his employees and then to talk to community
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Feb. 19, Dombeck said he thinks the conflict
over the closure of South Canyon Road contributed to the climate of
hostility, but blames the origins of the hostility on ``some of the
challenges that have occurred over the last several decades on the
authority of federal management of lands.''
</P>
<P>
   He clarified: ``I think you're really seeing cumulative effects
of a long history of concern and, to be realistic, when you have a
large proportion of a state like Nevada in federal ownership, the
stakes are high. The various sides care very deeply about these
issues.'' Approximately 83 percent of Nevada is federal public
land.
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck's meeting with community and state officials leads him
to believe that ``there's a real willingness on their part of
wanting to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck admitted that Flora's resignation brought attention to
the issues involved: ``My number one concern as I met with my
employees is, of course, employee safety. We absolutely cannot put
employees in unsafe situations whether it's a fire line and
employees fighting a wild fire or in anything we do. The report
verified that safety isn't the issue, it's how people feel. And, as
I said to the employees, that it's important to me that not only
they be safe but that they feel valued because they are proud of
what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service's report on the problems in Elko County
documents some of the hostile pressure brought to bear on USFS
employees. One employee said that when driving in a Forest Service
vehicle in northeast Nevada, ``I often feel like a `sitting duck,'
a target.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone working for a business were the victim of the kind of
harassment that targeted Forest Service employees in Elko County,
that person could file and win a lawsuit against that business.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-government rhetoric is an old tradition in the United
States and criticism of government practices has an honored place
in that tradition _ but when people are attacked instead of
government policies and decisions, then the rhetoric has taken a
wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to eliminate the personal attacks on Forest Service or
other federal land management personnel who are doing their jobs.

STREET RALLIES BESPEAK ANGER AT US FOR ISRAEL STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ The US Embassy compound here has the feel of a crusader
castle. It is perched on a rocky outcropping with a winding entry
that leads up to a bunkered complex ringed by massive stone walls,
gun turrets, and steel barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Officials inside this fortress are anticipating more
demonstrations this week reflecting the rising anger in Beirut
against what many here see as an unjust US policy that supports
Israel even when it hits civilian targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, who see the hand of Hezbollah in promoting the
demonstrations, say the anger nevertheless is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just got sick and tired of American support for
Israeli aggression,'' said Fouad Faris, 19, a college student who
describes himself as apolitical but who joined last week's
protests. ``Look at America hiding behind all this barbed wire, and
all these walls. If they had a fair policy, they wouldn't have to
do all this,'' Faris said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment notwithstanding, the security here is a holdover
from the 1980s, when Americans in Lebanon were the targets of
kidnappings and Hezbollah-orchestrated bombings and sniper attacks
that killed more than 260 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the seafront American Embassy, just 800 yards from the
new embassy, was destroyed by a bomb that killed 63 people,
including 17 Americans. Another bomb attack destroyed a barracks
near the airport, killing 239 US military personnel, including 218
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the shells of some of these buildings are visible from
the embassy compound, which has retreated to a more strategic
hilltop overlooking the sea. Noticeably absent are any Marines at
the guard posts. Instead, the embassy staffs Lebanese security
guards clad in black Kevlar vests and wielding M-16 machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the image of a diplomatic mission under siege, a
cluster of offices in small trailers is sealed in sheet metal, and
the central building is outfitted with steel-mesh cages to protect
windows from rocks and Molotov cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials, meanwhile, say they do not feel any danger
from the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that the protests are against US policy, and
analysts point out that the rhetoric and slogans being shouted
should not be confused with anti-American sentiment. Indeed, just
down the street from the protests is a commercial boulevard of
American commerce: a massive Burger King, a brand new Kentucky
Fried Chicken, and other American chains and outlets with glittery
window displays.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, one demonstrator holding a placard that read ``Death
to Israel, Death to America'' was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat
turned backward. Another young man in the crowd pressing against
the police line was wearing a ``South Carolina'' sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters also rallied in front of CNN's offices _
a unique expression of outrage against the global news channel and
what Lebanese perceive as a pro-Israeli bias in its coverage. One
mocking placard read: ``Q&AMP;A: Where is the other side of the
story?''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's airstrikes on Lebanon this month, in which three power
stations were destroyed and 20 civilians wounded, were in
retaliation for Hezbollah attacks on its soldiers in southern
Lebanon. The guerrillas have killed seven Israeli soldiers in a
series of attacks since Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Observers here say the recent demonstrations are significant,
largely because they seem to be uniting Lebanon with Hezbollah in a
way that it never has been.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when Israel retaliated for Hezbollah's shelling of
northern Israel by targeting civilian infrastructure and killing
five Lebanese civilians, there were no such demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a backlash against Hezbollah, which was seen by
many Lebanese as contributing to the cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
   But not this time. Now, the Lebanese believe Hezbollah hit
legitimate military targets when it killed Israeli soldiers who are
occupying southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time Hezbollah played its cards very well,'' one diplomat
in the region put it.
</P>
<P>
   In the US compound ringed by concertina wire, Anne O'Leary, a
spokeswoman for the embassy, said the demonstrations ruined the
visit of an orchestra from Keene, N.H., which was performing a
series of concerts as a sign of American solidarity with the
Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the day after Israeli airstrikes near Beirut,
hundreds of student protesters swarmed the concert at American
University in Beirut and heckled US Ambassador David Satterfield by
chanting ``shame, shame'' throughout the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Another concert scheduled for Thursday was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerts were to be a symbol of our confidence in their
country and its stability, and were much appreciated by many
Lebanese,'' O'Leary said. ``It was ironic that the events instead
became a magnet for student protesters who overshadowed the good
they intended to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nizar Hamzi, a political scientist at American University, and
an expert on Hezbollah, says the ``anger in the street is
legitimate, and real.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sees the demonstrations as an effort by the Islamic
guerrillas to shore up public support, especially among students,
as the group's political leadership faces an uncertain future if
Israel pulls its forces out of the occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, more than 10,000 people were in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are gathering in the street because they have found
rare common ground,'' said Charles Adwan, a researcher at the
Lebanese Center for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not only Hezbollah, this was Christian students,
Sunni students, a mix of student political parties; there were
those who support Syrian presence in Lebanon and those who
adamantly oppose it. There was the whole spectrum of Lebanese
voices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is legitimate anger,'' he said, ``and America would do
well to listen to it.''

   KASULO, Tanzania _ Every morning, Daniel Kyiyuga walks six miles
over rolling hills to check the banana groves and corn fields of
his farm. The crops, the only source of his income, often bear
signs of looting from the night before.
</P>
<P>
   It is the price he pays for living so close to the sprawling
refugee camps along Tanzania's western border with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be happy if the refugees went home,'' Kyiyuga said,
sitting on the stoop of the mud-brick house he rents in this
roadside village, his toddler son nestled in his lap. ``If I stay
on the farm, armed bandits can come and kill my family.''
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi has sent
hundreds of thousands of people fleeing into seven camps stretched
along the Tanzanian frontier. At the height of the influx, shortly
after the 1994 genocide that left 800,000 ethnic Tutsi dead in
Rwanda, the two camps near here swelled with 500,000 refugees,
dwarfing the local population.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees attract foreign aid organizations, which bring in
money for roads, water systems, and schools. Fifteen miles down the
road in Ngara, the main town in northwestern Tanzania, business is
booming. They also represent cheap labor for the surrounding towns
and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But the displaced also pose security and environmental problems.
They cut down forests for firewood, hunt the wildlife for meat, and
attract armed rebels looking for food, shelter, and new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Rwandans were repatriated in 1996. There are now
about 310,000 refugees in all the camps, 100,000 in the two near
Kasulo, according to the Ngara field office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees. Of those, only about 5,000 are
Rwandans, some of whom are believed to be tied to the Hutu
extremist groups that carried out the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanzanian police require cars to ride with armed escorts
along the stretches of road between the camps and the border.
Locals fear for their lives. Night watchmen patrol Kasulo with a
large drum to signal the villagers in case of an attack by thieves.
</P>
<P>
   As Nelson Mandela, the former South African president, convenes
peace talks on Burundi's civil war in Arusha, Tanzania, regional
security experts worry that heightening rhetoric about ethnic
hatred among warring parties in the region could spark a new mass
exodus into Tanzania. Already, as many as 200 people arrive at the
two camps here each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of specific concern is the ongoing and growing tension between
Burundi and Tanzania over the fact that the Burundian refugee camps
just across the border in northwestern Tanzania are being actively
used by Burundian rebels to recruit as well as allegedly train and
store arms _ on an ongoing basis _ to launch large-scale attacks in
southern and southwestern Burundi,'' Jan van Eck, a consultant to
the Arusha talks from the Center for Conflict Resolution in Cape
Town, wrote in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR confirms the presence of Rwandan Hutu rebels in the areas
around Kasulo.
</P>
<P>
   Security issues aside, the refugees make life hard on the locals
in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Burigi Game Park's rear boundary is only about four miles from
the two camps. During the peak of the Rwandan influx, the park's
animal populations were vastly depleted, according to Leonce
Batandana, an environmentalist at the Relief to Development
Society, a UN-affiliated organization in Ngara.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam has measured declines in the underground water table due
to usage in the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Alabyoma, a resident of Kasulo, worries about how she'll
cook her beans and corn. ``Before the refugees came, we could find
plenty of firewood nearby,'' she said. ``Now we have to walk miles
to find enough.''

GOTH ROCK SHINES ON `BLOODFLOWERS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``Bloodflowers''; The Cure; Elektra/Fiction) 
 
By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 20 albums and 20 years, the King of Mope, Cure singer
Robert Smith, has finally found his niche. Turns out it wasn't too
far from where he began. His band's latest, ``Bloodflowers,'' finds
Smith doing what he does best: whining poetically, and sometimes
jubilantly, about the ills of the world, so that the rest of us
don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   The Cure actually has been two bands during its career. It began
with the prancing guitars of ``Boys Don't Cry,'' but has recently
been wrapped in drawn-out suicide notes like 1992's ``From the Edge
of the Deep Green Sea.'' After spending the '80s as a decadent punk
band turned alternative rock icon, the group wallowed through the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Cure once again is recognizable as the band that
created ``Lovecats'' and ``Let's Go To Bed.'' Smith is the band
now, and his wailing Halloween howl has always been the constant.
On ``Bloodflowers,'' the second part of its winning combo _ warped
guitar lines and ``Phantom of the Opera'' imagery _ have returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lost like Austin Powers' mojo since 1987's ``Kiss Me, Kiss Me,
Kiss Me'' album, the group spent the '90s trying to get the balance
back. The result was sonic lithium on ``Wish'' and insincere joy on
the aptly titled ``Wild Mood Swings.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Bloodflowers,'' Smith has finally stopped trying to
please anybody but himself. ``Out of This World'' and ``Watching Me
Fall'' are long, winding, guitar-shearing Goth tales featuring
Smith climbing over it all like he hasn't done since ``The Hanging
Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the ``Birds Always Fly'' is a beautiful cousin to ``In
Between Days.'' Distinct multiple guitar voices couple with
sustained one-chord piano breaks. Most beautifully horrifying is
``Maybe Someday,'' which finds the Cure once again fitting
complicated horror into a shiny pop-rock box.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Smith and the Cure are doing again what they once did
so well, pushing alternative rock forward and nay-saying those who
swear the genre is dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's not. ``Bloodflowers'' proves that. It's the band's best
since 1985's ``The Head on the Door.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   ``The Next Best Thing''; Music from the Motion Picture; Maverick) 
 
By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be it the big screen or the spinning disc, when it comes to the
upcoming movie ``The Next Best Thing,'' only one person apparently
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   For months there's been buzz about the Material Girl playing a
regular Jane who conceives a baby with her gay best friend. That
friend is Rupert Everett, but at this point, he's been something of
a side note.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes with the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 tracks of interesting, multilingual, bass-heavy
dance grooves on ``The Next Best Thing,'' but the only one most
seem to care about is the Boy Toy's remake of Don McLean's
``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Madonna's electronic, William Orbit-ized cover of
``the day the music died'' isn't bad musically. She's clipped the
lyrics and replaced McLean's innocent guitar strumming with a close
encounter of the synthesized kind, but her voice is infinitely more
listenable than that of the '70s folkie.
</P>
<P>
   The unsettling question for Madonna fans should be why she did
it. After 17 years of pushing the boundaries of pop and being the
trendsetter, why fall back on a twee oater that was previously
covered by the Brady Bunch? McLean recorded it as a tribute to the
death of Buddy Holly, which certainly has no relation to ``The Next
Best Thing'' story line.
</P>
<P>
   Before overthinking it, check out some of the CD's other tracks.
``Boom Boom Ba'' by Metisse is Euro-chic rave music, sung in French
for a sexy edge. And Olive's drum-machine version of the 10cc disco
hit ``I'm Not In Love'' has rescued that song f bargain
rack. Manu Chao's ``Bongo Bongo'' makes him the Latin lover Lou
Bega would love to be.
</P>
<P>
   The real Madonna-esque song here is Mandalay's ``This Life,''
which could sit next to a ballad like ``Rain'' or ``Take a Bow'' on
her greatest-hits disc. It makes one wonder how healthy it is when
others are doing Madonna better then Ms. Ciccone herself.

AFFLECT GETS BIGGEST ROLE YET IN `REINDEER GAMES' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Actors often look bigger onscreen than in the flesh,
but Ben Affleck has got it backward. He's a sizable guy, 6-foot-3,
and broad-shouldered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that and his all-American handsomeness, the first
impression when he walks in the room is that of the proverbial
``regular guy,'' a well-grounded, likable 27-year-old who wouldn't
stand out in a crowd unless you'd seen him in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go to the bookstore. Sometimes you can wear a hat and,
by your carriage and demeanor (not be noticed),'' says Affleck, who
on this day is dressed casually in a gray crew-neck sweater layered
over a white T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   So Affleck may be playing against type in a bit role as a
stock-market scam recruiter in ``Boiler Room,'' which just opened,
but he is well-cast as a regular guy in ``Reindeer Games,'' opening
Friday. Well, as regular as any other guy just getting out of
prison after serving five years for car theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' is an unpretentious little thriller from
renowned director John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian Candidate,''
``The Fixer,'' ``Ronin''). It's a modern version of the old film
noir B-movie in which some poor chump ends up in a tight spot,
where everything he does right goes wrong and leads him deeper and
deeper into trouble. That's what happens to Rudy, Affleck's
character. ``Reindeer Games'' has more slippery twists and turns
than an oiled Slinky.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck's co-stars are Charlize Theron (``The Cider House
Rules'') and Gary Sinise (``George Wallace'' and the upcoming
``Mission to Mars'').
</P>
<P>
   They are eager to confirm Affleck's reputation as a fun-loving,
easygoing guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's a great guy,'' Sinise says. ``He's funny, he's charming,
he's got a very natural behavioral thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an easy guy to be around. I like him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Theron was even more flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Ben,'' she says. ``Ben makes work so easy. It's his
spirit that shows up to work that makes the job so much easier. If
you only have that and nothing else, it's such a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds so impossible, but I swear, there was not one day he
showed up for work in a bad mood. You'd walk into the makeup and
hair trailer and he wanted to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   After numerous roles in mostly unseen movies and a few
successful independents, such as ``Dazed and Confused,'' Affleck
hit the jackpot with ``Good Will Hunting,'' a film he and pal Matt
Damon wrote together. Damon took the lead role and won the glory,
but Affleck got noticed as his onscreen buddy. By the time they won
an Oscar for their screenplay _ looking like naughty Boy Scouts in
their tuxedos and Cheshire grins, with their mothers as dates _
they were both launched toward stardom.
</P>
<P>
   In the two fast years since ``Good Will Hunting,'' Affleck has
made up for the many years when he was eager for any role by doing
11 movies, including ``Armageddon,'' ``Shakespeare in Love,''
``Forces of Nature,'' ``Dogma'' (for pal Kevin Smith) and ``Boiler
Room.'' He also has a role in ``Daddy'' and ``Them,'' an upcoming
film written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   His salary has gone from next to nothing (for Smith films such
as ``Mallrats'' and ``Chasing Amy'') to a reported $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, he also dated Gwyneth Paltrow, with whom he worked
on ``Shakespeare in Love,'' though according to both, that has gone
from romance to affectionate buddy status.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarence Williams III, Affleck's co-star in ``Reindeer
Games,'' told reporters that Paltrow was a frequent visitor to the
film's remote Canadian location, where she spent a lot of time
holding hands with Affleck. And Affleck and Paltrow will be
reunited onscreen this summer in ``Bounce,'' a romantic drama.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck has been on a personal rocket as hot as the one he rode
in ``Armageddon,'' but he's tried not to let it affect him. It
hasn't always been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strange thing happens where you have no success in your
life whatsoever, and then you get some,'' he says. ``It's thrilling
and exciting and ... you get scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really. All of a sudden, you have something to lose, you know
what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck, who never runs short of words, says he's getting it in
hand now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has settled down a little bit, thank you very much. It
was a little bit crazy for a while, and now I'm sort of settling
in. Not so prone to be freaked out by highs and lows and different
things that happen,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He may be enjoying himself, but Rudy sure isn't having any fun
in ``Reindeer Games.'' Though he gets to spend most of the story
traipsing around the countryside with Theron, ideas of romance soon
get sidetracked in the maze that is the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was filmed in northern British Columbia, near Prince
George, which Affleck calls ``the furthest north civilized city of
western civilization.'' The actors spent a lot of time cold and
miserable, especially in a scene in which Affleck and Theron fall
through the frozen surface of a lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' is the first time Affleck has been in the
position of carrying a big-budget major film as the star. (In
``Forces of Nature,'' Sandra Bullock was the big name.) He admits
that he felt a little trepidation about the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, sure,'' he says. ``The way I came into this business was
with people who were, like, near to my age and near to my
experience and near to my level of experience. It's not like
working with an icon of cinema (Frankenheimer), where you naturally
defer to that person's experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy may be just smart enough to keep his head above icy waters,
but not smart enough to keep himself from sinking deeperire
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he's a little thick,'' Affleck says of Rudy. ``One of
the things I loved about this character was that they don't make
movies with this kind of protagonist any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This character is like these tough-luck '60s film-noir
protagonists who always struggled and never had a sense of what
they were doing. Like (Jack) Nicholson's character, getting beaten
up and getting his nose cut open in `Chinatown.' He's always behind
the curve of what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more interesting to me, to watch a guy who is a little
confused and suffering a little more, than somebody you know is
going to win and figure everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' is, at $34 million, the most expensive movie
ever financed by Miramax (through its Dimension logo), which is no
surprise since, in addition to Affleck's salary, Theron, Sinise and
Frankenheimer don't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   It won't go down as a classic on any of their resumes, but
Affleck is confident it will do well with audiences looking for a
little escapism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, films noir were B-movies. They weren't high
drama. They were popcorn entertainment. We've sort of gotten away
from that. Movies that were fun and didn't try to take themselves
too seriously. Escapist entertainment that was still sort of
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck also wants to continue not taking himself too seriously.
He kept going back to his respect for director Frankenheimer, both
as a filmmaker and an example of how to survive in the movie
business by focusing on work, not the publicity or fame that comes
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to surrender yourself to the process and act of
doing the stuff, because (otherwise) you can drive yourself
crazy,'' Affleck says. ``That was a good lesson to learn. In
keeping with that I've been able to find some normalcy and settle
into my life and focus on the things that are important to me.''

ANTI-DEATH ACTIVISTS JOIN WOMAN IN HER PLEA TO BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the scheduled execution of Betty Lou Beets
looming less than a week away, anti-death penalty activists have
stepped up the pressure on Gov. George W. Bush to halt the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the Texas Catholic Conference and a host
of family violence groups have called on Bush and the Texas Board
of Pardons and Paroles to spare Beets' life.
</P>
<P>
   Once a strawberry-blonde who hustled beer in a tavern near Gun
Barrel City, Beets today is 62, gray-haired with deep furrows in a
face that reflects a hard life. The ninth-grade drop-out is
scheduled for execution Thursday for the 1983 murder of former
Dallas firefighter Jimmy Don Beets, her fifth husband. Prosecutors
contend he was killed in an attempt to cash in on a $110,000
pension and life insurance package.
</P>
<P>
   Beets pleaded her case to Bush through a television interview
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking you to let me live,'' she said, her voice cracking
with emotion in a broadcast on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
``I'm asking for mercy. And I'm asking for that compassion and I'm
praying you will allow it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would make no decision until the parole board makes
its recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no unilateral right to stop an execution,'' he said.
``Secondly, all facts of a case need to be considered. And the
thing I consider is whether or not a jury has heard all the facts
and whether or not the person is guilty of the crime committed and
whether or not the person has had full access to the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   If her death sentence is carried out, Beets will be the second
woman put to death in Texas under modern capital punishment
statutes. She would also be the oldest along with another
62-year-old inmate executed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Beets was indicted but never tried in the slaying of her fourth
husband, Doyle Wayne Barker, a construction worker who disappeared
in 1981. She pleaded guilty in 1972 to shooting her second husband,
Billy Y. Lane, who survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe all life is sacred, even the life of a person who
has committed a heinous crime,'' said Richard Daley, executive
director of the Texas Catholic conference. The conference is the
public policy arm of the Catholic Bishops Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can protect society from these people without killing
them,'' Daley added.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic bishops are asking Bush not only to spare Beets' life,
but to issue a moratorium on all executions until the state can be
assured that no innocent person is sent to the execution chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has said the Texas Constitution does not empower
him to halt all executions, Daley and other abolitionists argue
that he could encourage the 18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles
to halt executions on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   They have drawn strength from Illinois Gov. George Ryan, also a
Republican, who last month called a halt to executions after a
college journalism class study revealed that 17 men were sent to
death row for crimes they did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Texas leads the nation in the number of executions carried out
in modern times, with 205 men and one woman put to death since the
state resumed executions in 1982. Of those, 119 have been carried
out while Bush has been in office, although most of those
executions were cases that had been wending their way through the
courts long before Bush was elected.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Texas Council on Family Violence, the
National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Amnesty
International also have urged Bush to grant Beets a commutation of
sentence, alleging she has endured ``repeated sexual, physical and
emotional abuse ... throughout her life'' and ``severe and repeated
beatings'' by Jimmy Don Beets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush must ensure that Texas does not commit the final act
of violence against this woman,'' said Shelia Dauer, director of
Amnesty International's Women's Human Rights Program.
</P>
<P>
   Adds &UR;  &LR; Juley Fulcher, of the National Council Against domestic
Violence, ``It will be a terrible miscarriage of justice if Texas
executes this battered woman without hearing her story.''
</P>
<P>
   Beets' story of abuse, however, is a relatively recent one. In
several letters to the Houston Chronicle and an extensive interview
dating back to 1989, Beets never once mentioned having been
battered by any of her husbands, raped repeatedly or abused as a
child, as her clemency petition now contends.
</P>
<P>
   At her trial, one of Beets' daughters mentioned abuse in
passing, testifying that her mother claimed she had shot husband
No. 4 because she was tired of being beat and wanted him out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Baggett, the warden at the Mountain View Unit in
Gatesville, where death-sentenced women are housed, said the
battered wife claims are new _ as are the tears she has shed in
numerous media interviews in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Baggett has worked at the unit for most of the past 11 years,
becoming well-acquainted with Beets, and she said it has been only
recently that she has heard the grandmother talk about being a
battered wife.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beets' advocates suggest that her failure to mention repeated
episodes of abuse are typical of battered women who try to keep the
abuse secret out of fear, shame and humiliation. They also fault
her trial attorney for failing to present any mitigating evidence
on Beets' behalf at trial.
</P>
<P>
   But James Donald Beets, the son of her victim, says his father
never abused his former stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy was not an abuser,'' he said. ``My daddy can't stand
up and defend himself. ... For the first year after they were
married, she went around town telling everybody my daddy was the
best thing that ever happened to her.''
</P>
<P>
   And James Beets said all anyone need do to discover the true
Betty Lou Beets is to ``look into her cold, black eyes. They might
be blue, but look deep into her soul. They're black.''
</P>
<P>
   He accuses Beets of ``abusing the system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's hollering `abused grandma' and all that,'' James Beets
said. ``But what about my daddy? My kids have never known their
granddaddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of five, grandmother of nine and great-grandmother of
six, Beets is a former barmaid who once was charged with public
lewdness during an audition as a topless dancer. She was reared in
North Carolina in a sharecropper's shack, married the first time at
15, and was a grandmother by the time she was 36.
</P>
<P>
   Since her conviction, two of Beets' daughters have done jail and
prison time on prostitution and drug charges. Shirley Furgala
Branson is serving a one-year sentence for possession of a
controlled substance and has served jail time on three different
prostitution charges. She is housed in a prison across the street
from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter, Phyllis Ann Coleman of Balch Springs, has a
string of at least six prostitution convictions and served time in
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on possession of heroin
charges before she was discharged in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Beets was convicted of capital murder in the death of Jimmy Don
Beets, who was shot multiple times in the back of the head. Beets
reported her husband missing in 1983, and authorities initially
thought he had drowned in a boating accident on Cedar Creek Lake,
near the couple's trailer home in Gun Barrel City.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Henderson County authorities, acting on an
anonymous tip and armed with a search warrant, discovered the
missing man's body in a shallow grave beneath a wishing-well flower
bed.
</P>
<P>
   They made an unexpected find as well: the body of Barker, her
fourth husband, buried in a shallow grave under a patio at the rear
of the home. He had been reported missing in 1981 and he, too, had
been shot several times in the back of the head. Beets was indicted
in Barker's death, but was never tried for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of Jimmy Don Beets' killing, Betty Beets had moved
an ex-con who had done time for theft and killing his wife, into
her home, prison and court records show.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Beets, who in recent days has said she wants to be
remembered as a loving family matriarch, accused her daughter,
Shirley Stegner Furgala, then 24, of killing Barker, and her son
Robert F. ``Robbie'' Branson II, then 18, of killing Jimmy Don
Beets.
</P>
<P>
   Both children testified for the state, saying their mother had
shot both men and that they had helped bury the bodies _ the exact
opposite of Beets' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Her appeals lawyers have argued that Beets did not receive
adequate representation at trial, calling her trial lawyer a
``corrupt trial attorney ... who sold her out for his own profits''
when he demanded book rights to her story in payment for
representing her.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals initially overturned the
case, saying the state's murder-for-hire statute applied only in
cases involving hired killers and not in cases where the
remuneration involved pension or insurance benefits. The court
changed its mind on rehearing, though, and reinstated the
conviction. Trying her for murder for remuneration was the only way
the state could get a death sentence under Texas law at that the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Beets' case, though, prompted the Legislature to rewrite the
murder-for-hire definition to include situations like hers.
</P>
<P>
   Then a federal judge overturned her conviction, saying not only
was her attorney's book deal unethical but he should have withdrawn
from the case so he could testify on her behalf. The attorney, E.
Ray Anderson, has said that Beets did not know about the pension or
life insurance until he told her she could collect those benefits.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that judge's
ruling and reimposed the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   James Beets said he will be on hand Thursday to witness the
execution, although he said he is not relishing the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgive her with all my heart, I really do,'' he said.``And
I ask God to forgive her.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONROE, Texas _ Jimmy Chilcutt is not someone most people would
associate with the kind of wild, unsubstantiated stories that show
up in supermarket tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Chilcutt, 54, is skeptical by nature. His job as a fingerprint
technician at the Conroe Police Department requires hard-nosed
judgments and painstaking attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   He is highly regarded by agents of the FBI, the Drug Enforcement
Administration, and state and local law enforcement agencies
because of his innovative techniques and ability to find
fingerprints where others fail.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing what comes naturally _ being careful and thorough _
he ended up rocking his own skepticism about one of the most
sensational tales that routinely show up in the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Chilcutt's quest to squeeze more information out of fingerprints
led him to develop a rare expertise in nonhuman primate prints. He
tried to use his special knowledge to debunk alleged evidence of
Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch.
</P>
<P>
   But his examination of alleged Bigfoot footprint castings didn't
lead to the conclusion he had expected. He now believes that _
while some of them are fakes _ some are the genuine prints of a
reclusive animal that has yet to be documented and studied.
</P>
<P>
   The path to Chilcutt's unusual investigation began with an idea
he had in 1995. ``If I could look at fingerprints and could tell
the sex, gender and race, I'd be way ahead,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He began examining fingerprints to determine whether there were
differences based on race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every time I thought I had it right, I'd be wrong,''
Chilcutt said.
</P>
<P>
   It finally occurred to him that the key to understanding human
fingerprints could lie in nonhuman primates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Darwin was correct, if we did in fact evolve, we should be
able to study primate prints,'' Chilcutt reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Primates are members of the order of mammals that includes
humans, great apes, monkeys and lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   Chilcutt said he hoped to find primordial characteristics that
would unlock hidden information in human fingerprints. First, he
had to convince a zoo or a research center to allow him to take
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to find somebody who would let you fingerprint
their monkey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After being rebuffed about 25 times over three months, he called
Ken Glander, director of the Duke University Primate Center in
Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wasn't sure that it wasn't one of my friends
playing a joke on me,'' Glander said about his initial reaction.
``But it didn't take long talking to him to realize that this was a
legitimate request.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by Chilcutt's expertise, Glander offered prints from
his collection of lemurs. But Chilcutt was primarily interested in
apes, so Glander steered him to the Yerkes Regional Primate Center
at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kaylee Summerville, occupational health program coordinator at
Yerkes, said Chilcutt's request was received with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had one like it before or since,'' she said. ``It
was unusual, but in the study of primates we get unusual requests
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   After checking Chilcutt's credentials, the center arranged for
him to take prints of apes at the Atlanta zoo during an annual
medical checkup, while the apes were anesthetized.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chilcutt has amassed a collection of about 1,000
nonhuman primate prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a fantastic, incredible sample size,'' Glander said.
``I've been working with primates for 30 years. I started in 1970.
I have about 350 prints.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there are only about four or five researchers working
with nonhuman fingerprints. ``All are biologists,'' Glander said.
``We don't have fingerprint expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilcutt studied the primate prints and discovered
characteristics that distinguish different species and traits
within species. He said he has become an expert on primate prints
through long study of his samples, although he is not yet able to
decipher human fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   But an opportunity arose in December 1998 to put his rare
knowledge to use. He was at his home in Montgomery, which is about
40 north of downtown Houston, reading a book one evening, barely
paying attention to a TV program about Bigfoot.
</P>
<P>
   His interest was piqued, however, when he heard the term
``dermal ridges,'' a reference to fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   He listened closely as Jeff Meldren, associate professor of
anatomy at Idaho State University, held a casting of a supposed
Bigfoot footprint and pointed to what appeared to be the loops and
whorls of prints.
</P>
<P>
   Believing he could determine the authenticity of the prints,
Chilcutt phoned Meldren, a specialist in primate anatomy and
locomotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a Sasquatch, only a handful of people in the world
know the difference between a primate and a human print,'' Chilcutt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meldren said he was delighted to find someone who could help
authenticate his collection of about 100 castings of supposed
Bigfoot footprints.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical Chilcutt arrived in Pocatello, Idaho, last April and
began studying the collection.
</P>
<P>
   He first examined the casting Meldren had shown on TV and
quickly determined it to be a fake. The toeprints were actually
human fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Meldren turned him loose on the entire collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I actually found surprised even me,'' Chilcutt said.
</P>
<P>
   The print ridges on the bottoms of five castings _ which were
taken at different times and locations _ flowed lengthwise along
the foot, unlike human prints, which flow from side to side, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way do human footprints do that _ never, ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skeptic in me had to believe that (all of the prints were
from) the same species of animal,'' Chilcutt said. ``I believe that
this is an animal in the Pacific Northwest that we have never
documented.''
</P>
<P>
   Meldren, for whom the study of Bigfoot prints is a sideline,
believes it's a legitimate, scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A misconception is often perpetrated that this should be
relegated to the tabloids,'' he said. ``The question is, what made
the tracks? They are there; that is indisputable. It's either a
hoax or the track of a living animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Chilcutt has brought his expertise to that question.
We will never know for sure until a specimen is collected. Until
then, it's unscientific, in my opinion, to dismiss this evidence
without giving it an airing.''
</P>
<P>
   Glander, who was casually acquainted with Meldren when Meldren
taught briefly at Duke, said: ``Do I believe in Bigfoot? I don't
know, but I think it's one of those things that is interesting and
intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   Glander likened Meldren's research to his own study of lemurs in
Madagascar, where he hopes to find a species of lemur believed to
be extinct. ``Does that make me a crackpot? I don't think so.''

<P>
   VILLA EL SALVADOR, Peru _ Nearly every neighborhood in this
sprawling slum has a concrete basketball court, a child-care center
and a soup kitchen that ladles out 30-cent meals.
</P>
<P>
   To remind residents of the man most responsible for these
improvements, huge white letters spelling the name of President
Alberto Fujimori's political movement emblazon the hillside
overlooking Villa El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fujimori has all of our support,'' said Irene Saez, 64, who
works at a center that distributes state food. ``I don't think any
other government would do as much for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Government programs, which hand out nearly $300 million in food
annually, aggressively target some of the most wretched pockets of
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The largess has resulted in widespread support for Fujimori
among the poor, who make up half of Peru's population of 24 million
people, and, according to analysts, could propel the president to
victory in April 9 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics describe the war on poverty as a crude patronage
system designed to ensure election-day loyalty to Fujimori, who is
running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of public works, land giveaways and
direct aid,'' said Guillermo Loli of the Lima polling firm Apoyo.
``It's a very effective way to buy votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the anti-poverty program has made some strides, critics
also contend that it has addicted the population to handouts.
</P>
<P>
   The government's effort is evident in Villa El Salvador, a slum
on the southern edge of the capital of Lima that was founded by
squatters 30 years ago and now is home to 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   For the past eight years, Isabel Mena, 35, has volunteered at a
state-sponsored soup kitchen. In exchange for peeling potatoes and
shucking corn, she receives free food for her family of five.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchens were set up in the late 1980s amid food shortages
and economic chaos. The program expanded under Fujimori, who was
first elected in 1990, and became a permanent part of the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for the poor people who really need the help, such as
single mothers and abandoned children,'' Mena said. ``If it weren't
for the kitchens, we would be in bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Mena would prefer a paying job and complains that unemployment
is the biggest problem in Villa El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   But she credits Fujimori for taming hyperinflation and for
crushing the Shining Path guerrilla movement, which killed hundreds
of people in Villa El Salvador in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, she wonders whether a different president
would eliminate her soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   As election day nears, many observers claim that the Fujimori
administration has capitalized on such fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's daily lives are very linked to the survival of this
government, or at least that's how they perceive it,'' said Diego
Garcia-Sayan of the Andean Commission of Jurists, a legal aid group
in Lima. ``It's not that they are pro- or anti-Fujimori. But they
are receiving something concrete, and they fear that they could
lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a critical report released this month, the Washington Office
on Latin America noted that 42.5 percent of all Peruvian households
receive food aid. The think tank warned that the government is
manipulating this lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offering or threatening to withdraw food aid in exchange for
political support appears to have become a common tool of the
Fujimori government,'' the report said. ``While previous
governments also engaged in such practices, never before has the
phenomenon been so widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Chavez, a legislator aligned with Fujimori, insists that
results _ not threats _ are the reason that poor people will vote
for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a government makes good on its promises, it will
naturally have the advantage'' in elections, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another resource at the government's disposal is land.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, thousands of squatters have taken over private
property in Villa El Salvador. Though army troops later forced them
to move, Fujimori promised that all homeless people in urban areas
would be eligible for plots of vacant land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This experience will be repeated throughout the country, and
the delivery of land will be free,'' Fujimori said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate Federico Salas promptly accused the
government of violating electoral laws by handing out public
property during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that after 10 years in power and just weeks
before the election, (the government) has just now become concerned
about the lack of housing in Peru,'' Salas said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such controversies, development experts say that
Fujimori has had some success in reducing misery. Between 1991 and
1997, the number of Peruvians living in poverty decreased from 57.4
percent to 50.7 percent, according to the Lima research center
Cuanto.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Washington Office on Latin America, food
distribution programs are a dubious way to fight poverty. That's
because they do nothing to increase the ability of people to buy or
grow food for themselves. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``If this were the United States, we would say that President
Fujimori has reduced poverty by putting people on welfare,'' the
group said in its report.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also creates dependency, according to Gloria Tejada,
of the international aid group Caritas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It conditions people to avoid doing things for themselves,''
she said. ``It's a policy that has people holding out their
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez, the pro-Fujimori legislator, said emergency food
programs are necessary to combat cases of extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they suggest as an alternative?'' she asked. ``That
the people die of hunger?''

FUJIMORI WANTS THIRD TERM IN OFFICE, LEGAL OR NOT 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ He took on Maoist terrorists and won. He
resurrected a dying economy. And over the years, he has racked up
higher poll ratings than any other Peruvian head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet President Alberto Fujimori, who is the overwhelming favorite
to win the April 9 election, has come under intense criticism for
his heavy-handed maneuvers to hang onto his job.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors say that, without major changes by the
government, a free and fair vote may be almost impossible because
of harassment of candidates, unbalanced media coverage and a surge
in public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts argue that Fujimori, who took office in 1990 and
was re-elected five years later, should not be allowed on the
ballot. That's because a constitutional provision bans sitting
presidents from serving three consecutive five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``His main concern is staying in power, and he's going to get
there by hook or by crook,'' said Hernando de Soto, a former
economic adviser to Fujimori. ``He's got the media controlled. He's
bullied his main opponents. In a way, you could say he's got it
pretty well rigged.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, observers from the Atlanta-based Carter Center seemed
to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori enjoys so many advantages, they said, that conditions
for a fair election have not yet been established. They urged the
government to ``act swiftly to restore public confidence in the
electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even on a level playing field, opposition candidates would
be in for a dogfight.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10 years in office, Fujimori, the son of Japanese
immigrants, has received higher job-approval ratings than any other
Peruvian president, according to Guillermo Loli of the Lima polling
firm Apoyo. A January survey put Fujimori's popularity rating at 58
percent.
</P>
<P>
   When first sworn in as president a decade ago, Fujimori took
over a nation reeling from hyperinflation, food shortages and
attacks by Shining Path, a hard-line Maoist guerrilla organization.
</P>
<P>
   His authoritarian tendencies were evident almost from the start.
He once suggested that ``perhaps an emperor would be good for
Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing an obstructionist Congress in 1992, Fujimori ordered
tanks into the streets. He closed Congress and the courts and
declared one-man rule. The moves, though condemned abroad, were
popular at home.
</P>
<P>
   The government then decimated Shining Path by capturing its
supreme leader, Abimael Guzman. A radical program of reforms opened
Peru to foreign investment, leading to the highest economic growth
rate in Latin America in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic institutions were eventually restored, and Fujimori
easily won re-election in 1995 with 64 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's second term, however, has been marred by what critics
call a systematic drive to concentrate power in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the Washington Office on Latin
America think tank, the Fujimori government has erased meaningful
checks and balances by gutting the Supreme Court, harassing the
press and giving exceptional power to the state intelligence
service. A rubber-stamp Congress has approved most of the
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past decade in Peru has witnessed the steady dismantling
of the basic institutional structures of democratic governance,''
the think tank's report said. ``Peru represents a new form of
`hybrid authoritarianism' where the formal trappings of democracy
are maintained but are often neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``The Fujimori File,'' author Sally Bowen calls
Peru's current government ``one of the most sinister, durable and
effective power machines to emerge in Latin America in recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's most controversial move during his second term has
been his insistence on running again.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 constitution allows sitting presidents to stand for
re-election just once. In 1996, however, Congress passed a law that
``reinterprets'' the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The provision says, in effect, that because Fujimori was
originally elected under the old charter, his first term does not
apply toward the re-election ban, making him eligible to run in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Civic organizations gathered enough signatures to hold a
national referendum on the matter, but the vote was blocked by
Congress. Fujimori launched his re-election campaign Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole electoral process starts out with a factory defect,
which is the Fujimori candidacy,'' said Jorge Santistevan de
Noriega, who heads the Office of the People's Defender, a
government ombudsman group in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante argues, however, that strong
leaders such as Margaret Thatcher of Britain, Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain and Helmut Kohl of Germany all stayed in power for more than
10 years. He insists that no viable successor to Fujimori has
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread to imagine Peru in 2000 in the hands of any of those
who have appeared at the moment as alternatives,'' he told Peru
Monitor magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the nation's economy has stagnated in the past three
years, and many Peruvians long for change. Last week, police and
soldiers used tear gas to break up hundreds of rock-throwing
protesters who tried to storm the National Palace to denounce
Fujimori's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, however, has made a series of blunders. For
instance, instead of uniting behind one or two figures, eight
opposition candidates have entered the race. None appears to have
caught on with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls give Fujimori a comfortable lead over his nearest rivals _
Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade and Luis Castaneda Lossio, the former
head of the social security institute. If no one receives more than
50 percent of the vote on April 9, a runoff between the two top
finishers will be in June.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition ``hasn't broken out with a message that resonates
with the public,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't vote on rule-of-law issues,'' the official said.
``They vote on your record of success, and Fujimori has a strong
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say, however, that it's been nearly impossible for
opposition candidates to take their case to the public.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Carter Center report, television stations have
been ``openly hostile and biased'' toward opposition candidates,
denying them regular access and, in some cases, refusing to accept
their campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   The report pointed out that the Peruvian government is the
single largest buyer of TV and radio ad time. Most television
stations have outstanding tax debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the tacit threat of calling in these debts or
withdrawing a major source of advertising income that acts as a
disincentive for media corporations to sell spots to opposition
candidates,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Fujimori has received far more TV coverage than his
rivals, according to Transparencia, a Lima-based electoral
monitoring group. In November, for example, stories on the
president made up 80 percent of TV campaign coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Andrade said the dirty war in the press has
paid off for Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, polls showed that 70 percent of Peruvians opposed
re-election. But the media campaign has been so strong and our
image has been so blackened that the only option voters see is
Fujimori,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few newspapers cover the opposition, but most Peruvians read
tabloids that are overwhelmingly pro-government.
</P>
<P>
   Laura de Cordoba, who lives in a Lima slum and gets her news
from television, had trouble naming any of the opposition
candidates. ``We don't know what they would do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Chavez, a pro-Fujimori legislator, said that the
president gets more coverage simply because of his office. ``It's
not like he's a small-town mayor. There are always 20 or 30
reporters trailing him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition also has faced mysterious power outages
during their rallies as well as counter-demonstrations by Fujimori
supporters. One candidate was targeted by Peru's tax agency for an
aggressive audit within two weeks of entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Fujimori has capitalized on his incumbency by
inaugurating bridges, schools and health clinics across the
country. Last week, he even promised free land for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Santistevan, the human rights ombudsman, said that with the help
of outside observers, there is still time to improve conditions and
mount fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the international community wants to help, they must come
now and make their judgments and try to influence events,'' he
said. ``Most of the time, they just come for election day. But we
are asking for observation in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has denounced Fujimori's
anti-democratic measures. But because he has fully cooperated with
U.S. counter-drug policies, many analysts believe that Washington
would not object to a third term for Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the civil war in nearby Colombia, last month's coup in
Ecuador and the election of a former coup-plotter as president of
Venezuela, Peru can seem like an island of stability, said Diego
Garcia-Sayan of the Andean Commission of Jurists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, Peru is seen as a factor of equilibrium in
an area that would otherwise be complete chaos,'' he said.

WILL DEATH PENALTY'S FOES STOP AT NOTHING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bleeding hearts are at it again.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-capital punishment crowd has now gone to bat for Texas
Death Row inmate Betty Lou Beets, 62, who has a date with the
executioner Thursday for the crime of shooting her fifth husband in
his sleep and then burying him in the front yard. Her fourth
husband also turned up shot to death and buried in a shallow grave
not far from where No. 5 was buried.
</P>
<P>
   She shot at least one other husband, although that mate survived
the two bullets she put in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Beets is sometimes referred to as the ``Black Widow'' due to her
penchant for murdering spouses rather than disposing of them
through the more conventional means of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about some kindly grandma who accidentally
dropped some cyanide into granddaddy's oatmeal. This woman is a
cold-blooded killer.
</P>
<P>
   But the death penalty opponents insist that the state of Texas
should spare Beets' life rather than administer the lethal
injection that she so richly deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose there could ever be a murderer so vicious, so
vile, so irredeemable that these people would be unable or
unwilling to summon up a hysterical outbreak of weeping and
teeth-gnashing over his or her impending demise?
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough when the pro-killer forces invent some phony
argument in support of the idea that the killer is innocent,
claiming that 10 eyewitnesses were hallucinating or wearing dirty
contact lenses or perhaps fingered the defendant because he
reminded them of the schoolyard bully who used to steal their lunch
money.
</P>
<P>
   But what's really insulting _ to the killer's victims, to the
public and to the cause of justice _ is when the evidence of guilt
is unassailable and the bleeding hearts resort to conjuring up some
outrageous rationale for nullifying the death sentence even as they
concede that the killer is the killer.
</P>
<P>
   You know. Karla Faye Tucker was a born-again Christian. Larry
Keith Robison was mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lou Beets was a victim of wife abuse.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. That's why the death penalty opponents are saying we
should cancel Betty Lou's appointment with the needle. Her
husband(s) abused her.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a question: Did she kill the fifth husband in retaliation
for abuse that he inflicted or because she was abused by husband
No. 4? And was husband No. 4 subjected to multiple gunshot wounds
in the head because he treated Beets badly or because she was still
mad at that other husband, the one who had the audacity to survive
those bullets she fired into his back?
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're willing to buy into the idea that spouse abuse is
a justification for murder, Beets hasn't produced a shred of
evidence that she was abused by Jimmy Don Beets, whose slaying
earned her the death penalty. Her lawyer, in fact, was interviewed
on Court TV the other day and all but admitted that the murder
victim never laid a hand on the alleged abuse victim.
</P>
<P>
   The killer, meanwhile, has been sobbing and whining for the
benefit of anyone who gets near her with a camera or a notebook in
a disgustingly transparent campaign to generate public sympathy. At
least Karla Faye admitted her guilt and showed some dignity during
that farewell round of interviews shortly before her execution.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Texas is that the Lone Star State has a
tough-minded governor who understands the value of capital
punishment and won't be buffaloed by nonsense such as abuse-excuse
pleas on behalf of Beets or the recent unfounded demands for a
moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Gov. George Ryan might have valid reasons for ordering
a moratorium in his state. Gov. George W. Bush says no such action
is needed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have had full access to the courts,''
Bush said in response to a question by CNN's Larry King during last
week's presidential debate in South Carolina. ``There's no doubt in
my mind that each person who's been executed in our state was
guilty of the crime committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Say goodnight, Betty Lou.

HOTELS HARBOR PRESIDENTIAL LORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the intense campaigning of an election year, we pause to
reflect not on White House wannabes but on Ike and the wayward
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The setting: Denver's Brown Palace Hotel, a favorite overnight
respite for Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to please the president, who loved to fish, the
hotel staff created an ice carving of a mountain complete with pine
trees and a miniature lake at the mountain's base. Three small,
live trout swam in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Eisenhower was so enchanted by the lake and
its tiny inhabitants that he was among the first to notice one
trout flipping out of the pool and onto the hotel carpet. The
president leaped to the rescue, nearly upsetting a table in his
eagerness to save the fish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MEMORABLE MOMENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ike's adventure is among many memorable moments relived by
guests at Historic Hotels of America, operated by the National
Trust for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Peabody, still a Memphis, Tenn., institution, future
president Harry Truman wrote a letter to his wife, dated Nov. 16,
1941, that reads: ``I got up at 7:15 a.m. and had breakfast in the
coffee shop downstairs, and they charged me 55 cents for tomato
juice, a little dab of oatmeal and milk with toast. I don't mind
losing $100 on a horse race or in a poker game with friends, but I
do hate to pay 55 cents for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Truman was escorted to his room at the Boston Park
Plaza by Leo Montgomery, who spent 40 years as a bell captain at
the hotel. According to legend, Truman poured a shot of whiskey
from his flask and offered it to Montgomery. The bell captain,

CLIFTON DANIEL, FORMER MANAGING EDITOR OF THE TIMES, DIES AT 87

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clifton Daniel, the courtly North Carolinian who
served as managing editor of The New York Times from 1964 to 1969
after a career as a correspondent in wartime London, war-torn
Europe and the Middle East, died Monday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 87 .
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a stroke and heart disease, said
his wife, Margaret Truman Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's long, adventuresome and many-sided professional life
was once summed up in a magazine profile with the headline ``Up
From Zebulon.'' Zebulon was the tiny lumber mill town in
northeastern North Carolina where he was born and reared and where
his parents saved the income from the family drugstore to put him
through college in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   A small-town Southern background was something that Daniel
shared with his predecessor as managing editor, Turner Catledge,
who was from Philadelphia, Miss. And when Daniel was married in
1956, after many footloose years in Europe and the Middle East, it
was to a down-to-earth young woman whose father, like Daniel's, had
worked as a shopkeeper far away from Times Square. The bride was
Margaret Truman, the only child of former President Truman, who had
run a haberdashery in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot in common,'' Daniel wrote in his volume of
reminiscences, ``Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,'' which appeared in
1984. ``We were the kind of people who wouldn't marry anybody our
mothers wouldn't approve of; a couple of citified small-towners,
puritans among the fleshpots.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel rose to be assistant to the managing editor, assistant
managing editor and then managing editor. In that post he was the
senior news executive of the daily Times, outranked only by
Catledge, the executive editor, who oversaw daily and Sunday
departments from a vantage outside the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   As managing editor, Daniel sought to brighten the newspaper with
pungent writing, eye-catching photography and an emphasis on what
many newspaper editors of the time disparaged as ``soft news.''
Daniel intensified the newspaper's treatment of society news, arts
coverage and obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   Society news, which had been mainly dry wedding and engagement
announcements, began to burst with spicy detail, human interest and
social insights. Cultural coverage studied the flaws as well as the
fame of important artists. Obituaries became less reverent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Daniel was succeeded as managing editor by A.M.
Rosenthal and became an associate editor, remaining in New York for
four more years and working in a different area of journalism, as a
commentator on The Times' radio station, WQXR. Then the Daniels
moved to Washington, where Daniel worked as chief of the
newspaper's bureau until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career Daniel had won respect as a foreign
correspondent on some grueling and unsettling assignments for The
Times. In Moscow in 1954 and 1955, for example, he was the only
permanent correspondent of a Western non-Communist newspaper in the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Among his colleagues, Daniel was known for an ability to imbue
his writing with a strong feeling for the places and people he had
seen. Of a drive through the Soviet Union, he wrote that he found
``a Russia that Tolstoy never knew,'' where ``factories seen across
the fields and mines with towering slag heaps are giving off steam
and smoke,'' where ``hitchhikers, creatures of the motor age, are
on the road with bundles and thumbs uplifted,'' while ``strung out
mile after mile along the highway is a convoy of new trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Daniel took his readers to the Bolshoi Theater, ``an
ornate and refurnished relic of 19th-century Russia'' with
``burnished gilt balconies and vivid red draperies,'' where
``Muscovites circled the foyer in pairs between the acts, seeing
and being seen, keeping in line and in step, as if arranging
themselves for a quadrille ... plain people, the women generally in
flowered print dresses, the men in uniforms or the sober garb of
civil servants.''
</P>
<P>
   From Cologne, West Germany, Daniel described carnival time:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the twisting narrow streets that run around the twin spires
of the city's famous cathedral, hundreds of thousands of spectators
swayed, rocked and sang and danced. They cheered the brilliant
costumes ((and)) scrambled for barrelfuls of candy that were thrown
at them. Any girl who could be caught could be kissed and several
policemen were tossed in the air by a gang of young men.''
</P>
<P>
   Breathing New Life Into News Pages
</P>
<P>
   When Daniel became managing editor, he gave a gifted reporter,
Charlotte Curtis, a mandate to write about society as news,
encouraging her to provide shrewd and sometimes impudent reporting
about high society and high life. Curtis continued that society
reporting after she was promoted in 1965 to be the editor of
women's news. Her title was changed in 1971 to family/style editor,
and she held the position until 1974. Curtis worked under Daniel
for nine years, until 1969, and strove to expand coverage of
fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect the
conviction she shared with Daniel that those topics should be
treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that
politics and sports received.
</P>
<P>
   It was Daniel who nurtured the career of The Times' food writer,
Craig Claiborne, and helped him become one of the best-known
restaurant critics in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel also set about improving obituaries in The Times. He
found them written in such a gray, lifeless way that he was said to
have remarked, ``It seemed as though the subjects had never been
alive.'' He sought to make them longer, more authoritative and more
vivid; to help bring that about, he chose Alden Whitman as chief
obituary writer.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman recalled that Daniel told him, ``We interview people
about everything else, why shouldn't we interview them for their
obituaries?'' Daniel encouraged Whitman to travel and talk to
accomplished people solely for their future obituaries, often with
their full knowledge of the purpose. That had rarely been done
before, and Daniel proposed that Whitman begin by interviewing
Daniel's father-in-law, the former president. Soon Whitman found
himself facing Truman, who told him, ``I know why you are here and
I want to help you all I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, Whitman interviewed figures like
Earl Warren, Charles Chaplin, Charles A. Lindbergh, Graham Greene
and Anthony Eden. His method resulted in comprehensive obituaries
that would be written in advance to be ready for publication at
short notice when the subjects died. It also resulted in the
presentation of a special Polk Memorial Award to Whitman in 1980
for ``setting new standards of excellence at what had been a
routine assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Daniel relished his role in expanding The Times' coverage of
arts news. ``Any newspaper that didn't cover a major industry in
its community would be judged derelict,'' he said. ``I thought the
coverage should be conscientious, thoughtful and thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thought that critics working for The Times should not
express their views so vehemently that they seemed to be carrying
on vendettas. And in 1968, when The Times retained a long-haired
culture writer as a rock critic, Daniel enjoyed breaking the news
gently to the well-groomed former Marine who was then the paper's
publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger. ``His name is Mike Jahn,''
Daniel wrote in a note to Sulzberger, ``and he is going to write
pieces on folk/rock music.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel went on to report that another editor had reassured him:
`` Jahn wears his hair in a somewhat bizarre style _ in fact he
looks like a werewolf. But since his work will not require him to
be in the office very much, I don't think he'll bite any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik of Fleet Street and a Wastrel King
</P>
<P>
   Much of Daniel's interest in society and the arts took root
while he was reporting in World War II from London, where he was
remembered not only for his professionalism but also for his
savoir-faire. Indeed, during Daniel's London years, he became known
as the Sheik of Fleet Street. And London tailors made the
fur-lined, karakul-collared greatcoat that he later wore on cold
days in the Soviet Union, where his reporting won him an Overseas
Press Club award.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Daniel's worldliness, his table manners failed to
satisfy the dissolute King Farouk of Egypt. ``Daniel,'' the King
said at a luncheon in Cairo in 1946, ``would you mind not clicking
your fork against your teeth?'' Daniel answered politely enough:
``I'm sorry, sir. I shall try to eat more quietly.'' But two
decades later, in his volume of reminiscences, he observed,
``Farouk's was a wasted life.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing that book in The New York Times, John Brooks said of
Daniel, ``Like a modern Scarlet Pimpernel, he enjoys wearing the
masque of a dandy'' and ``seems intent on playing down the fact
that, dinner parties aside, his has been a life of serious hard
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 book, ``Growing Up With My Grandfather,'' Daniel's
eldest son, Clifton Truman Daniel, wrote, ``Dad is so impeccable
that even in his undershirt he looks almost formal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel did not hesitate to telephone The Times' society news
desk to set the chaps there straight on esoteric details of British
fox-hunting garb.
</P>
<P>
   In two memos long famous within The Times, he listed the exact
gradations of men's formal wear and all their proper accessories.
In one, he distinguished between ``a black silk hat called a top
hat,'' worn at formal daytime occasions with a morning coat or
cutaway, and the kind worn to a formal evening affair with a
tailcoat: ``The hat properly worn with this suit is an opera hat _
a folding silk hat of grosgrain material _ but almost nobody owns
one these day.'' In the other memo, he concluded, ``Finally, it
used to be that formal evening dress along the Persian Gulf or the
Red Sea consisted of black trousers, a cummerbund and a
short-sleeved white shirt with an open collar. It was too hot to
wear a jacket and tie.''
</P>
<P>
   He was aghast when a young reporter confused the names of two
former Saudi monarchs, Ibn Saud and just plain Saud. But veteran
journalists remember Daniel's perceptive coverage of the lives of
ordinary people in the Soviet Union while he was a correspondent.
Admirers say he led the way in presenting American readers, who
were conditioned by Cold War tensions and fears, with a humanized
portrayal of Russian daily life in the period after Stalin's death
in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Elbert Clifton Daniel Jr. was born on Sept. 19, 1912, the son of
Elbert Clifton Daniel and Elvah Jones Daniel and a great-grandson
of Zachariah G. Daniel, an illiterate farmer who came to the United
States from England.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Zebulon had a population of 500. As a teen-ager,
young E.C., as he was known, worked part time for his father, an
enterprising druggist who was mayor of Zebulon, the first person in
town to own a telephone, and later the head of the North Carolina
Pharmaceutical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, in a speech at the University of North Carolina,
Daniel gave this account of how he first became a reporter: ``I
read one of those articles in a boys' magazine on `Choosing a
Career.' It said that if you wanted to be a newspaperman, if you
wanted to write, the best thing to do was to start writing. It
didn't say anything about going to journalism school. It just said,
`Send in something to the local paper.' So I did. As I remember, it
was an account of a basketball game. It got printed. Having one
item published was enough to convince me that I was God's gift to
journalism. I was pretty soon writing all the local news in The
Record during summer vacations from school.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalism School Was a Drugstore
</P>
<P>
   Working in the drugstore, Daniel told his audience, ``was a
lucky coincidence, because there was no better place in the town to
gather news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief of police and the deputy sheriff used to hang around
there all the time,'' Daniel continued. ``We took calls for the
doctors. Visiting politicians dropped in to shake hands. Farmers
talked about the price of tobacco and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, nearly everybody in town went down to the drugstore
for one reason or another during the week. I can still remember one
night when a fellow walked in, apparently holding his head on with
his hands. His throat was cut from ear to ear. I got a doctor for
him _ and a story for The Record.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Wakelon High School in Zebulon, Daniel
entered the University of North Carolina. He became editor of the
campus literary magazine and vice president of the student body,
and received his B.A. degree in 1933. Then he put in a year as
associate editor of The Dunn (N.C.) Daily Bulletin before spending
four years as a reporter, political writer and columnist for The
News and Observer in Raleigh, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, after trying unsuccessfully to be hired by The Times,
Daniel went to work for The Associated Press in New York. One of
his friends in the city was the writer Thomas Wolfe, a fellow North
Carolinian, whose turbulent second novel, ``Of Time and the
River,'' had come out in 1935. The two men would sometimes meet for
a late supper in the theater district, then stroll the streets for
hours, talking about literature and life.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel spent seven years as a reporter and editor with The AP
and was transferred from New York to Washington, and then to Bern
and London.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he was hired by The Times and stayed on in London,
covering the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary
Force. Later, he followed the advance of the First Army into
Belgium and Germany. Early in 1945 he was in Paris, and one of his
dispatches included these lines: ``The big dirty green trucks speed
along the Rue La Fayette, their heavy tires singing on the
cobblestones and their canvas tops snapping in the winter wind. The
men in the back are tired and cramped after 11 hours on the road.
The last wisecrack was made a hundred miles back. But one of them
peers out, sees the name of the street and says, `La Fayette, we're
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Daniel recalled in an interview: ``I had what the
British used to call `a good war.' I enjoyed my war and I survived
without a scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   After the guns fell silent, he became The Times' chief
correspondent in the Middle East and traveled widely, reporting on
Arab nationalism, on tension and violence in Egypt and what is now
Israel and in late 1946 on the collapse of a Soviet-backed rebel
regime in northern Iran, where he found himself ahead of the story
he had come to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Driving in a borrowed jeep, he and two other correspondents
arrived in Tabriz, the main north Iranian city, hours ahead of the
Iranian Government force that was to take over. The newsmen got a
tumultuous greeting from excited throngs along their route, and
sheep were sacrificed in their honor.
</P>
<P>
   But they soon saw there was no conventional way of sending their
dispatches from Tabriz to the outside world. And so they gently
commandeered the local radio station and broadcast the news to the
world _ and to their editors.
</P>
<P>
   Later Daniel returned to London and covered the death of King
George VI and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coronation was the greatest spectacle I've ever seen,'' he
said afterward. ``It was probably the last time that the British
would be able to mount such a production; they were losing their
place as an imperialist power.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pivotal Struggle and a New Path
</P>
<P>
   After his assignments overseas, Daniel returned to New York and
began the editing apprenticeship that led to the managing editor's
chair. He had occupied it for four years when a climactic event
occurred in The Times' newsroom management, one that ultimately
chilled his relationship with the publisher, Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger. Daniel and the two other highest-ranking editors,
Catledge and Rosenthal, had become dissatisfied with the leadership
of the newspaper's Washington bureau, staffed by award-winning
proteges of James Reston, the columnist and former bureau chief.
The three New York editors decided that they wanted James L.
Greenfield, an editor recently hired in the home office, to replace
Tom Wicker as the bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield had previous experience in Washington, as a
correspondent and a government official. Sulzberger endorsed his
appointment, but it was strongly opposed by Wicker, by members of
the bureau and above all by Reston. They appealed, and Sulzberger
changed his mind, keeping Wicker as bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel complained to Sulzberger so angrily about the change of
plan that the publisher was offended. Late in 1968, Wicker stepped
aside to write his column full time. He was succeeded by Max
Frankel, a bureau member who went on to become executive editor of
The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield, meanwhile, quit the paper. But he was rehired in
1969 as foreign editor and rose to be an assistant managing editor.
Daniel, though, never regained his standing with the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   After yielding the managing editor's post in 1969, Daniel worked
in television as well as radio. His assignments included
supervising The Times News Service, the direction of special
projects and the continuation of his service as moderator of a
twice-monthly program called ``News in Perspective'' produced by
National Educational Television in association with The Times.
Daniel also presided over two radio programs, ``Insight'' and ``One
Man's Opinion,'' for WQXR.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the news staff as head of the Washington bureau, he
wrote analytical articles and oversaw the coverage of President
Richard M. Nixon's resignation and the outset of Gerald R. Ford's
presidency. He concentrated much of his effort on developing a
staff for investigative reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Of Murder Mysteries and Truman's Ghost
</P>
<P>
   He also watched his wife's literary career with pride. Margaret
Truman Daniel wrote or edited a score of books under the Truman
name. After her first mystery novel, ``Murder in the White House,''
became a best seller in 1980, she said in an interview, ``My
husband tells me to stick to what I know.'' Her later books have
included ``Murder on Capitol Hill'' and ``Murder in the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Their son Clifton Truman Daniel asserted in his memoir: ``My
mother seems to have a strong opinion, often bad, of almost
everyone in Washington. That's why she writes those murder
mysteries; so she can kill them all off, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daniels had three other sons _ William Wallace, Harrison
Gates and Thomas Washington. Late in life the couple saw their home
life laid open publicly in a way that was unsettling. In his book,
young Clifton, now a writer for a North Carolina newspaper, gave
this summary of the problem he said stemmed from having President
Truman for a grandfather: ``Grandpa Truman died when I was 15 and I
spent my next 11 years wondering how to live up to him. Only I
didn't realize that's what I was doing. The only thing I had to
show for it was a string of failed academic courses, lost jobs, and
hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 years,'' he added, ``I found that though I
had let my grandfather's fame bring me down, I could look to him to
lift me up again. All he would have wanted for me was my
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Truman Daniel also wrote that his parents were strict
with him and his brothers in other ways because Truman had been
President. ``They didn't want us to get the idea that, just because
of our grandfather, we could go through life getting something for
nothing,'' he observed. ``Looking back, I can see what they were
worried about. But keeping us from getting swelled heads often
meant bruising our egos.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, having reached 65, Daniel ended his newspaper career
and told an interviewer, ``There's no profession that offers you
more variety in life or more excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and sons, he is survived by five
grandchildren. In retirement, Daniel enjoyed the conviviality of
his club, the Century Association, near the Times Building on West
43rd Street. He did not stop writing and went on to be the editor
in chief of the book ``Chronicle of the 20th Century.'' Its first
edition, a best seller, was published in 1987. The book was a
weighty collection of two million words and 3,700 illustrations
that listed a news event for almost every day of the 20th century
to the end of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the headlines in the book, and a few of the articles,
were written by Daniel. In an interview in 1987, he said of those
articles: ``When something came along where I had some knowledge, I
pitched in. I wrote the Hall-Mills murder case because none of the
editors had ever heard of it. I also was the only one who seemed to
know the details about the Earl of Roseberry, who achieved the
three things he wanted in life _ to win the English Derby, marry
England's richest heiress and become prime minister.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Feb. 12 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   &UR; WOMAN: An Intimate Biography &LR;  By Natalie Angier. Anchor, $15. A
Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer for The New York Times
conducts a rapturous tour of the female body and its intricate
workings, drawing on evolutionary theory, science, literature,
medicine and history. ```Woman' is a tour de force, a wonderful,
entertaining and informative book,'' Abraham Verghese wrote in The
New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST INTO UPPER EAST: Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi &LR; 
By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Counterpoint, $14. These stories by a
connoisseur of divided souls, written over the last 20 years or so
and set in gilded Manhattan co-ops and expensive Indian villas,
focus on rootless characters whose inner longings are at odds with
their protective coloration. In 1998 the reviewer Deborah Mason
called the author ``a spellbinding urban fabulist'' and said ``each
story reveals Jhabvala's mastery of the form.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; OUT OF INDIA: Selected Stories &LR; 
($14), a collection of Jhabvala's early tales that explore the
domestic lives of middle-class Indians and the spiritual yearning
of Westerners who flock to often-bogus ashrams. In 1986 in The New
York Times Book Review, Rumer Godden said the stories display ``her
hallmark of balance, subtlety, wry humor and beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FORTRESS AMERICA: The American Military and the Consequences of
Peace &LR;  By William Greider. PublicAffairs, $10. A journalist
searches for the ``peace dividend'' that was supposed to follow the
Cold War, and discovers instead a bloated military establishment
dedicated to building an increasingly chaotic and obsolescent
arsenal. This ``is the kind of book that leaves a reader agitated
and indignant, and should by all rights ignite an urgent national
debate,'' James B. Stewart wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG &LR;  By Andre Dubus III. Vintage
Contemporaries, $14. In this tale of good people gone crazy, three
characters collide in Pacific suburbia: an Iranian immigrant, a
California woman who loses her home to him in an auction, and a
deputy sheriff who comes between them. In 1999 the reviewer Bill
Sharp admired the novel's ``highly visual, descriptive language.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the
Quest for the Ultimate Theory &LR;  By Brian Greene. Vintage, $15. A
Columbia professor makes a case for string theory, which posits a
universe with 10 curled-up dimensions and melds quantum mechanics
with the general theory of relativity. ``In the great tradition of
physicists writing for the masses, `The Elegant Universe' sets a
standard that will be hard to beat,'' George Johnson wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEONS, BLACK HOLES, AND QUANTUM FOAM: A Life in Physics &LR; , by
John Archibald Wheeler with Kenneth Ford (Norton, $14.95), is an
account of the Princeton physicist's long career (he worked on the
Manhattan Project) and highly regarded theoretical work on atomic
nuclei and gravitation (he coined the term ``black hole'').
``Difficult concepts that defy common sense come briskly to life,''
Michael Riordan wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXTREMITIES: Stories &LR;  By Kathe Koja. Four Walls Eight Windows,
$13.95. In these unsettling tales, a survivor of a plane crash
changes into a bird and a woman transforms herself into a plant to
remain near her boyfriend. ``Koja's provocative story lines and
evocative prose combine reality with invention, the supernatural
with the everyday,'' Christopher Atamian wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP &LR;  By Michael Lesy. University of New
Mexico, $29.95. This 1973 chronicle of a rural Wisconsin town
ravaged by depression, madness and epidemic disease at the turn of
the century combines many haunting old photographs with local
newspaper accounts. ``The result is an impressive example of the
poetry of history,'' William H. Gass wrote. ``This original work
makes us deeply feel one form that misery has taken.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALLAN STEIN &LR;  By Matthew Stadler. Grove, $12. A young teacher
visits Paris in search of information about Gertrude Stein's nephew
and becomes obsessed with a 15-year-old boy. ``Stadler demonstrates
that he is among the handful of first-rate young American
novelists, one with a wide reach and a quirky, elegant pen,''
Edmund White wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WITH OSSIE AND RUBY: In This Life Together &LR;  By Ossie Davis and
Ruby Dee. Quill/Morrow, $14. The actors reflect on their
childhoods, the black experience in American theater and the many
social causes they have championed during their more than 50 years
together. In 1998 the reviewer Victor Navasky called this ``a
conversation studded with anecdotes ... and also some inspiration,
wisdom and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MISTRESS &LR;  By Philippe Tapon. Plume, $12.95. Emile Bastien
is a French doctor living comfortably with his mistress in
Nazi-occupied Paris until his affair, his family and his livelihood
are threatened by betrayal and perilous wartime allegiances. Last
year the reviewer Liam Callanan called this ``a fine, wicked'' and
``altogether enjoyable'' novel.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 20, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-CHANGING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As candidates cling to
long-held positions or candidly change them, a debate develops
about why politicians and their handlers consider consistency so
important when candidates do, just like other people, change their
minds occasionally. Or have their minds changed for them, once they
get elected. Several conservative thinkers said the post-Clinton
moment is a time when someone who is willing to say he was wrong,
and how he's changed, may hold particular appeal. By Melinda
Henneberger. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-MILITANTS-REVIEW (Nabatiye, Lebanon) _ Islamic
revolutionary movements show signs of fading as developments in
Iran and Lebanon suggest a trend toward political pragmatism in the
Shiite Muslim world. After 20 years of holding high the banner of
Islamic fundamentalism, Iran's conservative mullahs and Lebanon's
Hezbollah have arrived at a crossroads at which their cause will
either adjust or wither. By John. F. Burns. (Moved in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HACKERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Computers are under constant random
attacks from hackers looking for open doors _ called ports _
allowing them to sneak in. It's called doorknob rattling. The
hacker attacks on commercial web sites like Amazon and Yahoo
apparently were launched by doorknob rattlers. Users who connect to
the Internet at home, using telephone lines, are of little interest
to the intruders. But people who use cable connections or DSL lines
are a different story. So are companies and universities that hook
everyone up with cable modems. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Combating cybercrimes such
as the recent attacks on major Web sites seems to be among the
easier Internet issues to handle. It will require some new tools,
new skills and new forms of cooperation among government agencies.
But the issue appears to be mainly one of enforcement, not
requiring new laws or new policy. The more thorny policy issues
raised by the Internet are privacy and antitrust, which may require
legislative action. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BUDDHISTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Vice President Al Gore's aides
insist that the Buddhist temple fund-raising episode is old history
and that Gore was cleared of any wrongdoing. Still, they anticipate
a blitz of attack ads showcasing the temple fund-raiser. The raw
footage for such ads was on display in court last week during the
trial of Maria Hsia, a former Democratic fund-raiser. By Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's nine-year economic
expansion is the longest in history. So wages should be climbing
faster and faster as the unemployment rate falls and companies
raise pay to lure new workers or to retain the ones they have. But
wage increases, instead of getting bigger, are getting smaller.
Why? By Louis Uchitelle. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-STRESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ohio State University
researchers studying how emotions can help or hinder physical
healing are conducting experiments on volunteer married couples,
asking them to discuss stressful subjects and then inflicting minor
wounds on them and studying how the wounds heal. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   MARRY-MILLIONAIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some possible questions
from a hypothetical sequel to ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' By Jenny Lyn Bader.

   MILLIONAIRE-PROSTITUTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Was ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire?'' a form of prostitution? Although no one
on the show mentioned sex, the arrangement had certain elements of
prostitution, defined by as ``engaging in sexual conduct for a
fee'' _ or, more accurately, of soliciting prostitution. After all,
a woman was promising sex to a stranger in expectation of some of
his assets. By Lauara Mansnerus.

   UNIVERSE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Legions of popular science fans have
become accustomed to increasingly fantastic revelations. In a day
when a steady stream of exotic scientific speculations overwhelms
the public imagination _ tiny superstrings vibrating in a
10-dimensional universe, invisible parallel worlds, wormholes
tunneling through space and time _ a comfortable satisfaction can
be taken from a modest technological triumph like an unmanned
asteroid probe. By George Johnson.

   BOREDOM-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some experts say the growing use
of the Internet reflects not social isolation and individual
loneliness, but mass boredom. Some excerpts from scholarly writings
on boredom as a cultural phenomenon.

   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ In Mitrovica, the
divided town in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins,
long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north and Albanians to
the south have burst into violence. The reasons go deeper than any
tactical mistake made by civilian or military authorities.
Mitrovica marks the effective political and ethnic partition of
Kosovo, and its problems explain why true peace looks so far away,
even eight months after NATO took complete control of the province.

   ITALY-NEWSPAPERS-REVIEW (Rome) _ European countries are more
relaxed about nudity than the United States, particularly in
newspapers and advertising. However, while English and German
newspapers tend to restrict their naked starlets to the
entertainment pages, Italian papers regularly blend nudity or
startling graphics into reporting, blurring the line between soft
porn and hard news. A look at some of the ethical issues raised by
Italy's unique style of newspaper advertising and journalism. By

for Sunday, Feb. 20, moved Saturday.

</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-CHANGING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As candidates cling to
long-held positions or candidly change them, a debate develops
about why politicians and their handlers consider consistency so
important when candidates do, just like other people, change their
minds occasionally. Or have their minds changed for them, once they
get elected. Several conservative thinkers said the post-Clinton
moment is a time when someone who is willing to say he was wrong,
and how he's changed, may hold particular appeal. By Melinda
Henneberger. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-MILITANTS-REVIEW (Nabatiye, Lebanon) _ Islamic
revolutionary movements show signs of fading as developments in
Iran and Lebanon suggest a trend toward political pragmatism in the
Shiite Muslim world. After 20 years of holding high the banner of
Islamic fundamentalism, Iran's conservative mullahs and Lebanon's
Hezbollah have arrived at a crossroads at which their cause will
either adjust or wither. By John. F. Burns. (Moved in the `i'
category)

   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HACKERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Computers are under constant random
attacks from hackers looking for open doors _ called ports _
allowing them to sneak in. It's called doorknob rattling. The
hacker attacks on commercial web sites like Amazon and Yahoo
apparently were launched by doorknob rattlers. Users who connect to
the Internet at home, using telephone lines, are of little interest
to the intruders. But people who use cable connections or DSL lines
are a different story. So are companies and universities that hook
everyone up with cable modems. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Combating cybercrimes such
as the recent attacks on major Web sites seems to be among the
easier Internet issues to handle. It will require some new tools,
new skills and new forms of cooperation among government agencies.
But the issue appears to be mainly one of enforcement, not
requiring new laws or new policy. The more thorny policy issues
raised by the Internet are privacy and antitrust, which may require
legislative action. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BUDDHISTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Vice President Al Gore's aides
insist that the Buddhist temple fund-raising episode is old history
and that Gore was cleared of any wrongdoing. Still, they anticipate
a blitz of attack ads showcasing the temple fund-raiser. The raw
footage for such ads was on display in court last week during the
trial of Maria Hsia, a former Democratic fund-raiser. By Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's nine-year economic
expansion is the longest in history. So wages should be climbing
faster and faster as the unemployment rate falls and companies
raise pay to lure new workers or to retain the ones they have. But
wage increases, instead of getting bigger, are getting smaller.
Why? By Louis Uchitelle. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-STRESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ohio State University
researchers studying how emotions can help or hinder physical
healing are conducting experiments on volunteer married couples,
asking them to discuss stressful subjects and then inflicting minor
wounds on them and studying how the wounds heal. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   MARRY-MILLIONAIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some possible questions
from a hypothetical sequel to ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' By Jenny Lyn Bader.

<P>
   The attacks on eBay, Yahoo, Etrade and other big Web sites
earlier this month showed the Internet to be surprisingly
vulnerable to a few laptop-toting cyber-vandals. This is a pressing
public concern, surely, as the nation increasingly comes to rely
for commerce and everyday communication on this chaotic, global
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   But when President Clinton met last Tuesday with more than two
dozen representatives of the Internet community, a big role for
government was not on the agenda. The president asked what could or
should the government do. Not a lot, the Internet elite told him.
The group's message: It's an industry issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in that room was asking the government to fix this
problem,'' said Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice president for
technology at IBM, who attended the meeting in the Cabinet Room of
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering epitomized the main thrust of government policy in
the Internet arena. Government, the theory goes, should offer a
forum and be a cooperative partner, so as to facilitate the rapid
rise of Internet commerce. That stance was set in a July 1997
policy document on e-commerce written by Ira Magaziner, a senior
White House policy adviser at the time. His document extolled the
``breakneck speed of change in the technology'' and stated,
``Government attempts to regulate ((the Internet)) are likely to be
outmoded by the time they are finally enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   The hands-off approach, however, will be challenged more and
more as the Internet moves rapidly into the mainstream. For just as
the Net creates new forms of commerce, it also opens a door to new
forms of crime. And the malicious hackers who recently brought down
the big commercial Web sites by jamming them with a flood of bits _
a tactic known as denial-of-service attacks _ are but one example.
</P>
<P>
   Online con artists are doing a booming business. In a report to
the Justice Department in January, the National Consumers League
warned, ``The Internet has become the new frontier of fraud.'' The
Federal Trade Commission, for example, reports an alarming surge in
consumer complaints of fraud on Internet auction sites, to more
than 10,000 last year from about 100 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet combating such crimes seems to be among the easier Internet
issues to handle. Cracking down will require some new tools, new
skills and new forms of cooperation among federal and state
agencies. The FBI, Justice Department and FTC are increasing their
computer crime and Internet fraud squads. But the issue appears to
be mainly one of enforcement, not the need for new laws or
policies. The problem seems manageable, even familiar in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   Other new technologies, from cars to credit cards, have prompted
dire warnings that they would bring a flood of crime. In the early
1900s, the automobile was seen as an ideal means for bank robbers
and murderers to flee before police could catch them. Criminals did
use them, but police got their own cars and motorcycles, cars were
licensed and federal agents were allowed to pursue suspects across
state lines. Later, credit cards were seen as a license for fraud.
And, indeed, credit card fraud exceeds $1 billion a year. But law
enforcement authorities and industry have kept it a manageable cost
of doing business, amounting to roughly 9 cents for every $100 of
goods purchased by credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The thornier policy issues raised by the Internet concern
privacy and antitrust matters. On privacy, the United States has so
far adopted a self-regulatory approach, letting the online industry
set its own policies for collecting personal data on computer users
who visit Web sites _ and for informing users of those policies and
how they can opt out. The FTC is monitoring the industry's efforts,
saying that self-regulation, if effective, is more flexible and
thus preferable to direct government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates and other critics say self regulation
gives too much power to Internet companies and too little to
consumers. The danger, they warn, is that increasingly
sophisticated software will soon allow marketers to track a user's
every mouse click and then match that information with demographic
databases to establish online profiles of individuals. Those
profiles could, in theory, be used to determine not only what
online marketing pitches people see, but also potentially what job
and education opportunities people are offered.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says such concerns are overstated. But the FTC
recently began investigating how medical Web sites handle personal
information. And last week, DoubleClick, the Internet's leading
advertising placement company, reported that the FTC was
investigating how the company collected and used personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the profiling technology disturbing _ this notion of
checking on consumer viewing habits without them knowing it _
especially if that information is then merged with other databases
so they can be identified,'' said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the
FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy issue is so sensitive that Robert Litan, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, recommends ``minimalist''
privacy legislation to engender consumer trust and ensure the rapid
development of E-commerce. The effect, he says, would be similar to
legislation in the 1970s limiting a person's liability to $50 if
his credit card is lost and used fraudulently, which eased consumer
worries about credit cards.

<P>
   One of the more innovative views of government's role in the
Internet era comes from Lawrence Lessig, an antitrust scholar and
the author of ``Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig argues that the headlong commercialization of the
Internet threatens its decentralization and openness _ the
technological ``architecture,'' as he puts it _ that has made
wide-open innovation, competition and free expression essential
features of the Internet. That core architecture, he explains, is a
network that has open access and public software standards so that
anyone can communicate over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig sees the efforts of cable television operators, who are
beginning to offer high-speed Internet service, to deny competing
Internet services access to their cable network as one such threat
to the openness of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government should be pro-active early on to make sure the
architecture of the Internet remains open,'' Lessig said. ``If you
get the architecture right, the regulation takes care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are skeptical of the need for much government
involvement, all the more so of the pre-emptive variety advocated
by Lessig. The answer they offer is to let markets work _ the
Internet being first and foremost an extremely efficient market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there a role for government and that policy must be
informed by the new technology,'' said Carl Shapiro, an economist
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``But the fact is the
technology is enabling an enormous amount of new competition and
breaking down barriers. The Internet is off and running, and for
the most part the government should stay out of its way.''

   NABATIYE, Lebanon _ A group of hard-eyed men from Hezbollah, the
Party of God, were driving an American correspondent down a narrow
road outside this village in southern Lebanon last week when the
visitor pointed through the open car window toward an Israeli
fortification high on a rocky hill to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Something on the hill was glinting in the blinding sunshine. It
was probably an Israeli soldier's binoculars, and the reaction of
the Hezbollah fighters was quick and angry. ``In the name of Allah,
don't point!'' the driver said, turning the car and racing back
toward the village. ``If you point, the Israelis will think you're
aiming at them, and they'll hit us with their 155-millimeters.''
</P>
<P>
   The reproach was a hard lesson, but it was nothing compared with
the cold fury of the Hezbollah men a little later while driving
past billboards showing the supreme icons of Hezbollah's brand of
Shiite Muslim fundamentalism _ Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, and his successor as the Islamic
Republic's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Blundering again, the reporter asked where were the images of
Iran's president, Mohammed Khatami, an Islamic reformer whose calls
for greater democracy and human rights have electrified his country
and crystalized the battle between reformers and conservatives that
culminated in the Iranian parliamentary election held Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This time the driver slowed, looked back at his questioner with
something approaching contempt, then fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   Among militant Shiites in Lebanon, apparently, Khatami is a
nonperson, somebody who merits only scowls. Later, much the same
reaction was evident in Hezbollah's heavily guarded sanctuaries in
the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah leaders are
preparing to face up to their own day of reckoning. That will be
the moment in July when Israeli troops complete their promised
withdrawal from Lebanon and leave Hezbollah to make a historic
choice between the militant Islamic policies of its past and
mounting pressure for more pragmatism _ particularly if Lebanon's
neighbor and protector Syria resumes seeking peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of holding high the banner of Islamic
fundamentalism, the conservative mullahs of Iran and their
counterparts in the leadership of Lebanon's Hezbollah have arrived,
more or less simultaneously, at their respective political
Rubicons, the point at which their cause will either adjust or
wither. Partly this is a matter of coincidence, of political
timetables in Iran and Lebanon that have their separate logics. But
there are common factors, too, as there have been since the first
stirrings of Shiite clerical insurgency in the two countries more
than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching any broad conclusions about the tide of affairs in the
Islamic world is fraught with hazard, considering that there are
more than 50 Muslim nations, comprising more than a billion people,
vastly different cultures in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and
a deep theological and political schism between the world's 800
million Sunni Muslims and 200 million Shiites. But some trends are
too compelling to ignore; the events now unfolding in Iran and
Lebanon, suggesting a broader movement toward political realism in
the Shiite world, are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Sunni-Shiite schism, tracing back to the dynastic
rupture that followed the death of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed in
632 A.D., it would take an intrepid chronicler to suggest that
something still broader may be stirring across all of Islam _ a
slow, even crab-like move away from the militancy that seemed like
a rising tide at the onset of the 1990s. After all, Osama Bin
Laden, the heir to a Saudi Arabian fortune who is the world's
most-wanted terrorist leader, is still at large in Afghanistan,
with cells of armed supporters spread widely through the Middle
East, North Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of Islamic militancy continue to lurk, on the
fringes of power or underground, in dozens of countries _
Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, Algeria among them. Some experts
think the world has yet to see the high tide of Sunni
fundamentalism, an equivalent of the Shiite revolution in Iran in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, what seems inescapable is that the men who
kick-started the wave of Islamic militancy in the modern world, the
Shiite clerics of Iran and Lebanon, have their backs to the wall,
even if few hard-line mullahs in either country seem ready to fly
the white flag just yet.

<P>
   In Iran, where huge numbers of voters turned out for
parliamentary elections last week, the results will take days to
compile and it is possible that reformers, divided among themselves
and deprived of some of their best candidates by pre-election
screeners loyal to Khamenei, may have to settle for something less
than outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   And in Lebanon, a surface appraisal would suggest that
Hezbollah, after 15 years of battling Israeli troops, is on the
verge of its brightest moment yet, the unilateral Israeli pullout
promised by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But in Lebanon, as in Iran, the longer-run trends seem to lie
against the militants. With Israel's troops gone, the Islamic group
will be deprived of its most powerful card, and Lebanon's 3.5
million people will be left to weigh whether they want to give the
group more political power than it already has with its minority
bloc in the Lebanese parliament. Every sign says that they do not.
In recent times, Hezbollah has even been rewriting history,
pretending it had nothing to do with the brutal terrorism it
sponsored in the 1980s, and playing down its commitment to an
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Iran, the long run seems to strongly favor the
pragmatists, if only because of demographics. The young constitute
a great bulge in Iran's population _ people under 25 who are too
young to remember the revolution or to have fought against Iraq or
to do anything today but chafe at the social restrictions Khomeini
imposed as the price of liberation from the rule of Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi. Those young are a formidable, and growing, base of
support for the forces of reform.
</P>
<P>
   If the pragmatic trends hold, it will be an ironic comeuppance
for the Shiite fundamentalists, who once viewed the Iran-Lebanon
axis as the basis for building an eventual Islamic superstate. Only
in Lebanon, it seems, do many people remember that it was here, in
the 1960s, that Musa al-Sadr, an Iranian-born Shiite cleric,
pioneered the populist form of Shiite political awakening that
found its ultimate expression in the Islamic revolution in Iran.
Revered by Shiite moderates and revolutionaries alike, he
disappeared on a trip to Libya in 1978, the apparent victim of a
plot by the Libyan leader Moammar el-Gadhafi, a Sunni Muslim who,
most Lebanese Shiites suppose, did not favor the rise of Shiite
fundamentalist power in the heart of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months after Sadr's luggage turned up off a
Tripoli-Rome flight without Sadr, Khomeini was on a flight from
Paris to Tehran, where he declared the Islamic state that turned
Iran upside down. Within a few years, the militant Lebanese Shiites
who felt orphaned by Sadr's disappearance were empowered again when
Khomeini sent 5,000 Iranian revolutionary guards to Lebanon's Bekaa
valley, where they armed, trained and indoctrinated the Hezbollah
force that went to war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in both countries, the hard-line clerics are faced with
evanescent dreams. About the only solace for them may be that their
Shiite faith has rested from the start on a cult of dispossession,
betrayal and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Shiites believe that Sunnis usurped the rightful
inheritance of Ali, the Prophet Mohammed's son-in-law and the
Shiites' first imam, so now the hard-liners may come to believe
that their enemies on earth have wrested from them the Islamic
state that, according to the militants, was the millennarian
promise vouchsafed them by the Prophet.

<P>
   As Rice Krispie Treats sailed over John McCain's head _ lobbed
by a reporter passing out snacks on the campaign bus _ the senator
was asked how he had changed over the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know the real truth?'' McCain began, and
everyone else stopped talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; have &LR;  changed a little bit, to try to be more considerate
of people who ask me questions _ not the media, but in town hall
meetings. Sometimes I'd get offended if somebody stood up and said,
`You're a crook.' I used to flash back at them,'' he said, raising
the subject of his own soft spot, the temper critics have raised as
an issue in the race. ``But I've learned to treat people with
respect, even when they're there hammering you. I've gotten a
thicker skin.'' Asked why, after 17 years of give and take in
Congress, that hadn't happened before, he said, ``Lack of maturity,
maybe?'' and laughed along with his audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's almost unheard of willingness to evolve in public and
his eagerness to admit to past mistakes, both in his personal life
and on policy, have helped set him apart and define him as a
different kind of candidate. He does a whole riff on the stupidity
of his vote against making Martin Luther King's birthday a national
holiday and returns again and again to the subject of how he blew
his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And however it turns out, this particular experiment in
authenticity has opened a debate about why most politicians and
their handlers consider consistency so important when candidates,
just like other people, do change their minds occasionally. Or have
their minds changed for them, once they get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Estrich, who ran Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential
campaign, said the impulse to appear consistent above almost all
else is a fearful response but not altogether unwarranted. ``The
concern is that if you admit any weakness, it will be exploited,''
she said. ``But the lesson of this year is that the best possible
political strategy is to seem authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of `Gotcha!' is no fun,'' Estrich said, when the
candidate himself keeps reminding us where he's gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservative thinkers said the post-Clinton moment is a
time when someone who is willing to say he was wrong, and how he's
changed, may hold particular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls suggest that voters, for whatever reason, do consider
McCain more believable than the other candidates. The latest New
York Times/CBS News poll found last week that 49 percent of those
surveyed think he says what he really believes most of the time,
compared to 42 percent who think that of Bill Bradley, 31 percent
of Vice President Al Gore and 30 percent of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Only 33 percent think McCain says what he thinks people want to
hear, compared to 38 percent who think the same of Bradley, and 61
percent who say that about both Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hardly the first American politician to score points
with a nicely done apology. But Alan J. Lichtman, chairman of the
history department at American University, who specializes in
presidential politics, said McCain has wielded the mea culpa in new
way. It works particularly well for him, Lichtman said, because
``the McCain model fits with the whole image he's trying to
establish as different, willing to buck his party, speak his mind,
and as part of that, be like all of us and say, `I've made
mistakes, I'm admitting the mistakes and I'm moving on.' It's so
effective it's hard to see how you even get nailed on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet where in politics is the line between intellectual growth
and pandering? And how do voters know when the candidate is sincere
_ or when his evolution is complete?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a change, people deserve to know why,'' said
Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's daughter and an adviser to his
campaign. ``This election process is really a little like a job
interview. As a voter, I'm hiring someone to do a job for me, and I
want to know what they're going to do and what their approach is. I
personally wouldn't place a lot of value on complete rigidity
through 20-plus years of public service, but the valid question is,
is this person going to change their position again?''
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees, McCain's competitors seem to adhere to the
more traditional view that it's a lot more important to be seen as
consistent than as capable of learning from missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insists that he has always _ ``always, always, always,'' he
said in a recent interview _ fully supported abortion rights. But
in the 1980s, as a member of the House, Gore's votes got an 84
approval percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee,
according to the group's executive director, David O'Steen. ``I've
been in meetings with him,'' O'Steen said, ``and he put himself
forward as opposing abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrich said, ``Nobody cares 20 years ago what he said about
abortion, and there would have been no issue at all'' if he hadn't
given them the honesty issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush somehow maintains that there is no discrepancy between his
stated belief that abortions should be available in cases of rape,
incest or to save the life of the mother and his statement that the
GOP platform should not be changed to include these exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever indicating that he's moved an inch, Bush today
takes credit for protecting patients against managed care abuses,
even though he vetoed such legislation in 1995 and, after voicing
serious reservations, enabled an HMO liability law to take effect
without his signature in 1997.

time when someone who is willing to say he was wrong, and how he's
changed, may hold particular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls suggest that voters, for whatever reason, do consider
McCain more believable than the other candidates. The latest New
York Times/CBS News poll found last week that 49 percent of those
surveyed think he says what he really believes most of the time,
compared to 42 percent who think that of Bill Bradley, 31 percent
of Vice President Al Gore and 30 percent of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Only 33 percent think McCain says what he thinks people want to
hear, compared to 38 percent who think the same of Bradley, and 61
percent who say that about both Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hardly the first American politician to score points
with a nicely done apology. But Alan J. Lichtman, chairman of the
history department at American University, who specializes in
presidential politics, said McCain has wielded the mea culpa in new
way. It works particularly well for him, Lichtman said, because
``the McCain model fits with the whole image he's trying to
establish as different, willing to buck his party, speak his mind,
and as part of that, be like all of us and say, `I've made
mistakes, I'm admitting the mistakes and I'm moving on.' It's so
effective it's hard to see how you even get nailed on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet where in politics is the line between intellectual growth
and pandering? And how do voters know when the candidate is sincere
_ or when his evolution is complete?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a change, people deserve to know why,'' said
Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's daughter and an adviser to his
campaign. ``This election process is really a little like a job
interview. As a voter, I'm hiring someone to do a job for me, and I
want to know what they're going to do and what their approach is. I
personally wouldn't place a lot of value on complete rigidity
through 20-plus years of public service, but the valid question is,
is this person going to change their position again?''
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees, McCain's competitors seem to adhere to the
more traditional view that it's a lot more important to be seen as
consistent than as capable of learning from missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insists that he has always _ ``always, always, always,'' he
said in a recent interview _ fully supported abortion rights. But
in the 1980s, as a member of the House, Gore's votes got an 84
approval percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee,
according to the group's executive director, David O'Steen. ``I've
been in meetings with him,'' O'Steen said, ``and he put himself
forward as opposing abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrich said, ``Nobody cares 20 years ago what he said about
abortion, and there would have been no issue at all'' if he hadn't
given them the honesty issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush somehow maintains that there is no discrepancy between his
stated belief that abortions should be available in cases of rape,
incest or to save the life of the mother and his statement that the
GOP platform should not be changed to include these exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever indicating that he's moved an inch, Bush today
takes credit for protecting patients against managed care abuses,
even though he vetoed such legislation in 1995 and, after voicing
serious reservations, enabled an HMO liability law to take effect
without his signature in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seems to have combined the worst of both models _ mostly
sticking to the ``never let them see you evolve'' philosophy, but
then publicly switching to support ethanol subsidies, a move that
is hard to explain as anything other than an epiphany inspired by a
desire to win the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Some see McCain's openness as just another strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says all the time, `I was wrong on that vote,''' said Ralph
Reed, the former Christian Coalition leader who is advising Bush.
His own candidate is not likely to follow suit: ``There's a point
where flexibility can begin to look like waffling, and voters want
consistency,'' Reed said. ``McCain has learned the value of winning
an argument by conceding the point, but that works better in the
cloakroom than in a primary.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if it does seem like a decent strategy, several
political consultants said that what McCain is attempting is not
likely to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell whether it will play in November,
though I personally find it refreshing, like a shower after seven
and a half years of Clinton,'' said Scott Reed, Bob Dole's former
campaign manager. ``But even if McCain, through a unique history
and background, seems to be able to get away with it, you can't
carbon copy it with other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself does not necessarily recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost doesn't matter if it's a good idea or not,'' he said
in an interview. ``It's just the only way I could do it.''

   The first one rattled the doorknob at 3 a.m. Wednesday morning,
trying to see if the door was open. The next came by an hour later,
then one at 8 a.m., another at 10:30 and yet another at noon. At 1
p.m. a particularly determined intruder arrived, trying entrances
that most people would not even think about. The final attempt of
the day came at 3 p.m., but like all the rest, it was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The fortress these thieves were trying to enter? A simple home
computer, hooked up to the Internet with the cable modem service
(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The owner happens to be a computer security expert, who wants to
remain anonymous so hackers will not see his system as a
tantalizing challenge. He knows about the attacks because his
computer has a fire wall, which keeps intruders out and tells him
when they have come by. Yet he was nonplussed by the number of
attacks on that single day last week. ``I think it's fairly
typical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree. ``It's called doorknob rattling,'' said Steven
Bellovin, a researcher in Internet security at AT&AMP;T Laboratories in
Florham Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are under constant random attacks from hackers around
the world who are looking for open doors, or ports, enabling them
to sneak in. For many hackers, the goal is simply to enter someone
else's computer. Others, like those who launched the recent attacks
on commercial Web sites, are criminals who quietly entered other
people's computers and planted programs that they later triggered
en masse, tying up Amazon.com., Buy.com, eBay, CNN.com and other
sites. But it is a strange sort of crime, since the owners of the
invaded computers probably were unaware of the foray, computer
security experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users who are connected through telephone lines are of
less interest to intruders because they are assigned a different
address each time they dial in. Thieves who do break in have a hard
time succeeding at it again.
</P>
<P>
   But people who are always connected to the Internet through
cable services offered by (at)Home or Road Runner or the high-speed
DSL lines provided by telephone companies are a different story. So
are companies and universities that hook everyone up via their own
high-speed networks. The advantage is that these systems are 10 to
hundreds of times faster than using an ordinary telephone line. The
disadvantage is that your computer's address is usually fixed and
easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addresses used by (at)Home are public, they're well
known,'' said Bellovin. ``It's very easy to scan all the addresses
for (at)Home and see which ones might be hooked up to cables and on
all the time and which ones might have certain open doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for other commercial cable companies as well as
university computers. ``A lot of universities have networks that go
to every dorm room,'' he added. ``It is very easy to scan the
address space and find the open servers and go in.''
</P>
<P>
   How often you see doorknob rattlers come by may depend on how
good you are at detecting them. Some computer experts say they see
attacks on a regular basis. Bellovin, who also uses (at)Home, says
his system averages two attempted break-ins a day. Ira Winston,
director of computing at the University of Pennsylvania, said he
detects an attack at least once a day on his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Smith, a computer science professor and expert on
network security at the University of Pennsylvania, protects his
computer by closing and locking all of its doors. That makes it
more difficult to use, but he doesn't care. ``I'm paranoid about
security,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Other owners set up fire walls that act as electronic stockades.
But most people who are at risk do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a target-rich environment,'' Bellovin said, borrowing a
phrase from the military. Computer factories may ship their PCs
with their doors unlocked, and many users are blissfully unaware of
the cruising doorknob rattlers, which include not just the
teen-ager next door, Smith said, but foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Today the trend is toward high-speed cable connections and DSL
lines and toward personal computers connected by networks, said
William Arbaugh, a computer security consultant in Baltimore who
worked at the National Security Agency. The stage is set for
break-ins, he said. And while there are countermeasures, nothing is
100 percent secure.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague at the NSA, he said, ``used to say that the only
safe computer was one buried in a safe in the ground with a marine
guard and the power turned off.''

A FUND-RAISING SCANDAL SHRINKS TO A SHADOW OF ITSELF _ FOR NOW

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the same federal courthouse where Kenneth
Starr's grand jury met, Maria Hsia, an obscure California
immigration consultant, sits silently at the defense table dressed
in a neat yellow sweater set and black skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is the only figure embroiled in the 1996 Democratic
fund-raising scandal to face a full trial so far. Other party
fund-raisers, like John Huang and Yah Lin Trie, have pleaded guilty
to charges growing out of the scandal, and Pauline Kanchanalak,
another fairly obscure figure, is awaiting trial. But no senior
Democratic National Committee officials were ever charged. In a
much criticized decision, Attorney General Janet Reno decided
against appointing an independent counsel to investigate the fund
raising of either President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So, after four years of congressional hearings and federal
criminal investigation, it could all boil down to Hsia. In an
interesting piece of legal symmetry, Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque,
also represented Julie Hiatt Steele, a tangential figure in the
Monica Lewinsky investigation, who was the only person to face
criminal charges in the White House sex and lies scandal. (After a
jury deadlocked, Steele was not convicted).
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is charged with engaging in an illicit scheme to reimburse
Democratic contributors, including donations connected to the
now-infamous luncheon held at the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif., which was attended by Gore. Hsia has pleaded not
guilty. The vice president has said he had no knowledge of the
$55,000 in illicit contributions to the Democratic Party collected
from donors at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   But the temple fund-raiser shadows Gore, particularly as he
campaigns for the March 7 primary in California. Sen. John McCain
has savagely mocked Gore's varying statements about the event
(initially the vice president denied knowing it was a fund-raiser).
On the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley has warned that
the fund-raising scandal is an unremovable stain on Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom last week, it was clear the Hsia trial could
provide Republicans with fodder for attack ads against Gore. Among
the exhibits was a videotape of Gore making his entrance at the Hsi
Lai temple on April 29, 1996, and then giving a speech surrounded
by enthusiastic worshippers in robes. The judge presiding over the
case noted that members of Congress, presumably Republicans, had
already called for copies, while Luque argued against releasing the
tape. ``My concern is that I can just see it played because the
vice president is campaigning on March 7 in California,'' she said.
(On Friday, the judge decided to keep the tape under wraps until a
verdict is reached.)
</P>
<P>
   There are no media throngs filling the grass and concrete area
in front of the courthouse known as ``the beach'' during the Monica
Lewinsky spectacle. The Hsia case involves far less sensational
testimony, including complicated federal election laws, party
allocation formulas and four-year-old allegations of fund-raising
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   That is how the Gore campaign would like it to remain. But the
video isn't the only trial exhibit that could cause Gore problems.
Luque also introduced into evidence a color photograph of Hsia and
a broadly smiling Gore, with longer and much bushier hair, during a
trip they made to Taiwan in 1989. It was during that trip, arranged
by Hsia and Huang, that Gore first met the temple's leader,
Venerable Master Hsing Yun.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is charged with providing Huang and others with checks
signed by monks, nuns and other straw donors who were reimbursed
for their donations by the temple and other illegal sources.
</P>
<P>
   The marquee witness last week was Huang, who testified that he
knew nothing of the reimbursement. Huang occasionally shot a sad
glance toward Hsia, who was once his good friend and political
comrade. In the late 1980s, they helped organize the Pacific
Leadership Council in order to gain more clout for Asian-Americans
in California. To achieve that goal, Huang explained, they started
raising money for Democratic Senate candidates, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's testimony certainly exposed some of the dark side of
fund-raising. He made it clear that both he and Hsia were under
intense pressure from the party to bring in money. He said that
fund-raising events featuring Gore were expected to generate
$200,000 and that the temple event had fallen far short of that
amount. He said he called Hsia after the luncheon and urged her to
help him reach his goal of taking at least $100,000 back to
Washington with him. He said he knew this meant she would return to
the temple for more money and when he met her there later, she
handed him an envelope with checks totaling $100,000. Among the
checks were those from the monks and nuns who were later illegally
reimbursed by the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee,
said the party was unaware of the reimbursement scheme or of any
illegal fund raising by Huang, who pleaded guilty to a single
conspiracy charge last August. The committee returned all the money
raised at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Huang said he needed dignitaries from Washington to draw donors
to events in California. He had wanted Gore to attend two events, a
fund-raising luncheon at a Los Angeles restaurant and a visit to
the temple that would not involve soliciting donations. But Huang
was told Gore would only have time for one stop, and so the two
events were collapsed into one. ``Everything was on a tight
schedule,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his testimony was helpful to Gore and Hsia. The
fact that the two events were hurriedly combined and the temple
visit was not originally scheduled as a fund-raiser may help
explain why the vice president at first described it as a
``community outreach'' luncheon. And Luque said that Gore did not
give a fund-raising speech at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's trial has renewed criticism from Asian-American political
activists that relatively small fry like Huang and Hsia have been
singled out for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Hsia has had kind words for Gore. In an interview last year,
she said: ``I've met dozens of politicians. The others come saying,
`Money, money.' By comparison, he is a more genuine person.''

to charges growing out of the scandal, and Pauline Kanchanalak,
another fairly obscure figure, is awaiting trial. But no senior
Democratic National Committee officials were ever charged. In a
much criticized decision, Attorney General Janet Reno decided
against appointing an independent counsel to investigate the fund
raising of either President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So, after four years of congressional hearings and federal
criminal investigation, it could all boil down to Hsia. In an
interesting piece of legal symmetry, Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque,
also represented Julie Hiatt Steele, a tangential figure in the
Monica Lewinsky investigation, who was the only person to face
criminal charges in the White House sex and lies scandal. (After a
jury deadlocked, Steele was not convicted).
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is charged with engaging in an illicit scheme to reimburse
Democratic contributors, including donations connected to the
now-infamous luncheon held at the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif., which was attended by Gore. Hsia has pleaded not
guilty. The vice president has said he had no knowledge of the
$55,000 in illicit contributions to the Democratic Party collected
from donors at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   But the temple fund-raiser shadows Gore, particularly as he
campaigns for the March 7 primary in California. Sen. John McCain
has savagely mocked Gore's varying statements about the event
(initially the vice president denied knowing it was a fund-raiser).
On the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley has warned that
the fund-raising scandal is an unremovable stain on Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom last week, it was clear the Hsia trial could
provide Republicans with fodder for attack ads against Gore. Among
the exhibits was a videotape of Gore making his entrance at the Hsi
Lai temple on April 29, 1996, and then giving a speech surrounded
by enthusiastic worshippers in robes. The judge presiding over the
case noted that members of Congress, presumably Republicans, had
already called for copies, while Luque argued against releasing the
tape. ``My concern is that I can just see it played because the
vice president is campaigning on March 7 in California,'' she said.
(On Friday, the judge decided to keep the tape under wraps until a
verdict is reached.)
</P>
<P>
   There are no media throngs filling the grass and concrete area
in front of the courthouse known as ``the beach'' during the Monica
Lewinsky spectacle. The Hsia case involves far less sensational
testimony, including complicated federal election laws, party
allocation formulas and four-year-old allegations of fund-raising
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   That is how the Gore campaign would like it to remain. But the
video isn't the only trial exhibit that could cause Gore problems.
Luque also introduced into evidence a color photograph of Hsia and
a broadly smiling Gore, with longer and much bushier hair, during a
trip they made to Taiwan in 1989. It was during that trip, arranged
by Hsia and Huang, that Gore first met the temple's leader,
Venerable Master Hsing Yun.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is charged with providing Huang and others with checks
signed by monks, nuns and other straw donors who were reimbursed
for their donations by the temple and other illegal sources.
</P>
<P>
   The marquee witness last week was Huang, who testified that he
knew nothing of the reimbursement. Huang occasionally shot a sad
glance toward Hsia, who was once his good friend and political
comrade. In the late 1980s, they helped organize the Pacific
Leadership Council in order to gain more clout for Asian-Americans
in California. To achieve that goal, Huang explained, they started
raising money for Democratic Senate candidates, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's testimony certainly exposed some of the dark side of
fund-raising. He made it clear that both he and Hsia were under
intense pressure from the party to bring in money. He said that
fund-raising events featuring Gore were expected to generate
$200,000 and that the temple event had fallen far short of that
amount. He said he called Hsia after the luncheon and urged her to
help him reach his goal of taking at least $100,000 back to
Washington with him. He said he knew this meant she would return to
the temple for more money and when he met her there later, she
handed him an envelope with checks totaling $100,000. Among the
checks were those from the monks and nuns who were later illegally
reimbursed by the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee,
said the party was unaware of the reimbursement scheme or of any
illegal fund raising by Huang, who pleaded guilty to a single
conspiracy charge last August. The committee returned all the money
raised at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Huang said he needed dignitaries from Washington to draw donors
to events in California. He had wanted Gore to attend two events, a
fund-raising luncheon at a Los Angeles restaurant and a visit to
the temple that would not involve soliciting donations. But Huang
was told Gore would only have time for one stop, and so the two
events were collapsed into one. ``Everything was on a tight
schedule,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his testimony was helpful to Gore and Hsia. The
fact that the two events were hurriedly combined and the temple
visit was not originally scheduled as a fund-raiser may help
explain why the vice president at first described it as a
``community outreach'' luncheon. And Luque said that Gore did not
give a fund-raising speech at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's trial has renewed criticism from Asian-American political
activists that relatively small fry like Huang and Hsia have been
singled out for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Hsia has had kind words for Gore. In an interview last year,
she said: ``I've met dozens of politicians. The others come saying,
`Money, money.' By comparison, he is a more genuine person.''

<P>
   There are those who may think it is something out of an Edward
Albee play, or maybe ``The Newlywed Game'' meets Jerry Springer.
But for the couple tired of flowers, chocolates and renting Nora
Ephron films, it could just be another way to celebrate their love.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Ohio State University are placing volunteer
married couples in a hospital room for two 24-hour sessions,
inflicting small wounds and then encouraging the couple to chat
about anything from in-laws to their sex lives. Then they take
regular samples of blood, saliva and sometimes fluid from the
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems like ``get the guests'' _ the venomous game in
Albee's ``Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' _ taken to new
extremes, serious science is going on. The exercise is one of a
series of studies at the university that are taking a look at how
emotions affect healing, for better or worse. And the results may
help change how surgery patients are treated, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment and related research are taken so seriously that
the National Institutes of Health recently gave grants totaling $18
million to studies at Ohio State's Institute for Behavioral
Medicine Research.
</P>
<P>
   The couple behind the studies, Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a
psychiatrist, and her husband, Dr. Ronald Glaser, an immunologist,
are in the growing field of psychoneuroimmunology, which explores
mind-body issues as they relate to health. Already they have found
strong evidence that stress can not only make it harder to recover
from illness, but also make a person more susceptible to it.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing about the Glasers' experiment that seems to
interest people the most is not the science, but simply how the
volunteers feel. And they seem especially interested in those
little wounds given at the outset of each session, which include
blisters administered on the forearm with a small suction device
called a chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds terrible, I know, when you hear about it,'' said Dr.
Kiecolt-Glaser, who said she and her husband had both been
``chambered'' several times. ``But it's not. It's like someone
gently pinching your arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguing is not that bad, either, she said, adding that the
goal was not to provoke 24 hours of disharmony. The couples, who
are paid $1,800 and must consider themselves happily married, are
asked to discuss a contentious issue (identified in earlier
discussions) for only a half hour during the second session. During
the first session, they are asked to talk about more neutral
aspects of their relationship, like how they met (although this,
too, can lead to conflict). Over the next 24 hours, researchers
draw fluids to check for levels of hormones like cortisol, which
indicates stress, as well as healing agents like leukocytes. Later,
they correlate their findings with a videotape taken of the entire
session to see when the stress points were.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the researchers have studied wound healing in other
people considered to be under stress, among them medical students
and people who care for Alzheimer's patients, and found that their
healing mechanisms were impaired. But in those cases, they had to
settle for people who reported being under stress. Bound by ethics,
the researchers could not design experiments in which human
subjects, unlike animal studies, were placed under deliberate
psychological pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Then some years ago, the Ohio scientists, drawn by the stress
that naturally occurs in relationships and the ability to measure
it physically in a lab setting, thought of using married couples.
``We wanted to take a real-life situation that was filled with a
lot of emotion and a lot of history,'' said Dr. William B.
Malarkey, an internist who is involved in the studies.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the married couples were not given wounds, but simply
studied to see how their immune and other biological systems were
affected as they argued. The latest experiment is the first in
which the volunteers are given either blisters or small wounds
called punch-biopsies. The researchers hope to study about 100
couples, which could take several years.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser said the findings could help convince hospitals that
reducing stress can improve patient care and even shorten their
stays, which would lower costs. Although much has already been
written about the dangers of stress, he said he wanted to establish
clearly the connection between it and wound healing. ``The medical
community is a very conservative community,'' he said, ``and it
takes a while to convince people.''

   Like many Americans so repelled by ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' that they watched it in astonishing numbers,
Scott Shuger, a columnist for Slate, came away with questions. He
wrote: ``How is this show, with its explicit cash and property
prizes for the woman, not prostitution?''
</P>
<P>
   The question may have been rhetorical, of course. No one said
anything about a sexual quid-pro-quo on the Fox special aired from
Las Vegas last week, and it ended in a wedding ceremony minutes
after Rick Rockwell, described as a real estate investor and
motivational speaker, chose Darva Conger, a nurse, from a field of
50 women who competed to marry a man they had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrangement struck some as akin to prostitution or
soliciting prostitution, both crimes under Nevada statutes. After
all, a woman was promising sex to a stranger in expectation of some
of his assets, and prostitution is defined by law as ``engaging in
sexual conduct for a fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the crime of pandering, in which a third party
``induces, persuades, encourages, inveigles, entices or compels a
person to engage in prostitution.'' Fox did inveigle, and it
offered the winner an Isuzu Trooper and a $35,000 diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas authorities are not on the case. ``I don't watch
television,'' said J. Charles Thompson, the deputy district
attorney, although he said the show sounded like something his wife
had mentioned because her beautician was talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the marriage would nullify a possible prostitution
charge, he replied: ``It's often the case that people have sex and
then get married, but you can do it the other way. We don't mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like something that's going to be big on our
list to prosecute,'' Thompson continued. His office's top
priorities are murder, robbery and rape, he said, though there is
the occasional prostitution arrest. ``If you're hanging on a street
corner with your thumb out saying you'll do certain things for 20
bucks,'' he said, ``we have vice cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve George, a spokesman for the state attorney general's
office, said of Fox's contest, ``They're not selling sex,'' though
he quickly added, ``It may be an end product.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox assured viewers that the entire production was legal. And it
arranged for all 50 contestants to sign a prenuptial agreement
protecting Rockwell's assets, just in case things don't work out.

   ``It's not fair that you didn't get to ask me all those
questions, and I didn't get put on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Multimillionaire Rick Rockwell, ne Richard Balkey, last week
on the hit Fox TV special ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the groom felt the show was imbalanced. The would-be brides
answered all the questions; he answered none.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the folks at Fox: In the spirit of equal time, you need
a sequel with the bridal contestants doing the asking!
</P>
<P>
   After all, the program didn't let on that Rockwell, a real
estate developer and motivational speaker worth $8 million, is also
a former B-movie actor and comedian. Or that in 1982 he told jokes
for 30 hours, making the Guinness Book of World Records for
``longest continuous comedy routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. With on-air revelations like these, ratings
would soar. Plus you should face up to the fact that it's not
single women without rich husbands who are desperate. Networks
without Regis Philbin are the desperate ones. Just imagine: ``Who
Wants to Be a Gold-Digger? Part II: The Bride Strikes Back'' . .
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: So. Are you really a multimillionaire? How much
of your net worth is liquid? Or is this only, like, on paper?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'm heavily invested in high technology right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Aren't you concerned that high-tech is
overvalued?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I also own a lot of small-cap stocks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Hmm. You're not one of those suitors who thinks
the Russell 2000 Index is going to surge?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'm hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Oh, dear. I usually drop those after the second
date. OK. If you were to invest in an Asian country right now,
would it be A) Japan, B) China, C) Singapore, or D) none of the
above?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: C.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Good. How long do you think it would take you to
evaluate my investment portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (surprised) You have an investment portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Of course I do! I'm an experienced gold-digger!
(consulting teal index cards) Next question: I understand you're a
success object. You have a second home and a decent wardrobe. I
gather you're an attractive guy, though I can only see the back of
your head silhouetted in the purple shadows in your ``Wizard of
Oz'' booth. So the girls and I have been trying to figure out, um,
what your problem is. Why you can't find a wife. So, why are you
here?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I resent that. You're here, too!
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I told you, I'm a fortune-hunter. And my best
friend Marcia is always making fun of me for liking men who give me
presents, so she sent my picture in as a little joke. (To camera)
Marcia, if you're watching now, you're dead meat. (To
multimillionaire) What's your excuse?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (miserable) See, I'm a motivational speaker
and by the time I get to a date I'm so burned out from talking I
have nothing left to say. Women find me boring. (He bursts into
tears.)

<P>
   Aspiring bride: Oh, God, you're the crying type too. No wonder
you're not married.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: You're not either!
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: That's because I'm picky.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (incredulous) If you're picky, how can you let
the Fox network choose for you?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I find the Fox Network to be very selective!
Have you seen those boys on ``Party of Five''? Besides, I don't
have the resources to do the kind of background check they did.
They screened you for diseases and past marriages and Swiss bank
accounts and criminal records and _ Fox accomplished in two weeks
what would take an average woman two years!
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I hadn't thought of it like that.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I hear before you became a real estate investor,
you did stand-up comedy in clubs. This whole thing could be a
publicity stunt for you. Would you promise me you'll never do
stand-up again? And you'll never mention me in a comic monologue?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: What about if I get invited to do, like,
Letterman?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I promise. Though, damn, you'd make great
material.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: How would you justify your purchase of me to our
children?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I mean, when our neighbor pops this tape in the
VCR and little Billy asks you, Daddy, did you really buy Mommy on
TV?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'll say we had a very special romance.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Can I get more light on him, please?
Technicians! And can we see a little more flesh? Did you bring a
bathing suit?
</P>
<P>
   (MULTIMILLIONAIRE is stripped and put on display. REGIS PHILBIN
appears.)
</P>
<P>
   Regis: You've used up your ``50/50'' and your ``Ask the
Audience.'' You can either marry him or call your ``Lifeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I'd like to call Marcia.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Marcia is on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: (blubbering) I am so sorry. I'll never send your picture
anywhere again.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I forgive you.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: But he might buy me some stuff. And the diamond
is really pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: So what? He's a former comic, he can't talk on dates,
and his portfolio isn't diversified! Look, you should totally meet
this other guy I was telling you about.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: I need your final answer.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: (still on phone) What's this other guy like?
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: Well, he doesn't have money, but you would love his abs.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: But I'd get to keep the car.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: You are a mercenary freak. (Marcia hangs up.)
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: OK, Reeg. I do.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: You do. That's your final answer?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Yes. It's my final . . . (bursts into tears) No!
Why do I always meet losers? Even on national TV! Pre-screened,
creatively frustrated, incapable-of-making-small-talk losers?
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Maybe you should be a contestant on our next show: ``Who
Wants to Go on a Long Vacation by Herself?''
</P>

   ``It's not fair that you didn't get to ask me all those
questions, and I didn't get put on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Multimillionaire Rick Rockwell, ne Richard Balkey, last week
on the hit Fox TV special ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the groom felt the show was imbalanced. The would-be brides
answered all the questions; he answered none.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the folks at Fox: In the spirit of equal time, you need
a sequel with the bridal contestants doing the asking!
</P>
<P>
   After all, the program didn't let on that Rockwell, a real
estate developer and motivational speaker worth $8 million, is also
a former B-movie actor and comedian. Or that in 1982 he told jokes
for 30 hours, making the Guinness Book of World Records for
``longest continuous comedy routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. With on-air revelations like these, ratings
would soar. Plus you should face up to the fact that it's not
single women without rich husbands who are desperate. Networks
without Regis Philbin are the desperate ones. Just imagine: ``Who
Wants to Be a Gold-Digger? Part II: The Bride Strikes Back'' . .
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: So. Are you really a multimillionaire? How much
of your net worth is liquid? Or is this only, like, on paper?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'm heavily invested in high technology right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Aren't you concerned that high-tech is
overvalued?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I also own a lot of small-cap stocks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Hmm. You're not one of those suitors who thinks
the Russell 2000 Index is going to surge?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'm hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Oh, dear. I usually drop those after the second
date. OK. If you were to invest in an Asian country right now,
would it be A) Japan, B) China, C) Singapore, or D) none of the
above?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: C.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Good. How long do you think it would take you to
evaluate my investment portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (surprised) You have an investment portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Of course I do! I'm an experienced gold-digger!
(consulting teal index cards) Next question: I understand you're a
success object. You have a second home and a decent wardrobe. I
gather you're an attractive guy, though I can only see the back of
your head silhouetted in the purple shadows in your ``Wizard of
Oz'' booth. So the girls and I have been trying to figure out, um,
what your problem is. Why you can't find a wife. So, why are you

   This is a high-input society. It seems that not a minute may be

   I am convinced that there is a great deal to be learned from the
experience of boredom (much of it religiously edifying) and that
thinking about that experience can be interesting, even enjoyable
(at least for some persons, in certain circumstances). What most
intrigued my students about the topic was the ambiguity of boredom,
its surprisingly complex nature. My being bored with someone or
something can represent a trivial matter or a matter of great
consequence. My disinterest can signify either a moral failure or
the presence of virtue. . . . I can be bored, at least for a time,
with something that I continue to care deeply about; even love
cannot banish boredom altogether.

   The gods were bored, and so they created man. Adam was bored
because he was alone, and so Eve was created. Thus boredom entered
the world, and increased in proportion to the increase of
population. Adam was bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored
together; then the population of the world increased, and the
people were bored en masse. To divert themselves they conceived the
idea of constructing a tower high enough to reach the heavens. This
idea is itself as boring as the tower was high, and constitutes a
terrible proof of how boredom gained the upper hand.

Here's how: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Sit on the ground outside and be bored.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to wait a while for true boredom to settle in. You
have to sit long enough for your mind to recognize that running
through its lists and endless chatter won't cause you to
automatically re-engage in typical activities. Just sit there.
Don't catalog all the things you see, or run through the list of
tasks you want to accomplish that day. Just sit and watch, without
interpreting.
</P>
<P>
   As you are sitting there you are probably starting to feel
foolish. Children may waste their time not doing much of anything,
but adults have things to do. More social patterning. Ignore it.
You are not trying to squash that response _ being able to
recognize social norms and act within them is important. Instead,
you are temporarily ignoring the reflex to follow habit. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Next, you might notice a little fear arising. Examine that fear
for a bit. What do you think might happen to you, sitting here on
the ground doing nothing? The answer: I don't know. And that's the
frightening part. Once you are truly bored, you are stepping into
the unknown. You don't know what thoughts will occur to you, what
your eye may notice, or how will feel. You are stepping beyond the
comfort of habitual patterns of perception.
</P>
<P>
   You are starting to itch.
</P>
<P>
   Breathe deeply, from the diaphragm, and relax. Gently resist the
reflex to jump up and get busy with something , or even to continue
sitting there busying your mind with unnecessary thoughts. Just
sit, relax and watch. No rush, no hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations! You can now begin to be truly bored.

   For those who grew up in the 1950s and '60s, mesmerized by the
predictions in Life magazine or The Saturday Evening Post of
exploring the solar system and establishing colonies on the Moon
and Mars, it might have been a little depressing to gaze half a
century ahead to what counts as a big space story in the year 2000:
the visit of an unmanned craft _ with not even a dog or a monkey
inside _ to a lifeless asteroid barely beyond Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The simple probe called the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous met
up with Eros, a 21-mile-long, potato-shaped space rock named, for
some reason, after the Greek god of love, on Valentine's Day.
Adding to the sappy coincidences, the craft's camera spotted a
confluence of shadows on the asteroid that looked like a big heart
_ ``a valentine from Eros,'' mission director Robert Farquhar
called it.
</P>
<P>
   But as mundane as the voyage may have seemed, there was no need
to strain for a good sound bite. Any success, of course, would be
encouraging after last year's disappointing near misses by the Mars
Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander. There was much more, though,
to NASA's accomplishment. In a day when a steady stream of exotic
scientific speculations overwhelms the public imagination _ tiny
superstrings vibrating in a 10-dimensional universe, invisible
parallel worlds, wormholes tunneling through space and time _ a
comfortable satisfaction can be taken from a modest technological
triumph like NEAR.
</P>
<P>
   The closest most people will get to science's more ethereal
wonders is through animations on TV science shows or planetarium
megascreens. At the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York, which opened this
weekend, visitors can take a visual tour of the galaxy and beyond,
finally plunging through a black hole, emerging unscathed onto West
81st Street.
</P>
<P>
   With so many things about the universe that can only be
simulated or imagined, there was something wonderfully direct about
the four-year asteroid mission that reached its destination last
week. The NASA scientists reminded us that for all we don't know
about the universe, when it comes to the basics, earthlings have it
down cold: Put the equations for the trajectory to an asteroid into
a computer, plot a three-year course, whip the spacecraft around
the Earth to give it a gravity boost _ and when you miss your tiny
target the first time, follow it for another year around the Sun
before carefully moving in for final contact.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Earth Time, NEAR came within
striking distance (203 miles) of Eros. It fired its thrusters for
57 seconds, slowing itself just enough (about 30 feet a second) to
be gently pulled, as planned, into the asteroid's field of gravity.
There it became the first artificial satellite to orbit one of
these flying rocks. All this precise maneuvering took place 160
million miles from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   With their digital observer in place, the scientists began
downloading photos of the barren terrain, posting them one by one
on the NASA Web site (www.nasa.gov). Planetary scientists prepared
for a yearlong study of the asteroid's geology, seeking clues to
the formation of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   If this wouldn't make much of a ``Star Trek'' episode, it is
only because viewers have become so spoiled. Whether they glean the
details from the latest issue of Scientific American or from the
newest Michael Crichton novel, legions of popular science fans have
become accustomed to increasingly fantastic revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month at a meeting in Atlanta of the American Astronomical
Society, scientists described how the orbiting Chandra X-Ray
Observatory remotely took the temperature of a black hole at the
core of the neighboring Andromeda galaxy, as though it were
possible to insert a thermometer, deftly removing it just before it
was swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, physicists meeting at a conference in
Pasadena, Calif., discussed the latest twists in what used to be
called superstring theory. It now goes by the name M theory, with
the M sometimes said to stand for ``magic,'' ``mystery'' or
``mother of all theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving an idea of just how fast the theoretical forefront is
moving, Stephen Hawking hailed what he called ``the most exciting
idea in the last 12 months.'' Speaking with his voice synthesizer,
five-second pauses separating each sentence, he explored some of
the consequences of a recent suggestion that this universe is a
four-dimensional membrane floating inside a five-dimensional
universe.
</P>
<P>
   The last reason to reject a hypothesis is because it defies
narrow conceptions of common sense. The curved space-time of
Einstein's general theory of relativity and the paradoxical
predictions of quantum mechanics have proved to be powerfully
precise tools for explaining what is going on in the world. Trying
to merge these two theories into a single picture of creation has
yielded an explosion of perplexing new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing there is a growing appetite for this stuff _ and the
weirder the better _ some physicists have taken their case directly
to the public. In his recent book ``Life of the Cosmos,'' Lee
Smolin, a physicist at Pennsylvania State University, argues that
our universe is but one among many in a ``multiverse'' _ a kind of
cosmic ecosystem in which universes compete in a Darwinian struggle
to reproduce. (The baby universes are spawned through black holes _
cosmic wombs.)
</P>
<P>
   In the latest addition to this genre, ``The End of Time,'' a
British physicist named Julian Barbour lays out an elaborate theory
in which time turns out to be an illusion. Every instant past and
future coexists in an eternal present he calls Platonia _ a
hypothesis put forth earlier by the American theorist Kurt Vonnegut
(see ``Slaughterhouse Five'').
</P>
<P>
   With theories getting wilder and wilder, real physics and
fictional physics _ call it phiction _ have become mashed into a
new folklore. When writers for ``Star Trek'' need to bring back a
dead character or reverse a pivotal event, they can simply invoke a
space-time distortion or declare that what seemed so persuasive was
just a simulation on the holodeck. (In the old series ``Dallas,''
resurrecting the beloved Bobby required tweaking the script so that
his tragic death turned out to be somebody's dream.)
</P>
<P>
   When causality appears so mushy, tragedy becomes impossible. If
a story's essential turning point _ what Aristotle called
peripeteia _ can be undone at will, the drama starts to leak away.
Whether the entertainment comes from science or science fiction, an
old-fashioned narrative sometimes comes as a relief. That's what we
got from NEAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Kosovska Mitrovica is the divided town
in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins. In the last
three weeks, long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north of
the Ibar River and Albanians to the south have burst into violence
that international peacekeepers have only slowly managed to control
_ after they, too, became targets.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica, as the town is more familiarly known, is a mess, but
the reasons go deeper than any tactical mistake by civilian or
military authorities. Mitrovica marks the effective political and
ethnic partition of Kosovo, and its problems explain why true peace
looks so far away, even eight months after NATO took control of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is that so much was left unresolved when
NATO troops arrived. The troops were on the ground, but their
governments squabbled over how Kosovo would be run, over how it
would be financed and even over the ideals that would shape the new
protectorate: Would it be a safe harbor for Albanians, heading
toward independence, or a multiethnic, autonomous province that
would stay in Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   With much in the air, facts on the ground tended to define
everything. And those facts included the persistence of organized
Albanian revenge to drive out the Serbs; the Serb flight out of the
province or into small ethnic enclaves; the emergence of Mitrovica
as the largest Serbian enclave, the real border between Serbian and
Albanian control; and the presence of French troops, who are
historically sympathetic to the Serbs, in charge of Mitrovica and
northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If Mitrovica was some form of wake-up call, it rang long ago. In
November, senior U.N. and Western officials said Mitrovica was
unstable and marked the effective partition of Kosovo, proof that
the NATO-led peacekeeping troops known as KFOR had not extended
their authority throughout the province. They said Mitrovica's
division would allow Serbia to destabilize Kosovo, served as a
touchstone for organized Albanian rage and risked formalizing an
ethnic separation similar to Bosnia's.
</P>
<P>
   In December, senior U.S. officials talked of the urgent need to
get more police in, to break the ethnic barrier and to
internationalize the KFOR unit. Soon KFOR would be seen as the
enemy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But the warnings were not heeded and the good intentions proved
impossible to carry out, given the haphazardly built U.N.
administration of Kosovo, the national pride of the KFOR members
and the failure of the victors to provide the money and trained
personnel to win the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began at the beginning. The war with Serbia lasted
longer than Western officials thought it would and then,
paradoxically, it ended sooner than they had imagined it could.
Washington and NATO were not, at first, prepared to fight the war.
Then the winners were not ready to rule Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an administration that has had little chance
of securing noble but contradictory goals of a multiethnic, stable,
secure, democratic, self-governing but not-quite-independent
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter debate about who should rule Kosovo, the United
Nations was extremely slow to set up shop. Worse, the very
countries that fought to make this protectorate possible still have
not provided the trained police and funding they promised.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of KFOR troops to occupy Kosovo in June, but
policing it was among their last priorities. They were interested
first in their own protection, making sure all Milosevic's troops
and security forces left on schedule. They were worried, second,
about attacks on themselves by angry, armed Serb civilians. They
were enraptured by the reception they received from grateful ethnic
Albanians who had lived through murder, rape and expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not prepared for any discussion of Albanian
revenge organized by the Kosovo Liberation Army. The protection of
Serb civilians and holy places was not high on KFOR's list of
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior U.N. officials suggested that Gen. Mike Jackson of
Britain, KFOR's first commander, judged that if fewer Serbs stayed,
Kosovo would be easier to secure. KFOR did nothing to stop the
exodus of Serbs _ not even to look for possible war criminals among
them. The general attitude was captured in a British headline:
``Serbs you right.''
</P>
<P>
   So when early violence broke out in Mitrovica between Serbs who
had seized the areas north of the Ibar River and Albanians to the
south, outnumbered French troops stopped their own advance and held
the bridges, sealing the town's division.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and the French commanders did nothing to break the
stalemate, and the ethnic separation became nearly complete this
month when at least 1,000 ethnic Albanians were driven from
northern Mitrovica. Now the remaining Albanian families in the
north have KFOR guards, just like the few Serbs left in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians are furious because KFOR has not given them
freedom of movement. They fear they will never control the area in
and around the Trepca mine complex; both sides believe this is the
richest part of Kosovo, the heart of any future state, and the
Serbs intend to hold it.

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Kosovska Mitrovica is the divided town
in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins. In the last
three weeks, long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north of
the Ibar River and Albanians to the south have burst into violence
that international peacekeepers have only slowly managed to control
_ after they, too, became targets.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica, as the town is more familiarly known, is a mess, but
the reasons go deeper than any tactical mistake by civilian or
military authorities. Mitrovica marks the effective political and
ethnic partition of Kosovo, and its problems explain why true peace
looks so far away, even eight months after NATO took control of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is that so much was left unresolved when
NATO troops arrived. The troops were on the ground, but their
governments squabbled over how Kosovo would be run, over how it
would be financed and even over the ideals that would shape the new
protectorate: Would it be a safe harbor for Albanians, heading
toward independence, or a multiethnic, autonomous province that
would stay in Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   With much in the air, facts on the ground tended to define
everything. And those facts included the persistence of organized
Albanian revenge to drive out the Serbs; the Serb flight out of the
province or into small ethnic enclaves; the emergence of Mitrovica
as the largest Serbian enclave, the real border between Serbian and
Albanian control; and the presence of French troops, who are
historically sympathetic to the Serbs, in charge of Mitrovica and
northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If Mitrovica was some form of wake-up call, it rang long ago. In
November, senior U.N. and Western officials said Mitrovica was
unstable and marked the effective partition of Kosovo, proof that
the NATO-led peacekeeping troops known as KFOR had not extended
their authority throughout the province. They said Mitrovica's
division would allow Serbia to destabilize Kosovo, served as a
touchstone for organized Albanian rage and risked formalizing an
ethnic separation similar to Bosnia's.
</P>
<P>
   In December, senior U.S. officials talked of the urgent need to
get more police in, to break the ethnic barrier and to
internationalize the KFOR unit. Soon KFOR would be seen as the
enemy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But the warnings were not heeded and the good intentions proved
impossible to carry out, given the haphazardly built U.N.
administration of Kosovo, the national pride of the KFOR members
and the failure of the victors to provide the money and trained
personnel to win the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began at the beginning. The war with Serbia lasted
longer than Western officials thought it would and then,
paradoxically, it ended sooner than they had imagined it could.
Washington and NATO were not, at first, prepared to fight the war.
Then the winners were not ready to rule Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an administration that has had little chance
of securing noble but contradictory goals of a multiethnic, stable,
secure, democratic, self-governing but not-quite-independent
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter debate about who should rule Kosovo, the United
Nations was extremely slow to set up shop. Worse, the very
countries that fought to make this protectorate possible still have
not provided the trained police and funding they promised.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of KFOR troops to occupy Kosovo in June, but
policing it was among their last priorities. They were interested
first in their own protection, making sure all Milosevic's troops
and security forces left on schedule. They were worried, second,
about attacks on themselves by angry, armed Serb civilians. They
were enraptured by the reception they received from grateful ethnic
Albanians who had lived through murder, rape and expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not prepared for any discussion of Albanian
revenge organized by the Kosovo Liberation Army. The protection of
Serb civilians and holy places was not high on KFOR's list of
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior U.N. officials suggested that Gen. Mike Jackson of
Britain, KFOR's first commander, judged that if fewer Serbs stayed,
Kosovo would be easier to secure. KFOR did nothing to stop the
exodus of Serbs _ not even to look for possible war criminals among
them. The general attitude was captured in a British headline:
``Serbs you right.''
</P>
<P>
   So when early violence broke out in Mitrovica between Serbs who
had seized the areas north of the Ibar River and Albanians to the
south, outnumbered French troops stopped their own advance and held
the bridges, sealing the town's division.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and the French commanders did nothing to break the
stalemate, and the ethnic separation became nearly complete this
month when at least 1,000 ethnic Albanians were driven from
northern Mitrovica. Now the remaining Albanian families in the
north have KFOR guards, just like the few Serbs left in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians are furious because KFOR has not given them
freedom of movement. They fear they will never control the area in
and around the Trepca mine complex; both sides believe this is the
richest part of Kosovo, the heart of any future state, and the
Serbs intend to hold it.

   Meanwhile, Belgrade helps to organize the Serbian resistance in
Mitrovica. And as soon as Serb leaders in Kosovo began to talk
seriously about joining the U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner and
Albanian politicians on an executive council for Kosovo, Mitrovica
exploded. At least 11 people died, most of them Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   However manipulated, it is also true that this round of violence
began with an attack on a U.N. bus ferrying Serbs and guarded front
and back by KFOR, followed by a bombing in a Serbian cafe in
Mitrovica. The attacks set off the exact results desired by
extremists on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's successor, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, has given KFOR more
police duties and has used the violence to add German, Italian and
British forces to the French. More attention is being paid to the
fomenting of violence by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But military fatigue is becoming obvious. Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, complained to Congress last
week that KFOR is ``marking time'' waiting for the civilians to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner has found words to describe the Kosovo dilemma: ``Give
security a chance, then we'll give peace a chance. Eventually,
we'll give reconciliation a chance.'' That's a far cry from the
lofty goals of the West when it entered Kosovo eight months ago.
And it means Western troops will be there for a very long time to
come.

<P>
   America's nine-year economic expansion is now the longest in
history. Companies everywhere are thriving and sharing this
prosperity with workers clamoring for raises. So paychecks must be
ballooning, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Pay should be climbing faster and faster as the unemployment
rate falls and companies raise wages to lure new workers or to
retain the ones they have. But wage increases, instead of getting
bigger, are getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   What a puzzle that is for policy-makers. Anticipating faster
wage increases, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest
rates to slow the economy, a strategy that will continue, Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, suggested in congressional testimony
last week. A slower economy, the thinking goes, reduces the demand
for workers, taking pressure off employers to raise wages. Less
pressure to lift wages means less pressure to raise prices to cover
the higher labor costs. A major source of inflation is thus
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, though, wage growth is slowing even without higher
interest rates. When economists first spotted the smaller raises in
government statistics last summer, they thought it was a fluke. But
now all the numbers for 1999 are in hand, and there is no mistake.
Nearly everyone who earned $26 an hour or less _ 90 percent of the
work force _ found that their pay last year, adjusted for
inflation, rose by far smaller amounts than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mystery,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the
University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. ``The usual
preconditions for wage pressure have existed for some time, but the
behavior that we expected, based on behavior in the past,
particularly in the 1960s, has not been forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Wage growth had accelerated rather smartly in 1997 and 1998 as
the economy boomed. But the expansion was even stronger last year,
with even lower unemployment, and yet wage growth perversely slowed
down. That happened whether the pay was for flipping hamburgers or
designing machines and whether the measure was wages or a broader
category that also includes bonuses and cashed-in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Only people earning north of $65,000 _ fewer than 10 percent of
all workers _ found their incomes growing faster last year after
adjustment for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard, economists are reaching for explanations. High
on the list is job insecurity. Despite rising public confidence in
the economy, many workers still remember the layoffs and
downsizings of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with full employment, workers may be more timid than in
earlier periods of full employment, when unions were also
stronger,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have settled on annual raises of about 3 percent in
the last few years. That was double the inflation rate in 1998.
Inflation was a bit higher in 1999, however, so real wage growth _
adjusted for inflation _ slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   But if inflation rose last year, why did workers settle for the
same 3 percent when a falling unemployment rate (it's now 4
percent) increased their bargaining power? Demographics may play a
role, some economists say. The work force is aging as baby-boomers
move into their 50s and older workers are not as aggressive about
raises. ``If you are turned down, you are not going to get another
job so easily,'' said James Glassman, an economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the job-mix thesis. Manufacturers have shed
350,000 jobs in the past two years, and lower-paying service jobs
have replaced them. The 1996 minimum wage law also played a role,
helping to push up wages at the low end in 1997 and 1998, says Alan
B. Krueger, a Princeton labor economist. The effect wore off last
year, however. And immigrants flooding into the work force have
also held back wages.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, business itself has become more reluctant to raise
wages, invoking global competition as a reason and demonstrating a
readiness to move operations to lower-wage regions in the United
States or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many economists insist that wage pressure will increase
soon. ``We definitely expect hourly compensation to pick up this
year,'' said Kenneth J. Matheny, a senior economist at
Macroeconomic Advisers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ To illustrate an article about a recent conference on
breast cancer prevention, Il Messaggero, the daily newspaper,
splashed across its front page a picture of a sultry nude starlet,
Sabrina Ferilli, reclining on a hammock, touching her breast and
wearing a come-hither look that does not seem directed at an
oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   The color photograph, taken from one of Italy's best-selling
nude calendars, did not offend many readers, not even Dr. Aurelio
Picciocchi, chief of surgery at the Catholic Hospital of the Sacred
Heart in Rome, and a speaker at the conference. ``Oh, that's just
journalism,'' he said cheerfully. ``But I can assure that, alas, no
nude starlets attended the conference. That I would have noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   European countries generally are more relaxed about nudity than
the United States, particularly nudity in newspapers and
advertising. While English and German newspapers tidily tend to
restrict their naked starlets to the entertainment pages, however,
their Italian counterparts regularly blend nudity or startling
graphics into reporting, blurring the line between soft porn and
hard news.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring distinctions is an Italian art form, after all, even
literally. ``It was Leonardo da Vinci who invented the painting
technique of sfumato, smudging the edges of a line for greater
effect,'' said Paolo Fabbri, a professor of semiotics at the
University of Bologna.
</P>
<P>
   That ethical _ and perhaps aesthetic _ dexterity may help
explain the Italian reaction to Benetton's notorious Death Row ad
campaign. Many admired the shock value of the ads that have become
the trademark of the fashion retailer, but few seemed concerned
that the photographer Oliviero Toscani and his colleagues may have
misrepresented themselves as journalists to the prison authorities
and death row inmates they photographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the ads very strong and courageous,'' Paolo Graldi,
editor in chief of Il Messaggero, said. When asked about the ethics
of the campaign, he replied, ``Well, I am not familiar with the
deontology of the professional guidelines that were followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, Graldi saw nothing questionable in
using a nude pinup to report on breast cancer awareness. ``The
picture is both reassuring and suggestive,'' he explained. ``It
shows women that they should not be afraid to touch their breasts.
Breasts are beautiful, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers and magazines routinely feature naked women,
and the newsmagazine Panorama broke new ground in 1997 when it
illustrated a story on privacy with a nude cover photograph of the
former Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli, now 78, diving into the sea
from his yacht.
</P>
<P>
   But nudity isn't the only thing that sells newspapers in Italy.
So do movies. Just as articles on bank robberies often feature a
spaghetti-western still of Clint Eastwood, reports on child
prostitution are almost always accompanied by a still of Jodie
Foster in ``Taxi Driver.'' Adult prostitution is illustrated with
shots from ``Pretty Woman.'' A recent Il Messaggero article on
research on tar-blocking filters in cigarettes was printed
alongside the image of Sharon Stone in ``Basic Instinct,'' lighting
a cigarette in the film's famous interrogation scene.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine tend to inspire the most imaginative
graphics. A report on Dr. Severino Antinori, a fertility specialist
who has been conducting experiments using mouse sperm to combat
male infertility, was illustrated with a drawing of the cartoon
mouse Topo Gigio.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbri noted that for centuries Italian reality, with its cozy
accommodations between church, state, politics, business and even
organized crime has itself presented a blurry picture to the world.
For example, in his 1994 election campaign, former Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi, a center-right politician and a media tycoon,
flooded his own airwaves with political ads and also made many
appearances on his networks' most popular variety shows, which only
his opponents viewed as an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the center-left government of Massimo D'Alema passed
a law strictly limiting the use of political ads on television, and
introducing equal-time rules that infuriated Berlusconi, who has
never conceded that owning the three largest private television
networks conflicted with his political duties.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fact and fiction can be legislated back into their
proper domains in Italy remains to be seen, but Fabbri warned that
the smudging of distinctions between reality, art, journalism and
advertising was not a cultural throwback but a sign of things to
come. ``Unfortunately, this phenomenon is very postmodern,'' he
said. ``The degeneration of values and modes of communication lie
in the future of all societies and not just Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said he believed that Toscani's effort to blend
commerce and political statement has so far backfired. ``He is a
victim of his own confusions,'' he said. ``He is pretending to do
journalism, but people read it as fiction. When they see these
beautifully lit, colored images, most people don't even realize
they are seeing real faces of death row inmates, or it has no
importance _ they see it as another skillful publicity campaign, a
movie poster, not reality.''

<P>
   ROME _ To illustrate an article about a recent conference on
breast cancer prevention, Il Messaggero, the daily newspaper,
splashed across its front page a picture of a sultry nude starlet,
Sabrina Ferilli, reclining on a hammock, touching her breast and
wearing a come-hither look that does not seem directed at an
oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   The color photograph, taken from one of Italy's best-selling
nude calendars, did not offend many readers, not even Dr. Aurelio
Picciocchi, chief of surgery at the Catholic Hospital of the Sacred
Heart in Rome, and a speaker at the conference. ``Oh, that's just
journalism,'' he said cheerfully. ``But I can assure that, alas, no
nude starlets attended the conference. That I would have noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   European countries generally are more relaxed about nudity than
the United States, particularly nudity in newspapers and
advertising. While English and German newspapers tidily tend to
restrict their naked starlets to the entertainment pages, however,
their Italian counterparts regularly blend nudity or startling
graphics into reporting, blurring the line between soft porn and
hard news.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring distinctions is an Italian art form, after all, even
literally. ``It was Leonardo da Vinci who invented the painting
technique of sfumato, smudging the edges of a line for greater
effect,'' said Paolo Fabbri, a professor of semiotics at the
University of Bologna.
</P>
<P>
   That ethical _ and perhaps aesthetic _ dexterity may help
explain the Italian reaction to Benetton's notorious Death Row ad
campaign. Many admired the shock value of the ads that have become
the trademark of the fashion retailer, but few seemed concerned
that the photographer Oliviero Toscani and his colleagues may have
misrepresented themselves as journalists to the prison authorities
and death row inmates they photographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the ads very strong and courageous,'' Paolo Graldi,
editor in chief of Il Messaggero, said. When asked about the ethics
of the campaign, he replied, ``Well, I am not familiar with the
deontology of the professional guidelines that were followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, Graldi saw nothing questionable in
using a nude pinup to report on breast cancer awareness. ``The
picture is both reassuring and suggestive,'' he explained. ``It
shows women that they should not be afraid to touch their breasts.
Breasts are beautiful, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers and magazines routinely feature naked women,
and the newsmagazine Panorama broke new ground in 1997 when it
illustrated a story on privacy with a nude cover photograph of the
former Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli, now 78, diving into the sea
from his yacht.
</P>
<P>
   But nudity isn't the only thing that sells newspapers in Italy.
So do movies. Just as articles on bank robberies often feature a
spaghetti-western still of Clint Eastwood, reports on child
prostitution are almost always accompanied by a still of Jodie
Foster in ``Taxi Driver.'' Adult prostitution is illustrated with
shots from ``Pretty Woman.'' A recent Il Messaggero article on
research on tar-blocking filters in cigarettes was printed
alongside the image of Sharon Stone in ``Basic Instinct,'' lighting
a cigarette in the film's famous interrogation scene.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine tend to inspire the most imaginative
graphics. A report on Dr. Severino Antinori, a fertility specialist
who has been conducting experiments using mouse sperm to combat
male infertility, was illustrated with a drawing of the cartoon
mouse Topo Gigio.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbri noted that for centuries Italian reality, with its cozy
accommodations between church, state, politics, business and even
organized crime has itself presented a blurry picture to the world.
For example, in his 1994 election campaign, former Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi, a center-right politician and a media tycoon,
flooded his own airwaves with political ads and also made many
appearances on his networks' most popular variety shows, which only
his opponents viewed as an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the center-left government of Massimo D'Alema passed
a law strictly limiting the use of political ads on television, and
introducing equal-time rules that infuriated Berlusconi, who has
never conceded that owning the three largest private television
networks conflicted with his political duties.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fact and fiction can be legislated back into their
proper domains in Italy remains to be seen, but Fabbri warned that
the smudging of distinctions between reality, art, journalism and
advertising was not a cultural throwback but a sign of things to
come. ``Unfortunately, this phenomenon is very postmodern,'' he
said. ``The degeneration of values and modes of communication lie
in the future of all societies and not just Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said he believed that Toscani's effort to blend
commerce and political statement has so far backfired. ``He is a
victim of his own confusions,'' he said. ``He is pretending to do
journalism, but people read it as fiction. When they see these
beautifully lit, colored images, most people don't even realize
they are seeing real faces of death row inmates, or it has no
importance _ they see it as another skillful publicity campaign, a
movie poster, not reality.''

   Welcome to the Onetime Fire Wall State
</P>
<P>
   A few days before Saturday's South Carolina primary, a
Reuters/Zogby poll of Republicans, Democrats and independents
showed Gov. George W. Bush with 42.7 percent and Sen. John McCain
with 42 percent. And this was supposed to have been Bush's fire
wall state _ the one he would win in a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's been a nasty firefight, the sort that Lee Atwater,
that son of bare-knuckle Palmetto politics, would have loved.
</P>
<P>
   After the dull ``No, you first'' courtliness of New Hampshire,
South Carolina brought the invigorating ugliness of ``push
polling,'' in which Bush campaign callers, posing as unbiased
pollsters, did their best to trash McCain.
</P>
<P>
   This primary also highlighted the increasingly independent South
Carolina electorate. Transplanted business people, part of the
state's growing connection to the global economy, upwardly mobile
suburbanites and retirees on the coast have made politics here more
cosmopolitan and less predictable. The big question all week was
how many Democrats and independents might weigh in on McCain's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right remains influential, but uncertainly so.
Both these traits could be seen in Gary L. Bauer's endorsement of
McCain. On the one hand, McCain was assumed to benefit; on the
other hand, no one was sure how much; and on the third hand, it was
duly noted that Bauer had endorsed a candidate who hasn't pledged
to outlaw abortion or to hew to other issues dear to the religious
right.
</P>
<P>
   All the energy and anxiety engendered by this fluctuating
environment were on display last week in a shrill televised debate
ineffectually moderated by Larry King. The spectacle of a McCain
smiling a tight smile to mask his famous anger and an agitated Bush
sputtering in indignation _ both far less articulate than Keyes _
was compelling enough to make one forget that a couple of testy
Democrats, with no primary until next month, were also campaigning
somewhere or another.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Bush, who has already spent a mind-boggling $52
million, will soon have to ask his backers for more money.

   The Man Who Created the Kid In Us All
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Schulz, the creator of the comic strip ``Peanuts,''
died Saturday night, Feb. 12, just hours before his last comic ran.
He was 77. The strip was 50.
</P>
<P>
   From the day the strip was first published, Oct. 2, 1950, the
lives of the comic and its creator were entwined. Schulz once said,
``This is my excuse for existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the humor of ``Peanuts'' was gentle, it was dark, too.
``All the loves in the strip are unrequited,'' Schulz once said,
``all the baseball games are lost, all the test scores are D
minuses; the Great Pumpkin never comes; and the football is always
pulled away.''
</P>
<P>
   What accounted for the pull of ``Peanuts''? Umberto Eco, the
novelist and semiotician, who wrote the introduction to the first
``Peanuts'' book translated into Italian, thought it captured
modern neurosis. Schulz's wife, Jeannie, said the characters were
parts of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Schulz said, he woke up in the middle of the night
thinking about Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Linus and exclaimed:
``Good grief! Who are all these little people? Must I live with
them for the rest of my life?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was yes.

   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who shut down the government
of Northern Ireland , continued to keep it shut over disagreements
on how the Irish Republican Army should disarm its arsenal of
weapons, despite demands from Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, that the
government be restored. Adams' demands were met by counter demands
from Blair, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble that the IRA first return to disarmament
talks.

   For the second time in 10 months, students from Columbine High

Kunselman, 15, and Stephanie Hart, 16, were found behind a counter
in a Littleton, Colo., sandwich shop, just blocks from the school
where two students killed 13 people, and then themselves, last
April. Authorities, who said little about the latest shootings,
interviewed scores of people in the area, hoping to learn whether
robbery or something else was the motive.

colleague, Constantinos Skordis, have published a paper showing
that a ubiquitous energy named quintessence could inflate the known

   Americans are forsaking face-to-face relationships in favor of
Web surfing and e-mail, according to a nationwide survey by the
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society. The survey, which
is based on 4,113 telephone interviews, suggests that the Web is
also cutting into time once spent watching television and reading
newspapers.

<P>
   Internet defenders responded that the Web enabled people
separated by time or space to stay in close contact and gave new
independence to the aged and infirm. Still, said the study's

``When you spend your time on the Internet, you never hear a human

rejected his proposed new constitution. With the economy in a
shambles, citizens, urban ones in particular, showed no inclination
to strengthen the man many blame for soaring inflation, rising
unemployment and a litany of other ills. A new opposition party
smells blood, and parliamentary elections in April promise to be
interesting.

   A leaky pipe inside a steam generator at the Indian Point 2
nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., may have released a puff of
radioactive gas into the atmosphere. The plant's owner,
Consolidated Edison, said there had been signs of leaks weeks
before, but said that radiation levels near the plant were
one-fifth ``the exposure you currently get just from walking in a
park, standing on a rock.''

<P>
   The leak could doom the 26-year-old plant 35 miles north of New

have to rise to keep inflation in check.

   A Drippy Nuclear Plant

<P>
   A leaky pipe inside a steam generator at the Indian Point 2
nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., may have released a puff of
radioactive gas into the atmosphere. The plant's owner,
Consolidated Edison, said there had been signs of leaks weeks
before, but said that radiation levels near the plant were
one-fifth ``the exposure you currently get just from walking in a
park, standing on a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The leak could doom the 26-year-old plant 35 miles north of New
York City, which Con Ed wants to sell. Experts said that when a
nuclear plant's generators start to go, the problems are often too
costly to be worth fixing.

SHOULD IRA WITHDRAWALS BE DELAYED UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE DATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I will be 70 1/2 this year and my wife will be 66. I am
fully retired. As you know, one is required to start taking minimum
withdrawals from IRAs the year after he reaches 70 1/2, so for me
that year will be 2001. This means I have only a few months to
position my IRA so as to be most advantageous to me at the time I
must start my required minimum distribution. Would it be advisable
to begin the required minimum distribution from my IRAs this year
rather than having to take two distributions during the first year
if I wait until tax year 2001 to begin the withdrawals? How should
I reallocate my IRA holdings at this time? I have income from the
military, Social Security for myself and my wife, and income other
investments, so I do not need the IRA withdrawals for living
expenses. Therefore, I will take only the minimum withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   G. L. Seal Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. If your goal is to remove money from your IRA as slowly as
possible, you would be better off taking your first mandatory
minimum withdrawal this year rather next year, when you would have
to take two withdrawals, one for the year in which you turned 70
1/2 and another for tax year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math. Your joint and life expectancy is determined by
the ages of yourself and your beneficiary on your birthdays in the
tax year in question.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you turn 70 1/2 before June 30, you would calculate the
life expectancy using your wife's age of 66 and your age of 71.
Using the IRS life expectancy tables, you would get a life
expectancy of 22.2 years, and divide the IRA balance by 22.2.
</P>
<P>
   If the balance were the same as it currently is, that would
require a withdrawal of $19,690. (If you turn 70 1/2 after June 30,
the calculation would be based on ages of 70 and 66, the divisor
would be 22.5, and the mandatory minimum withdrawal would be only
$19,427.)
</P>
<P>
   In the next tax year, your divisor would fall to 21.7 or 21.3,
again depending on where your birthdate falls. Thus, you would face
withdrawals of $20,144 or $20,522, basing the calculations on the
same theoretical balance. The upshot is that for the two tax years,
your withdrawals would total $39,571 or $40,212.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the effect if you waited until tax year 2001 to
take the withdrawals. If you were age 71 at the end of that year,
the divisor would be 21.7 and you would take two withdrawals of
$20,144, or a total of $40,288. If you were 72 at the end of tax
year 2001, you would face two withdrawals of $20,522 each, for a
total of $41,044.
</P>
<P>
   There is another way that taking your first withdrawal this year
might benefit you. This is that if you wait until tax year 2001 to
take the double withdrawal, the addition of more than $40,000 to
your taxable income might push you into a higher tax bracket, thus
leaving you not only with heavier withdrawals from the IRA, but a
higher tax bill as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for reallocating your IRA portfolio now that you have entered
the age when you must face withdrawals, I see no reason to make a
change. As I break it down, your current IRA portfolio is 31
percent each in stocks and in bond funds, and 38 percent in CDs and
money market funds. (I have divided the assets of a balanced fund
to make that calculation.)
</P>
<P>
   If you like that allocation, which is a fairly typical one for a
person your age, you can simply take the withdrawals
proportionately from each portfolio segment, or take them so as to
realign the portfolio however you like. But if I were doing it, I
would take the actual yields from the bond portfolio and the
CD/money market segments, which I estimate at a little more than
$18,000, and sell only enough of the stock fund shares as you need
to make up the remainder of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be retiring in about three years. I will need income
for the rest of my life, which I plan to draw from a $150,000 bond
portfolio. My investments now consist of about 80 percent in stocks
and stock funds and the rest in bonds or cash. I am leaning toward
the idea of establishing the bond portfolio in the taxable accounts
and leaving the IRA almost fully invested in stocks and stock funds
for growth. This is based on my assumption that the tax
consequences would be the same whether I withdrew dividends from
the IRA or from the nondeferred account _ that is, both taxed as
ordinary income. Is there a fault in my thinking? Also, where is
there a good source of information on IRA withdrawals on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you have worked out the right plan, but the tax
consequences would not be the same if you used the alternative
approach. If you follow your plan, you will have $200,000 in the
IRA, all in stocks. You won't be required to take anything from
that account, and therefore won't have any tax liability, until
after age 70 1/2. You would then have $150,000 in bonds and
$250,000 in stocks in your taxable accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that your bond portfolio yields an average 6.5
percent and that the distributions _ income and capital gains
distributions from funds _ averaged 4 percent. You would thus have
taxable income of $9,600 from the bond holdings and $10,000 from
your stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The latter figure is a hard one to estimate, particularly if the
majority of the holdings in the taxable accounts is mutual funds
rather than common stocks; a funds pattern of capital gains
distribution can be quite irregular, and sometimes have little
relationship to the short-term performance of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But look what would happen if you built the bond fund in the IRA
and took the yield from there: You would have the same $9,600 in
taxable income from the IRA withdrawals, but you would also have
$16,000 in taxable income from the taxable accounts, meaning you
would have taxable income of $25,600 rather than $19,600.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal way to build the portfolio is to have your bonds in
the taxable account, and to arrange the taxable stock positions so
that they are dominated by common stocks with the lowest dividends,
and by funds that have historically been fairly tax efficient, such
as index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Your IRA would then be the ideal repository for your stocks with
high payout levels, such as utilities, and funds that traditionally
deliver large capital gains distributions.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy would reduce the short-term tax effects, but of
course the taxman will ultimately get his due, because not drawing
from the IRA should mean that it will grow steadily during the
dozen or so years after retirement and before you need to take
minimum mandatory withdrawals, and the higher the balance at that
time, the higher the withdrawals will be.
</P>
<P>
   So at that point you could adopt a reverse strategy _ selling
the taxable bond positions and replacing them with common stocks
and tax-efficient funds, and swapping some of the tax-deferred
stock holdings for a bond portfolio in the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am in my first year working as a court reporter and am
already concerned about self-employment taxation. Can you recommend
a ``For Dummies'' book?
</P>
<P>
   C.B., Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there is a book called ``Taxes for Dummies: 2000
Edition'' by Donald J. Silverman and Eric Tyson, but I haven't read
it so I can't provide an evaluation. My tax bible is ``J. K.
Lasser's Your Income Tax,'' revised for each tax year. It resembles
a Manhattan telephone book, and there's no question that some parts
of it are fairly tough sledding.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than faulting the book, I lay the blame for the
complexity on the tax code itself. (Lines from Ezra Pound come to
mind: ``I won't say it wasn't hard going / Over roads twisted like
sheep's guts.)
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, if the dummy is computer-literate, using one of
the computer programs to generate your tax return is probably the
easiest approach. The programs pose a long sequence of questions,
you supply the answers, and you just follow the instructions until
you come to the crushing reality of Line 68 of Form 1040, the one
highlighted Amount You Owe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money musings: Here's a classic quotation for tax time from
Judge Learned Hand, one of the nation's greatest jurists never to
sit on the US Supreme Court, written in 1934: ``Anyone may so
arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he
is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the
Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's
taxes.''

MOVE OVER DAY TRADERS: T-BILL BUYERS USE THE NET, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet isn't just for day traders, tech-stock mavens, or
others who want in on the excitement of the stock market. It's also
for individual investors who want to buy something as conservative
as US Treasury securities and savings bonds.
</P>
<P>
   At two Web sites, www.treasurydirect.gov and
www.publicdebt.treas.gov, you can make a direct purchase of
Treasury securities online _ once you have mailed in a paper
application to establish a TreasuryDirect account.
</P>
<P>
   At a third site, www.savingsbonds.gov, parents, aunts and
uncles, and grandparents can buy that perennially popular gift for
young children _ the US savings bond _ with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, with Treasuries or savings bonds, investors are
helping to fund the $5.7 trillion US debt.
</P>
<P>
   The government doesn't give financial advice, but there are
advantages to Treasuries worth mentioning, said Larry Grey, manager
of TreasuryDirect for the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston: ``One is,
they're not subject to state taxes. The second one is, they're
guaranteed by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Internet, the TreasuryDirect program let
individuals buy Treasury bills, notes, and bonds directly from the
overnment, without a broker or commission. It usually involved a
trip to a Federal Reserve Bank or the use of a cashier's or
certified check.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once your TreasuryDirect account is open and the government
has bank-account debit information, you can order directly on the
Internet. Account holders can also make a purchase by calling
800-943-6864.
</P>
<P>
   Online ordering is just one of the latest additions to
TreasuryDirect. ``One of the things the Treasury is doing is trying
to make it so customers can be self-sufficient,'' Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can still get an application by mail. Call (617)
973-3811 and leave your name and address. Later, you can mail in a
purchase order.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury has gotten rid of the walk-up windows at Federal
Reserve Banks, though.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also makes it easier to reinvest and sell Treasuries
and to pay the $25 fee due annually on accounts with balances over
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites provide plenty of information about Treasuries _
including auction dates, interest rates, and minimum investment
amounts _ plus downloadable applications and a history of the
public debt.
</P>
<P>
   Rules for buying Treasuries can be somewhat complicated, so
check the sites carefully. Some basics:
</P>
<P>
   --Treasury bills, or T-bills, are short-term obligations that
mature in one year or less and are sold at a discount from face
value, paying interest at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, an auction of three-month T-bills resulted in a 5.682
percent interest rate; six-month T-bills had a 6.032 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   --The terms of Treasury notes range from more than a year to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   --Bonds are issued with a term of more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   --Both Treasury notes and bonds pay set interest rates, with
payments made twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation-indexed versions of Treasury notes and bonds
adjust the principal based on the Consumer Price Index and pay
interest twice a year based on that adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum investment for all forms of Treasury securities is
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   US savings bonds are even easier to buy online than Treasuries.
You don't need to open an account first.
</P>
<P>
   Simply go to savingsbonds.gov and click the ``Savings Bond
Connection'' link. You an then shop for everything from a $50
Series I savings bond to a $1,000 face-value Series EE bond and pay
online with MasterCard or Visa.
</P>
<P>
   The site also lets users print out a gift certificate.A savings
bond calculator helps you figure out what a bond is worth today;
other tools help you to calculate everything from the tax
advantages of savings bonds to the growth you can expect from the
investment.
</P>
<P>

Treasuries:

HOPE WANING FOR WOMAN ON TEXAS DEATH ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GATESVILLE, Texas _ Days away from execution, Bettie Lou Beets
has been encouraged to talk, to sit behind a plexiglass-and-steel
mesh screen and dredge up a lifetime of rapes and beatings and
other abuse that she says should have convinced a jury she doesn't
belong on death row.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock ticking down to 6 p.m. Thursday, her advocates
understand the importance of national attention, particularly in a
state whose governor aspires to be president of the United States.
Maybe, just maybe, the TV cameras and reporters' notebooks can help
keep her alive.
</P>
<P>
   But Beets is a reluctant death row celebrity. The
great-grandmother and convicted husband killer says the retelling
is painful. She is a frail, 62-year-old with smooth pink skin, soft
salt-and-pepper hair, and a sad, gap-toothed smile. Unlike some
other death row inmates, she hasn't tried to become a household
name, and she hasn't become one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel just like a broken record,'' Beets said
Thursday, in what she decided would be her final interview. ``It
does help, really it does. It's something I need to do. But it's
just so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Beets, convicted of killing her fifth husband for insurance
money and indicted but never tried on charges of murdering her
fourth, says she has begun speaking out to help other battered
women as much as save herself.
</P>
<P>
   But as some of Beets's advocates concede, her refusal to repent
for a murder of which she has no memory, guilty or innocent, has
hardly helped her win widespread support. Even death row has its
politics, and the particulars of her crime are not as tidy as the
public might like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone likes the good battered woman who has been a victim
of one man and didn't fight back,'' said Dr. Lenore Walker, a
clinical psychologist who examined Beets in 1989 and testified to
her victimization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman fought back and maybe didn't use the best judgment.
It's easier to think of her as a black widow rather than a victim
with limited options.''
</P>
<P>
   Beets's lawyers are not seeking her release or using a history
of abuse to excuse murder. Instead, they are asking that she spend
the rest of her life in prison. They argue that her injuries should
have been introduced as a mitigating factor during her four-day
trial in 1985, which could have spared her the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   They also allege incompetence, even malfeasance, by her defense
lawyer at the time. As Joe Margulies, one of her current attorenys,
put it, ``The cases of women who have endured years of harrowing
abuse have to be looked at through a different prism. Is this the
picture we want of women on death row?''
</P>
<P>
   But Beets's clemency application has failed to stir much passion
on either side of the death penalty debate, leaving her supporters
to worry that Americans in general and Texans in particular have
been numbed by the swift pace of executions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has held more than 110 of them since George W. Bush became
governor in 1995, by far the most of any state. For a death row
inmate, the Texas governor can issue only a one-time, 30-day stay
of execution, something Bush has never done.
</P>
<P>
   There is little visible pressure for Bush to do so now. As the
Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles considers whether to recommend
commuting her sentence to life in prison, only 215 letters
concerning Beets have been tallied by the governor's office. That
compares with the 10,217 received before Karla Faye Tucker in 1998
became the first woman put to death in Texas in more than a
century. Beets would be the second woman in Texas and the fourth
nationwide to be executed since the death penalty was reinstated in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Karla Faye Tucker had a huge press machine working for
her,'' said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, a
Houston-based group that advocates for victims' rights. ``The
propaganda being distributed by her and her supporters was immense,
so we felt compelled to respond. Bettie Lou Beets has not become a
cause celebre.''
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, Sister Helen Prejean, the Roman Catholic nun
made famous by the movie ``Dead Man Walking,'' did stop in the
state capital of Austin, about 120 miles southeast of the state
prison in Gatesville, to attend a rally for Beets and ask for
mercy. Groups advocating for battered women have issued pleas of
their own. But time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Beets's conviction was for the 1983 murder of a former Dallas
firefighter named Jimmy Don Beets. Her lawyers said her husband did
not beat her, but ``sexually humiliated'' her. He was found buried
in the yard of their trailer home outside Gun Barrel City, under a
wishing well and near the body of her fourth husband, Doyle Wayne
Baker, who allegedly beat her before his disappearance in 1981.
Both men had been shot in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   She also shot a third husband, Bill Lane, who survived his
wounds but later died of unrelated causes. That attack resulted
only in misdemeanor charges and a small fine, which advocates offer
as proof that law enforcement officials believed she was defending
herself.
</P>
<P>
   In her prison interview, Beets speaks in a half-whisper that is
partly the result of natural shyness, mostly the result of a
childhood bout with measles that left her partially deaf. With no
claim to innocence or admission of guilt, she insists she does not
deserve to die.
</P>
<P>
   Beets, a ninth-grade dropout who went on to earn her high-school
equivalency diploma from prison, says she had nothing to do with
Baker's death. She also says she cannot remember the details of the
night her last husband died, beyond an argument he was having with
her son.
</P>
<P>
   Walker says she believes Beets went into a disassociative state,
a sort of survival technique developed subconsciously during the
decades of abuse that allegedly began with being raped by her
father when Beets was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being abused just seemed like something that happened to me
all the time, like something I couldn't get out of,'' Beets said in
the interview, her eyes filling with tears until she couldn't stop
them from running down her cheeks. ``I tried to get help. But
nobody helped me . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I think I didn't do it,'' she added when asked
if, given her memory loss, she ever considered the possibility that
she might have killed her husband. ``I don't know what happened.
Some people might find that hard to believe, but I was in a car
accident in 1980, and I don't remember that either.''
</P>
<P>
   That near-fatal accident, according to Beets's attorneys,
resulted in organic brain damage _ another mitigating circumstance
that was never raised at trial. Most corrosive of all, they say,
was her defense attorney's refusal to step down from the case in
order testify that Beets could not have killed her husband for the
life insurance. According to her lawyers, Beets did not know she
had a claim until the defense attorney told her later, when she
went to see him about another, unrelated insurance claim.
</P>
<P>
   But with a potential movie or book deal looming, they add, the
defense attorney had financial incentive to stay on the case, which
enabled the jury to convict her of murder for capital gain and
sentence her to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what was going on'' at the trial, said Beets,
who claims she was left uninformed about every aspect of her case
and could not even hear most of her own trial.
</P>
<P>
   Beets's daughter and son testified against her. In interviews
with Texas newspapers, the adult children of the fourth and fifth
husbands have rebutted claims that their fathers were the monsters
Beets has made them out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the massive search that began after she reported
her last husband missing, possibly at a lake where he often fished,
have raised anew reports that she showed up at the dock in full
makeup, with her hair done, and displaying no emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to empathize, and of course the media has
portrayed her as the black widow, when the black-and-blue widow is
more appropriate,'' said Mark Warren, who, as USA coordinator for
the Canadian section of Amnesty International, is working to raise
awareness of Beets's case. ``But whether she did do this crime or
did not do this crime, the large queston is whether the state of
Texas will execute a battered woman without considering the
shocking story of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The board of pardons, her lawyers say, should have considered
her life story under a 1991 resolution that called for the review
of all cases involving battered spouses. The board has never
explained why the review did not take place, although the Houston
Chronicle reported that such a review has been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   A commutation by the board, whose members are appointed by the
governor, could help Bush deflect claims that Texas is overzealous
in meting out the death penalty. The board, however, has commuted
only one death sentence that chairman Gerald Garrett could recall.
A decision on Beets could come on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innocence is always tidier; I'm not arguing her innocence,''
said Mary Robinson, who lives in Austin and has befriended many of
the nine women now on death row in Texas. ``I am not saying let her
out of prison; I am saying let her live.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Beets has been spending what may be her final days
meeting with her lawyers and finishing the items that she knitted
and crocheted to earn extra money in prison. Without any irony, she
says she has never felt safer than she has in prison, away from the
men who hurt her. She also says she is sorry for the hurt her
stepsons feel at the loss of their fathers, even if she is not
responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how it feels to lose someone, because I lost a
grandmother, a mother, a child, my (grown son in a car accident),
while I was in here,'' said Beets, proudly noting through tears
that her son's organs were donated to people in need. ``Killing me
will do no good. There will just be someone else's grandmother,
someone's mother, someone's child being killed. It will just extend
the cycle.''

A RAMBUNCTIOUS GALLOP THROUGH GEORGE W. BUSH'S CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SHRUB 
The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush 
By Molly Ivins with Lou Dubose 
Random House, 184 pp., $19.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the flood of books being published about presidential
candidate George W. Bush, none is likely to have more personality
than ``Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W.
Bush,'' by Molly Ivins with Lou Dubose.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the book's personality derives more from the writers than
from their subject. Ivins is a syndicated columnist and former
coeditor of The Texas Observer, and Dubose is the current editor of
the Observer, the famously irreverent chronicle of all things
Texan, especially politics. Ivins, in particular, has made a career
of sticking needles into thick hides, with infectious glee.
</P>
<P>
   So a book by these Texans skewering their governor and then
roasting the would-be president on a rhetorical rack would seem to
be a natural, and ``Shrub'' does not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it will not disappoint liberals looking for a laugh at
the expense of the compassionate conservative, and it will not
disappoint Bush supporters who doubtless anticipate a negative
thrust from this quarter. Example: ``If you think his daddy had
trouble with `the vision thing,' wait till you meet this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Less partisan readers wishing to learn something about the
potential president will find here a view of Bush's role in Texas
politics that is entertaining and occasionally revealing, but that
is only one fairly narrow viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivins and Dubose are candid about some of the things the
book is not. It is not, for instance, a psychological probe into
how an upper-class white boy became a tough guy growing up in Texas
politics. ``Somebody should probably be worrying about how all this
could affect his handling of future encounters with some Saddam
Hussein,'' they say, ``but that's beyond the scope of this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the authors make it clear they have no interest
whatever in the details of Bush's self-styled ``irresponsible
youth.'' Yet they are livid at Bush for securing ever-tougher
sentences for minor drug violations while cutting back
drug-treatment programs that had proved effective.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the book is a rambunctious gallop through Bush's six
years as governor. Ivins and Dubose first establish that relative
to other states, Texas has a constitution that gives its governor
limited powers. Even so, Bush has a record that is clear _ and
clearly lacking, in the authors' view _ on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   He has been extraordinarily harsh in enforcing the law,
especially the death penalty, they say, and extraordinarily tight
in helping the poor, those without health insurance and desolate
communities in the Rio Grande Valley. Compassionate conservatism,
they say, ``is a biblical and ideological justification for further
dismantling what remains of the social-welfare safety net.'' The
environment is another area in which they say Bush has led Texas
from bad to worse _ to being the most polluting state in the
country, by many measures. Overall, they say, ``From the record it
appears that he doesn't know much, doesn't do much, and doesn't
care much about governing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some attempt at providing balance: Ivins and Dubose
credit Bush with putting effort into education reform, including
high standards and better teachers. But they argue he has achieved
only mixed results, as several of the charter schools he has rushed
into existence have faltered, and he failed to turn a single
legislator's vote that would have given him a voucher program he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The central theme of Bush's public life is his enthusiastic
sympathy for business interests _ especially big business. This
explains his early experience in oil (financed largely by wealthy
friends), the bonanza he struck through his interest in the Texas
Rangers baseball team, the pro-business environmental record, the
emphasis on tort reform, and the gushers of contributions that have
flowed to each of his political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrub'' contains little revelation or deep insight. It is
rewarding as an account of Bush's business-centered administration
_ and as entertainment.

LATE STARTER MUST STINT MIGHTILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We have made little preparation for retirement. Our mortgage
payment is $950 a month, with $650 coming from the rental unit,
leaving us with just $300 to pay. We have made a committment to
start investing $400 a month. I know we should start an IRA, but
which one? And how much should we put in? Should we invest the
$15,000 (savings) in a mutual fund, and if so, which one? My
feeling is to be a little aggressive, so I guess my question is
where should we invest to make up for lost time?
</P>
<P>
   G.J., Fallbrook, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'll start with the really bad news: The rate at which you
propose to invest isn't nearly enough to get you very far. Saving
6.4 percent of your income might have been satisfactory 20 years
ago, but at this stage you're going to have to stint on yourselves
mightily. Unless you have the prospect of a fat pension, I can't
really propose anything more than taking a very hard look at your
budget and determining how you can make dramatic cuts _ enough to
double or triple that $400 a month in savings.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, if you add $400 a month to your current $9,000 in
investments, you would amass $103,377 over the course of 10 years _
assuming average portfolio returns of 10 percent. Why didn't I plug
in 12 percent, since you're willing to invest aggressively? Simply
because I don't think you can afford the risk of aggressive
investments, which could backfire and put you even deeper into the
hole. My byword for people who need to make up for years of playing
the grasshopper is to save aggressively, but invest conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how to start? I would not advise putting all of your
$15,000 savings into mutual funds. But if you feel that your
overall financial security _ particularly job security _ is strong
enough so that $11,000 would be an ample emergency reserve, you
could put $4,000 into traditional IRAs. Do so by April 15 and you
will be able to deduct that $4,000 on your 1999 federal tax return.
(Entitling you to a tax refund. If that's the case, I suggest that
you invest the refund _ in addition to whatever regular savings
program you have adopted.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, I suggest you embark upon a program of fully funding
each of your IRA accounts for tax year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If you are beginning in February, you could add $182 a month to
each IRA, cutting the payment to $180 for December. (You are
subject to penalties if you add more than $2,000 a year to an IRA.)
In 2001, you could drop the IRA contributions to $166 a month,
adding $8 to one of the payments so that you will again be
precisely on target.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are unwilling to go beyond the $400 monthly savings
you proposed, fully funding the IRAs will account only for $4,000
of your proposed $4,800 in annual savings. I suggest you put the
remaining money in a bank account until you accumulate enough to
open a taxable fund account. You can open IRAs with initial
investments in the $500 to $1,000 range, but the minimum for
taxable accounts if often $2,500 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for what funds to use: Save aggressively and invest
conservatively. I suggest you begin with the Vanguard Index 500
fund for your IRAs, which seeks to track the Standard and Poors 500
Index. Then, consider Vanguard Balanced Index as the eventual
target for your additional savings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I have newborn twins and expect to pay a
significant portion of their college expenses and to pay off our
mortgage before retirement. Our mortgage has a $183,000 balance,
with 29 years remaining. We add an extra $100 a month to our $1,465
payment. Other than a $350 monthly auto loan, we have no other
debt. It's likely I will not work full time for the next two or
three years, reducing our combined salaries from $165,000 to a
minimum of $75,000. Our rate of savings would be greatly reduced.
We will cut back on 401(k) contributions, mortgage prepayments, and
contributions to taxable savings, but will contribute to the Roth
IRAs and college savings. Is this sensible? Stock funds are 70
percent of our assets; we'd prefer at least 90 percent but feel we
need some cash handy. We fear the large-cap segment of our
portfolio is too high. Should we build up the small-cap portion
quickly? Do we have too many funds? What about our prospects for
having a mortgage-free retirement at age 60?
</P>
<P>
   K.P., Southington, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. With the short-term slowdown in your earnings and savings,
it's hard to predict fairly precisely where you'll be in 27 years.
But I did run a calculation based on the current assets and the
pre-interruption contributions, figuring that future salary
increases _ plus savings increases during later years _ should make
up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Based on expectations of 10 percent average annual portfolio
returns, I came up with an eventual accumulation of $5,766,443 _
another way of saying youd be in fat city. That calculation was
based on a projection of your 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable accounts
only, leaving your emergency savings and the college account to the
side.
</P>
<P>
   Too many funds? Well, you have a lot, but they are solid
offerings. The only effect of having so many is a certain amount of
duplication, particularly in the large-cap arena. If there is a
small- or mid-cap offering in the 401(k) account in which you hold
the Vanguard Total Bond Market position, I'd suggest a swap there.
If the tax consequences are not onerous, you might also swap Janus
Worldwide for Janus Overseas, thus getting a pure foreign stock
play rather than one mitigated by about a third of the portfolio in
North American markets.
</P>
<P>
   And you could invest so as to achieve greater portfolio
diversification. This would probably give you even more funds, but
you seem to have an eye for good ones.
</P>
<P>
   As for the college savings, Roth IRAs and reduced contributions
to the 401(k) and taxable savings:
</P>
<P>
   First off, it's eminently sensible to invest in your twins
early. (I've trod the two-at-a-time path, and it's an exhausting
one). It's equally sensible to focus on the shorter-term goal
(college costs) and in the uninterrupted progress in building that
tax-free Roth account, which will provide you with valuable
flexibility in your retirement when you will need to manage the
withdrawals from the very large projected accumulation in the
401(k).
</P>
<P>
   It seems pretty clear that people who have saved so well by age
33 will certainly have the discipline to pick up the ball again
after a few years' interruption.
</P>
<P>

----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Money musings: Maybe it's the choppy markets, but lately I've
had queries about whether I provide individual advice for a fee.
The answer is no. I'm a journalist, not a financial adviser. To
work for fees would violate the canons of journalism _ and the law.

WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some might say the photos of John McCain's beaming visage that
graced the Feb. 14 covers of Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News &AMP; World
Report were no coincidence: The romance dominating the political
world on Valentine's Day was between the GOP presidential hopeful
and the press corps.
</P>
<P>
   And leading up to Saturday's South Carolina primary, that
relationship had become one of the biggest stories of campaign
2000. At the same time the news media were reporting George W.
Bush's brother Marvin's comment that ``the great sucking sound you
hear is the sound of the media's lips coming off John McCain's . .
.,'' Doonesbury's Gary Trudeau depicted reporters at a McCain press
conference behaving like tail-wagging lapdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Has love blossomed between the usually cynical members of the
Fourth Estate and the Arizona senator? And if so, is it affecting
the presidential primary contests?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question is an unequivocal yes. The
answer to the more critical second question is almost certainly no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the way McCain has run his campaign is something that
appeals to the press. . . . It's kind of `Bulworth' without the
rap,'' says Jeff Greenfield, a CNN political analyst. But ``if so,
so what? So far, he has struck a nerve with the voters. I think the
press role in that is greatly overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that journalists personally like McCain,'' says Robert
Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs.
``There's no evidence he's benefiting differentially from that well
of positive feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say a combination of factors _ McCain's insurgent
campaign, his accessibility, and his refreshing willingness to
admit mistakes _ have helped disarm the media. But they point out
that those same qualities won over the New Hampshire voters who
catapulted McCain into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   On the chicken and egg question of which came first, good press
or good results, Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Washington-based,
nonpartisan Project for Excellence in Journalism, leans toward the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're surging in the polls, the press tends to cover why
you're succeeding,'' he says. ``So the press helps reinforce
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Project for Excellence in Journalism studied two weeks of
pre-New Hampshire primary coverage in five leading newspapers and
nine television programs. While only a snapshot, the survey
revealed that McCain received only marginally more favorable
coverage than Bush. Of the stories in which McCain was the dominant
subject, 31 percent were favorable while 26 percent were negative.
By comparison, of the stories that focused on Bush, 29 percent were
positive and 34 percent were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make the case that the coverage has been
explicitly more positive for McCain,'' says Rosenstiel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another nonpartisan Washington-based media watchdog
group, The Center for Media and Public Affairs, has been studying
campaign stories on the three network evening news shows with
similarly unremarkable results. During 1999, Bush and McCain fared
almost exactly the same when it came to generally favorable
comments. Bush, however, had a significant edge on the issue of who
seemed to be the more viable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The center's recent numbers, which covered the month before the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, showed McCain narrowly besting Bush
on the percentage of positive comments. On the matter of viability,
Bush still held a significant edge.
</P>
<P>
   Lichter's conclusion echoes Rosenstiel's. ``McCain was getting
good press but so was Bush,'' he says. ``My data do not support the
notion that McCain was a media darling who was benefiting
disproportionately from a fawning press.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that McCain has displayed an unusual array of
media skills. That was foreshadowed in November when The New York
Times Magazine published a piece in which journalist Michael Lewis
confessed his affection for McCain under the headline ``I Liked a
Pol.'' Others would soon share those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's bus, the Straight Talk Express, ``has taken on a
life of its own,'' says Roger Simon, the chief political
correspondent for U.S. News &AMP; World Report, who believes the media
have helped magnify McCain's reformer image. ``The bus is the
symbol of the guy who sits there and just talks to the press. . . .
McCain is this guy who appears to be different and refreshing and
he's feeding the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that has inoculated McCain from negative press. In the
days before the New Hampshire vote, he was hit with several tough
stories that bounced around the media universe: the controversy
caused by his statement that he could sometimes identify a gay man
by behavior and attitude; his intervention with the Federal
Communications Commission on a case critical to a big campaign
contributor; and the flap that occurred when he stumbled over the
issue of what would happen if his daughter faced an unwanted
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign continued to roll, thanks more to a candidate style
that includes self-deprecation and confession than any media
forebearance. Jon Keller, political analyst for WLVI-TV, recalls
that when he started a McCain interview by grilling him about his
ties to savings and loan villain Charles Keating, the candidate
immediately admitted serious wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only comment is, how can you get any traction on a guy who
admits fault, is repentant, and wants to talk about the future?''
says Keller.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that the media gravitate to the candidate, like
McCain, who plays the outsider/reformer role. ``Outsiders benefit
from the fact that the press likes outsiders,'' says Lichter.
``That's the way the game is played and McCain has played it
well.'' Lichter also notes that such previous outsider candidates
as Eugene McCarthy in 1968 and Gary Hart in 1984 got bigger press
bounces than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the same kind of longshot reformers, Greenfield says:
``The fact is that over the last 20 years, every candidate who has
been a press favorite has gone down to crushing defeat. . . . I
don't believe the press can make a horse race when there isn't
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Without McCain's clear voter appeal, he adds, ``all the press
gee-whizziness wouldn't have meant a hill of beans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the loudest complaints about press treatment of McCain
are coming from dueling ends of the political spectrum. Tim Graham,
director of media analysis for the conservative Media Research
Center, says the media are ``basically trying to decide the
Republican primary for Republican voters. I don't like the idea of
Dan Rather picking the Republican candidate for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Robert Dreyfuss, who recently wrote about the
McCain-media ``love affair'' for the liberal magazine The Nation,
says, ``Reporters have allowed McCain to create this image of
himself as the straight-shooting war hero with very little to
counterbalance it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry between the press and McCain is undeniable. But
the idea that it is driving his candidacy is more the concoction of
a confused Bush campaign than valid political science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this theory,'' says media analyst Andrew Tyndall,
offering what has suddenly become a unique view of the McCain
phenomenon. ``He got good coverage because he deserved it.''

A DOLLAR COIN? WE HAVE ENOUGH CHANGE ALREADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Mint is wasting its time and coinage trying to convince
Americans they need a shiny new gold dollar. Americans need more
change in their pockets the way Noah needed rain.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the new issue bearing the likeness of Sacagawea, Lewis
and Clark's Shoshone guide, isn't a lovely keepsake. But carry it
around? Make room for it on the dresser? Get real.
</P>
<P>
   The dresser is loaded. So are the candy dishes, jelly jars, and
wine carafes. The kitchen drawers rattle with it. The car grows it
under the seats. The change purse is fat with it and weighs down
the shoulder bag. The pocket seams rip from it. And the plastic
coin sorter that was supposed to help get the stuff organized,
rolled, and into the bank is overflowing onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a $40 million promotional campaign, scheduled to start
next month, can make us eager to cram more jingly into our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as replacing four quarters,'' says Jim Benfield,
executive director of the Coin Coalition in Washington, cheerleader
for the new dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar won't replace the quarters _ it will be in
addition to the quarters and the rest of clinking mess that gets on
people's nerves in check-out lines _ especially when the person up
front has to fish pennies out of a coat lining or drops them down a
grate.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet is to be the person up front who mistakes the subway
tokens for nickels and who forgets how to count because everyone is
staring hard and starting to cough.
</P>
<P>
   Chump change, that's what coins are.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how they make a person feel, no matter how shiny, or
how convenient they're supposed to be at the bus stop or the
vending machine. More of them can never be convenient _ only
redundant.
</P>
<P>
   The new dollar is also likely to be expensive and fattening. The
Mint says so, right in its promotional materials, which contain a
page of testimonials from a gleeful vending industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Buckholz, president of Goodman Vending in Reading, Pa.,
says the dollar coin will ``increase profitability by reducing
service calls, encouraging impulse sales, and allowing us to sell
higher-priced items.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that the upside for consumers is learning about
Sacagawea's journey with Lewis and Clark and treasuring ``the
coin's exceptional aesthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Chump change once again, for the consumer is seen as easily
distracted from the nub of the matter, which is that 80-cent drinks
will probably go up to a buck as soon as the dollar coin slot can
be installed in a machine.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mint weren't trying so hard to push its new issue, a
person might be a little more willing to give it a try. But money
that begins circulating in Cheerio's boxes and Wal-Mart and Sam's
Club stores has all the allure of a deodorant sample.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint, which plans to have 200 million Sacagaweas in
circulation by March 1, is working overtime to avoid another fiasco
like the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which even the Mint's director,
Philip Diehl, calls ``the Edsel of American coinage.'' Not only did
that one run afoul of the public's inherent resistance to coins,
but it looked so much like a quarter that it doubled the tension in
check-out lines.
</P>
<P>
   The gold Sacagawea isn't as bad, but it isn't that good either.
It's barely bigger than a quarter and can still cause confusion in
the dark recesses of a bulging change purse when the pressure is on
to count fast.
</P>
<P>
   Benfield, at the Coin Coalition, and many of the group's members
hope that the dollar coin, which is said to be sturdy enough to
circulate for 30 years, will replace the fragile dollar bill, which
has a life span of only 18 months. But Benfield knows that logic
has little to do with people and their money and that they don't
like the government messing with their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any more personal than that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Coin proponents cheer the wisdom of Canada for ditching the
paper dollar in 1989, after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
introduced a coin with the alluring loon on its face.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone calls it the ``looney.'' And the two-dollar coin,
introduced in 1996, is a ``tooney.''
</P>
<P>
   Figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two decades ago, fire alarms went off in the offices of The New
Yorker, then located at 25 West 43d St. Firefighters rushed to the
scene: false alarm. Meanwhile, a group of writers huddled outside
their 18th-floor warrens. A fireman idly asked what kind of company
they worked for.
</P>
<P>
   ``A magazine,'' one staffer replied. ``Actually, it's The New
Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Yorker!'' the fireman exclaimed. ``Geez,'' he said,
glancing around at the shabby accommodations. ``What's a classy
magazine like that doing in a dump like this?''
</P>
<P>
   You won't find that anecdote in any of the new books published
to coincide with The New Yorker's 75th anniversary. But the story
would almost surely serve as parable for one of the following: the
deep and longstanding disconnect at the magazine between appearance
and reality; the insecurity that drove staffers to cry ``fire!''
(metaphorically, at least) to get the attention of then-editor
William Shawn, the Unabomber of West 43d Street; the contrast
between 1930s-style bohemian chic (good) and 1990s-style Conde Nast
glitz (bad); or even the wistful notion that the entire enterprise
should have burned down when it had the chance years ago, with
Shawn laid out in his woolen suit on a pyre of unpublished
manuscripts, to spare everyone the pain of watching the magazine
wither and rot from within.
</P>
<P>
   Well. Alarms aside, there are a few things that can be safely
said about The New Yorker, past and present. One is that its inner
workings have inspired more curiosity among outsiders _ and more
perfervid memoir-writing _ than any other periodical of its time,
and not by accident, either. Another is that the magazine is not
dead, notwithstanding Renata Adler's hyperbolic obituary notice; in
fact, under incumbent editor David Remnick, it may be healthier
than at any time since Shawn's inglorious departure in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A third is that the Reign of Shawn is of infinitely greater
interest to literary archeologists than the Reign of Tina Brown,
the anti-Shawn, which ended in 1998. (Footnote: Whereas the names
of founding editor Harold Ross and Shawn never appeared in the
magazine before their deaths, Brown never missed an opportunity to
buzz her own moniker into print. Perhaps this accounts for the
discrepancy in third-party interest.) A fourth is that the
magazine's high command tinkered with the editorial formula many
times before Queen Tina took over, and will presumably continue to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, what do the rash of current books about The New
Yorker add to our understanding of the place? What do they say
about the methods and motives of their respective authors:
scholarly and critical analysis, personal score-settling, making a
quick buck, or what? Do we need to know anything more about Ross's
unpolished genius, or Shawn's druidic ways? About ``The Years with
Ross'' (James Thurber's quirky memoir) or The Affair with Ross
(Shawn's hush-hush tryst with Lillian R.)? To recontextualize a
line from Adler's jihad of a book, ``Is this pathology, or the wave
of the future?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Ben Yagoda's exhaustively researched and highly
entertaining history, the answer is: Quite a lot can be learned,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   Yagoda, a journalism professor, is the first institutional
biographer to make extensive use of archival materials donated to
the New York Public Library in 1991 _ including thousands of pages
of interoffice correspondence, the unaccessed e-mail of its era.
His re-creation of the magazine's beginnings and its golden years
(along with some less-then-golden ones) is everything the other
books demonstrably are not, namely: balanced, nuanced, informative,
and fair-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout Yagoda's narrative, which basically ends
with the Shawn years, are nifty portraits of such New Yorker
stalwarts as Thurber, E. B. White, J. D. Salinger, John Cheever,
Saul Steinberg, and Truman Capote, a lineup that reminds us of the
all-star talent The New Yorker has put on the field over the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Yagoda is particularly strong on the early days, when New York
City was becoming the world capital of hip sophistication and The
New Yorker was ``the only cocktail party in town.'' Uninterested in
highbrow culture, founder Ross, a rough-edged Midwesterner and
former newspaperman, conceived the magazine as a comic journal that
would, as he put it, ``hate bunk'' and ``contain some josh and some
news value.'' Almost from the outset, writes Yagoda, the place was
a mass of contradictions: ``a pure accident from start to finish,''
to quote another memorable Rossism, a multiplicity of tics and
talents that consistently defied definition.
</P>
<P>
   In its infancy, as Yagoda notes, the magazine's most successful
component was its art. Yet as the roster of early contributors
(John O'Hara, Dorothy Parker, Wolcott Gibbs, S. J. Perelman, Edmund
Wilson) expanded, so did The New Yorker's cultural significance.
The magazine grew from a showcase for cutting-edge humor and
criticism into a forum (under Shawn) for some of the century's
finest journalism (John Hershey's ``Hiroshima,'' Capote's ``In Cold
Blood'') and best short fiction (Cheever, John Updike, Ann
Beattie), then to a mouthpiece for contrarian political views
(Jonathan Schell on Vietnam and Watergate), and finally into a
repository for the best from across the print-media spectrum, from
Steinberg's illustrations and Pauline Kael's film reviews to the
writing of Ian Frazier, Calvin Trillin, and John McPhee.
</P>
<P>
   As a business, The New Yorker was not only immediately
successful but astonishingly so, growing in circulation from 14,000
to 156,000 between 1925 and 1940. In defiance of its elitist image,
it flourished during the Depression. By 1952, its circulation had
reached 370,000, even as the magazine itself was beginning to
stultify. It was then, writes Yagoda, that Shawn _ ``a poet with a
pencil,'' in one acolyte's view _ shook up the formula again,
publishing writers like James Baldwin and Hanna Arendt. By the
mid-'60s, Shawn's personal foibles were so legendary (the
polyphobia, the corn flakes lunches at the Algonquin) and his
editorial system so idiosyncratic (the endless queries, the layers
of fact-checking, the unexplained last-minute substitutions) that
when Tom Wolfe mockingly profiled him in New York magazine it all
sounded so improbable it almost had to have contained a kernel of
truth.
</P>
<P>
   What of the casualties, then? Joseph Mitchell, perhaps the most
gifted nonfiction writer in Shawn's stable, published nothing for
30 years. The magazine would have none of the so-called New
Journalism, nor much in the way of experimental fiction or poetry.
Rejectees included Styron, Pynchon, Roth, and Flannery O'Connor.
Long fact pieces were often too long and too fact-laden. There were
libel lawsuits and succession struggles, palace intrigue made even
spookier by Shawn's passive-aggressive management style and code of
omerta.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn came to run the enterprise, writes Yagoda, ``the way
Algerian terrorist cells were organized in the Battle of Algiers _
no one knew who anybody else was or what anybody else was doing.''
In the end Shawn himself was the most conspicuous casualty,
standing on his ship's main deck after being harpooned by owner S.
I. Newhouse and exhorting the crew to ``love'' him back to power. A
shout of ``fire'' would have been the apter rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   As for two new memoirs _ one by Adler, a staff writer from 1963
to 1989, one by Alexander Chancellor, a Britisher who edited the
Talk of the Town under Brown from 1992-93 _ one might rightfully
ask, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   (Full disclosure: My late father, E. J. Kahn Jr., a New Yorker
staff writer from 1937 to 1994, suffers some unkind _ and in one
instance, untrue _ cuts by Adler in her book. My late
father-in-law, Robert Shaplen, who covered Southeast Asia for the
magazine, fares considerably better. All I can say in my father's
case is that he's in good company and that like Kael and Roger
Angell, he'll survive.)
</P>
<P>
   Adler's book has gotten the lion's share of critical attention,
most of it negative. Leaving aside her purportedly loving portrait
of Shawn, which manages to out-Wolfe Wolfe in wading into the
waters of dysfunction, Adler goes from nit-picking other memoirists
(Lillian Ross, Ved Mehta) to making sweeping statements about
colleagues' actions and motives, backed by little evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Other books about Shawn and The New Yorker ``do not seem right
to me,'' writes Adler, who published virtually nothing in the
magazine after she skewered Kael in another journal (to Shawn's
great displeasure). At one point Adler refers to the ``ethic of
silence'' that developed under Shawn, the feeling among some New
Yorker writers that it was ``morally wrong to write.'' Amazingly,
the magazine kept coming out, week after week, without Adler in it.
As it continues to do today, despite Adler's obituary.
</P>
<P>
   The line on Chancellor's slight but reasonably entertaining
memoir involves: many, many dry martinis consumed; endless
welcoming dinners and goodbye parties hosted by titans of the
social and journalistic establishment; an account of how he hired
Jeffrey Toobin to be a Talk writer (good) and how he kept defying
Brown's wishes not to write about cow murders (bad); a rehash of a
Columbia Journalism School panel on British journalists that
Chancellor failed to attend; his on-again, off-again closeness to
Tina; and, what a marvelous time he had spending oodles of Newhouse
money that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My observations of New York were poignantly unoriginal,''
Chancellor writes of his first attempts to wring a book out of his
year in Manhattan. Faced with the prospect of having to return his
advance, apparently, Chancellor bravely soldiered on. To return to
Ross for a moment, the results are long on josh and short on news
value.

ON PAROLE 
By Akira Yoshimura. Translated, from the Japanese, by Stephen
Snyder. Harcourt Brace. 
244 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born in 1927, Akira Yoshimura is an acclaimed Japanese writer
who has written 20 novels, only two of which have been translated
into English. The first, ``Shipwrecks,'' was published here in 1996
to a good deal of critical regard, for its hauntingly careful style
was eclipsed only by the mounting horror of the story it told. ``On
Parole'' possesses a similar titrated intensity, measured in
half-teaspoons and building to a nearly unbearable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the obvious joy of reading the literature of another
culture is the education one receives in the greater world; less
manifest but just as valuable are the mirrored refractions we
witness about our own lives. Both of Yoshimura's English
translations depend upon deeply rooted Japanese traditions for
their stories: upon the dominion of family, the self-control of the
individual, the sometimes agonizing strain of trying to live up to
societal codes. Set in a poor, isolated fishing village on the
Japanese coast, ``Shipwrecks'' told the terrible story of what
befalls a populace that depends on looting for its own survival;
the novel's gothic consequences suggested a complex portrait of
human loss _ of the potential tragedy in doing the wrong things for
the right reasons. This intricacy of purpose also governs ``On
Parole,'' which opens with a man waking up to his first day of
freedom after serving 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a narrative that consistently remains compassionate but
detached, we see the world through Shiro Kikutani's eyes, and it is
not an easy place in which to wake. Formerly a high school teacher
in a village a few hours from Tokyo, Kikutani received an
indefinite sentence for what is first described as ``the incident''
_ a crime that will become clear only after Kikutani himself has
been thoroughly introduced. A quiet man of modest decorum, he was a
model prisoner who passed most of his sentence proofreading for the
prison's print shop. The last few years of his incarceration were
spent awaiting the parole board's decision on his release _ a
torturous process in which he was told nothing, presumably because
that silence would help him come to terms with his crime.
Kikutani's loneliness in his concrete cell was so thorough that he
once captured a housefly, then clipped its wings, in order to have
something alive to keep him company.
</P>
<P>
   athos of this incident has to compete, of course, with its
inherent ghastliness, and that mix pretty much suggests Kikutani's
own life story. The ``incident,'' we learn soon enough, was the
murder of his wife _ a woman he loved and found in the arms of
someone else, at which point he took a fish-scaling knife to them
both. Condemned by his family and village, he leaves prison under
the guidance of a kind parole officer, Kiyoura, and spends the
first few months of his new life in a halfway house on the
outskirts of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The nebulous quality of Kikutani's freedom is apparent from the
moment he attempts to cope with a radically different world. The
society he left 15 years ago now seems a futuristic madhouse of
freeways, department stores, and hugely inflated prices _ even a
shopping trip to purchase an alarm clock is fraught with
apprehension and despair. More inescapable are Kikutani's internal
strictures, the ones that must have served him well during his
crime and punishment both. Walking the Tokyo streets with another
newly paroled man, he strides in the military lockstep he learned
in prison; at the end of his day, he sits in his room on his mat,
feet tucked under his knees, waiting for the hours to pass. He
finds a job shoveling excrement on a chicken farm outside the city,
and each day he dresses in his only suit for the commute, carrying
his work clothes along with his lunch. He discovers the ominously
transformative pleasures of sake. With his new savings, he buys a
heater and a small television; finally, having more to choose from
in the outside world than a mere housefly, he purchases a tank and
a few fish.
</P>
<P>
   All these journeys of discovery unfold with a finely wrought
tension touched by poignance; one feels for Kikutani and his
agonies but also shudders at the ways in which he avoids them,
sensing what the payback must be for that evasion. For this is a
man who, prudish and judgmental about his own sexual desires, feels
no remorse for his crime _ a loving husband who, faced with an
adulterous wife, went after her with the precision of ``a carpenter
driving nails in just the right places.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems extraordinary about ``On Parole'' is the finely
modulated way in which Kikutani's character unfolds. Throughout the
novel, he remains partly sympathetic and mildly unknowable, when it
would have been an easier task to make him unsympathetic and
revealed. His love for and dependence upon the two men who help him
_ Kiyoura, then Takebayashi, who takes over as parole officer _
reveal both the emotional complexity of the man and his vast
psychic need. And the manner in which a courtship is foisted upon
him _ a woman for a bunch of fish, Kiyoura tells him, is ``not a
bad trade'' _ suggests the societal misogyny that must have made it
a bit more tempting for Kikutani to drive those nails home.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``On Parole,'' one is reminded that the literary premise
of the prison of self is hardly a Western concept. Kikutani has
miles to go in search of the peace that sake and psychic repression
promised but didn't deliver; and no matter what path he takes, he
finds that ``his past was still coiled tightly about his heart.''
The crimson blur of fury that awaits him hasn't softened with the
years, in or out of prison. If penitence doesn't really work in
alleviating rage, then neither, as it turns out, does murder.
</P>
<P>
   This is quite a terrible story, not least because, in Kikutani's
world, mercy can be a dangerous thing.

MALE NUDITY IS NO LONGER TABOO, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a tale of two movies _ and a stark example of the film
industry's complicated, contradictory attitudes toward male nudity.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Any Given Sunday,'' Oliver Stone's contemplation of the
kaleidoscopic collisions of football, Cameron Diaz, playing the
young owner of the Miami Sharks, tours the locker room after a
victory. The camera follows the blonde star as she stops to
congratulate one player, who stands naked and larger than life in
every way. He is just one of a number of men shown that way.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is simultaneously a realistic view and an ostentatious
flouting of a longtime Hollywood taboo against full frontal male
nudity in mainstream movies. Yet it received an R rating, which
means minors can attend with an older person, rather than the more
restrictive NC-17, a commercial kiss of death because it bans
anyone under 17 from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Now recall the controversy over ``Color of Night,'' in mid-1994,
when the Motion Picture Association of America objected mightily to
shots of a naked Bruce Willis, front and center. To win an R rating
back then, director Richard Rush was forced to excise a six-minute
segment, consigning the offending organ to the very briefest of
cameos.
</P>
<P>
   So does this mean that our standards for what is acceptable on
screen have changed? Film and cultural critics offer widely varying
views. Some believe cinema's traditional taboo against showing male
genitals remains strongly in place, while others declare frontal
nudity increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, both are right.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, only a few American actors had bared it all for art,
even early in their careers. There was, say, Robert De Niro in
``1900'' (1976) and Richard Gere in ``American Gigolo'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   But the episodes were so infrequent that their very occurrence
made them memorable (particularly after the rightward lurch of the
1980s). Indeed, 20 years later, the novelty of Gere's nude scene is
about all that endures from ``American Gigolo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, however, a new frankness seemed to slip into film.
John Malkovich went nude in ``The Sheltering Sky'' (1990), as did
Tom Berenger in ``At Play in the Fields of the Lord'' (1991).
Harvey Keitel, always the independent, had frontal nude scenes in
``Bad Lieutenant'' (1992) and ``The Piano'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Then there was ``The Crying Game,'' whose entire plot turned on
the unexpected display of the male member, thereby shocking the
protagonist into realizing that the ``woman'' he had fallen for was
different than she seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997), a goofy, sentimentalized
view of the porn era of the mid-'70s to mid-'80s, a filmful of
chatter about the main character's remarkable endowment is realized
visually in the last scene, when Mark Wahlberg's character finally
reveals the gargantuan (prosthetic) organ that has made him a
natural in the adult-entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Male nudity even morphed into cartoon form in last year's
``South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,'' in which Saddam Hussein
uses a penis as a weapon to battle Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Why the change? In no small part, film images mirror a general
easing of cultural strictures. Some of that was unavoidable, as
people as diverse as John and Lorena Bobbitt and Bill Clinton made
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   On TV, hip new shows determined to push the envelope of
propriety brought a nightclub standard of comedic candor to prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Seinfeld,'' for example, ``shrinkage'' became an
instantly recognized term for male anxiety about
post-traumatic-swim syndrome. ``Ally McBeal'' has made a dumb
schtick out of the ``dumb stick,'' a sexual sobriquet imparted
because of the many misadventures on which the impetuous male organ
supposedly leads its putative master.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, even if unseen, a conceptual phallus played a key
supporting role in ``Something About Mary,'' the Farrelly brothers'
much-laughed-about 1998 comedy whose hair-gel gag has passed into
popular culture, if not into fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Credit _ or blame _ foreign films for some of the change, says
Peter Lehman, a professor of film studies at Arizona State
University and author of ``Running Scared: Masculinity and the
Representation of the Male Body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the places you are finding an increase in full frontal
male nudity is in what are usually called international art
films,'' says Lehman, who notes that ``The Piano,'' ``The Crying
Game,'' and ``The Pillow Book'' all fall into that category, as do
``The Sheltering Sky'' and ``Sirens,'' the 1994 film that featured
a naked Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   But there's clearly a different sensibility at work in Hollywood
as well. Gregory Black, a professor of communication studies at the
University of Missouri and author of two books about film and
censorship, says Hollywood executives have long assumed that ``men
are a lot more embarrassed to be sitting in an audience and seeing
male nudity than women are to be sitting in an audience and seeing
female nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, studios are belatedly coming to weigh the demands of gender
parity when it's time to disrobe. Topless scenes, after all, have
long been almost a rite of passage for female actresses. It's
equally instructive that one reputed measure of an actress's having
achieved star status is her ability to insist on a no-nudity clause
in her contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The double standard has long rankled female stars. In an
interview with The New York Times several years ago, Michelle
Pfeiffer put it this way: ``If there's a man who's willing to run
around with his willy hanging out, then I'd run around in the buff,
too. It has to be tit for tat.''
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, more frequent shots of male nudity are
welcomed as a blow for equality before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the female point of view, it is about time,'' declares
Bobbi Frank, director of operations for Women In Film, an
organization of women in the entertainment industry. ``If nudity is
warranted, then why not the male body as well as the female body?''
</P>
<P>
   Where some see progress for the philosophical notion of equality
before the camera, others detect crasser commercial interests at
play: specifically, a recognition of the purchasing power of the
female audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has been a recognition . . . of men as objects
of desire for . . . females, who have as much a right to sexual
desire and fantasy as the men in the audience,'' says Vivian
Sobchack, a professor of film and television at UCLA. ``So I think
it is ultimately a consumer and box office thing that has been
recognized in terms of dollars and demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, differences continue in the treatment of female and male
nudity. Lehman says that when the penis does appear, it's often in
a scene designed to shock or dismay. Thus the moment of
transvestitic discovery in ``The Crying Game,'' the revelation of
incest in ``Angels and Insects,'' the overwhelming drugged-out
despair of ``Bad Lieutenant,'' or the sheer size surprise of
``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a moment of shockingly great significance when
they show the penis,'' Lehman says. ``They can't just show it in a
casual manner, and that is still quite different from the manner in
which the female body is commonly shown.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why ``Any Given Sunday'' just may mark a
departure.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to portray football in its totality, from smash-mouth
combat on the line to pain and panic in the backfield, Stone casts
an equally candid camera on the locker room. No neatly tucked
towels here, but neither an extraordinary moment. These are just
football players as they are on any given Sunday, men
unself-consciously on display showering and dressing.
</P>
<P>
   But in his insistence on that view _ and in his placing Diaz
amidst that male nudity _ Stone calls attention to the very
convention he flouts. He is, in other words, underlining and
insisting on the realism of his scene.
</P>
<P>
   The brief nudity in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' when the camera
refuses to pan away as Jude Law emerges from the bathtub can also
be counted as a move away from exceptionalism and toward casual
candor.
</P>
<P>
   There, foreign arts films still lead the way, however.
</P>
<P>
   If brief is the key description of the nudity in ``Sunday'' and
``Ripley,'' that's hardly true of ``The Pillow Book.'' As the lover
of Vivian Wu, a young woman whose erotic compulsion is to write on
and be written on, Ewan McGregor becomes a naked human canvas, his
sex an unavoidable exclamation point for her compulsive
calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   But if a new cinematic frankness has invaded the locker room, it
has just as clearly stopped outside the bedroom door.
</P>
<P>
   When women are seen naked or partially naked on screen, it's
often in a love scene. Not so with men. Film the male sex organ in
an erotic scene, even unaroused, and the MPPA unceremoniously slams
the door.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Rush discovered when, in ``Color of Night,'' he
tried to put the complete and unabridged Willis in a love scene
with Jane March. Before the ratings board would bestow the less
restrictive R rating crucial for commercial success, almost all the
frontal male nudity had fallen to the cutting-room floor. The
result was a film far more revealing of March than of Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Here the issue has become not the nudity itself but the context
in which it occurs. ``Where it gets difficult is when they feel
there is a conjunction of showing the penis in what they consider
to be a sexual situation,'' says Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has that standard been noticeably eased in the years since
Rush's movie. Indeed, Black says the same sense of sexual
circumspection helps explain why last year's ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
hyped as a groundbreakingly candid movie about sex, could parade
countless naked or mostly naked women before the camera but reveal
few if any naked men.
</P>
<P>
   So if the last decade lessened cinema's stage fright about male
nudity, it has hardly ended the double standard. Nor is it likely
to. Film may indeed have tiptoed toward a franker era, but that
final taboo seems unlikely to crumble _ even in a month of given
Sundays.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The room began as an empty canvas. But Joan Dial had an idea
and, more importantly, an artist to make her dreams and those of
her children come true.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be called Fairy Tale Magic. It's a children's
playroom where several of 4-year-old Justin Dial's favorite
characters _ including, ``Toy Story's'' Buzz and Woody, Christopher
Robin and the Seven Dwarfs _ all share wall space. Justin's baby
sister, Jessica, 10 months, doesn't have favorites just yet, but
her parents figured she might like to share a room with Snow White
and Cinderella. Artist Doreen Behnke added Tarzan and Jane after
Justin saw _ and flipped for _ the summer Disney movie.
</P>
<P>
   Male and female. For Justin and Jessica. And for any other
additions to the Dial family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the whole upstairs for the kids to be really fun,''
said Joan Dial, who lives in Agoura Hills, ``a fun and inviting
place, something that reflects their interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooms getting a theme makeover aren't necessarily for children.
This, after all, is L.A. _ land of dreams. If you imagine it,
somebody can build it. Somebody who knows where to track down
hard-to-find items or how to get a waterfall into a bedroom. But
the more elaborate your fantasy, the more it's likely to impact
your pocket book.
</P>
<P>
   Interior designers cited specific examples: a recreation room
done with `50s soda fountains; an animator with a passion for all
things circus; a replica of the Egyptian Theatre in a subterranean
screening room; a big game hunting enthusiast who _ political
correctness aside _ insisted on decorating a room with actual
stuffed animals in his room of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more interested in having their living space
reflect what they believe to be a statement about themselves or
something they're really interested in,'' said Leah Vasquez, an
artist and designer based in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by your desire for an in-home design fantasy? You
shouldn't be, said the dream builders. A themed room is simply an
extension of that interest. The practice isn't common yet, but
there will always be a client with a mania for something.
</P>
<P>
   When they were hired to design the North Carolina recreation
room of former NASCAR racer Ernie Irvan, officials at Rancho
Cucamonga- based Penwal Industries went positively hog wild: a
symphony of chrome, from ceiling to floor, authentic gas pumps,
crankshafts and tires. Even a portion of a Formula 1 race car above
the custom-designed bar.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan had trophies and racing outfits that he wanted displayed,
but he had no idea how to pull it off. He has young children at
home, but this room was primarily for the entertainment and
pleasure of Irvan, his friends and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Penwal designers met with the racer, submitted sketches and went
to work. The rec room was completed in three months, about half the
time it takes Penwal to do a commercial job.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the entertainment field have been creating these
props and faux finishes,'' said Diane Bader, a marketing executive
at Penwal. ``We're saying you can bring these same elements into
your home. If you want to create a storybook look, we would be the
ones to sculpt, do the molds, create the fiberglass models,
whatever it took to create that whole look.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irvan rec room was Penwal's first job, and now they're
hungry for more. Having built the company's reputation on interior
design of toy stores, movie-themed stores and a Las Vegas hotel,
Penwal is looking to bring what they have termed ``home-theming.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they'll have competition from other commercial designers
or set builders is anybody's guess. Many design companies
accustomed to building movie sets say they aren't likely to start
assembling the Knights of the Round Table fantasy in a private
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the scale they work, I don't know that my companies would
want to build two or three trees,'' said Jim Presnall, executive
director of the Themed Entertainment Association. ``We would rather
do 2,000 to 3,000 trees for a Disney project.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior designers will remind their richly dreaming clients
that any room in any house has to weather the test of time and
changing impulses. Children's rooms, bathrooms and play areas lend
themselves most easily to theming, but will your son be the same
L.A. Dodgers fanatic at age 13 that he was at age 8? If not, his
parents will be the ones forking out the bucks to change the
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go to a themed restaurant and another to
live in it every day,'' said B.J. Peterson, an interior designer
who has offices in the Pacific Design Center. ``People who wax
nostalgic tend to incorporate it into a certain room of the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dial rooms might be called low-key thematic. The playroom
contains shelves of carefully organized books and toys, but the
only piece of furniture that ties into the wall mural is a small
couch with a Winnie the Pooh throw pillow. Placed next to a
newsstand-style book shelf, the couch is tucked in an enclave by
the painting of Christopher Robin reading ``The Dial Fairy Tales''
to Pooh, Piglet and a couple of characters from Disney's ``A Bug's
Life.'' Together, couch and wall illustration make up a true ``Pooh
Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the playroom was done, the process became addicting. With
Behnke's help, Dial and her husband, Greg, turned one bathroom into
an under-the-sea dreamworld _ with accessories to match. A third
bathroom, leading directly into the playroom, became a castle with
painted vines and pewter accessories.
</P>
<P>
   For the undersea bathroom, Behnke did not stop at the walls and
ceiling. Step stools match the walls; soap dishes, toothbrush
holders and towels all have oceanic elements. Inside the tub,
stencils of fish dot the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really see the kids outgrowing this,'' said Dial. ``It
can become very addicting. As you start to go, you realize how
personalized it is and how much fun it is. Justin watched Doreen
during the whole process. He was completely fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Behnke, who began doing murals following the birth of her
children, agrees. It's all in fun, and she gets lots of referrals
from people who see her work and are willing to let their
imaginations run free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's endless,'' she said. ``I just did the kitchen for a
single guywho has a beach home in Malibu. It's the sky, and in the
middle, there's a great big pineapple. He loves it, and he has no
kids.'' &QL;

`DR. CALIGARI' A CLASSIC; `LOVERS' STUNNING BUT LONG 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' (1919) _ For many
decades, this great example of German Expressionism was available
only in cheesy, scratchy 16mm prints. This digitally remastered
version of Robert Wiene's silent classic features a provocative new
score by Timothy Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lovers on the Bridge'' _ Juliette Binoche plays a homeless
artist meandering through the streets of Paris while going blind in
director Leos Carax's stylish bit of melancholy. While it's
fascinating to watch Carax's stunning imagery, it's tough to stay
tuned for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tail Lights Fade'' _ This Canadian road movie begs, borrows,
and steals from the popular hardtop genre. Nothing original in this
race from Toronto to Vancouver. Director Malcolm Ingram needs to
rely less on talk and more on action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Designated Mourner'' _ Playwright David Hare turns movie
director. Movie director Mike Nichols turns film actor.
Actor-playwright Wallace Shawn's play remains wonderfully
stagebound as three actors take turns talking directly into the
camera. It's an intoxicating exercise for people who appreciated
another Shawn collaboration _ ``My Dinner With Andre.''

GOING ALONG FOR THE JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the central conceit of ``Wit,'' Vivian Bearing describes the
similarity of her life to that of the overbearing doctor treating
her for ovarian cancer: ``So. The young doctor, like the senior
scholar, prefers research to humanity. At the same time, the senior
scholar, in her pathetic state as a simpering victim, wishes the
young doctor would take more interest in personal contact.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Bearing's wry acknowledgement that she has learned her
lesson, that a life of the mind _ as satisfying as it might be _
needs to be balanced by a life of the heart and soul. For the
professor, it will provide only small comfort given the advanced
stage of her cancer. For the audience, though, it is not too late.
``Wit,'' like the fairy tale that runs through it, is ``a little
allegory of the soul,'' as one character puts it. And one of the
reasons that audiences have taken Margaret Edson's play so much to
heart is the reenactment of the archetypal life lesson, the journey
of discovery and transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a cursory knowledge of mythology, or of the late
Joseph Campbell, knows that such journeys are central to art of all
cultures. They are also an area in which the theater, for all its
contemporary troubles, still has a huge edge over movies and
television, an edge it would fritter away at its own peril. These
journeys take any number of forms, but a live performance takes the
audience along communally and spiritually. As Judith Light, who
plays Bearing in Boston after an extremely successful run in New
York, said in a Globe interview, the professor's epiphany about
what she had been missing in the poetry of John Donne ``is as good
as any sermon you will hear in any church.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey in ``Violet'' is a much simpler one. Jeanine Tesori
and Brian Crawley's musical is a contemporary recasting of ``The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' In Salman Rushdie's BFI Film Classics
essay about the movie version, he talks about the tension between
the two dreams of returning to one's roots and escaping from them,
with ``Over the Rainbow'' symbolizing the greater power of the
latter: ``In its most potent, emotional moment, this is unarguably
a film about the joys of going away, of leaving the greyness and
entering the colour.''
</P>
<P>
   There may not be any songs in ``Violet'' with the power of that
Harold Arlen-E. Y. Harburg song, but Tesori's skillful use of other
musical idioms, such as gospel and country music, makes ``Violet''
a rewarding journey in its own right. Violet's face was disfigured
by the blade flying off her father's ax, and she's yearning for a
contemporary version of the wizard, a televangelist, to give her
``Gene Tierney eyes, Judy Garland's chin,'' and body parts from
other actresses.
</P>
<P>
   Her journey takes the form of a bus ride with two soldiers, one
black, the other white, from the Blue Ridge Mountains through
Tennessee and Arkansas to Oklahoma. In the rich SpeakEasy Stage
Company production at the Boston Center for the Arts that just
finished its run, the audience went along for the ride and even
wound up in church with Violet. Tesori and Crawley cleverly use
gospel music both to subvert the literal Messianic purpose of
gospel and to substitute a more metaphorical, romantic conception
of deliverance and redemption. The evangelist will be an empty
wizard, too, and Violet's epiphany will come from a more secular
source leading her to the light. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Emotions multiplied &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the nature of that epiphany, the two actors who played
Violet in her 20s and her teens, Bridget Beirne and Kristina
Bjornstad, made it easy for the audience to identify with Violet's
transformation. As Light says, it's as good as any sermon even if
the revelation isn't ultimately earth-shaking. Whenever the two
actresses were onstage together, the theatrical effect was like
nothing in any other art form, as time is encapsulated into an
eerie stillness and emotions are multiplied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet'' made use of a particular device that's also on
display in Diane Samuels's ``Kindertransport'' at the New Repertory
Theatre production in Newton _ having the same character appear
simultaneously as both adult and child. Eva Schlesinger survived
the Holocaust because her mother put the 9-year-old German girl
(played by Emily Dubner) on a train to England. She was taken in by
a kindly English woman, but yearns for her parents to join her.
Most of the dialogue takes place in an attic (shades of another
Holocaust play) where, almost simultaneously, we see Eva as an
adult (Nancy Carroll) struggling for a decent relationship with her
daughter as well as struggling with her own depression, or
repression.
</P>
<P>
   Because we constantly see her as a fearful and traumatized
child, it is impossible not to feel things for her that she can no
longer feel for herself. Her odyssey has been a journey away from
herself. We won't say whether she goes through a transformation,
but the harm of hiding from one's past is almost unbearably
wrenching for the audience. Samuels can be heavy-handed at times
and is certainly no Shakespeare, but the effect of watching Eva's
identity crisis unfold is the same as when classical tragedy hits
home.
</P>
<P>
   Many modernist artists, of course, reject the whole notion of
such transformations as sentimental romanticism. In the American
Repertory Theatre's fine production of ``Full Circle,'' Charles L.
Mee stands the whole notion on its head as a character based on the
Dutch mythological heroine Dulle Griet recites poetic claptrap
while journeying through post-Cold War Berlin. But even the lack of
insight of Mee's characters does add up to less smug assumptions
about ourselves by the time we're through. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Catharsis in music &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A live musical performance can have the same cathartic effect. I
had always found Dmitri Shostakovich's string quartets a dreary
exploration of the composer's private feelings, as opposed to the
high drama of his symphonic output, but the Emerson String
Quartet's recent BankBoston Celebrity Series performance of his
15th quartet, written when he was hospitalized, was as emotionally
wrenching as ``Wit.'' As Lawrence Dutton, the Emerson violist, said
in the excellent liner notes to the recently released recording of
the quartets: ``These pieces are the aural representation of an
incredible spectrum of human tragedy and suffering, with occasional
glimpses of hopefulness. It's an amazing journey, this music.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinematic characters make their own journeys, too, and while
audiences appreciate their discoveries, it's harder to feel a
shared experience. Kevin Spacey's realization that there's life
beyond suburban fantasies in ``American Beauty'' didn't
particularly move me. And while I may lament the hatred of lesbians
and transsexuals displayed in ``Boys Don't Cry,'' I never felt I
was making the journey along with Hilary Swank's character in that
film. What changes do the protagonists of the much-praised ``All
About My Mother'' or ``Run Lola Run'' go through?
</P>
<P>
   Even when there are real revelations in films, audiences these
days don't seem to see that as a communal function of film. Witness
the cool reaction to Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' John
Sayles's ``Limbo,'' and Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown.''
Allen's film was not one of his best, but the Sean Penn character's
realization that he threw away his one chance at happiness in
pursuit of artistic glory was one of the most chilling epiphanies
I've seen on screen. Artistically it parallels Henry James's
``Beast in the Jungle.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Movies and pop culture &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any shortage of transformative journeys in the
movies and popular culture, but these depend largely on reducing
the mess of life to ``Star Wars'' banalities. Thus ``Hurricane''
has to remove the complexities of Rubin Carter's case and turn him
into a street-smart saint. We love tales of Kurt Warner's
transformation from supermarket clerk to Super Bowl hero. Next year
we'll find out he's unfaithful to his wife or took steroids, but
for now we'll swallow the Horatio Alger myth while watching Regis
Philbin bestow instant transcendence on the winners of ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no predetermined correlation between artistic
excellence and the mythological journey. Much in modernist and
postmodernist art sees the transformative journey as sentimental
claptrap left over from 19th-century romanticism. Patricia
Highsmith's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is a gripping novel
precisely because Tom Ripley suffers no guilt from the mounting
pile of bodies. The film, as smart as it is, subverts itself
precisely because it tacks a hollow epiphany onto the ending
(although that isn't nearly as bad as the ending to ``Purple
Noon,'' the earlier film of the Highsmith book.)
</P>
<P>
   But if an artist walks strictly on the wild side of the street,
what happens when the insights aren't that wild anymore? Joe
Orton's '60s-era ``Loot,'' also at the American Repertory Theatre,
is an example of a work that gained its original power from a
darkly comic rejection of mythic transformations of any kind.
Orton's world is corrupt from head to toe and his characters are
beyond redemption, but now that we are living at a time in which
all institutions are viewed cynically, Orton's artistic power is
considerably reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' and ``Violet'' may be sentimental by comparison, but
there is still something that will probably give these 1990s plays
staying power. As Judith Light goes through her amazing
transformation from arrogant professor to dying patient, the
audience's transformation goes in the opposite direction. ``Wit''
isn't about how to die one's death, but how to live one's life.

   (FU) !! 1/2 ``Boiler Room'' This would-be ``Wall Street''
update, which also genuflects to ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' carries
you along on the rush of the collective energy of a roomful of
young hotshots getting rich selling worthless stocks. Its MTV-style
breathless energy subsides long before the end, but not before
Giovanni Ribisi impresses as a smart go-getter and Vin Diesel gets
to us as one with heart. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Cup'' A quiet little film about a monastery full of
exiled Tibetan student monks _ they're secret soccer addicts trying
to get a dish antenna so they can watch the World Cup. The film
succeeds precisely because it's so not Western. Instead of going
for cutesiness or preachiness, it wins you over with its gentle
patience and its implied message that Buddhism is bigger than
sports, rather than the reverse. (G) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``Diamonds'' It's impossible not to respond to that old
battler, Kirk Douglas, playing an aging boxer recovering from a
stroke and trying to repair his damaged family. But a journey of
reconciliation (to Reno, of all places) is played out on a level of
mawkish sentimentality that makes this outing unacceptable as
Douglas's swan song. He still has a lot to offer, and deserves
better. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Hanging Up'' There's the feel of a genuine family dynamic in
this comedy of desperation, in which three overloaded sisters must
care for their declining father. Meg Ryan is at her ragamuffin best
as the middle sister stuck with shouldering most of the work. But
the film isn't what it could have been. Diane Keaton (who directed)
and Lisa Kudrow are underutilized as the siblings, and Walter
Matthau's dad is too one-note. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Miss Julie'' One would have thought Strindberg's battle of
the classes and the sexes in late-19th-century Sweden outdated. But
Mike Figgis and a cast headed by Saffron Burrows and Peter Mullan
invigorate it with heat and complexity. A daughter of the
aristocracy and her opportunistic servant play out their combat as
a claustrophobic fever dream. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Pitch Black'' So-so Aussie sci-fi that's really an old
dark-house thriller, and awfully reminiscent of ``Alien.'' A
spaceship of earthlings crash-lands on a planet filled with flying
flesh-eaters that suggest giant bats with the horned heads of
triceratops. Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell are the most intrepid of
a bland lot. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Whole Nine Yards'' A comedy of hitmen that overrides
genre cliches. The script revels in its devious ability to stay a
step ahead of us as it rides the interplay between Bruce Willis's
laid-back minimalism (he's the contract killer) and Matthew Perry's
farcical terror (he's the next-door neighbor, a dentist in suburban
Montreal). (R)

HANDICAPPING THE GRAMMYS (OTHER THAN CARLOS SANTANA'S) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stirring up excitement for this year's Grammy Awards is not
easy. It appears a foregone conclusion that Carlos Santana, the
sentimental favorite, will win most of the 10 Grammys for which
he's nominated. Fine, and he deserves them after a 30-year career
in which he's been virtually ignored by the Grammys except for one
award in 1988 for best rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
   But where else do you look for excitement this year? That's
precisely the problem, as Grammy organizers try to build a ratings
winner out of a show that is overrun with plastic pop acts.
</P>
<P>
   Is the world waiting breathlessly to see if Britney Spears or
Christina Aguilera is going to win best new artist? Or to see if
the Backstreet Boys or Ricky Martin will win record of the year? Or
whether Cher will be crowned?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique year. We have quite a few acts that would be
generously referred to as pop-phenomenon acts,'' says Michael
Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences. Its 11,000 members vote on the awards, which will be
handed out Wednesday night on CBS (WBZ-TV, Channel 4) starting at 8
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   To see how things have changed, just look at the artists who
performed on the show two years ago (and won a number of the
awards): Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan, Erykah Badu,
Shawn Colvin, Will Smith, R. Kelly, Fleetwood Mac, Fiona Apple,
Aretha Franklin, and Luciano Pavarotti. Then look at Wednesday's
key performers: Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, TLC, Santana,
Kid Rock, Ricky Martin, the Dixie Chicks, Whitney Houston, and
Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of crappy music to choose from,'' says one
Grammy executive who asks not to be identified. ``But you've got to
play the cards that you've been dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene blames today's radio landscape for the ``pop-pop-pop''
tone of the current music business. ``Radio is a cultural wasteland
and to expect (commercial stations) to do anything but jump on a
moving pop train would be too much to expect from them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One way to upgrade the entertainment value this year is to ask
some of the performers to do things they wouldn't ordinarily do.
For instance, half of the Backstreet Boys' segment will be a
tribute to a cappella groups throughout history. Anything to get
them away from the formulaic dance-production numbers that sell
oodles of tickets in the arenas, but can be numbing on TV.
</P>
<P>
   One sure winner should be a Latin segment featuring Marc
Anthony, Chucho Valdez, Ibrahim Ferrer (from the Buena Vista Social
Club), climaxed by Ricky Martin, whose explosive performance on the
Grammys last year started his meteoric rise. The Latin segment will
be the show's longest, and a good way to build momentum for the
first-ever Latin Grammys, to be televised from Miami on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, it seems, the Grammys have a dominant theme. In
1998, it was the year of female singer-songwriters, based on a
flock of nominations for Lilith Fair participants Sarah McLachlan,
Jewel, Sheryl Crow, and Shawn Colvin. Last year was the year of
soundtracks, with ``Titanic'' (and soundtrack goddess Celine Dion)
winning much of the glory. And this year is a case of an ageless
hippie (Santana) against all the flavor-of-the-month upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy voters are typically not kind to the teeny-bop
sensations. Two years ago, you may recall that the Spice Girls were
all the rage in the marketplace, but they garnered zero
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   So, given that history, here's a prediction this year in the
best new artist category: Susan Tedeschi, the blueswoman who hails
from the Boston suburb of Norwell, will win. She's going to beat
out Spears and Aguilera (whose supporters will cancel each other
out in the voting), Macy Gray (though she'll come close), and Kid
Rock (a group that is too politically incorrect for many
conservative Grammy voters).
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi will likewise be boosted by the same factions that
drove Bonnie Raitt and Eric Clapton to Grammy success in the '90s.
Tedeschi also plays her own instrument (guitar), sings her own
songs (no question of lip-synching, which Grammy voters are still
explaining after Milli Vanilli's bogus win in this category), and
she has a neat indie label, Tone-Cool Records. Tedeschi's win will
also be a way for Grammy voters to tweak the major labels and stand
up for the artistic underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The following are more predictions:
</P>
<P>
   Record of the year: Santana's ``Smooth'' (his hit single with
Rob Thomas) will edge out Cher's ``Believe,'' Martin's ``Livin' La
Vida Loca,'' TLC's ``No Scrubs,'' and the Backstreet Boys' ``I Want
It That Way.'' Don't bet against Santana, period.
</P>
<P>
   Album of the year: Santana's ``Supernatural'' by a landslide,
besting entries by the Backstreet Boys, TLC, Dixie Chicks, and the
biggest surprise nominee _ jazz artist Diana Krall. It's rare that
a jazz artist is nominated for this.
</P>
<P>
   Song of the year: This is a songwriting award and will go to Rob
Thomas and Itaal Shur, who wrote ``Smooth'' for Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Female pop vocal performance: A tossup between Alanis
Morissette's ``Thank U,'' Aguilera's ``Genie in a Bottle,'' and
Madonna's ``Beautiful Stranger.'' The Aguilera and Madonna tunes
were perfect pop ditties, but Grammy voters often like more depth,
so Morissette will win.
</P>
<P>
   Male pop vocal performance: Martin's ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' is
just too strong, beating tunes by Marc Anthony, Lou Bega, and
Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Dance recording: Cher will get some due here for ``Believe,''
which fueled an unexpected comeback for her.
</P>
<P>
   Rock performance by a duo or group with vocal: ``Put Your Lights
On'' by Santana and Everlast should be unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   R &AMP; B song: TLC's ``No Scrubs,'' hands down.
</P>
<P>
   Rap album: Look for Grammy darling Missy Elliott (and her album
``Da Real World'') to nip discs by Busta Rhymes, Eminem, Nas, and
the Roots.
</P>
<P>
   Country album: The Dixie Chicks' ``Fly.'' Old-line voters will
go with ``Trio II'' by Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, and Dolly
Parton. But the younger Chicks should prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional tropical Latin performance: The CD ``Buena Vista
Social Club Presents Ibrahim Ferrer'' is too potent to be thwarted.
Anything with the Buena Vista Social Club name is magic.

A RAMBUNCTIOUS GALLOP THROUGH GEORGE W. BUSH'S CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT L. TURNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SHRUB 
The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush 
By Molly Ivins with Lou Dubose 
Random House, 184 pp., $19.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the flood of books being published about presidential
candidate George W. Bush, none is likely to have more personality
than ``Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W.
Bush,'' by Molly Ivins with Lou Dubose.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the book's personality derives more from the writers than
from their subject. Ivins is a syndicated columnist and former
coeditor of The Texas Observer, and Dubose is the current editor of
the Observer, the famously irreverent chronicle of all things
Texan, especially politics. Ivins, in particular, has made a career
of sticking needles into thick hides, with infectious glee.
</P>
<P>
   So a book by these Texans skewering their governor and then
roasting the would-be president on a rhetorical rack would seem to
be a natural, and ``Shrub'' does not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it will not disappoint liberals looking for a laugh at
the expense of the compassionate conservative, and it will not
disappoint Bush supporters who doubtless anticipate a negative
thrust from this quarter. Example: ``If you think his daddy had
trouble with `the vision thing,' wait till you meet this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Less partisan readers wishing to learn something about the
potential president will find here a view of Bush's role in Texas
politics that is entertaining and occasionally revealing, but that
is only one fairly narrow viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivins and Dubose are candid about some of the things the
book is not. It is not, for instance, a psychological probe into
how an upper-class white boy became a tough guy growing up in Texas
politics. ``Somebody should probably be worrying about how all this
could affect his handling of future encounters with some Saddam
Hussein,'' they say, ``but that's beyond the scope of this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the authors make it clear they have no interest
whatever in the details of Bush's self-styled ``irresponsible
youth.'' Yet they are livid at Bush for securing ever-tougher
sentences for minor drug violations while cutting back
drug-treatment programs that had proved effective.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the book is a rambunctious gallop through Bush's six
years as governor. Ivins and Dubose first establish that relative
to other states, Texas has a constitution that gives its governor
limited powers. Even so, Bush has a record that is clear _ and
clearly lacking, in the authors' view _ on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   He has been extraordinarily harsh in enforcing the law,
especially the death penalty, they say, and extraordinarily tight
in helping the poor, those without health insurance and desolate
communities in the Rio Grande Valley. Compassionate conservatism,
they say, ``is a biblical and ideological justification for further
dismantling what remains of the social-welfare safety net.'' The
environment is another area in which they say Bush has led Texas
from bad to worse _ to being the most polluting state in the
country, by many measures. Overall, they say, ``From the record it
appears that he doesn't know much, doesn't do much, and doesn't
care much about governing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some attempt at providing balance: Ivins and Dubose
credit Bush with putting effort into education reform, including
high standards and better teachers. But they argue he has achieved
only mixed results, as several of the charter schools he has rushed
into existence have faltered, and he failed to turn a single
legislator's vote that would have given him a voucher program he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The central theme of Bush's public life is his enthusiastic
sympathy for business interests _ especially big business. This
explains his early experience in oil (financed largely by wealthy
friends), the bonanza he struck through his interest in the Texas
Rangers baseball team, the pro-business environmental record, the
emphasis on tort reform, and the gushers of contributions that have
flowed to each of his political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrub'' contains little revelation or deep insight. It is
rewarding as an account of Bush's business-centered administration
_ and as entertainment.

NEW YORK'S NEW PLANETARIUM: OUT OF THIS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly 40 years, astronauts have been rocketing
toward the stars. Now the rest of us can join in.
</P>
<P>
   The Space Age begins on 81st Street and Central Park West, a
strange place to herald a new stage of human experience. But that's
where you go to get to the Hayden Planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   The Hayden, which takes up the north wing of the American Museum
of Natural History, has been closed for three years, undergoing a
$210 million renovation. With its reopening Saturday, it will mark
the city's first architectural project in many years that is not a
restoration of some past glory, like Grand Central Station, Radio
City, or the Public Library Reading Room _ but, rather, a whole new
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building is what we all imagined a 21st century building
would be,'' says the planetarium's director, Neil de Grasse Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Its chief architect, James Stewart Polshek, calls it a ``cosmic
cathedral'': massive, sparkling, with a 100-foot-high ceiling,
crisscross angles, steep spirals, a curtain-wall of Pilkington
water white glass (the world's clearest glass), and, seemingly
floating at the center of it all, a 4-million-pound,
87-foot-diameter sphere.
</P>
<P>
   The sphere houses the main attraction, the Space Theater. It's
not a Sky Theater, like every other planetarium, including the old
Hayden, where you look up at a projection of the night sky. This is
a Space Theater, where you soar right through that sky, past the
planets, including an amazingly three-dimensional Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Then visitors set off to distant galaxies, into the Orion
nebula, out to the edge of the universe, then back to the Milky Way
via a shortcut: a black hole.
</P>
<P>
   The journey inside the black hole, of course, is sheer fancy,
and great fun: a vast, fast virtual-reality roller coaster, but the
rest is based on real science: data from the Hubble Space
Telescope, the European Space Agency's Hipparcos satellite, and, in
the case of the Orion nebula, three decades of collecting and
mapping at Rice University, all super-crunched through the Hayden's
bank of five Silicon Graphics Onyx-2 supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the stars are in their correct position, and the distance
between the stars is to the correct proportion,'' emphasizes
Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, one of the Hayden's eight staff
astrophysicists, who use the Onyx-2s for research at night, when
the Space Theater shuts down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in the Golden Age of astronomy,'' booms the
voice of Tom Hanks, who narrates the space show, which aims to
illustrate that claim as dramatically as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The images are beamed onto the dome from a one-of-a-kind Zeiss
Mark IX star-projector, bolstered by seven high-definition
SEOS-Prodas digital projectors, which display 9.2 million pixels
(five times the resolution of the most sophisticated
High-Definition Television, and on a much larger scale) _ all of
which account for a lifelike sense of motion, dimension, and depth
that even the brightest sky shows don't begin to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea,'' says Tyson, ``is to make your journey
through the universe personal, to make you realize your place in it
and that you are a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This, it does, in ways that some might find unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Cosmic Pathway, a 360-foot spiral ramp that lays out
the timespan of the universe. At the start of the ramp is the Big
Bang of 13 billion years ago. Each step you take marks the passing
of 50 million years, until you get to the end, where the entire
duration of human history, from cave dwellers to the present, takes
up the breadth of a strand of hair.
</P>
<P>
   In short, we are but a smidgen of a nanosecond, the tip of a
blip on the cosmic radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the Scales of the Universe exhibit, a 400-foot
square walkway around the sphere. At the start, a sign reads, ``If
the Hayden sphere is the size of our observable universe, then this
model,'' _ a tiny ball _ ``is the relative size of the Virgo
supercluster of galaxies.'' Next: If the sphere is the Virgo
supercluster, this model, another tiny ball, is the local group of
galaxies. Then: If the sphere is the local group, this is the Milky
Way.
</P>
<P>
   And on it goes, smaller and smaller, till 30 stops later, we
reach the realm of rain drops, blood clots, and subatomic
particles.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brilliant way of portraying relative sizes and scales,
but the message is once again clear: We are but a speck's speck.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson acknowledges this: ``At every point, you learn how tiny
you are _ in time, in space, in size. That doesn't worry me. The
truth is always better than falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he goes on, his eyes widening, ``it's also empowering,
because you then realize: We've figured this out. Human beings have
figured it out. However small we are, however short a time we've
been here, our minds have grasped the universe, we understand how
it works. That makes me feel big.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' he adds, in a stage-whisper, ``some people in
this world need their egos deflated.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughs, loudly.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Tyson is the youngest director in the Hayden's 65-year
history. He grew up in the Bronx, and knew he wanted to become an
astrophysicist at age 9, when he first visited the old Hayden
Planetarium. ``I saw all those stars at the sky-show _ I'd never
seen so many stars in the Bronx, I was hooked,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He continued his boyhood interest in sports, winning baseball
trophies and gold medals for track, swimming, and wrestling. But at
age 14, he also went on his first astronomical expedition, to the
northwest coast of Africa to photograph a total solar eclipse. The
next year, he gave his first professional lecture. He went on to
Harvard, then Columbia for his Ph.D., published books and articles,
taught at Princeton, and was appointed director of the Hayden in
1996, just as plans for the renovation began.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is also one of only a dozen or so black astrophysicists in
America. In his just-published memoir, ``The Sky Is Not the
Limit,'' he recalls an incident from his sophomore year at Harvard,
when a fellow black student, an economics major who was planning to
study urban poverty, told him, ``Blacks in America do not have the
luxury of your intellectual talents being spent on astrophysics.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time after that, Tyson carried what he calls
``suppressed guilt for pursuing my esoteric interests in the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, nine years later, he had a revelation. A local news show
asked him down to the station to explain a series of explosions on
the sun that had been detected by a recently launched solar
satellite. That evening, as he watched himself on TV, he realized,
``At no time could I recall a black person . . . being interviewed
as an expert on something that had nothing whatever to do with
being black. For the first time in nine years I stood without guilt
for following my cosmic dreams,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson joined the Hayden in the hopes, above all, of inspiring
young people the way it once inspired him. Ellen Futter, director
of the Museum of Natural History, expects 500,000 schoolchildren a
year to visit the Hayden, or, as the entire complex is now called,
the Rose Center for Earth and Space. All told, Futter estimated the
Rose Center will boost the Museum's annual attendance figure, which
stands at 4 million people, by another million at least.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The most popular attraction at the old Hayden, by
far, was the Weight-on-Other-Worlds exhibit, an array of scales
that told you how much you would weigh on the moon, on Jupiter, and
so forth. It was a hokey exhibit, but everybody remembers it
because it gave you at least a hint of what another planet was
like.
</P>
<P>
   The new Hayden has digital scales next to various objects
throughout the building, not just the moon and the planets but also
a neutron star and Haley's Comet. As a separate exhibit, though,
the concept has been junked. After all, there's no thrill in
stepping on a scale and pretending you're in outer space, when you
can feel like you're really there.

THE FALL AND FALL OF `THE PRACTICE' AND `ALLY MCBEAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was but five months ago that ABC's ``The Practice'' and Fox's
``Ally McBeal'' won Emmys for best drama and best comedy,
respectively, and, mostly, deservedly.
</P>
<P>
   Like them or hate them, and many viewers have liked and hated
them simultaneously, David E. Kelley's quirky legal series have
brought an element of the unexpected to series television.
</P>
<P>
   The two shows, set in Boston, have also formed a neat little
Janus of the justice system, circa 2000: glum and sleazy on one
mask, surrealistic and silly on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it was but five months ago that both of these Kelley
creations began to slip rather quietly down the unisex toilet. They
say positive reinforcement fosters quality in performance, but in
the case of Kelley and his firms, the Emmys coincided with his
descent into softness. With ``Ally McBeal,'' the fall comes as no
big surprise; the strikingly original comedy had ``fast flight''
written all over it the day it hit the air in 1997. But ``The
Practice,'' which premiered in the spring of that year, has shown
real potential to become one of TV's long-term favorites, even to
join the league of memorable nighttime dramas such as ``L. A. Law''
and ``ER.'' Its decline has been harder to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' isn't exactly awful this season _ it does come
up with a good moment every few weeks _ but it has lost its dazzle.
One disappointment has been the minimizing of Camryn Manheim, whose
Ellenor Frutt is the show's least glamorous but most engaging
character. An actress who can knock down a house with a roll of her
eyes, Manheim has been given far too few plots this season.
</P>
<P>
   And the plots themselves, always a strength of ``The Practice,''
have lost their tension and originality, like last week's ``Primal
Fear'' knockoff, or the recent recovered-memory fiasco. At the peak
of its creative arc, the drama consistently delivered highly
charged situations _ Lindsay defending her former mentor, for
instance, or Ellenor dating a crooked chiropractor. And it boldly
developed them across episodes, despite the network logic that says
ongoing plots alienate new viewers. (``ER,'' which no longer
cultivates long story lines, has succumbed to that thinking.) But,
unless this week's episode worked some magic (it was unavailable
for preview), this season of ``The Practice'' has yet to build any
compelling long-term intrigues. Even the juicy George Vogelman
thread left dangling from last season was cursorily dumped in
October, with some crummy grade-B-horror moves.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all that the bummer pairing of Helen and Ellenor as
roommates, the unbelievable alliance of Helen and Richard Bay as a
romantic possibility, Eugene's redundant family drama, and the
out-of-character premarital woes between Bobby and Lindsay (she
wants more sex, he wants her in his mother's gown) and you've got a
too-far-from-perfect ``Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``The Practice'' hit its bottom two weeks ago, during
a two-parter that brought the gang to LA to defend a man Lindsay
barely knew. The whole scenario was incongruous, and not simply
because the hotheaded Bostonians looked so humorously alien on
planet Hollywood. Would Lindsay really have taken the case in the
first place? Would Bobby, Jimmy, Ellenor, and Lucy fly out to help
her simply because she intuits innocence against all odds? No and
no. And the quickie resolution of the case, which hits Lindsay in a
lightning flash as a woman puts on glasses, was ridiculous, a
throwback to more simplistic courtroom dramas such as ``Perry
Mason.'' For a show that has asked us to put on our thinking caps
to follow some gnarly legal twists, this was slumming.
</P>
<P>
   The clincher came in the final airport scene of that episode,
when their innocent client serenades the ensemble with bombast
about how worthy they are as lawyers. What has been so juicy and so
contemporary about the firm on ``The Practice'' is their disrepute,
their questionable tactics, their slippery morality, their
willingness to sling plan B at a moment's notice. Heroes? Thanks,
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' has been similarly engaged in efforts to make
its team of loonies into Cabbage Patch Kids. The result: four-star
cringe moments. Two weeks ago, Georgia sued the firm for the
breakup of her marriage, giving John Cage an opportunity to deliver
a rousing defense of the office's sexed-up atmosphere. It was
McBaloney. And it was equaled last week, when the suddenly
softhearted Ling bonds with an elderly man, and the most cynical of
characters, Richard Fish, is seen sobbing over the man's sad fate.
P-P-P-Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as ``Ally McBeal'' has deteriorated into a pandering
mess of titillation, schmaltz, and blondness, Calista Flockhart has
improved her acting style enormously. She no longer relies on
hyperventilating and stammering to convey Ally's anxiety, and she
is so much easier to watch. But her character has nowhere left to
go _ something both Gil Bellows and Courtney Thorne-Smith have
realized about Billy and Georgia. In recent weeks, both actors
announced their decisions to leave the show.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the problems with the show and ``The Practice''
may have more to do with Kelley's schedule than anything else. He
may be losing creative steam regarding his cranky Boston babies, or
he just may be stretched too thin of late, working on the canceled
``Snoops,'' the canceled half-hour ``Ally,'' and the retooling of
``Chicago Hope,'' as well as the other two. The temptations of a
bigger piece of the television pie might be undermining his
creative stamina. Now surely ``Ally McBeal'' has delivered some
wisdom on the subject of size?

NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION AS BRADLEY SLIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of the political coverage of the past two weeks was
focusing on George W. Bush and John McCain battling it out in the
South Carolina Republican primary, Democratic front-runner Al Gore
was decisively outpunching rival Bill Bradley in the race for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been gaining so much ground that some analysts have
gone so far as to say, at this still-early stage, that the former
New Jersey senator has already ``self-destructed,'' even before the
coming New York and California primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, Bradley's star was rising faster and
shining brighter than Gore's, prompting media reports and various
polls to suggest that he could beat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he lost in New Hampshire, Bradley was still
considered a serious threat because Gore's victory was by only 4
points. In retrospect, it appears that 4-point margin was even more
significant than McCain's 19-point New Hampshire upset win over
Bush
</P>
<P>
   McCain's win gave him a big boost, and made it a closer race
than most analysts anticipated. It's still a race on the GOP side;
no one pretends to know who will win. But on the Democratic side,
Gore is increasingly viewed as the all-but-certain nominee.
</P>
<P>
   After New Hampshire, Bradley took a more mean-spirited approach,
disappointing some of his own supporters, who came to see him as
just another politician, rather than an outsider and a man of
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   This disappointment is reflected in the polls, which show Gore
increasingly ahead both nationally and in key states holding
primaries on March 7 and March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York, where he starred as a basketball player for
the New York Knicks, Bradley has run into problems, at least
according to Ed Koch, the former mayor. Koch says Bradley's
campaign has lost its ``intensity'' there. He noted that if Bradley
doesn't win the March 7 primary, ``he's finished.'' Koch did add,
``So I hope he wins New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Koch said Bradley can ``recoup'' his intensity, Gore
continues to pull ahead, winning endorsements from abortion rights
groups, gay rights groups, and labor groups. Gore is pulling so far
ahead that one writer described his intense campaigning as an
effort not to beat Bradley, but to ``bury'' him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has acknowledged that he has to win a number of states
in the early March primaries in order to keep his presidential bid
alive. But if California, where he is currently 40 points behind in
the polls, is any indication of how he is faring, that may not be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has been also hampered by the way McCain has
dominated the media spotlight and the public's attention for the
past few weeks. As McCain's campaign moved upward, Bradley's
continued to sink.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, more than a few pundits thought his effort would be
hurt more than helped by President Clinton and Hillary Rodhan
Clinton, who is running for the US senate from New York. But the
opposite appears to be true. Clinton gave Gore plaudits during his
State of the Union speech, and Gore has used Clinton's name to good
advantage during debates and campaign stops. Meanwhile, Gore and
Hillary Clinton teamed up last week in New York, and received
strong favorable reactions from their respective constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is very much on McCain's mind. McCain has said on more than
a few occasions that he would beat Gore ``like a drum,'' with no
mention of Bradley. Bush has also mentioned Clinton and Gore in
negative terms, but has not mentioned Bradley at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain appears to be attracting independent voters away
from Bradley more than from Gore, which may be another reason why
the gap is growing between the two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supporters could argue that the GOP contenders are
playing up Gore because they feel he would be an easier opponent to
beat in a general election. But recent polls show that, in a
head-to-head contest, Gore and Bush are almost dead even. It's
probable that the GOP contenders also read the polls and believe
that Gore, not Bradley, is going to be the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Koch said, Bradley has time to turn his campaign
around and re-create the momentum he had. But, unless Gore
stumbles, and stumbles badly, it's going to be very difficult for
Bradley to overtake him. Bradley knows that he must win New York to
stay in the race. Gore, however, could afford to lose it, as long
as he wins California, where he holds a solid lead.
</P>
<P>
   Barring big upheavals or surprises, all Gore has to do now is
show up at debates and shake hands on the campaign trail. But he
knows that in a presidential campaign, as in a basketball game, the
lead can change unexpectedly. That's why Gore is running not to
beat Bradley, but to bury him.

   CHINA-TAIWAN (Dateline to kum) _ China issued a new white paper
Monday reiterating its policy on Taiwan calling for peaceful
reunification under the ``One Country, Two Systems'' formula

also warned for the first time it would take ``all drastic measures
possible, including the use of force,'' if Taiwan repeatedly
rebuffed the peaceful overtures. China had previously only refused
to rule out using military muscle to bring the island back under

   RAIL-MERGER (Montreal) _ For much of the last century, the
Canadian National railroad helped define Canada. But now Canadian
National plans to merge with a giant American railroad, the
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe, and its focus has shifted to the
south. The merger underscores how far the formation of a true North
American economy has developed in the six years since the North
American Free Trade Agreement went into effect. Although they may
be less visible, the auto, banking, and telecommunications
industries already operate on a north-south axis and pay hardly any
attention to borders. Not everyone accepts the vision of the new
railroad or the changes it represents. In the United States,
shippers and unions want to derail the deal. In Canada, shippers
and farmers are concerned, while nationalists see the proposed
merger as the loss of a revered national symbol. By Anthony
DePalma.

   CELL-PHONE-CHARGES (Undated) _ A debate is raging within the
Federal Communications on whether to change the rules that allow

Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING-STRIKE (Undated) _ An update on the strike by 17,000
engineers and technical workers against Boeing. While many
analysts, and possibly the company, had expected the white-collar
workers, unaccustomed to walkout and lacking strike fund benefits,
to knuckle under, nearly 90 percent are staying out. What effect
has the strike had on production? By David J. Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-INTERNET (Hong Kong) _ Like America Online and Time
Warner in the United States, Pacific Century's bid for Hong Kong's
flagship telephone company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, dramatizes the
gravity-defying levels of Internet stocks in Asia. But the gambit
by Pacific Century, an Internet start-up, is in some ways even more
brazen than AOL's: the company has no operating profits, no
customers, and has not even launched the Internet and television
service that is supposed to be its core business. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   FOX-MULTIMILLIONAIRE (New York) _ Developments inside Fox
Television Entertainment, after the ``Multimillionaire'' debacle.
Fox canceled the rebroadcast of its highly rated special ``Who
Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' after learning that the groom,
Rick Rockwell, once was accused of hitting and threatening to kill
an ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   MCI-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ The European Commission, which
nearly derailed the merger of MCI and Worldcom two years ago, plans
to take a hard look at MCI Worldcom's planned acquisition of
Sprint. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-SUIT (Almaty, Kazakhstan) _ In court papers filed in
London Monday, the Wall Street hedge-fund manager, Leon Cooperman
joined another American investment fund in suing the Czech
investment promoter Viktor Kozeny. In the civil suit, Cooperman
alleged that Kozeny defrauded and enriched himself. The other
plaintiff is Marlwood Commercial Inc., a subsidiary of the American
International Group, a diversified insurance company.

   The many charms of Crested Butte
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Irwin, Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   CRESTED BUTTE, Colo. -- Crested Butte Mountain Resort is known
for its extreme skiing. Where else would you find a mountain big
enough to hold the U.S. Extreme Freeskiing Championships for the
past three years?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking a Wild West sort of place with 824 acres of
ungroomed, double-diamond, out-of-your-mind terrain. And, after a
five-year closure, the resort plans to reopen Teocalli Bowl,
another 274 heart-pounding acres of extreme, backcountry-style,
patrolled terrain for experts only.
</P>
<P>
   Crested Butte boasts that it has the largest number of
expert-only slopes served by a chairlift in the United States --
steep and deep double-diamond runs, just the way extreme skiers and
boarders like them.
</P>
<P>
   But Crested Butte showed a gentler side on a recent ski trip
here. Resort officials were apologetic about the lack of snow,
which prevented them from opening the expert trails, and I wondered
whether the trip would be worth it. But after three days of nonstop
skiing, I responded in a resounding affirmative. Maybe only half of
the mountain was open, but it was my half.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely had to wait in a lift line, even though 1,600 college
students were there for their holiday break. The vast mountain is
served by 14 lifts that have an uphill capacity of 17,440 skiers
per hour, so lines seldom get long. Try nonstop skiing for hours on
end and you'll never go back to the long lines at our local
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the beginning and intermediate trails were covered
by a couple feet of man-made snow. And every night, the mountain
received a fresh coating of powder.
</P>
<P>
   The ski resort has snowmaking on 300 acres served by 12 of the
14 chairlifts. All in all, this majestic, 12,162-foot mountain in
the heart of the Elk Mountains provided a great beginning for the
ski season.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain, located 230 miles southwest of Denver, has 60
percent of its terrain devoted to beginner and intermediate skiers,
40 percent to advanced and expert skiers.
</P>
<P>
   From the peak, the views in all directions were sensational.
Surprisingly, an intermediate skier can ride all the way up to the
summit and still ski down easily. These are real intermediate
slopes, not expert runs disguised as intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ski mountain itself, the town of Crested Butte has a
split personality. Three miles from the resort, the old mining town
is an extensive historic district. The false fronts of this Western
town date back to the 1880s, when silver was discovered in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the town has maintained an authentic Western flavor.
On the outside, the buildings look like a splintery, authentic
mining town, but on the inside you'll find all the modern
conveniences of any small American city.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the century-old Victorian fronts lie some excellent
restaurants. The large number of restaurants once prompted Michael
Carlton of Southern Living magazine to comment that Crested Butte
has more fine restaurants per capita than any other town in
America. While that may be the subject of some debate, it's
certainly true that Crest Butte has more fine restaurants than you
could visit during a week-long stay.
</P>
<P>
   If history interests you, stop at the historical museum for a
free audio tour of the town. While the 45-minute tape may be a
little long for a walk in cold temperatures, it certainly gives you
an better understanding of the town's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about renting a car -- convenient shuttle buses run
from the resort to downtown every 15 minutes throughout the day.
Just jump on the bus and in a few minutes you're downtown for
dinner or shopping.
</P>
<P>
   If you're tuckered out after a long day of skiing, as I was,
you'll still find several good restaurants and bars on the
mountain. The elegant Woodstone Grille in the Sheraton serves
excellent dinners, while Antlers in the Marriott is a good place
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   If nightlife is important to you, try Rafters, a huge nightclub
located literally in the rafters of the Gothic Building. There are
also several breweries downtown that are worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The March Madness package costs $353 per person, double
occupancy, and includes five nights lodging and a four-day lift
ticket. This package is offered through April 1, at which time
prices drop to $114 per person, double occupancy, for three nights
lodging.
</P>
<P>
   The prices are reasonable when you consider that an adult
three-day lift ticket costs $156 if purchased separately (daily
rate is $52). And Crested Butte is very family friendly. Children
12 years of age and under pay their age for a lift ticket (a
6-year-old pays $6, for example). A special teen-ager rate of $40
is offered for students 13 to 17 years of age. From April 2 through
16, lift tickets are free for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Crested Butte was a great choice for a quick winter
getaway. If I had such a good time with a little snow, I can only
imagine what it might be like now -- the resort received 3 feet of
new snow at the end of January. The resort receives an average of
300 inches annually.
</P>
<P>
   ----IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: United Airlines offers numerous flights from
Southern California to Denver, and United Express has five daily
commuter flights to Gunnison, 30 miles from the resort. Airport
shuttles provide convenient transfers to the resort. America West
flies to Montrose, 91 miles from the resort. Hotel shuttles serve
that airport, too.
</P>
<P>
   SKI STATS: Crested Butte offers 1,434 acres of skiing, with 85
trails. The longest run is 2.6 miles long, running from Crested
Butte Peak to the bottom of East River. Its base area is located at
9,100 feet, giving the resort a vertical drop of 2,775 feet. The
resort's 14 lifts include three high-speed detachable quad
chairlifts, three triple chairs, three double chairs and five
surface lifts.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: In addition to the resort's Marriott and Sheraton,
there are more than 50 other hotels, inns, bed-and-breakfasts and
condominiums from which to choose. These are available in a wide
price range -- from the luxurious Plaza Condominiums to the
economical Crested Butte International Hostel. For more
information, call Crested Butte Mountain Resort's central
reservations center at (800) 544-8448.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: For current weather conditions, snow reports,
special deals or to register for lessons, visit the resort's Web
site at www.crestedbutteresort.com. Or call (800) 867-6933 for the
snow report, (800) 444-9236 for the ski and snowboard school.

   Biggest little ski resort in Colorado
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Irwin, Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   IRWIN, Colo. -- Powder skiers shouldn't miss a trip to Irwin
Lodge, the largest snowcat skiing resort in North America. Located
12 miles from Crested Butte, this rustic lodge is surrounded by
2,200 skiable acres. But the resort allows only 44 skiers to enjoy
this pristine wilderness every day.
</P>
<P>
   Built 10,700 feet above sea level, Irwin Lodge receives an
average of 600 inches of snow every season. That's more than 50
feet of clean, white powder.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has dreamed of carving perfect curves through virgin
powder will enjoy this adventure. To experience the steep slopes,
bowls and chutes, however, the skier should possess intermediate
skills or above.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, large snowcats carry guests up through the crisp
mountain air to begin a day of white revelry. Good skiers can fly
down six to eight long runs on an average day.
</P>
<P>
   For safety reasons, avalanche beacons are provided. And a 6-to-1
ratio is maintained between skiers and guides, who have all
received emergency medical training.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1974 as a private retreat, Irwin Lodge was refurbished
three years ago. Though quite rustic, the lodge is still
comfortable. Best of all, there are no phones in the lodge, which
offers 21 rooms and a master suite.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to get to the lodge is via heated snowcat or a
Chevy suburban on snowtracks. Literally cut off from the rest of
the world, the lodge asks guests to turn off lights and shut the
windows whenever they leave their rooms because the lodge has to
generate its own electricity. In fact, there's a brief power
interruption at 10:30 every night when the lodge switches to a
smaller generator.
</P>
<P>
   Clocks are provided in the rooms, but they gain 15 minutes every
day because of power surges. So be sure to reset your clock before
you go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about being claustrophobic; the common room offers
8,000 square feet of open space. A huge field-stone fireplace
dominates the main room. Around the perimeter are bookcases, a pool
table, foosball and racks of board games. When was the last time
you played Monopoly or Risk with friends on a ski trip?
</P>
<P>
   A separate bar serves up libations, while the dining room
prepares excellent dinners. The chefs were out of their famous elk
stew during my visit, but the peppercorn steak was delicious.
</P>
<P>
   None of this comes cheap. A room for one night with a day of
skiing costs $375 single occupancy and $330 per person double
occupancy. A minimum stay of two nights is usually required --
three nights if your stay includes a Friday or Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   That's not too bad, however, when you consider that all meals
are included and the skiing alone, if purchased separately, would
cost $225 per person. Besides, where else can you ski powder that's
this deep?
</P>
<P>
   In April, the rates drop to $260 single occupancy and $230 per
person double occupancy, and there is no minimum-stay requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lack of snow, I chose to visit the lodge on a
dinner snowmobile tour. It was beautiful as we wound our way up
through the mountain forests in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   When we stopped along the trail and turned our lights off, a
million bright stars flickered in the cold winter night. The
black-velvet sky was spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Snowshoe and cross-country ski tours are also available if you
want to quieter adventure.
</P>

DOCTORS LEARN FROM STAGE'S `WIT'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A literary scholar learns that she has advanced ovarian cancer
from a doctor who is speaking a language the rest of us would call
``medicalese.'' The unfamiliar terminology doesn't shake the
patient. She has a Ph.D., and is a lover of words. She gets to
deconstruct and critique the language of her own diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, however, it shouldn't happen this way, say medical
experts. Message to doctor: When delivering this kind of news,
speak English, and choose your words and your tone carefully.
Message to patient: No matter how strong you think you are, don't
be alone when you receive this kind of news. Take a close friend or
a family member with you.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of Margaret Edson's ``Wit,'' a Pulitzer
Prize- winning play _ written by an elementary school teacher _
that contains multiple lessons for doctors and patients, students
and teachers. Theatergoers of all stripes have embraced the play
that is enjoying a nearly sold-out run through March 5 at the
Geffen Playhouse in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   The work has become a teaching tool as well as a forum for
discussion. The cast has read the play to medical students at the
Veterans Administration Hospital in West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The after-play discussions are called ``Talk-back Tuesdays,''
and people are indeed talking.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, one theatergoer asks about the ``stereotypical
doctors'' depicted in the play. A visiting psychologist, who plans
to use examples from ``Wit'' to teach first-year medical students,
asks whether the playhouse provides a psychologist for audience
members who are disturbed by the play's content. (The answer is no;
playgoers are on their own.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish every medical school and nursing school just happened
to have this playing across the street,'' said author David
Kessler, alluding to the walking-distance proximity between UCLA
Medical School and the Geffen Playhouse. ``It's a brilliant play,
and I think it brings out so many facets of the human experience.
It takes a subject that's hard to deal with and makes it watchable
and _ dare I say it? _ enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Enjoyable, certainly, but in a tough and uncompromising way.
``Wit'' examines how individuals face death, and the options they
are given when their doctors urge research over compassion. It's
about how a remarkable _ and frequently unsympathetic _ woman named
Vivian Bearing is able to hold up in a situation that would break
most people.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian's decision to undergo a rigorous cycle of chemotherapy at
a research hospital is a gamble. She is offered, at best, only a
glimmer of hope at survival. But she is a woman who passionately
understands the value of research, and for that reason alone, she
allows herself to become a human guinea pig.
</P>
<P>
   Which is pretty much how her doctors treat her. There is a
largely indifferent physician, Dr. Harvey Kelekian, and Kelekian's
unfeeling medical fellow, Jason Posner, a data-obsessed bumbler
whose idea of bedside manner is to ask a vomiting patient, ``How
are you feeling.'' The play's most sympathetic character is a
nurse, Susie Monahan, the only person who seems to know how to
treat a suffering patient like a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Are the doctors' characterizations extreme? In some respects,
said medical experts who have seen, read or taught ``Wit,'' but the
characters are presented this way to make a dramatic point about
the person Vivian is, and about the leveling effects of a disease
like cancer. And, as many medical experts note, a teaching hospital
isn't the place patients go if they're looking for a lot of warmth
and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Medical schools are just beginning to stress the importance of
bedside manner techniques, of ``treating the patient, not just the
disease.'' But helping a patient face death is still a barrier many
doctors, despite their skill, are unable to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there are reasons why Vivian Bearing's doctors
never quite get it, said Ronnie Kaye, a psychotherapist and breast
cancer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, doctors, nurses and medical students don't
understand end-of-life issues. They don't have a place for it in
their scheme of things, so they do some unfeeling and unsympathetic
things,'' said Kaye, who teaches a course in ``doctoring'' at UCLA
Medical School. ``It's too bad that people see the end of life as
unacceptable. It isn't unacceptable. It just is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is geared toward healing,'' agreed Karen Stanley, a
nursing consultant on end-of-life care and another participant in
the upcoming symposium. ``It doesn't prepare the practitioner for
an encounter with someone who is expected to or just about to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley took a group of 72 people to see ``Wit'' as part of her
effort to help educate the public about end-of-life issues. If they
take nothing else away from the experience, Stanley said, people
who see the play _ those who are sick and those who are healthy _
often emerge from the Geffen determined not to let a Vivian
Bearing-like situation ever happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a scene out of an ``ER'' episode, but the
discussion over whether to sustain life is one that every seriously
ill patient and family member should have, said Stanley, and one
that doctors can neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley also believes that anyone considering experimental
treatment should have an extensive discussion with his or her
doctor. Only after the physician lays out the benefits and burdens
of treatment should a person decide whether it's worth trying a
high-risk/no-guarantees treatment that may involve misery-inducing
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe all patients are willing to answer that
question,'' Stanley said. ``And patients like Vivian Bearing are in
a catch-22 position because this is all they have. They're far more
willing to be accepting of what's recommended because the
alternative is death.'' &QL;

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPETING-SPERM (Undated) _ rimatologists have developed
some surprising ideas about the nature of the human mating system,
suggesting that women may not be as faithful as their mates may
suppose. And some biologists think that the deceits of the mating
game may even be reflected in the hapless spermatozoon. People's
two closest evolutionary cousins, gorillas and chimpanzees, have
evolved two very different patterns of sexual behavior and social
organizations. Gorillas practice ``female defense polygyny,'' with
one male guarding a harem of female, whereas chimpanzees band
together in multi-male, multi-female groups. By Nicholas Wade.
(2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-QUANTUM-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Some physicists believe they are
coming closer to an answer to a mystery of quantum mechanics,
explaining it through a phenomenon called decoherence, in which the
very particles that make up the universe constantly ``observe'' one
another, breaking down the delicate quantum juxtapositions and
yielding the familiar world of solid objects. In recent weeks this
theoretical notion received what may be its strongest support yet.
Experimenters at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
in Boulder, Colo., observed decoherence in action. They put a
single atom in two places at once and measured the breakdown of
this quantum state more methodically than ever before. By George
Johnson. (1950 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-LOGEVITY (Undated) _ A gene known to govern the rate of
aging in yeast cells has been found to be active in mice, yielding
a new insight into why mice and people age and into possible ways
of enhancing life span. By Nicholas Wade. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HABITAT-EDGE (Undated) _ A study of the burrowing beetle has
led researchers to conclude that one of the basic tenets of modern
conservation theory _ that a wild species would persist most
abundantly and robustly in the center of its geographical range _
might be misguided, to the possible detriment of many endangered
species. By William K. Stevens. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MUSIC-PATTERNS (Undated) _ A neuroscientist and concert
pianist has discovered what he says are clues as to how exactly the
masters would have wanted their pieces performed. He has identified
patterns, or pulses, that show how a composer favors louder and
longer notes at consistent points in a musical phrase, or series of
notes, much the same way poets resort to consistent patterns of
phrasing or painters favor certain brush strokes. He also argues
that similar patterns also exist on higher levels in musical
compositions, such as how composers stress certain bars within a
movement. By James Glanz. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on how
the Moon got its tilt, nitrogen runoff and plans to view more
comets. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-RACE (Undated) _ The racial mortality gap for breast
cancer is widening. A National Cancer Institute study reported in
November that a black woman's risk of dying from breast cancer,
which was slightly lower than a white woman's in 1980, was 16
percent greater in 1990. By 1995, that gap had jumped to 29
percent. Some people say it's habits and environment; others wonder
if there are underlying genetic reasons. By Alexis Jetter. (2025
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PATIENT-PROGNOSIS (Undated) _ Cases column. No matter what
the chronic disease, doctors and their patients are bombarded by
breaking news these days: new studies, new machines, new enzymes,
new organs, new genes, and new drugs upon drugs, all with new side
effects. And to many patients' chagrin, only a sorcerer could feel
comfortable measuring out most patients' life spans. But the
science of predicting marches on anyway, for better or worse. By
Abigail Zuger.(1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-POPULAR-STUDENTS (Undated) _ Researchers studying the
qualities and dynamics of popular students have found that
especially among boys, a significant minority is abusive and overly
aggressive. By Susan Gilbert. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: Sore throat is a
symptom, not a disease. But according to the findings of a recent
nationwide survey of 1,000 adults, slightly more than half of
Americans do nothing to relieve a sore throat unless it becomes so
severe that they can't swallow. The American Academy of
Otolaryngology warns people to seek medical attention when a sore
throat is severe or persists longer than the five to seven days
that is the usual duration of a cold or flu and is not caused by an
avoidable allergen or irritant. By Jane E. Brody. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
nutrition:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists in Italy have found new support for the hypothesis
that the increased incidence of allergies and infectious disease
may be the price of living in a cleaner world, where people are
exposed to fewer infections in childhood. (170 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A study involving California paramedics has found that placing
a breathing tube in the throats of unconscious children saved no
more lives than the less risky method of squeezing oxygen into
their lungs through a mask and hand pump. (325 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A sleepy brain is never as sharp as a rested brain, but the
fuzziness can vary with the task at hand, according to a new study
that found signs of a mechanism that can sometimes limit the impact
of fatigue. (350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study in Australia shows that pre-workout stretching did
not significantly reduce the number of injuries. 190
w/illustration.
</P>
<P>
   _ A nasal spray form of a flu vaccine for children was effective
in a two-year test, even against an unexpected form of the virus, a
study in this month's issue of the Journal of Pediatrics reports.

DEADLY ACCIDENT REVEALS HIDDEN LIFE OF IRISH TRAVELLERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MELODY MCDONALD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Five young cousins killed last month in a
horrific accident on Interstate 30 died as they lived: close
together, of necessity as much as fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   The accident shocked the public, but questions arose when
authorities learned that none of the boys were older than 14 and
four of them were carrying false driver's licenses that
misrepresented their age.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to gather details about the youths have led to a
fragmented mosaic of the culture from which they came: All were
children of Irish Travellers _ secretive descendants of 19th
century nomads who speak an archaic dialect, marry within the clan
and specialize in home improvement and business repair work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with a closed society,'' said Joe Livingston, a
South Carolina-based national expert on Irish Travellers. ``You can
infiltrate the Mafia, but you can't infiltrate this group. Unless
you're family, they won't talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the accident, the media coverage and public
attention tormented the group of Travellers who were wintering at
campgrounds in the Fort Worth suburb of White Settlement where the
victims had been staying. The parents were infuriated. ``It is our
grief,'' screamed Ed McDonald, father of the youngest victim,
12-year-old Martin. ``The truth is, five kids are dead. Let's leave
it at that. If you are part of my family, you can know about them.
If not, you don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Many North Texans expressed sympathy and sought to contribute
money to a memorial fund. The Travellers would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Irish Traveller culture is limited as much by
lack of knowledge of the culture as by the reluctance of Travellers
to discuss their way of life with outsiders, whom they refer to as
``country men.'' Authorities estimate that only 30,000 Travellers,
of Irish, Scottish and English descent, live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Travellers react angrily to high-profile attention, Livingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the dead cousins declined repeated requests to talk
about either the Travellers' culture or the victims who were killed
when their westbound pickup truck veered out of control, flipped
over the I-30 median and crashed upside down on top of an eastbound
pickup. Shortly after the accident, some Traveller families
withdrew their children from school. Victims' families met with
investigators only once.
</P>
<P>
   The Travellers' detachment is centuries-old and focused on
preserving their culture.
</P>
<P>
   They regulate their own affairs, rarely attend school past the
sixth grade, and display a near compulsion for material goods.
Their hallmarks are wads of $100 bills, expensive cars and elegant
clothes. In Ireland and the United States, Travellers have had
reputations as accomplished con artists.
</P>

   They are descendants of an Irish group that came to America in
the mid-1800s to escape persecution and the potato famine. They
roamed the country by horse and wagon in search of various jobs.
Today, they roll through life in shiny new trucks and
travel-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life that only Travellers understand, one scholar
insists.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Hancock, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin
who wrote the Irish Travellers entry for the Encyclopedia of the
South, questions the existence of credible outsider sources on
Irish Travellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to law enforcement officers, the only people they
know are people they have had contact with,'' said Hancock, who
also serves as the ambassador to the United Nations for his fellow
Romani, or Gypsies. ``If you talk to academics, they have spent
little time with them. There is a danger. I would say the bottom
line is that the people that can tell you the most don't want to.''
</P>

   Most Irish Travellers roam the country, soliciting work and
wintering in such places as Murphy Village, S.C., and White
Settlement. Those in this area _ the Carrolls, Gormans, McDonalds,
Daleys and Jennings _ are known as the Greenhorn Irish Travellers
and generally work west of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders and residents said Travellers often frequent
Carswell Golf Course and Neiman Marcus and attend St. Patrick's
Cathedral, where the cousins' funerals were held.
</P>
<P>
   They drive new trucks laden with the tools and materials of
their trade, such as paint, water sprayers, and roof and sidewalk
sealants. They unhitch their travel-trailers at a handful of
campgrounds throughout the area and settle for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   During winter, the men solicit construction, roofing and paving
work, while the women travel in large groups to shopping malls,
beauty shops and tanning salons, paying cash for goods and
services.

<P>
   Robert Gilmore said the Travellers have been frequenting the
north side bar where he works for about six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a bunch of girls and a bunch of guys that come in
and they all say they're cousins,'' Gilmore said. ``When the girls
come into the bar, they don't drink; the men drink. They won't let
anybody associate with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids come in with gobs of money. They spend $100 bills
like it's nothing. I have no idea where all this money comes
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children attend area schools, though few seek higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Hope, principal of North Elementary in White Settlement,
said that many Travellers have attended her school but only for a
short time.
</P>
<P>
   ``None go to school year-round and none have ever been here the
entire year,'' Hope said. ``They come around Thanksgiving and leave
around Easter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope said that the boys in the accident did not attend North
Elementary but that some of their relatives withdrew from classes
shortly after the wreck. Some, she said, are still enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Members of one outsider family had befriended the accident
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Martinez, 10, and her mother, Genoveva Martinez, live
across the road from the mobile home park where many Traveller
families stay when they are in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinezes recognized the cousins who died in the accident
by their pictures on the cover of their funeral program.
</P>
<P>
   The boys hadn't volunteered much information about their lives.
``They would come over and jump on our trampoline every day for
about three months,'' Dolores Martinez said. ``They said they went
to home school. They said their dads traveled around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that Traveller children go to work at a young
age, often obtaining false identifications so they can drive and
work.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Travellers, especially the women, are pious Roman
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tim Thompson of St. Peter's Catholic Church in White
Settlement said that many Traveller women and children have
attended daily Mass during the winter months for at least four
years. They also attend on Sundays, he said, while most of the men
wait outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church seats 600 and we get an extra 200 in the winter and
then they leave,'' he said. ``It's overwhelming, but they have a
right to go to church, receive sacraments and practice their
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he first came into contact with the Travellers several
years ago when he was asked to give last rites to a dying woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a trailer park, and a lady directed me back,'' he
said. ``Her daughter and granddaughter were there. They were
responding to my prayers and responded in an Irish accent. Later, I
asked where they were from, and they said they have lived here all
their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the women are always beautifully dressed at
church. Other community members have also noted their seemingly
extravagant lifestyle _ new cars and trucks, large amounts of cash,
expensive jewelry and furs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to respect them, allow them to practice their faith and
let God be their judge,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Some Travellers are well-trained con artists, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, most of the ones we come in contact with are
scam artists,'' said Detective S.M. Haines of the Dallas Police
Department swindle section. ``Those are the ones we hear about.
I've made friends with them, whereas most officers only hear bad
things about their culture. If you never meet any Travellers except
crooks there is only one opinion you can have about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Haines said that jurors in Dallas County have convicted a few
English Travellers involved in home-improvement scams. But none of
the prosecutions involve Irish Travellers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that a common scam is spray-painting barns and
houses with paint diluted with water or gasoline. The finished job
lasts a couple of months before the paint blisters. By that time,
the workers are gone.
</P>
<P>
   The swindlers are rarely caught, Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and rob a bank and get $1,500, there are 50 FBI
agents chasing you,'' said Livingston, who has assisted in a couple
dozen arrests of Travellers. ``But if you work an elderly lady and
take her for $250,000 in a two-year period, who is going to
investigate you? Some local deputy who has no idea what a Traveller
is?''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution is even rarer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Travellers try to negotiate their restitution and
release,'' Livingston said. ``They'll offer to give the victim
their money back. The prosecutor says, `Great.' Police are happy
because they don't have to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Miller, a Tarrant County district attorney for 12 years,
said he can't recall a single prosecution of an Irish Traveller in
Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, juries have convicted Travellers for
scamming people, usually the elderly. But no law enforcement
agencies could say how many cases have been filed against them.
</P>
<P>
   Detective John McMahon, an agent with the Orange County, Fla.,
Sheriff's Department's special investigation division, studies
Irish Travellers across the nation, especially in south Florida. He
said that Travellers involved in con games are masters of
``confusion and illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   They are transients, never stay in one place very long, use
several addresses, and often carry false identifications, he said.
Because they share a limited number of surnames, dozens of
Travellers have variations of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid confusion within the group, Travellers often call each
other by nicknames. On the funeral program, for example, James
Thomas McDonald was also listed as ``Jim MC.'' John Peter McDonald
was called ``Johnny Boy.''

</P>
<P>
   The Travellers have their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Thompson Sr., of Gene Thompson and Associates, a real
estate investment company, said the Travellers have been staying at
his White Settlement campgrounds for about 10 years, always
arriving when the mercury drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 95 to 98 percent of those we have done business with
have been positive,'' Thompson said. ``I keep reading that they go
out and con people. But I know some people they have worked for
that are satisfied. They're not all crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that three Travellers with the last name McDonald
recently bought the RV campgrounds at 7409 Raymond St. and 410 N.
Cherry Lane, which contain a total of 90 spaces for recreational
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started dealing with them, we were scared to
death,'' Thompson said. ``They don't live like we live. The things
that are strange to us are the intermarrying. They're all related
somehow. There are more Marys and Johns and Jims. But after we got
to know them, we didn't worry about them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are good for the community. They come in and spend a lot
of money _ the clothes they buy, the cars they buy, the food they
eat. I would welcome them any time in my community if I was a
community leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the Travellers who stay in White Settlement also
spend time in Albany, a town of about 2,000 located 110 miles west
of Fort Worth. Each year, he said, the Travellers stay at motels he
owns there and work around the town.
</P>
<P>
   Nariman Esfandiary, owner of Fort Griffin General Merchandise
Restaurant and Beehive Saloon in Albany, said that Travellers with
the last name McDonald have been doing work for him for about six
years and are ``nothing but good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know their first names, but it is always the same
family _ a father, two brothers or maybe a cousin or nephew,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Esfandiary said they laid an asphalt parking lot at his
restaurant six or seven years ago, and they return each year to
reseal it as part of their regular maintenance. He said they have
worked for several people in town and that their prices are
reasonable, although he usually trades food and drink for their
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small town,'' he said. ``If they scammed anyone,
they would be ruined because everyone talks. ... They stay in the
motel, fill up their truck in town, go to the grocery store. They
spend a lot of money while they are here.''

   The Sunday afternoon wreck, just west of the Loop 820
interchange and the Alemeda Street exit, closed the eastbound lanes
of I-30 for several hours while rescue teams worked to free the
victims. Even the most hardened emergency workers were deeply
moved, some to tears, as they removed the bodies of the five boys
from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Police have closed their investigation of the crash, which
killed Edward James Jennings, 14; Harry Gerard Gorman, 13; James
Thomas McDonald, 13; John Peter McDonald, 13; and Martin James
McDonald, 12. Questions of why Jennings was behind the wheel and
why the four oldest boys carried false driver's licenses may never
be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Molinar of Plano, the driver of the other truck involved
in the accident, was released from Harris Methodist Fort Worth on
Jan. 6. He has declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the cousins were questioned after a funeral
program revealed that they were 14 and younger. Officials found
out-of-state driver's licenses on four boys, listing their ages
from 16 to 20 _ information that family members never disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The only official statement released by the Irish Travellers
came from Richard Waters, who authorities believe is a 62-year-old
Irish Traveller in New York State. Waters posted the following
statement on his Web site, Travellers' Rest:
</P>
<P>
   ``Five young Irish Traveller boys were killed in a truck
collision on Sunday afternoon, on the second day of a new year that
they will never enjoy, a new century that they can never know. A
country man named Ruben Molinar Sr. was seriously hurt in the crash
and was brought to Harris Methodist Fort Worth hospital. There are
lessons to be learned belatedly from this terrible accident and
while I offer prayers to God for their souls and Mr. Molinar's full
recovery I will also pray that we heed those lessons. Will you join
me in that?''

   SCI-COMPETING-SPERM (Undated) _ rimatologists have developed
some surprising ideas about the nature of the human mating system,
suggesting that women may not be as faithful as their mates may
suppose. And some biologists think that the deceits of the mating
game may even be reflected in the hapless spermatozoon. People's
two closest evolutionary cousins, gorillas and chimpanzees, have
evolved two very different patterns of sexual behavior and social
organizations. Gorillas practice ``female defense polygyny,'' with
one male guarding a harem of female, whereas chimpanzees band
together in multi-male, multi-female groups. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-QUANTUM-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Some physicists believe they are
coming closer to an answer to a mystery of quantum mechanics,
explaining it through a phenomenon called decoherence, in which the
very particles that make up the universe constantly ``observe'' one
another, breaking down the delicate quantum juxtapositions and
yielding the familiar world of solid objects. In recent weeks this
theoretical notion received what may be its strongest support yet.
Experimenters at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
in Boulder, Colo., observed decoherence in action. They put a

this quantum state more methodically than ever before. By George

longer notes at consistent points in a musical phrase, or series of
notes, much the same way poets resort to consistent patterns of
phrasing or painters favor certain brush strokes. He also argues
that similar patterns also exist on higher levels in musical

CLIFTON DANIEL, FORMER MANAGING EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES, DIES
AT 87 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds, sub brackets for double parens.) 
(gm) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clifton Daniel, the courtly North Carolinian who
served as managing editor of The New York Times from 1964 to 1969
after a career as a correspondent in wartime London, war-torn
Europe and the Middle East, died Monday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a stroke and heart disease, said
his wife, Margaret Truman Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's long, adventuresome and many-sided professional life
was once summed up in a magazine profile with the headline ``Up
From Zebulon.'' Zebulon was the tiny lumber mill town near Raleigh,
N.C. where he was born and reared and where his parents saved the
income from the family drugstore to put him through college in the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   A small-town Southern background was something that Daniel
shared with his predecessor as managing editor, Turner Catledge,
who was from Philadelphia, Miss. And when Daniel was married in
1956, after many footloose years in Europe and the Middle East, it
was to a down-to-earth young woman whose father, like Daniel's, had
worked as a shopkeeper far away from Times Square. The bride was
Margaret Truman, the only child of former President Truman, who had
run a haberdashery in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel rose to be assistant to the managing editor, assistant
managing editor and then managing editor. In that post he was the
senior news executive of the daily Times, outranked only by
Catledge, the executive editor, who oversaw daily and Sunday
departments from a vantage outside the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   As managing editor, Daniel sought to brighten the newspaper with
pungent writing, eye-catching photography and an emphasis on what
many newspaper editors of the time disparaged as ``soft news.''
Daniel intensified the newspaper's treatment of society news, arts
coverage and obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   Society news, which had been mainly dry wedding and engagement
announcements, began to burst with spicy detail, human interest and
social insights. Cultural coverage studied the flaws as well as the
fame of important artists. Obituaries became less reverent.
</P>
<P>
   Elbert Clifton Daniel Jr. was born on Sept. 19, 1912, the son of
Elbert Clifton Daniel and Elvah Jones Daniel and a great-grandson
of Zachariah G. Daniel, an illiterate farmer who came to the United
States from England.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Zebulon had a population of 500. As a teen-ager,
young E.C., as he was known, worked part time for his father, an
enterprising druggist who was mayor of Zebulon, the first person in
town to own a telephone, and later the head of the North Carolina
Pharmaceutical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, in a speech at the University of North Carolina,
Daniel gave this account of how he first became a reporter: ``I
read one of those articles in a boys' magazine on `Choosing a
Career.' It said that if you wanted to be a newspaperman, if you
wanted to write, the best thing to do was to start writing. It
didn't say anything about going to journalism school. It just said,
`Send in something to the local paper.' So I did. As I remember, it
was an account of a basketball game. It got printed. Having one
item published was enough to convince me that I was God's gift to
journalism. I was pretty soon writing all the local news in The
Record during summer vacations from school.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Wakelon High School in Zebulon, Daniel
entered the University of North Carolina. He became editor of the
campus literary magazine and vice president of the student body,
and received his B.A. degree in 1933. Then he put in a year as
associate editor of The Dunn (N.C.) Daily Bulletin before spending
four years as a reporter, political writer and columnist for The
News and Observer in Raleigh, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, after trying unsuccessfully to be hired by The Times,
Daniel went to work for The Associated Press in New York. One of
his friends in the city was the writer Thomas Wolfe, a fellow North
Carolinian, whose turbulent second novel, ``Of Time and the
River,'' had come out in 1935. The two men would sometimes meet for
a late supper in the theater district, then stroll the streets for
hours, talking about literature and life.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel spent seven years as a reporter and editor with The AP
and was transferred from New York to Washington, and then to Bern
and London.
</P>
<P>
   After his assignments overseas, Daniel returned to New York and
began the editing apprenticeship that led to the managing editor's
chair. He had occupied it for four years when a climactic event
occurred in The Times' newsroom management, one that ultimately
chilled his relationship with the publisher, Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger. Daniel and the two other highest-ranking editors,
Catledge and A.M. Rosenthal, had become dissatisfied with the
leadership of the newspaper's Washington bureau, staffed by
award-winning proteges of James Reston, the columnist and former
bureau chief. The three New York editors decided that they wanted
James L. Greenfield, an editor recently hired in the home office,
to replace Tom Wicker as the bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield had previous experience in Washington, as a
correspondent and a government official. Sulzberger endorsed his
appointment, but it was strongly opposed by Wicker, by members of
the bureau and above all by Reston. They appealed, and Sulzberger
changed his mind, keeping Wicker as bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel complained to Sulzberger so angrily about the change of
plan that the publisher was offended. Late in 1968, Wicker stepped
aside to write his column full time. He was succeeded by Max
Frankel, a bureau member who went on to become executive editor of
The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield, meanwhile, quit the paper. But he was rehired in
1969 as foreign editor and rose to be an assistant managing editor.
Daniel, though, never regained his standing with the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   After yielding the managing editor's post in 1969, Daniel worked
in television as well as radio. His assignments included
supervising The Times News Service, the direction of special
projects and the continuation of his service as moderator of a
twice-monthly program called ``News in Perspective'' produced by
National Educational Television in association with The Times.
Daniel also presided over two radio programs, ``Insight'' and ``One
Man's Opinion,'' for WQXR.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the news staff as head of the Washington bureau, he
wrote analytical articles and oversaw the coverage of President
Richard M. Nixon's resignation and the outset of Gerald R. Ford's
presidency. He concentrated much of his effort on developing a
staff for investigative reporting.
</P>
<P>
   He also watched his wife's literary career with pride. Margaret
Truman Daniel wrote or edited a score of books under the Truman
name. After her first mystery novel, ``Murder in the White House,''
became a best seller in 1980, she said in an interview, ``My
husband tells me to stick to what I know.'' Her later books have
included ``Murder on Capitol Hill'' and ``Murder in the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Their son Clifton Truman Daniel asserted in his memoir: ``My
mother seems to have a strong opinion, often bad, of almost
everyone in Washington. That's why she writes those murder
mysteries; so she can kill them all off, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daniels had four sons _ Clifton Truman, William Wallace,
Harrison Gates and Thomas Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and sons, he is survived by five
grandchildren.

CUTE CUSTOM TOWN FOR SALE, QUIET WEST TEXAS LOCATION
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lajitas, an Old West resort, pop. 160, is going to the highest
bidder this week.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m. Thursday, an entire community will go be auctioned to
the strains of mariachi guitars.
</P>
<P>
   On the block is Lajitas, a resort town with 160 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Wedged between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State
Park, Lajitas comes complete with a golf course, a hotel, three
motels, a 14-bed bunk house, condominiums, church, saloon, bakery,
trading-post-turned-grocery, sewage plant, an 80-spot RV park,
restaurants, six subdivisions, a 4,800-foot-long airstrip and
heart-achingly scenic vistas on 24,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the beer-guzzling goat named Clay Henry III, which
was elected ``mayor'' in November, and the town's full-gallop
footnote in history. Gen. John Pershing used Lajitas as a jumping
off point in his pre-World War I cavalry pursuit of Mexican
revolutionary Francisco ``Pancho'' Villa.
</P>
<P>
   During the years, the area has served as a backdrop to such
movies and TV programs as ``Barbarosa,'' ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Streets
of Laredo,'' as well as for Marlboro and Chevy Suburban
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me Ted Turner was interested,'' said Linda
Garcia, a native of upper Michigan who moved to the area in 1972,
joining an eclectic mix of urban dropouts, musicians, craftsmen,
river-rafting enthusiasts and desert fanciers in the
Lajitas-Terlingua-Study Butte area. ``One thing about living in a
small town, there's lots of rumors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston developer Walter M. Mischer, 77, bought a jumble of
rundown buildings that was Lajitas 23 years ago. He built himself a
five-bedroom, Santa Fe-style villa and invested millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves this country, but it's a good time to sell,'' said a
grandson, Randy Corson, 31, who served several years as the
resort's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneer William Bone, who specializes in trophy properties,
said there's been surprisingly scant interest so far from hotel
chains and business magnates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you that Ross Perot has been out there,
but he hasn't,'' Bone said in a call from his base in Gadsden, Ala.
``I wish I could tell you that the Bass brothers have been out
there, but they haven't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bone predicts a well-heeled Texan will fly in at
the last minute and buy himself (or herself) a town.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, you've got 2 1/2 miles on the Rio Grande. You've got
some of the best hunting anywhere,'' he said, not at all trying to
contain his professional enthusiasm. ``And it all pays for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The auctioneer wouldn't disclose any financial records but said
that the Brewster County tax district appraised the 2,650-acre
resort at $3.7 million and the adjoining 21,350 acres at about $1.5
million. And, it produces ``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' in
annual profits
</P>
<P>
   Bone said the auction was expected to fetch bids in the
neighborhood of $5 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't pay that,'' said Bill Ivey, 44, owner of the nearby
Terlingua ghost town. Ivey grew up in Lajitas, which his father Rex
owned from 1949 to 1977. The town had a population of nine,
including four in his family back then. It processed candelilla wax
for cosmetics, crayons and chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   Mischer then acquired the land and transformed it into a resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's put more than $5 million into it,'' Ivey said.
``But you've got to take into consideration the age of the
improvements, the condition they're in and the cost of repair. Some
of the past management didn't always keep things up well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with the right plan, someone could pay that much and come
out way ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the auction, Ivey said: ``There's been a lot of concern
that some conglomerate could buy it and Lajitas would become just
another resort. Mr. Mischer has had a very personal interest in
Lajitas the entire time he's had it. So it's difficult for some of
us because it's the last stronghold of the last frontier in the
United States. And that might be gone now.''

   NYT REGIONAL NEWSPAPERS
</P>
<P>
   The nation was preoccupied last week with multimillionaire Rick
Rockwell's televised quest to find a bride _ um, is it just me, or
does anyone else think we ought to be leery of encouraging a real
estate developer/motivational consultant to reproduce? _ so I
decided to keep an eye on the news for everybody in case anything
important happened.
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy to report that only two things of genuine consequence
occurred. First, a fellow in Germany found the cure for the common
cold. And, second, as the result of another amazing scientific
discovery, Lassie's pal, Timmy, is about to fall down a well again
and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   First, the medical news: Alexander Loschke of Sulzbach, Germany,
has found a sniffles cure. According to the Reuters news agency, he
stumbled upon it while gardening.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the neighbors' tomato plants were rotting, but his
weren't. Alexander zeroed in on one major difference in his
approach _ the little copper rings he uses to attach his tomato
plants to their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Alexander then asked himself the obvious next
question, namely: ``Gee, I wonder what would happen if I stuck
these things up my nose?'' And that he did, despite the fact that
he had a cold. Miraculously, his sniffles disappeared in just 36
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alexander is selling packs of copper rings for 20 marks,
or about $10.03, each. I suspect he's well on his way to becoming a
multimillionaire and, perhaps, hobnobbing with the Rockwells.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the update on Lassie and Timmy: The Washington Post reports
that scientists at Texas A&AMP;M University are progressing nicely in
their efforts to clone a dog.
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, an anonymous pair of millionaires put up a
$2.3 million prize a few years ago for a little game of ``Who Wants
to Clone Our Dog?'' Scientists found the money motivating and are
trying to create a double of the couple's mutt, Missy.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Westhusin, a veterinary physiologist at Texas A&AMP;M, told The
Post his team is ``90 percent there'' in reaching its goal. The
carbon-copy pooch could be produced as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Post reports, at least four companies are now
collecting down payments from people who want their pets cloned.
One firm, the Texas-based Genetic Savings and Clone, is charging
$1,000 to retrieve DNA samples from pets and store them for the day
when pet cloning becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Woof. Isn't that rich?
</P>
<P>
   You know, I can stomach TV producers starting up an assembly
line for mail-order brides. I can even tolerate a fellow trying to
sell me pieces of wire to push up my schnoz. But _ really, now _
are we willing to be led around by our nose rings on this
pet-cloning thing?
</P>
<P>
   Every day, all across the country, thousands upon thousands of
dogs and cats are put to gruesome deaths in animal shelters because
no one adopts them. So what do we do? Rather than throw these
critters a lifeline, we look for a way to crank out more Bowsers
and Tabbies _ all because we can't be troubled by our pets growing
old and dying like every other being on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these Bowsers and Tabbies won't be the same as the
originals. They'll just look the same.
</P>
<P>
   Let's examine this in terms of Lassie.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that Timmy's parents notice one day that Lassie is
losing a step or two chasing sticks in the back yard, and they
decide it's time to drive down to the Genetic Savings and Clone to
brew up a new Lassie for their little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that, when they get to the clinic, they find out it's
running a special and, in a burst of generosity, they decide to buy
the tyke six Lassies. So they load the Lassies into the pickup,
drive back to the ranch and surprise the Timster with six
mirror-image pooches.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what they'll have to do next? They'll have to throw
Timmy down the well, pin him under a rock, toss him into a forest
fire and re-create all of those other misadventures six separate
times so that each and every Lassie will have the same set of
experiences as the vintage Lassie.
</P>
<P>
   And what do you figure the old Lassie will do when she realizes
she's just one more special dog in a long, long line of special
dogs? Probably crawl under the porch in a deep, whimpering funk.
Hell, I might join her.

DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOVE: MADONNA SETTLES FOR `THE NEXT BEST
THING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Madonna with Rupert Everett in a scene
from ``The Next Best Thing.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Is there any role Madonna hasn't played?
 &HT;    Virgin and boy toy, sinner and saint. Sex symbol and
trend-setter, icon and pariah. Singer and actress, material girl
and maternal woman.
 &HT;    Madonna has done it all, surprising people again and again since
she arrived on the scene nearly 18 years ago.
 &HT;    ``It's not that my career has been based on surprising people,''
Madonna insists. ``My creative instincts have been to challenge
myself and to constantly do things that are going to broaden my own
mind and, in the process, hopefully the minds of other people.
 &HT;    ``First,'' she says, ``it has to interest me: `OK, is this going
to take me to another place? Am I going to learn something from
this? Is this going to inspire me?' That's where I always start,
whatever it is, whether it's music or film or whatever.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully, the manifestation of that is work that has some
effect on the audience.''
 &HT;    She's unquestionably connected with millions of fans through her
recordings and her vibrant, dance-driven live performances. But
she's had less luck on the big screen.
 &HT;    After stealing the show with a supporting role in ``Desperately
Seeking Susan'' (1985), Madonna elicited groans in ``Shanghai
Surprise'' (1986), ``Who's That Girl?'' (1987), ``Body of
Evidence'' (1993) and ``Four Rooms'' (1995). Not all her films
flopped _ she had effective bit parts in ``Dick Tracy'' (1990) and
``A League of Their Own'' (1992) _ but it wasn't until ``Evita''
(1996), in which she played the doomed Eva Peron, that Madonna won
genuine respect as an actress.
 &HT;    She insists, however, that she didn't need ``Evita'' to give her
confidence in her acting ability.
 &HT;    ``I needed some good roles and time with a really good acting
teacher,'' she says during a conversation at Manhattan's Rihga
Royal Hotel. ``I don't think it was necessarily `Evita.'''
 &HT;    At 41, dressed in black slacks and a shimmering blue-and-black
blouse, she remains every inch the star, at once smart, blunt and
playful. But, despite her celebrity and her musical prowess, movie
stardom has proven elusive: All eyes seem to be on her when she
acts, and it's almost as if people are hoping she fails, with her
box-office duds eliciting smug headlines and nasty gossip.
 &HT;    Madonna admits that she's had bad luck with the critics.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't say it's a question of them paying more attention,
but I do think they're much more judgmental,'' she says. ``That
goes for anybody who has been really successful in one area and
then wants to go off into another area and take it very seriously.
 &HT;    ``How on top of Michael Jordan was everybody when he decided he
wanted to play baseball?'' she says. ``It's kind of that same
thing.''
 &HT;    Madonna hopes that ``The Next Best Thing,'' opening March 3,
will be the hit she's been waiting for. Her first film in four
years, it's a romantic comedy with a serious edge, starring Madonna
and Rupert Everett as Abbie and Robert, best friends who wind up
fooling around and having a child together.
 &HT;    It's not a terribly uncommon scenario, except that Robert is
gay. The two happily raise their son, Sam (Malcolm Stumpf), but the
bliss ends a few years later, when Abbie falls in love with the
understanding, handsome Ben (Benjamin Bratt).
 &HT;    ``My first impression was that it was too much like a sitcom,''
Madonna says. ``I liked the idea of the friendship between Rupert's
character and my character, but that was it. I thought it needed
some rewrites. And that's when Rupert came in.''
 &HT;    Everett overhauled the script, though he goes uncredited, and
Madonna was much happier.
 &HT;    ``Then it was, of course, written for Rupert and me to do,'' she
says. ``The more they worked on it, the more I liked it.''
 &HT;    Early in the film Abbie is dumped by her boyfriend, who
complains that she's too together, too smart and too in control.
 &HT;    Madonna, no surprise, could relate.
 &HT;    ``Even though I had nothing to do with the writing of the
line,'' she says, ``I have found myself in situations with a man
where I've said, `Wait a second, you mean if I had less to offer
you I'd have a better chance in a relationship?'
 &HT;    ``I didn't exactly say it like that,'' the singer says, ``but
there have been many situations in my life where I felt that my
accomplishments and my success actually hindered certain
relationships. So I could relate to that _ but my life and Abbie's
life are obviously very different.
 &HT;    ``But I think a lot of the choices she makes _ the way she chose
to have the baby and raise the baby _ I probably would have done,
too.''
 &HT;    And, no, while Madonna admits that she finds the openly gay
Everett very attractive _ ``I adore him,'' she says, ``I'm sure if
he was straight things would be different'' _ the ``Best Thing''
story line does not reflect reality. The new love in her life is
director Guy Ritchie, best known for ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels'' (1999), whom she met at a lunch arranged by mutual friend
Trudie Styler, wife of the singer Sting.
 &HT;    ``Yes, he's the boyfriend,'' Madonna confirms. ``He's a very
important `guy' in my life. I adore him.''
 &HT;    Despite lingering scars from her marriage to actor Sean Penn,
which ended in divorce, Madonna says she'd consider marrying again,
and ``would love'' to have more children. For now, though, she
fills her time with her daughter Lourdes, 90 minutes of yoga each
day and work on a new album, which she describes as
``stripped-down, minimalist funk-techno.''
 &HT;    It seems unlikely, given her high-powered image, but Madonna
reports that, as the mother of 3-year-old Lourdes _ whose father is
ex-beau Carlos Leon _ she spends a lot of time on the same
child-rearing issues as parents everywhere, including matters of
religion, schooling and discipline.
 &HT;    And, of course, some extras. Life as the daughter of one of the
most recognizable women on the planet won't be easy, for one thing,
and Madonna is already wrestling with the possibility that Lourdes
might one day want to follow in her mother's footsteps.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't deter her,'' she says thoughtfully, ``but I'd want
to make sure she knew what she was getting herself into. I'm sure
by the time she's of a decision-making age she'll know.
 &HT;    ``The climate of the entertainment industry changes from decade
to decade,'' the singer adds, ``so who knows what it will be like
when she gets older? But I do think you need to be pretty
thick-skinned to understand that it's about the big picture, not
the small picture, and that everybody's career is made up of lots
of ups and downs.
 &HT;    ``You have to be prepared for lots of rejection,'' she
concludes. ``You have to do what you do for the right reasons. If
your intention is just to become famous and popular, then that's a
pretty bad place to start off.''
 &HT;    Madonna rocks her head back and forth, blond curls falling in
her face as she thinks.
 &HT;    ``I think it comes from having skills, being good at what you
do, having things to say and being talented,'' she says. ``It comes
from there, first and foremost.''

 (Includes a color slide of Michael Douglas in a scene from ``Wonder
Boys.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    His dad's new movie is called ``Diamonds,'' but you'll forgive
Michael Douglas if the word makes him wince.
 &HT;    The Oscar-winning actor's phobia stems from his efforts to
propose to actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.
 &HT;    ``Catherine and I were in Wales over Christmas,'' Douglas
recalls, ``and I kept taking the ring out of my overnight bag to
check it out.''
 &HT;    The couple jetted on to Colorado, and only then did he realize
that something crucial had been left behind.
 &HT;    ``I'm desperately calling the Marriott Hotel of Wales,'' Douglas
says. ``Finally housekeeping comes to the line to say, `Hello, Mr.
Douglas. Yes, we found a little box.'
 &HT;    ``I was like, `For God's sake, just hold onto it!'''
 &HT;    Perhaps it's because Zeta-Jones said `yes' that Douglas, tanned
and fit for an interview at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, can
look back and laugh. Dressed in a black sweater and dark pants,
he's certainly in a good mood _ at least to judge by his response
to those who have looked askance at the romance between the
56-year-old Douglas and the 30-year-old Zeta-Jones.
 &HT;    ``Naa-na, naa-na, naa-naaah,'' he says, laughing and wagging a
finger.
 &HT;    More seriously, Douglas _ who has a teen-age son, Cameron, with
his soon-to-be ex-wife, Diandra Douglas _ says that his age makes
him all the more appreciative of the news that Zeta-Jones is
expecting their first child.
 &HT;    ``This baby is a second chance for me,'' Douglas says. ``The new
baby is obviously wonderful, because you don't have to tear
yourself between career and family now. You feel like you've done
it all.
 &HT;    ``You love working,'' he adds. ``But you know you'll love having
a kid even more than making a movie. I will be able to focus that
much more time on my child and my marriage.''
 &HT;    His divorce has dragged on _ ``We're working it out'' is all
Douglas has to say on the subject _ and many were surprised that he
would be so quick to remarry.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, I was very happily surprised that I fell in love
again,'' the actor says. ``I think I reached the point of many
people where you think, `OK, I'll spend the rest of my life
single.'
 &HT;    ``The last thing I ever thought I'd do is get involved with an
actress,'' he says, rolling his eyes. ``But Catherine is extremely
grounded.''
 &HT;    Apparently, she's as comfortable with their age difference as
Douglas is.
 &HT;    ``The age difference actually disappeared very fast in the
relationship,'' he says. ``We don't even think about it anymore.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't really bother me,'' he adds. ``It's gone on
throughout civilization. Older guys marry younger women _ there was
Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow, Elizabeth Taylor and Mike Todd. There
are basically genetic and other reasons why. Women at a certain age
can have children, and men who are older want that family
lifestyle, too.''
 &HT;    About the only things Douglas won't discuss are wedding plans
and the baby's due date.
 &HT;    ``We have to keep something for us,'' he says firmly.
 &HT;    Almost lost in the hubbub over his personal life is that Douglas
has a new movie opening Feb. 25. In ``Wonder Boys'' he plays a
middle-aged college professor named Grady Tripp. Grady's life is
even more complicated than Douglas': He can't finish his latest
novel. His wife has left him. His girlfriend is pregnant. His best
female student is hitting on him. Another student is cracking up.
And he's running low on pot.
 &HT;    ``It was just this great, wonderful, rich character,'' the actor
says. ``I loved that you didn't know where the movie was going _
that insanity is life.
 &HT;    ``I've been blessed by the fact that audiences have pretty much
let me play whatever I wanted,'' he adds. ``And I've never had a
fear of being disliked.''
 &HT;    Which could be an issue, especially where drug use is concerned
_ Grady even supplies his students with marijuana. The issue is a
sensitive one, especially to Douglas, whose son recently has had
some widely publicized substance-abuse problems.
 &HT;    ``Of course, having had a liberal-arts education myself and
being a child of the '60s, there were certain reverberations that I
could remember,'' Douglas says, laughing nervously. ``I read the
script and thought, `Ah, college _ it's nice that it hasn't changed
that much.'''
 &HT;    The point is that he's playing a character, the actor adds, not
endorsing that character's actions or outlook. After having played
ruthless tycoons in ``Wall Street'' (1987) and ``The Game'' (1997),
a wandering sociopath in ``Falling Down'' (1993) and a coldblooded
murderer in ``A Perfect Murder'' (1998), he knows better than to
identify with his characters.
 &HT;    Besides, he says, there's a lot to admire in Grady.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be the bad guy each time out,'' he says.
``After `A Perfect Murder' and `The Game,' which were two
prince-of-darkness, well-dressed, well-coifed, rich urban
characters, I knew I wanted to do some romantic comedies. I want to
do more heroic roles _ and who is a bigger hero than a regular guy
who is a little burned out, getting it all together again?''
 &HT;    Douglas admits to some periods of burnout in his own career,
especially after ``Wall Street'' and ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987)
catapulted him to stardom.
 &HT;    ``I would basically finish a movie,'' he recalls, ``and then I
would come back and face a production company where I had 20
scripts in development, one more mediocre than the next. And the
studios were saying, `Well, let's go.' I was exhausted.'''
 &HT;    Nowadays, he says, he's learned to take it a bit slower. And
he's also come to terms with his own aging. He doesn't want to hang
on to leading-man roles at the expense of his own artistic
credibility.
 &HT;    ``I watch too many of these men so concerned with their images
and trying to make the best role for themselves that they don't
care about making the picture work,'' he says with a grimace. ``Get
over yourself.''
 &HT;    That's a lot easier these days, with his growing family
encompassing most of his attention.
 &HT;    Douglas and Zeta-Jones met in France, when he was attending the
Deauville Film Festival to hype ``A Perfect Murder.'' She was in
town to perform similar duties for her breakthrough movie, ``The
Mask of Zorro'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``I had just seen `Zorro' three weeks before,'' he recalls. ``I
said, `Wow, who is this?' Maybe Julie Christie was the last time I
had seen an actress come on screen who literally took my breath
away.'''
 &HT;    Finishing up his promotional duties, Douglas noticed that ``The
Mask of Zorro'' was scheduled for the next day.
 &HT;    ``Find out if Catherine Zeta-Jones is coming here,'' he told his
publicist. ``Find out if she's coming alone. See if maybe I can
have some dinner with her.'''
 &HT;    As it turned out, she was coming, and coming alone. And, yes,
she'd love to have dinner.
 &HT;    One thing led to another, and soon the paparazzi were falling
all over themselves to snap the couple basking on a yacht in the
Pacific, smooching in Kirk Douglas' Malibu back yard and traipsing
across most of the golf courses in Europe.
 &HT;    Yes, golf courses. Douglas is a passionate golfer who, only a
couple of years ago, said that he planned to dedicate his life to
the game.
 &HT;    ``Hey, man, Catherine is a good golfer,'' Douglas says with a
laugh. ``When she said, `I like to play golf, too,' frankly it
brought tears to my eyes.
 &HT;    ``I was like, `I will marry this woman.'''

 (Includes a color slide of Amy Brenneman in a scene from ``Judging
Amy.'') 
 By PHIL PARMA  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada until Feb. 27. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman is sitting in her trailer on the Paramount lot,
between scenes on her hit drama ``Judging Amy,'' and romance is in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not literally, but Brenneman feels as if it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my first scene with my new love interest,'' the actress
says enthusiastically. ``I'm really excited about that _ something
different for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That it is. To date, Brenneman's character, Family Court Judge
Amy Gray, has had a private life almost as chaotic as those in the
cases she tries. She's separated from her husband and living in
Connecticut with her mother, Maxine (Tyne Daly), who seems to
delight in tromping all over the lives of Amy and her brother,
Vincent (Dan Futterman).
</P>
<P>
   Cupid has not, to this point, put in an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really struck by the fact that I didn't have a love
interest,'' Brenneman admits. ``You know, part of me is so used to,
as most women are in Hollywood, playing the girlfriend, being
attached to a guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost got confused, like, `Well, where's my guy?''' she
says. ``And then I realized, `Oh, I am the guy in this series, for
now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of `Once and Again,' I know that the thrust is
that relationship,'' she says. ``And I thought, `Here I am, this
big loser-girl, I don't get one.'''
</P>
<P>
   So when Barbara Hall, executive producer and head writer on
``Judging Amy,'' told Brenneman that she was cooking up a romantic
interest for her _ to be played by Gregory Harrison, fresh from the
recently canceled family drama ``Safe Harbor'' _ the actress was
delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Hall notes that, now that audiences have gotten to know Amy,
creating a boyfriend for her is harder than it would have been at
the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days, it was hard to know who Amy should be with,
because the character was so new,'' Hall recalls in a separate
interview. ``But we used that to our advantage. I've been divorced,
and when I started dating my motto was, `All new mistakes,' you
know?
</P>
<P>
   ``And so she's starting over in terms of who she should be
dating,'' Hall says, ``and now we're just trying to establish that
Amy knows a little bit more about who she is and what she's looking
for. And, in typical fashion, I think that this love interest comes
at a time when she's not looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the writers aren't sure where the relationship will lead,
she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving it open in terms of how far we'll take it,''
Hall says, ``because we don't want to look too far ahead. We really
want it to evolve organically, the way relationships do, and we
want to complicate it, the way relationships really are.''
</P>
<P>
   That the relationship has the possibility of evolving over time
is a bit of a surprise _ many observers had predicted that the
series wouldn't be around that long. Brenneman herself admits that
she assumed the show would be ``13 (episodes) and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Judging Amy'' _ based loosely on the judicial career
of Brenneman's own mother _ emerged as one of the biggest hits of
the fall, handily beating ABC's more highly touted ``Once and
Again.'' Now, even though Brenneman's former series, ``NYPD Blue,''
is besting it in the ratings, ``Amy'' has maintained its sizable
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, our success has been like kismet, let's be honest,''
Brenneman says. ``I hoped the show would do well, but I've been
involved with a lot of projects that I thought were great that
didn't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly thinks the show's success reflects its intrinsically rich
dramatic potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for us is talking about grown-up women and
their mothers,'' she says in a separate interview. ``I said to
Barbara, `I don't think it's going to be hard to find the conflict
_ but what's more interesting to me is where they are actually
useful to each other anymore.' Maxine can't change her diapers and
slap her on her wrist, she has to help her in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's success is actually part of a trend, Hall notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most surprising thing about this season is that many of
the dramas have done well,'' she says. ``Another thing about our
show is that it has no gimmick. Everyone else seems to have a
gimmick _ talking to the camera, whatever _ but you really have to
say that this show is doing well because of the writing and the
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy'' and other hits such as ``Providence,'' ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' and ``7th Heaven'' seem to strike chords in their
audiences by portraying either multiple generations or a large
nuclear family living in very close proximity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are starting to figure out that families don't
all have to look the same,'' Hall says, ``and some people are
figuring out that, when the ideal married situation doesn't work
out, that doesn't mean that family life is over.''
</P>
<P>
   That family life will continue to develop over the course of the
current season, Brenneman promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, by the end of the season, the divorce is done, done,
done,'' she says. ``And I will have met his girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, a struggling writer, will try his hand at journalism,
and, Brenneman teases, ``there's some really great, very happy
surprises with other people on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to see her at times other than Tuesdays at
10, Brenneman co-stars with Glenn Close, Holly Hunter, Cameron
Diaz, Calista Flockhart and Kathy Baker in the independent film
``Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her,'' which debuted at
the Sundance Film Festival and is due for a wide release in April.
</P>
<P>
   Upon first reading the film's script, Brenneman admits, ``I
didn't really get it.'' But once she heard who else would be in the
cast, her doubts vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like `OK, I'll do it,''' she says cheerfully. ``Like,
`Oh, what do I know? I'll come to that party!'''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest test of ``Judging Amy'' _ and a potentially awkward
situation for Brenneman herself _ came in ``The Pillsbury
Bakeoff,'' her joking name for the show's being scheduled against
``NYPD Blue'' and its creator, her former boss Steven Bochco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy with an amazing show,'' she says, ``who's
given me more than I probably even know.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, just as ``NYPD Blue'' was preparing to return from
a lengthy hiatus designed to make room for ``Once and Again,''
Brenneman attended a Eurythmics concert in Los Angeles with her
husband, film director Brad Silberling _ another debt she owes
Bochco, since the couple met during an episode of ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the row of seats next to her, Brenneman spotted Bochco.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I immediately almost bought the media rap of, `Oh my God,
it's so awkward, oh my God,''' she recalls. ``And then I thought,
`Wait a minute, Steven's like our godfather, Steven brought us
together. I have so much love for Steven Bochco.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought, `Well, this is sort of awkward,' but I climbed
over all these people and I sat in his lap,'' she says, laughing.
``I said, `Well, I guess there's room in network television for
both of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco laughed, and Brenneman did too. And, to judge by the
ratings, they're probably both still laughing.

`INTIMATE' SENSATION: THE RETURN OF SMOKEY ROBINSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Smokey Robinson.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    You can go home again, after all.
 &HT;    Or at least Smokey Robinson can. For his latest album, the
Grammy-nominated ``Intimate,'' the singer returned to his musical
roots at Motown Records, the imprint he helped Berry Gordy Jr.
launch in Detroit during the late 1950s.
 &HT;    Robinson had left the label a decade ago to sign with the
now-defunct SBK Records, and he says that his return was as
surprising to him as it was to anyone else.
 &HT;    ``When we were just about to complete the album,'' the
59-year-old singer says, ``my manager came to me and said `We're
going back to Motown.' I said `Wow,' because I never expected that.
I said `Why?' and she said, `I'm not going to tell you. I'm going
to show you.'
 &HT;    ``So she takes me to New York to Motown's offices,'' he recalls,
``and I felt the same type of energy and atmosphere conditions up
there that we had in the early days. They go for it _ there's a
real hustle-and-bustle, let's-go-get-'em attitude.''
 &HT;    Robinson knows that attitude when he sees it. He was one of
Gordy's chief lieutenants at the start of Motown, a multi-threat
talent as a performer, bandleader, songwriter and producer. He
composed Motown's first No. 1 hit, Mary Wells' ``My Guy,'' and
wrote and performed its first million-selling single, ``Shop
Around,'' with his group The Miracles.
 &HT;    And, along with fellow Miracle Ronnie White, Robinson provided
The Temptations with ``My Girl,'' one of the top pop singles of all
time and considered by many to be Motown's quintessential song.
 &HT;    Gifted with a voice that Bob Dylan declared his all-time
favorite, one that was celebrated by the British band ABC in its
hit ``When Smokey Sings,'' Robinson has never been afraid to
reinvent himself. After leaving The Miracles in 1972, he broke new
musical ground with the romantic, pillow-talking ``A Quiet Storm''
(1975). He then stormed the pop charts again with two 1987 hits,
``Just to See Her'' and ``One Heartbeat.''
 &HT;    His career highs _ including induction into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, as well as a
Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording
Arts &AMP; Sciences _ have been impressive, but he's had some lows as
well, most notably the end of his nearly 25-year marriage to fellow
Miracle Claudette Robinson and a drug addiction that he chronicled
in his 1989 autobiography, ``Smokey: Inside My Life.''
 &HT;    But well into his fourth decade of making music, Robinson says
that, overall, the good has far outweighed the bad.
 &HT;    ``What do I really have to complain about, man?'' he says. ``I
was part of the birth of one of the greatest companies in the
world, music or otherwise. I got to work and hang with some of the
greatest artists in the world. I've been part of history, man _ a
lot of it.
 &HT;    ``I'm still out there doing it, too.''
 &HT;    For a while, of course, he wasn't. ``Intimate'' is Robinson's
first release in seven years, after a long stretch of reflection.
 &HT;    What he wanted, Robinson says, was ``just to kick back and look
at myself, man, see what I wanted to do with my life, how I wanted
to pursue show business itself, and get a little closer to the
people who are the priorities in my life, my family. It just
increases my values.''
 &HT;    He wasn't necessarily thinking of so much time off. In fact, he
started work on ``Intimate'' _ a collaboration with
songwriter/producer Michael Stokes _ in 1995. It's probably been
made six different times, Robinson says, with the pressure mounting
as each year passed.
 &HT;    ``After four years, it's kind of crucial that you come out with
something you feel is good,'' says Robinson, who recorded about 30
songs before settling on the album's 11 keepers. ``After six years,
it's a little more crucial. And after eight years, man, you better
come up with something _ you know what I mean?''
 &HT;    About two years into the process, Robinson sent some of the
material over to Gordy, as he often does, to get his former
mentor's thoughts on the music.
 &HT;    Gordy liked some of the songs, Robinson recalls, including the
title track. But his reaction generally wasn't favorable.
 &HT;    ``Man, I think the rest of this stuff is going in the wrong
direction, doing the wrong thing,'' the singer recalls him saying.
``This is a very crucial album _ you better let me come in.''
 &HT;    Robinson eventually agreed, and Gordy signed on as executive
producer, bring with him one of his current proteges, Michael
Lovesmith, to work with Robinson and Stokes. Together the four
worked on new songs and honed a vision and a theme for ``Intimate''
as a whole, a theme summed up in the romantic implications of its
title.
 &HT;    ``Berry wanted to call the album `Intimate,' which was one of
the first songs we had,'' Robinson says. ``That meant the album had
to be intimate, and it wasn't. When we got to the point where we
had these 11 songs we felt were intimate _ for an intimate setting,
that you can listen to with the one you love, put this on and have
a great time _ we knew we were finally done.
 &HT;    ``Romance is timeless, man,'' adds Robinson, a divorced father
of three grown children. ``Love is never passe _ somebody's falling
in love ever second of every day. I hope that continues to be that
way, every day of humanity.''
 &HT;    In that spirit, Robinson says, he strives to make his songs
universal, so they're not necessarily about specific people or
events, including those in his own life.
 &HT;    ``I'm not that kind of writer, at least not consciously,'' he
says. ``I write what strikes me at the time. I don't have to be
happy to write a happy song or sad to write a sad song.
 &HT;    ``Whatever idea comes into my mind, I promise you, it's a
blessing, a gift,'' he adds. ``I have pounds of paper at home, just
ideas for songs or notes or words or something that I write down
when they come to me and I figure I'll use somewhere down the
line.''
 &HT;    Robinson's promotional duties for ``Intimate'' kept him off the
road for most of 1999. But in the wake of his Grammy nomination,
he's looking forward to bringing ``Intimate'' _ as well as his
40-plus years of hits _ to as many concert audiences as he can.
 &HT;    ``Performing is probably my favorite thing in life, as far as my
business goes,'' he says. ``I always have a great time performing.
Always have.
 &HT;    ``I don't look at it like entertaining,'' Robinson adds. ``I'm
always of a mind of `Let's have fun.' I go out and have the chance
to one-on-one with my fans and we _ by that, I mean my people, my
band and I, and the people in the audience _ have a show,
together.''

 (Includes a color slide of Madonna with Rupert Everett in a scene
from ``The Next Best Thing.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Is there any role Madonna hasn't played?
 &HT;    Virgin and boy toy, sinner and saint. Sex symbol and
trend-setter, icon and pariah. Singer and actress, material girl
and maternal woman.
 &HT;    Madonna has done it all, surprising people again and again since
she arrived on the scene nearly 18 years ago.
 &HT;    ``It's not that my career has been based on surprising people,''
Madonna insists. ``My creative instincts have been to challenge
myself and to constantly do things that are going to broaden my own
mind and, in the process, hopefully the minds of other people.
 &HT;    ``First,'' she says, ``it has to interest me: `OK, is this going
to take me to another place? Am I going to learn something from
this? Is this going to inspire me?' That's where I always start,
whatever it is, whether it's music or film or whatever.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully, the manifestation of that is work that has some
effect on the audience.''
 &HT;    She's unquestionably connected with millions of fans through her
recordings and her vibrant, dance-driven live performances. But
she's had less luck on the big screen.
 &HT;    After stealing the show with a supporting role in ``Desperately
Seeking Susan'' (1985), Madonna elicited groans in ``Shanghai
Surprise'' (1986), ``Who's That Girl?'' (1987), ``Body of
Evidence'' (1993) and ``Four Rooms'' (1995). Not all her films
flopped _ she had effective bit parts in ``Dick Tracy'' (1990) and
``A League of Their Own'' (1992) _ but it wasn't until ``Evita''
(1996), in which she played the doomed Eva Peron, that Madonna won
genuine respect as an actress.
 &HT;    She insists, however, that she didn't need ``Evita'' to give her
confidence in her acting ability.
 &HT;    ``I needed some good roles and time with a really good acting
teacher,'' she says during a conversation at Manhattan's Rihga
Royal Hotel. ``I don't think it was necessarily `Evita.'''
 &HT;    At 41, dressed in black slacks and a shimmering blue-and-black
blouse, she remains every inch the star, at once smart, blunt and
playful. But, despite her celebrity and her musical prowess, movie
stardom has proven elusive: All eyes seem to be on her when she
acts, and it's almost as if people are hoping she fails, with her
box-office duds eliciting smug headlines and nasty gossip.
 &HT;    Madonna admits that she's had bad luck with the critics.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't say it's a question of them paying more attention,
but I do think they're much more judgmental,'' she says. ``That
goes for anybody who has been really successful in one area and
then wants to go off into another area and take it very seriously.
 &HT;    ``How on top of Michael Jordan was everybody when he decided he
wanted to play baseball?'' she says. ``It's kind of that same
thing.''
 &HT;    Madonna hopes that ``The Next Best Thing,'' opening March 3,
will be the hit she's been waiting for. Her first film in four
years, it's a romantic comedy with a serious edge, starring Madonna
and Rupert Everett as Abbie and Robert, best friends who wind up
fooling around and having a child together.
 &HT;    It's not a terribly uncommon scenario, except that Robert is
gay. The two happily raise their son, Sam (Malcolm Stumpf), but the
bliss ends a few years later, when Abbie falls in love with the
understanding, handsome Ben (Benjamin Bratt).
 &HT;    ``My first impression was that it was too much like a sitcom,''
Madonna says. ``I liked the idea of the friendship between Rupert's
character and my character, but that was it. I thought it needed
some rewrites. And that's when Rupert came in.''
 &HT;    Everett overhauled the script, though he goes uncredited, and
Madonna was much happier.
 &HT;    ``Then it was, of course, written for Rupert and me to do,'' she
says. ``The more they worked on it, the more I liked it.''
 &HT;    Early in the film Abbie is dumped by her boyfriend, who
complains that she's too together, too smart and too in control.
 &HT;    Madonna, no surprise, could relate.
 &HT;    ``Even though I had nothing to do with the writing of the
line,'' she says, ``I have found myself in situations with a man
where I've said, `Wait a second, you mean if I had less to offer
you I'd have a better chance in a relationship?'
 &HT;    ``I didn't exactly say it like that,'' the singer says, ``but
there have been many situations in my life where I felt that my
accomplishments and my success actually hindered certain
relationships. So I could relate to that _ but my life and Abbie's
life are obviously very different.
 &HT;    ``But I think a lot of the choices she makes _ the way she chose
to have the baby and raise the baby _ I probably would have done,
too.''
 &HT;    And, no, while Madonna admits that she finds the openly gay
Everett very attractive _ ``I adore him,'' she says, ``I'm sure if
he was straight things would be different'' _ the ``Best Thing''
story line does not reflect reality. The new love in her life is
director Guy Ritchie, best known for ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels'' (1999), whom she met at a lunch arranged by mutual friend
Trudie Styler, wife of the singer Sting.
 &HT;    ``Yes, he's the boyfriend,'' Madonna confirms. ``He's a very
important `guy' in my life. I adore him.''
 &HT;    Despite lingering scars from her marriage to actor Sean Penn,
which ended in divorce, Madonna says she'd consider marrying again,
and ``would love'' to have more children. For now, though, she
fills her time with her daughter Lourdes, 90 minutes of yoga each
day and work on a new album, which she describes as
``stripped-down, minimalist funk-techno.''
 &HT;    It seems unlikely, given her high-powered image, but Madonna
reports that, as the mother of 3-year-old Lourdes _ whose father is
ex-beau Carlos Leon _ she spends a lot of time on the same
child-rearing issues as parents everywhere, including matters of
religion, schooling and discipline.
 &HT;    And, of course, some extras. Life as the daughter of one of the
most recognizable women on the planet won't be easy, for one thing,
and Madonna is already wrestling with the possibility that Lourdes
might one day want to follow in her mother's footsteps.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't deter her,'' she says thoughtfully, ``but I'd want
to make sure she knew what she was getting herself into. I'm sure
by the time she's of a decision-making age she'll know.
 &HT;    ``The climate of the entertainment industry changes from decade
to decade,'' the singer adds, ``so who knows what it will be like
when she gets older? But I do think you need to be pretty
thick-skinned to understand that it's about the big picture, not
the small picture, and that everybody's career is made up of lots
of ups and downs.
 &HT;    ``You have to be prepared for lots of rejection,'' she
concludes. ``You have to do what you do for the right reasons. If
your intention is just to become famous and popular, then that's a
pretty bad place to start off.''
 &HT;    Madonna rocks her head back and forth, blond curls falling in
her face as she thinks.
 &HT;    ``I think it comes from having skills, being good at what you
do, having things to say and being talented,'' she says. ``It comes
from there, first and foremost.''

`WONDER' MAN: MICHAEL DOUGLAS ON LIFE, LOVE AND THE MOVIES

 (Includes a color slide of Michael Douglas in a scene from ``Wonder
Boys.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    His dad's new movie is called ``Diamonds,'' but you'll forgive
Michael Douglas if the word makes him wince.
 &HT;    The Oscar-winning actor's phobia stems from his efforts to
propose to actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.
 &HT;    ``Catherine and I were in Wales over Christmas,'' Douglas
recalls, ``and I kept taking the ring out of my overnight bag to
check it out.''
 &HT;    The couple jetted on to Colorado, and only then did he realize
that something crucial had been left behind.
 &HT;    ``I'm desperately calling the Marriott Hotel of Wales,'' Douglas
says. ``Finally housekeeping comes to the line to say, `Hello, Mr.
Douglas. Yes, we found a little box.'
 &HT;    ``I was like, `For God's sake, just hold onto it!'''
 &HT;    Perhaps it's because Zeta-Jones said `yes' that Douglas, tanned
and fit for an interview at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, can
look back and laugh. Dressed in a black sweater and dark pants,
he's certainly in a good mood _ at least to judge by his response
to those who have looked askance at the romance between the
56-year-old Douglas and the 30-year-old Zeta-Jones.
 &HT;    ``Naa-na, naa-na, naa-naaah,'' he says, laughing and wagging a
finger.
 &HT;    More seriously, Douglas _ who has a teen-age son, Cameron, with
his soon-to-be ex-wife, Diandra Douglas _ says that his age makes
him all the more appreciative of the news that Zeta-Jones is
expecting their first child.
 &HT;    ``This baby is a second chance for me,'' Douglas says. ``The new
baby is obviously wonderful, because you don't have to tear
yourself between career and family now. You feel like you've done
it all.
 &HT;    ``You love working,'' he adds. ``But you know you'll love having
a kid even more than making a movie. I will be able to focus that
much more time on my child and my marriage.''
 &HT;    His divorce has dragged on _ ``We're working it out'' is all
Douglas has to say on the subject _ and many were surprised that he
would be so quick to remarry.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, I was very happily surprised that I fell in love
again,'' the actor says. ``I think I reached the point of many
people where you think, `OK, I'll spend the rest of my life
single.'
 &HT;    ``The last thing I ever thought I'd do is get involved with an
actress,'' he says, rolling his eyes. ``But Catherine is extremely
grounded.''
 &HT;    Apparently, she's as comfortable with their age difference as
Douglas is.
 &HT;    ``The age difference actually disappeared very fast in the
relationship,'' he says. ``We don't even think about it anymore.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't really bother me,'' he adds. ``It's gone on
throughout civilization. Older guys marry younger women _ there was
Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow, Elizabeth Taylor and Mike Todd. There
are basically genetic and other reasons why. Women at a certain age
can have children, and men who are older want that family
lifestyle, too.''
 &HT;    About the only things Douglas won't discuss are wedding plans
and the baby's due date.
 &HT;    ``We have to keep something for us,'' he says firmly.
 &HT;    Almost lost in the hubbub over his personal life is that Douglas
has a new movie opening Feb. 25. In ``Wonder Boys'' he plays a
middle-aged college professor named Grady Tripp. Grady's life is
even more complicated than Douglas': He can't finish his latest
novel. His wife has left him. His girlfriend is pregnant. His best
female student is hitting on him. Another student is cracking up.
And he's running low on pot.
 &HT;    ``It was just this great, wonderful, rich character,'' the actor
says. ``I loved that you didn't know where the movie was going _
that insanity is life.
 &HT;    ``I've been blessed by the fact that audiences have pretty much
let me play whatever I wanted,'' he adds. ``And I've never had a
fear of being disliked.''
 &HT;    Which could be an issue, especially where drug use is concerned
_ Grady even supplies his students with marijuana. The issue is a
sensitive one, especially to Douglas, whose son recently has had
some widely publicized substance-abuse problems.
 &HT;    ``Of course, having had a liberal-arts education myself and
being a child of the '60s, there were certain reverberations that I
could remember,'' Douglas says, laughing nervously. ``I read the
script and thought, `Ah, college _ it's nice that it hasn't changed
that much.'''
 &HT;    The point is that he's playing a character, the actor adds, not
endorsing that character's actions or outlook. After having played
ruthless tycoons in ``Wall Street'' (1987) and ``The Game'' (1997),
a wandering sociopath in ``Falling Down'' (1993) and a coldblooded
murderer in ``A Perfect Murder'' (1998), he knows better than to
identify with his characters.
 &HT;    Besides, he says, there's a lot to admire in Grady.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be the bad guy each time out,'' he says.
``After `A Perfect Murder' and `The Game,' which were two
prince-of-darkness, well-dressed, well-coifed, rich urban
characters, I knew I wanted to do some romantic comedies. I want to
do more heroic roles _ and who is a bigger hero than a regular guy
who is a little burned out, getting it all together again?''
 &HT;    Douglas admits to some periods of burnout in his own career,
especially after ``Wall Street'' and ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987)
catapulted him to stardom.
 &HT;    ``I would basically finish a movie,'' he recalls, ``and then I
would come back and face a production company where I had 20
scripts in development, one more mediocre than the next. And the
studios were saying, `Well, let's go.' I was exhausted.'''
 &HT;    Nowadays, he says, he's learned to take it a bit slower. And
he's also come to terms with his own aging. He doesn't want to hang
on to leading-man roles at the expense of his own artistic
credibility.
 &HT;    ``I watch too many of these men so concerned with their images
and trying to make the best role for themselves that they don't
care about making the picture work,'' he says with a grimace. ``Get
over yourself.''
 &HT;    That's a lot easier these days, with his growing family
encompassing most of his attention.
 &HT;    Douglas and Zeta-Jones met in France, when he was attending the
Deauville Film Festival to hype ``A Perfect Murder.'' She was in
town to perform similar duties for her breakthrough movie, ``The
Mask of Zorro'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``I had just seen `Zorro' three weeks before,'' he recalls. ``I
said, `Wow, who is this?' Maybe Julie Christie was the last time I
had seen an actress come on screen who literally took my breath
away.'''
 &HT;    Finishing up his promotional duties, Douglas noticed that ``The
Mask of Zorro'' was scheduled for the next day.
 &HT;    ``Find out if Catherine Zeta-Jones is coming here,'' he told his
publicist. ``Find out if she's coming alone. See if maybe I can
have some dinner with her.'''
 &HT;    As it turned out, she was coming, and coming alone. And, yes,
she'd love to have dinner.
 &HT;    One thing led to another, and soon the paparazzi were falling
all over themselves to snap the couple basking on a yacht in the
Pacific, smooching in Kirk Douglas' Malibu back yard and traipsing
across most of the golf courses in Europe.
 &HT;    Yes, golf courses. Douglas is a passionate golfer who, only a
couple of years ago, said that he planned to dedicate his life to
the game.
 &HT;    ``Hey, man, Catherine is a good golfer,'' Douglas says with a
laugh. ``When she said, `I like to play golf, too,' frankly it
brought tears to my eyes.
 &HT;    ``I was like, `I will marry this woman.'''

 By PHIL PARMA  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada until Feb. 27. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman is sitting in her trailer on the Paramount lot,
between scenes on her hit drama ``Judging Amy,'' and romance is in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not literally, but Brenneman feels as if it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my first scene with my new love interest,'' the actress
says enthusiastically. ``I'm really excited about that _ something
different for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That it is. To date, Brenneman's character, Family Court Judge
Amy Gray, has had a private life almost as chaotic as those in the
cases she tries. She's separated from her husband and living in
Connecticut with her mother, Maxine (Tyne Daly), who seems to
delight in tromping all over the lives of Amy and her brother,
Vincent (Dan Futterman).
</P>
<P>
   Cupid has not, to this point, put in an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really struck by the fact that I didn't have a love
interest,'' Brenneman admits. ``You know, part of me is so used to,
as most women are in Hollywood, playing the girlfriend, being
attached to a guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost got confused, like, `Well, where's my guy?''' she
says. ``And then I realized, `Oh, I am the guy in this series, for
now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of `Once and Again,' I know that the thrust is
that relationship,'' she says. ``And I thought, `Here I am, this
big loser-girl, I don't get one.'''
</P>
<P>
   So when Barbara Hall, executive producer and head writer on
``Judging Amy,'' told Brenneman that she was cooking up a romantic
interest for her _ to be played by Gregory Harrison, fresh from the
recently canceled family drama ``Safe Harbor'' _ the actress was
delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Hall notes that, now that audiences have gotten to know Amy,
creating a boyfriend for her is harder than it would have been at
the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days, it was hard to know who Amy should be with,
because the character was so new,'' Hall recalls in a separate
interview. ``But we used that to our advantage. I've been divorced,
and when I started dating my motto was, `All new mistakes,' you
know?
</P>
<P>
   ``And so she's starting over in terms of who she should be
dating,'' Hall says, ``and now we're just trying to establish that
Amy knows a little bit more about who she is and what she's looking
for. And, in typical fashion, I think that this love interest comes
at a time when she's not looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the writers aren't sure where the relationship will lead,
she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving it open in terms of how far we'll take it,''
Hall says, ``because we don't want to look too far ahead. We really
want it to evolve organically, the way relationships do, and we
want to complicate it, the way relationships really are.''
</P>
<P>
   That the relationship has the possibility of evolving over time
is a bit of a surprise _ many observers had predicted that the
series wouldn't be around that long. Brenneman herself admits that
she assumed the show would be ``13 (episodes) and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Judging Amy'' _ based loosely on the judicial career
of Brenneman's own mother _ emerged as one of the biggest hits of
the fall, handily beating ABC's more highly touted ``Once and
Again.'' Now, even though Brenneman's former series, ``NYPD Blue,''
is besting it in the ratings, ``Amy'' has maintained its sizable
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, our success has been like kismet, let's be honest,''
Brenneman says. ``I hoped the show would do well, but I've been
involved with a lot of projects that I thought were great that
didn't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly thinks the show's success reflects its intrinsically rich
dramatic potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for us is talking about grown-up women and
their mothers,'' she says in a separate interview. ``I said to
Barbara, `I don't think it's going to be hard to find the conflict
_ but what's more interesting to me is where they are actually
useful to each other anymore.' Maxine can't change her diapers and
slap her on her wrist, she has to help her in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's success is actually part of a trend, Hall notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most surprising thing about this season is that many of
the dramas have done well,'' she says. ``Another thing about our
show is that it has no gimmick. Everyone else seems to have a
gimmick _ talking to the camera, whatever _ but you really have to
say that this show is doing well because of the writing and the
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy'' and other hits such as ``Providence,'' ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' and ``7th Heaven'' seem to strike chords in their
audiences by portraying either multiple generations or a large
nuclear family living in very close proximity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are starting to figure out that families don't
all have to look the same,'' Hall says, ``and some people are
figuring out that, when the ideal married situation doesn't work
out, that doesn't mean that family life is over.''
</P>
<P>
   That family life will continue to develop over the course of the
current season, Brenneman promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, by the end of the season, the divorce is done, done,
done,'' she says. ``And I will have met his girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, a struggling writer, will try his hand at journalism,
and, Brenneman teases, ``there's some really great, very happy
surprises with other people on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to see her at times other than Tuesdays at
10, Brenneman co-stars with Glenn Close, Holly Hunter, Cameron
Diaz, Calista Flockhart and Kathy Baker in the independent film
``Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her,'' which debuted at
the Sundance Film Festival and is due for a wide release in April.
</P>
<P>
   Upon first reading the film's script, Brenneman admits, ``I
didn't really get it.'' But once she heard who else would be in the
cast, her doubts vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like `OK, I'll do it,''' she says cheerfully. ``Like,
`Oh, what do I know? I'll come to that party!'''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest test of ``Judging Amy'' _ and a potentially awkward
situation for Brenneman herself _ came in ``The Pillsbury
Bakeoff,'' her joking name for the show's being scheduled against
``NYPD Blue'' and its creator, her former boss Steven Bochco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy with an amazing show,'' she says, ``who's
given me more than I probably even know.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, just as ``NYPD Blue'' was preparing to return from
a lengthy hiatus designed to make room for ``Once and Again,''
Brenneman attended a Eurythmics concert in Los Angeles with her
husband, film director Brad Silberling _ another debt she owes
Bochco, since the couple met during an episode of ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the row of seats next to her, Brenneman spotted Bochco.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I immediately almost bought the media rap of, `Oh my God,
it's so awkward, oh my God,''' she recalls. ``And then I thought,
`Wait a minute, Steven's like our godfather, Steven brought us
together. I have so much love for Steven Bochco.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought, `Well, this is sort of awkward,' but I climbed
over all these people and I sat in his lap,'' she says, laughing.
``I said, `Well, I guess there's room in network television for
both of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco laughed, and Brenneman did too. And, to judge by the
ratings, they're probably both still laughing.

 &HT;    You can go home again, after all.
 &HT;    Or at least Smokey Robinson can. For his latest album, the
Grammy-nominated ``Intimate,'' the singer returned to his musical
roots at Motown Records, the imprint he helped Berry Gordy Jr.
launch in Detroit during the late 1950s.
 &HT;    Robinson had left the label a decade ago to sign with the
now-defunct SBK Records, and he says that his return was as
surprising to him as it was to anyone else.
 &HT;    ``When we were just about to complete the album,'' the
59-year-old singer says, ``my manager came to me and said `We're
going back to Motown.' I said `Wow,' because I never expected that.
I said `Why?' and she said, `I'm not going to tell you. I'm going
to show you.'
 &HT;    ``So she takes me to New York to Motown's offices,'' he recalls,
``and I felt the same type of energy and atmosphere conditions up
there that we had in the early days. They go for it _ there's a
real hustle-and-bustle, let's-go-get-'em attitude.''
 &HT;    Robinson knows that attitude when he sees it. He was one of
Gordy's chief lieutenants at the start of Motown, a multi-threat
talent as a performer, bandleader, songwriter and producer. He
composed Motown's first No. 1 hit, Mary Wells' ``My Guy,'' and
wrote and performed its first million-selling single, ``Shop
Around,'' with his group The Miracles.
 &HT;    And, along with fellow Miracle Ronnie White, Robinson provided
The Temptations with ``My Girl,'' one of the top pop singles of all
time and considered by many to be Motown's quintessential song.
 &HT;    Gifted with a voice that Bob Dylan declared his all-time
favorite, one that was celebrated by the British band ABC in its
hit ``When Smokey Sings,'' Robinson has never been afraid to
reinvent himself. After leaving The Miracles in 1972, he broke new
musical ground with the romantic, pillow-talking ``A Quiet Storm''
(1975). He then stormed the pop charts again with two 1987 hits,
``Just to See Her'' and ``One Heartbeat.''
 &HT;    His career highs _ including induction into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, as well as a
Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording
Arts &AMP; Sciences _ have been impressive, but he's had some lows as
well, most notably the end of his nearly 25-year marriage to fellow
Miracle Claudette Robinson and a drug addiction that he chronicled
in his 1989 autobiography, ``Smokey: Inside My Life.''
 &HT;    But well into his fourth decade of making music, Robinson says
that, overall, the good has far outweighed the bad.
 &HT;    ``What do I really have to complain about, man?'' he says. ``I
was part of the birth of one of the greatest companies in the
world, music or otherwise. I got to work and hang with some of the
greatest artists in the world. I've been part of history, man _ a
lot of it.
 &HT;    ``I'm still out there doing it, too.''
 &HT;    For a while, of course, he wasn't. ``Intimate'' is Robinson's
first release in seven years, after a long stretch of reflection.
 &HT;    What he wanted, Robinson says, was ``just to kick back and look
at myself, man, see what I wanted to do with my life, how I wanted
to pursue show business itself, and get a little closer to the
people who are the priorities in my life, my family. It just
increases my values.''
 &HT;    He wasn't necessarily thinking of so much time off. In fact, he
started work on ``Intimate'' _ a collaboration with
songwriter/producer Michael Stokes _ in 1995. It's probably been
made six different times, Robinson says, with the pressure mounting
as each year passed.
 &HT;    ``After four years, it's kind of crucial that you come out with
something you feel is good,'' says Robinson, who recorded about 30
songs before settling on the album's 11 keepers. ``After six years,
it's a little more crucial. And after eight years, man, you better
come up with something _ you know what I mean?''
 &HT;    About two years into the process, Robinson sent some of the
material over to Gordy, as he often does, to get his former
mentor's thoughts on the music.
 &HT;    Gordy liked some of the songs, Robinson recalls, including the
title track. But his reaction generally wasn't favorable.
 &HT;    ``Man, I think the rest of this stuff is going in the wrong
direction, doing the wrong thing,'' the singer recalls him saying.
``This is a very crucial album _ you better let me come in.''
 &HT;    Robinson eventually agreed, and Gordy signed on as executive
producer, bring with him one of his current proteges, Michael
Lovesmith, to work with Robinson and Stokes. Together the four
worked on new songs and honed a vision and a theme for ``Intimate''
as a whole, a theme summed up in the romantic implications of its
title.
 &HT;    ``Berry wanted to call the album `Intimate,' which was one of
the first songs we had,'' Robinson says. ``That meant the album had
to be intimate, and it wasn't. When we got to the point where we
had these 11 songs we felt were intimate _ for an intimate setting,
that you can listen to with the one you love, put this on and have
a great time _ we knew we were finally done.
 &HT;    ``Romance is timeless, man,'' adds Robinson, a divorced father
of three grown children. ``Love is never passe _ somebody's falling
in love ever second of every day. I hope that continues to be that
way, every day of humanity.''
 &HT;    In that spirit, Robinson says, he strives to make his songs
universal, so they're not necessarily about specific people or
events, including those in his own life.
 &HT;    ``I'm not that kind of writer, at least not consciously,'' he
says. ``I write what strikes me at the time. I don't have to be
happy to write a happy song or sad to write a sad song.
 &HT;    ``Whatever idea comes into my mind, I promise you, it's a
blessing, a gift,'' he adds. ``I have pounds of paper at home, just
ideas for songs or notes or words or something that I write down
when they come to me and I figure I'll use somewhere down the
line.''
 &HT;    Robinson's promotional duties for ``Intimate'' kept him off the
road for most of 1999. But in the wake of his Grammy nomination,
he's looking forward to bringing ``Intimate'' _ as well as his
40-plus years of hits _ to as many concert audiences as he can.
 &HT;    ``Performing is probably my favorite thing in life, as far as my
business goes,'' he says. ``I always have a great time performing.
Always have.
 &HT;    ``I don't look at it like entertaining,'' Robinson adds. ``I'm
always of a mind of `Let's have fun.' I go out and have the chance
to one-on-one with my fans and we _ by that, I mean my people, my
band and I, and the people in the audience _ have a show,
together.''

PESSIMISTS CHECK OUT EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if optimistic people weren't annoying enough, what with their
perky smiles and sunny dispositions, it now turns out that they
live longer than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   (By ``us'' I am referring, of course, to pessimists or as I
prefer to call us, realists.)
</P>
<P>
   According to researchers at the Mayo Clinic, optimistic people
live about 19 percent longer than pessimists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirmed our common-sense belief. It tells us that mind
and body are linked and that attitude has an impact on the final
outcome, death,'' Toshihiko Maruta, a lead researcher on the
project, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Being a realist, it is my opinion that optimistic people do not
live 19 percent longer; they just make everyone else's life 19
percent shorter because they are so irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mayo Clinic researchers have not confirmed this, I
suspect that every time a realist hears an optimist utter the
words, ``Have a nice day!'', a minimum of one full hour is lopped
off his lifespan. When you stop to think how often realists hear
these dreadful words, it is surprising that any of us are around
today to bemoan the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Bemoaning, of course, is what we realists do best. It can be an
art form or an aerobic exercise, depending on whether your
bemoaning is done on the run or while seated.
</P>
<P>
   If optimists serve any purpose in the world _ and I'm not at all
convinced that they do _ it's to alert realists of topics that are
in need of bemoaning. Optimists cannot go five seconds without
saying something good about someone or something, so we realists
are never in danger of running out of bemoanable material.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite topic of optimists is the weather. (One might suggest
to the Mayo researchers that people who are intellectually shallow
also live 19 percent longer, but let us save that for another
time.) There could be a hurricane raging outside and an optimist
will declare that we need the rain. In the mind of an optimist, a
glacier sliding over New York, signaling the start of a new Ice
Age, will just make the arrival of spring all the more welcome,
10,000 years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The cliche is that optimists see the glass as half-full, while
pessimists see it as half-empty. This is nonsense. All pessimists
want to know is what's in the glass, and whether it's safe to
drink. Optimists don't care what's in the glass or how full or
empty it is; they're just happy to be there.
</P>
<P>
   As a realist, I do not begrudge the fact that optimists will
live 19 percent longer than I. Knowing optimists as I do, they will
probably squander that extra 19 percent rhapsodizing about the
weather or contemplating a metaphorical glass. If there is an
argument against extending the human lifespan, this is certainly
it.
</P>
<P>
   What bothers me more is an editorial in the Mayo Clinic
Proceedings that accompanied the research findings. Martin
Seligman, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said
pessimism is both identifiable early in life and can be
``changed.'' (The quotes are mine.)
</P>
<P>
   He suggested putting pessimists in ``programs'' to ``change
their way of thinking'' and thereby lower their risk of physical
illness. (Again, my quotes.)
</P>
<P>
   Optimists are clearly trying to wipe out pessimists and take
over the world, which they will then rename The Big Happy Face.
While they are doing that, we pessimists _ excuse me, realists _
will be locked up in gaily painted classrooms listening to our
teacher _ an optimist, of course _ drone on about the weather and
half-full glasses.
</P>
<P>
   And they wonder why we check out 19 percent ahead of schedule.
</P>

   &UR; SIDE EFFECTS: Finding a Down Side to a Cleaner World &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists investigating the rise in asthma and allergies in
developed countries have long wondered whether the increased
incidence is the price being paid for the cleanliness of the modern
world, of immune systems being inadequately challenged in
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   A new Italian study, published Feb. 12 in The Lancet, has lent
new strength to that hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of air force cadets in Caserta, Italy, found that those
who had been exposed to orofecal infections, which are carried in
tainted food or by unwashed hands, were less likely to suffer from
respiratory allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the Immunology and Allergy Laboratory in
Rome, are not suggesting bad hygiene as a preventive measure for
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, hope that new studies can determine exactly
how immune responses are boosted by exposure to microbes.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, they wrote, is to develop ways of using molecular
mimics of the infectious agents to stimulate the immune system
without causing disease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEHAVIOR: When a Weary Brain Hops Over Hurdles &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A sleepy brain is never as sharp as a rested brain, but the
fuzziness can vary with the task at hand, according to a new study
that found signs of a mechanism that can sometimes limit the impact
of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted by psychiatrists at the University of
California at San Diego and at the San Diego Veterans
Administration Medical Center using a brain scan to reveal patterns
of activity.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrists gave 13 people a series of exercises designed
to test their math and verbal abilities while normally rested and
again over the course of 35 hours without sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The math results were reported in December in NeuroReport and
the verbal last week in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   For math, the people were asked to subtract single digit
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found was completely different patterns of brain
activation,'' and a striking drop-off in performance as fatigue
rose, said Dr. J. Christian Gillian, the lead author of the
research paper.
</P>
<P>
   When the subjects were rested, doing the math lit up substantial
parts of their cerebral cortex.
</P>
<P>
   But fatigue appeared to limit the brain function across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   For the verbal test, subjects were read a list of 20 words and
were asked either to recall them after leaving the brain scanning
machine or to recognize them when they were mixed in with a larger
list.
</P>
<P>
   The tired subjects had a poor recall of the words, but to the
researchers' surprise, fatigue made little difference in the
recognition test, indicating, Gillian said, that the information
``got into the brain and was registered.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise was that the frontal lobes became more
active as the subjects became sleepier.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the parietal lobe, which normally plays only a
secondary role in verbal processing, began to be activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greater the activation of the parietal lobes, the more
subjects preserved their base line performance,'' said Gillian,
``which leads us to believe that perhaps the brain is in some way
compensating for loss of function elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSCLE GROUPS: Recruits Gauge Ways to Avoid Injuries &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Stretching out-of-shape muscles is the best way for the weekend
athlete to avoid injury, right? Wrong, says a new Australian study
that found no reduction in injuries among soldiers who stretched
before workouts, compared with soldiers who did not.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers who avoided injury were those who were more
physically fit to begin with, according to researchers at the
Kapooka Health Center and the University of Sydney, whose findings
were published in this month's issue of Science &AMP; Medicine in
Sports &AMP; Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 1,500 male recruits were randomly assigned to two
groups, one of which added a stretching routine _ 20-second static
stretches of six muscle groups in the legs _ to a warm-up that
preceded physical training.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 weeks that followed, the difference in the number
of injuries was not statistically significant: 158 injuries among
the men doing stretches, and 175 in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were ranked least fit, however, were 14 times as
likely as the recruits in the best shape to suffer injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAUMA: A Caution Flag on Breathing Tubes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A study involving California paramedics has found that placing
breathing tubes in the throats of unconscious children saved no
more lives than the less risky method of squeezing oxygen into
their lungs through a mask and hand pump.
</P>
<P>
   Intubating a child, or threading a breathing tube into the
throat, is often presented as a moment of high drama on television
medical shows, and well it might be, because complications are
common and can be fatal. But a belief that the more aggressive
treatment is the most effective method of keeping oxygen flowing to
a child's brain has caused intubation to becoming increasingly
common.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, conducted by emergency medicine physicians from
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and published on Feb. 9 in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, was the first controlled
comparison of the two methods. Over three years, paramedics in Los
Angeles and Orange counties switched on alternate days between
intubation and bag-valve mask ventilation, known as BVM, as the
intended treatment method in 820 cases of children 12 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates for the two methods turned out to be similar: 30
percent for children in the BVM group, and 26 percent of the
endotracheal intubation group. There was also little difference in
terms of limiting brain damage: 23 percent of the ventilation group
had good outcomes, compared with 20 percent for intubation.
</P>
<P>
   The study found two significant differences: paramedics involved
in intubations generally spent two minutes longer on the scene, and
potentially fatal complications were reported in 8 percent of the
children who were successfully intubated.
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead author, Dr. Marianne Gausche, said in an
interview that both counties had abandoned on-site intubations of
children after being informed of the study's findings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PREVENTION: Flu Spray Packs a Punch, Up the Nose &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A nasal spray form of a flu vaccine for children was effective
in a two-year test, even against an unexpected form of the virus, a
study in this month's issue of the Journal of Pediatrics reports.
</P>
<P>
   Few children get flu shots, even though children get the flu,
and spread it, more frequently than adults do, and often develop
ear infections that adults do not.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to injections, researchers have developed what
they call a cold-adapted live attenuated virus vaccine, which is a
weakened form of the disease designed to stimulate the body's
immune system in the cooler nasal passages, but unable to reproduce
in the warmer interior.
</P>
<P>
   They hope this form of vaccination can give immunity that lasts
longer and covers more strains than normal flu shots, which use
inactivated viruses.
</P>
<P>
   While testing the spray, called FluMist, researchers stumbled
into an unplanned test of the vaccine's ability to adapt to new flu
strains. In the winter of 1997-98, the predominant flu virus was
A/Sydney, a new form that the vaccine had not been designed to
block. Nevertheless, the spray proved to be 86 percent effective
against it, the study's lead author, Dr. Robert B. Belshe of St.
Louis University, reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's exciting here is evidence that a live attenuated virus
can provide broader protection, and in a form that may be easier
for children to take,'' said Dr. Linda Lambert, the influenza
program officer at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.

<P>
   &UR; The Moon at Full Tilt &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Four and a half billion years ago, the vicinity of Earth was a
mess. According to the commonly accepted theory, the young planet
had just been broadsided by a Mars-size object, creating a huge
disc of orbiting debris. It was this junk that eventually coalesced
into the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   A fine theory, except for one thing: according to it, the Moon's
orbit should be close to, if not aligned with, the plane of Earth's
equator. That is not the case. Early on, the orbit was inclined by
about 10 degrees, and is still about 5 degrees off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two scientists with the Southwest Research Institute in
Colorado have developed a model to explain how the Moon's orbit got
that way. It started off with only a slight inclination, about one
degree, the scientists say in a paper in Nature, but quite rapidly
developed its full tilt.
</P>
<P>
   It did so, this new theory holds, because only part of the
debris disc formed the Moon. The inner part of the disc was close
enough to Earth that the planet's gravity prevented it from
coalescing.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while, the new Moon coexisted with this inner disc
(until the debris in it was grabbed by Earth or the Moon). And
elaborate gravitational interactions between the Moon and the disc
made the Moon's orbit more inclined. The scientists estimate that
the Moon hit full tilt, about 10 degrees, in about a century, a
phenomenally short amount of time in the celestial scheme.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fighting Nitrogen Runoff  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen from farm runoff and other sources in the Midwest has
created pollution problems farther south, in the Gulf of Mexico.
Nitrogen travels in streams and rivers down to the Gulf, where
algae gorge on it. The increased algae growth, in turn, depletes
oxygen from the water, causing other marine life to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers have a way of removing some of the nitrogen, however, as
it flows with the water downstream. And when it comes to this
self-cleaning action, a new study has found, bigger is not better.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by scientists with the United States Geological
Survey and reported in Nature, shows that nitrogen removal is worse
in big rivers like the Mississippi and better in smaller streams
and tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   Given one of the major ways that the nitrogen is removed, this
finding makes sense. Nitrogen, in the form of nitrates and other
compounds, is converted by bacteria in the stream bed into nitrogen
gas, which bubbles up into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Since proportionally more water is in contact with the stream
bed in a smaller, shallower stream than in a larger, deeper one,
the rate of nitrogen removal rises as stream size falls. The
scientists found that the rates for the smallest streams measured
were up to 90 times as high as the rates for the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   So, the researchers say, delivery of nitrogen to the Gulf is not
a simple function of how far away the source is, but rather of the
size of the streams the nitrogen travels through. The researchers
suggest that this idea could be helpful in devising strategies to
control nitrogen runoff, particularly in deciding on which
watersheds to focus efforts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Touring the Comets &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Along with the successful orbiting of an asteroid by the Near
Earth Asteroid Rendezvous satellite last week came another piece of
good news for those in the business of sending spacecraft beyond
Earth's orbit. NASA has approved a mission to fly by three comets,
and building of the spacecraft begins this month.
</P>
<P>
   The $158-million mission, known as the Comet Nucleus Tour, is
scheduled for launching in mid-2002. The principal investigator is
Joseph Veverka, an astronomer at Cornell, and the spacecraft will
be built at Johns Hopkins. If all goes as planned, the craft will
travel about 30 million miles, encountering one comet (Encke) in
2004 and another (Schwassmann-Wachmann-3) in 2006. It then would
have the option of meeting up with a third comet, either d'Arrest
in 2008 or some other, yet-to-be-discovered one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The argument could be made that the 42nd annual Grammy awards
are a battle between youth and experience _ which is to say,
between schlock and substance.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music has been been skewing down to appeal to an
ever-younger audience for years now, but the overwhelming success
of such pop-tart acts as the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, Britney
Spears and Christina Aguilera made this more of a dividing line in
the past year than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   And what made these acts feel all the more uneasily omnipresent
was the Polygram/Seagram merger, which trimmed dozens of artists
from major-label rosters. Put the two together, and in late '98 and
all of '99, it felt like good pop music for adults was in mighty
short supply, and would become all the more so in the coming
months.

   The other side to this coin, and what gives veteran rock fans
something to root for Wednesday, is the realization that this will,
to a large extent, be Carlos Santana's night. With 10 nominations _
including record of the year, album of the year and song of the
year _ the 6 million-copies-sold-and-counting ``Supernatural'' has
brought the Mexican-born guitarist/bandleader a higher profile than
he's had since his heyday in the early to mid-'70s, in no small
part due to the success of the ``Smooth'' single, featuring Rob
Thomas of matchbox 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth'' is an unstoppable single and a winning video, and
(thanks to the marketing savvy of Arista President Clive Davis) one
of the smartest moves a major veteran rock artist has made in
years.
</P>
<P>
   It brought together kids who loved
young-but-not-quite-alternative music, which matchbox 20 surely is
(and who had, in many cases, no idea who Carlos Santana was) with
veterans who had long since thought of him as a classic rocker
whose hit-making days were over.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps _ which are a sizable chunk of the pop music audience
_ discovered/rediscovered Santana with one fell swoop, ensuring him
more success than at any time since his first greatest-hits
collection in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Just as 1991 was Quincy Jones' year, '93 was Eric Clapton's and
'95 was Bruce Springsteen's, so Wednesday night will be all about
Santana. He has all the things that the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences members have proved that they love in
the past: mass name recognition, the hard-working classic-rocker
pedigree, and a touch of modernity about him.
</P>
<P>
   That equals at least five trips to the podium. NARAS tends to
make up for lost time and crown a rocker who came back big (Bonnie
Raitt, anyone?) and Santana's story is as close to a Cinderella
fairy tale as pop music has had to offer for a good long while now.
</P>
<P>
   What will be interesting, though, is just how well he does
against the fizzy-pop kids. The Record of the Year, Album of the
Year and Song of the Year categories all find a stark contrast
between him and performers who could easily be his children: The
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Ricky Martin. My bet is he walks away
with at least two of the three above, as well as the Collaboration
With Vocals and Rock Instrumental statues, too.
</P>
<P>
   This is true, too, of TLC. The troubled R&AMP;B supergroup also came
back strong in '99 with the ``Fanmail'' CD and two of the biggest
R&AMP;B singles of the year, ``No Scrubs'' and ``Unpretty.'' Outside of
Santana, TLC is the longest-running group up for the big three _
Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Song of the Year. But
though they certainly deserve their fair share of attention _
they're a lock for Best R&AMP;B Album _ the odds are long that, with
all the negative publicity their squabbles have gotten, they will
be able to beat out Santana. These things do count, you know.
</P>
<P>
   But those, of course, are not the only categories, _ and, as
always, the nominations miss some of the best music that's been
released. Here, then, is my highly subjective list of who will win,
who should win, and who should have at least been nominated in the
top 15 categories.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Record of the Year
</P>
<P>
   ``I Want It That Way,'' Backstreet Boys
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe,'' Cher
</P>
<P>
   ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' Ricky Martin
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth,'' Santana
</P>
<P>
   ``No Scrubs,'' TLC
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Minus the pap of ``Want,'' a tough category. In
another year, perhaps, ``Believe'' would probably take it, and ``No
Scrubs'' is definitely a worthy nomination, but I'm going with
``Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: That vote wasn't just because I'm an old fan, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: These are biggies, all right, but both Lou
Bega's ``Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of ...)'' and Jennifer Lopez's
``If You Had My Love'' were also fairly omnipresent. As was,
frankly, Madonna's ``Beautiful Stranger.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Album of the Year
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium,'' Backstreet Boys
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly,'' Dixie Chicks
</P>
<P>
   ``When I Look in Your Eyes,'' Diana Krall
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanmail,'' TLC
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural,'' Santana
</P>
<P>
   What should win: Actually, my favorite CD here is ``Fly''; the
Chicks have crossed over to the extent that if anyone can win this
besides ``Supernatural,'' this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: It's 75/25 ``Supernatural/Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Actually, I was very pleasantly surprised
that Krall got the nomination. I would have put in R. Kelly's
``R.'' _ not because it was consistently good (it wasn't) but
because it was so much a part of the urban landscape. And it
certainly wasn't any worse than ``Millennium.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Song of the Year
</P>
<P>
   ``I Want It That Way''

   ``Smooth''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpretty''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got a Way''
</P>
<P>
   What should win: ``Unpretty'' certainly has the best message of
the five.
</P>
<P>
   What will win: ``Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   What was overlooked: While it wasn't my favorite song, there's
no question Smash Mouth's ``All Star'' was all over the place. As
was Kid Rock's ``Bawitdaba.''

<P>
   Britney Spears
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tedeschi
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: No question, Macy Gray has the most talent of
any of the above. Kid Rock isn't new, Tedeschi is a Bonnie
Raitt/Janis wannabe, and Aguilera and Spears are, well, what they
are.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Kid Rock. And I don't even want him to. Gray's
been coming on strong in the past couple months, but it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: I was actually quite proud of NARAS for even
including Gray, but I also think that Eminem should have been here
in place of the Kid; while neither is actually a ``new'' artist,
Eminem is clearly the better rapper.

<P>
   Who will win: That's never been enough. Madonna's already won a
slew of awards; ``I Will Remember You'' has stuck around a long
time and has broad-based appeal, and McLachlan's association with
Lilith Fair certainly doesn't hurt.

   Who should win: Marc Anthony. His vocal performance was far
better than Martin's _ and as for the Sting and Lou Bega songs, the
former was on a CD that flopped commercially and the latter was a
better video than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Ricky. This is a good, safe award to give him: He
burst onto the mainstream (read: white) consciousness on last
year's show and La Vida Loca is, despite being played to death,
darned catchy.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Robbie Williams' performance on
``Millennium'' is far better than Sting's _ it's a better song,
too. Ditto for the Artist's ``The Greatest Romance Ever Sold,'' a
fantastic single from an erratic record.

GRAMMIES: THE TEXAS CONTINGENT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies GRAMMIES-PREVIEW) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texans and those who want to be and/or who think they are, this
year's Grammys are for you.
</P>
<P>
   Not completely, of course _ the only connection that Ricky
Martin, Carlos Santana, Kid Rock and Cher have to the Lone Star
State is that they've all played here in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Texas musicians look to clean up on Wednesday: Not
only are there a ton of nominees, but several stand a very good
chance of coming home with a statue.
</P>
<P>
   There is, first and foremost, Dallas' Dixie Chicks, whose
``Fly'' is up for Album of the Year and Country Album. The Chicks
also look strong in the Country Duo or Group With Vocal category _
for ``Ready to Run'' _ and have a decent chance of seeing the same
song take home the country Song of the Year, although I think
George Jones' ``Choices'' will walk away with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choices'' is also up for Country Album of the Year _ it won't
win, however; ``Fly'' will because of the Chicks' youth, sassiness,
looks and enormous sales.
</P>
<P>
   The country Male Vocal category will go to a Texan: It'll be
``Choices'' or Lyle Lovett's ``That's Right (You're Not From
Texas).'' Jones' high profile _ and snubbing at the Country Music
Awards in September _ earn him a good shot here, and Lovett is
often in the news and never less than interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But the night's big winners from Texas may be the Austin-based
western swing band Asleep at the Wheel; while not ``technically''
Texans (the band was formed in Virginia in 1970) they've long since
been adopted. AATW is virtually a lock for the Collaboration With
Vocals Grammy _ after all, they've been nominated twice, once for
``Going Away Party'' (with Willie Nelson and Manhattan Transfer)
and twice for ``Roly Poly'' (with the Chicks, naturally).
</P>
<P>
   It's nice that their ``Ride With Bob'' got a nod for Best
Country Album, but it's a huge long shot there. But they might well
earn a third Grammy for Country Instrumental of the Year for
``Bob's Breakdowns.'' Two of the other four nominees in the
category (Marty Stuart and Steve Wariner) are better known as
vocalists.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Lonestar, a band that has some of its roots in
Fort Worth. ``Amazed,'' the band's biggest hit ever, is up for two
major country honors: Duo or Group With Vocal and Song of the Year.
My bet: It takes the former but loses the latter to Shania's ``Come
On Over.'' Unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget three other acts: Austin's Sixpence None the
Richer's ``Kiss Me'' is up for the Pop Duo or Group With Vocal
honor (it will lose to TLC's ``Unpretty''); Houston's Destiny's
Child, whose ``Bills, Bills, Bills'' got the nod for R&AMP;B Duo or
Group With Vocal _ it has a good shot, but my money's on Whitney
Houston's ``Heartbreak Hotel'' _ and good ol' Willie, whose ``Night
and Day'' has a so-so chance of beating out both Jeff Beck's ``A
Day in the Life'' and Santana's ``El Farol'' for Pop/Rock
Instrumental. This, however, will be Santana's night, so don't hold
your breath.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is Denton's own Brave Combo, whose
``Polkasonic'' should get the Polka Album award; it is the
long-running, hard-traveling band's third nomination in the
category, and our hopes are with them.

PERSONAL HEALTH: THE TELLTALE SIGNS OF SORE THROAT DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is high season for sore throats. One of my friends awakens
with a scratchy throat nearly every morning on these cold winter
days. Another said the other day that his throat felt sore and he
guessed (correctly) that he was getting a cold. A third had gone
back to bed with a throat so painful she could hardly talk, let
alone swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Sore throat is a symptom, not a disease. In each case, there was
a different cause that dictated a different treatment. The scratchy
throat probably was a mechanical problem caused by dry, heated
winter air and aggravated by my friend's tendency to breathe
through her mouth when she sleeps. The very painful throat, on the
other hand, turned out to be an infection serious enough to warrant
a visit to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the findings of a recent nationwide survey of
1,000 adults, slightly more than half of Americans do nothing to
relieve a sore throat unless it becomes so severe that they cannot
swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people seem to resist acknowledging and treating their
sore throat pain,'' said Dr. John G. Campbell, president of the
American Academy of Otolaryngology. Yet, he noted, ``Sore throat is
a symptom of many medical conditions, and it's important that
people identify sore throat symptoms and their causes in order to
seek appropriate treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy warns people to see a doctor when a sore throat is
severe or persists longer than the five to seven days that is the
usual duration of a cold or flu and is not caused by an avoidable
allergen or irritant.
</P>
<P>
   The academy also advises that any of the following signs and
symptoms should prompt a visit to the doctor: difficulty breathing,
swallowing or opening the mouth; joint pain; earache; rash; fever
over 101; blood in saliva or phlegm; a lump in the neck; a sore
throat that recurs frequently; and hoarseness that lasts more than
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The common causes of sore throats include infectious organisms,
mechanical irritants and conditions like tumors that can result in
serious health consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Most sore throats result from viral infections, usually colds,
but possibly influenza. In children or adults who were not
immunized, the measles, chickenpox or whooping cough can cause a
sore throat. Sometimes, a canker sore or fever blister forms in the
throat, causing intense pain upon swallowing. When a sore throat
persists for weeks, accompanied by swollen glands in the neck,
armpits and groin, enlarged tonsils with white patches and possibly
breathing difficulties, infectious mononucleosis (``mono,'' caused
by a herpes virus) is a likely cause.
</P>
<P>
   Certain antiviral drugs may diminish the severity of such an
infection, but it is important to remember that ordinary
antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should not be used
unless a bacterial infection is also present or is strongly
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 percent of sore throats are due to bacterial infections,
usually strains of streptococcus bacteria. Strep throat must be
treated with an antibiotic to prevent damage to the heart valves
and kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   A throat culture is needed to establish a strep infection and,
after treatment, another culture should be done to be sure the
infection is gone. But if another bacterium is the cause, the
culture will be negative, and even if strep is the cause, the
culture sometimes fails to detect it. The quick strep test, with
results in 20 minutes, is less accurate than an overnight culture.
</P>
<P>
   Small children may be prone to infections of tonsils
(tonsillitis), the lymph tissues on each side of the back of the
throat. Repeated infections may result when bacteria are trapped in
the tonsils, which can swell and cause significant throat
obstruction. If such infections recur three or more times a year, a
tonsillectomy may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Epiglottitis, a bacterial infection of the flap that covers the
windpipe when a person swallows, is especially dangerous because it
can cause swelling that obstructs the airway. Emergency medical
attention should be sought when swallowing is extremely painful,
speech is muffled and breathing becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A person with a deviated septum (the partition inside the nose),
nasal polyps or oversize tonsils and adenoids may be forced to be a
mouth breather, during the day as well as when asleep. This can
result in a chronically dry, raw throat. Consult an
otolaryngologist if this is your problem, since it may require
surgical correction.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, allergies to dust mites and pet dander often cause a
chronically raw or scratchy throat, usually accompanied by an
irritating postnasal drip or nasal congestion that results in mouth
breathing. Eliminating the cause is the best cure.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, breathing dry, heated air can cause a mild sore
throat, especially on awakening. The obvious solution: turn the
heat down at night, open a window a little and try to add moisture
to the air, perhaps by using a vaporizer. In hotels, I run the hot
water in the shower to steam up the room before retiring. Also,
drink lots of fluids (without alcohol or caffeine) to keep your
respiratory tract well hydrated.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution, most commonly from tobacco smoke, and straining
your voice by shouting or trying to talk in a noisy place can also
irritate the throat. If hoarseness accompanies a sore throat, rest
your voice, drink lots of fluids and avoid whispering or frequently
clearing your throat, which only compounds the irritation. If
hoarseness persists for several weeks or is accompanied by pain,
coughing up of blood, difficulty swallowing or a lump in the neck,
consult a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent heartburn can cause a chronic sore throat when stomach
acid that backs up into the esophagus reaches the throat. Acid
reflux is a serious problem that requires medical treatment if home
remedies fail to correct it. These include losing weight; quitting
smoking; avoiding spicy, fatty or acidic foods, chocolate,
peppermint, coffee, alcohol and carbonated beverages; eating
smaller meals and not eating anything for two or three hours before
going to bed; and elevating the head of the bed about six inches
higher than the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Cancerous tumors of the throat, tongue or larynx are most common
in longtime smokers and heavy drinkers. Symptoms may include a mild
chronic sore throat, difficulty swallowing, pain that radiates to
the ear, hoarseness, a lump in the neck, blood in the saliva or
phlegm, and unexplained weight loss. This problem requires
immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   In general, if you know the cause of your sore throat is not a
serious problem or, if serious, is receiving appropriate medical
treatment, it is all right to use an over-the-counter pain reliever
for a few days.

WHEN PATIENTS WANT TO KNOW THE DISTANCE TO DEATH'S DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My patient Charlie did not show up for his appointment this
month, an aberration for which I am deeply, selfishly grateful. It
means that he is feeling well, since he never fails to check in at
the first ache or sneeze. It also means that I get a little break
from the relentless cross-examination that is a session in the
office with Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long do I have, doc?'' he asks. ``Say a year, I guess, for
sure, right? Am I right? Two?''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, someone told Charlie, then newly diagnosed with
AIDS, that he had eight months to live. ``Can you believe that?''
he says now. ``Who would tell a person something like that, when it
wasn't, like, fixed?''
</P>
<P>
   But the inaccuracy of Charlie's last fortune has not dissuaded
him from seeking out another, better one from me. Logical perhaps
he is not, but who can blame him for a little illogic?
</P>
<P>
   He was at death's door; now he is fit and vigorous on
medications, working two jobs and newly engaged. He knows the
hairpin turns a person's health can take, and asks for no
guarantees. All he wants now is a little warning, a legible
roadside sign that gives him enough lead time to brake.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Charlie is concerned, if I can't do this one little
thing for him, then what earthly good am I?
</P>
<P>
   He does not actually come right out and say this, but I can see
it in his face every time I tell him that no one has a clue, these
days, how long his pills will work and what his future holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you ain't saying,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I protest that I can't begin to guess, he rolls his eyes, and we
leave it that way for another month.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that I really cannot predict Charlie's survival,
any more than I can tell people with diabetes, heart disease or
emphysema when the jig will be up for them. Down the road for all
are new studies, new machines, new enzymes, new organs, new genes
and new drugs upon drugs, all with new side effects.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your chronic disease, you and your doctor are
bombarded by breaking news these days. Most of it will not mean
very much in the long run, but a small fraction will turn
everything we think we know about a disease on its ear. Only a
sorcerer could feel comfortable measuring out most patients' life
spans.
</P>
<P>
   When I tell this to Charlie, he snorts and gestures at the
medical books stacked on the desk. ``Nothing in there?'' he says
with heavy sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is less and less in there, a change that has not
escaped the watchdogs of medical history. A hundred years ago,
telling people their prognosis was a major part of medicine, with
foretelling the future, as per Hippocrates, just as important as
doing no harm.
</P>
<P>
   But as treatments became better, the art of precise prediction
began to fall by the wayside. In a 1997 article in Social Sciences
and Medicine, Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis at the University of
Chicago illustrated this phenomenon by analyzing the chapter on
pneumonia in successive editions of a single medical textbook.
</P>
<P>
   He found that after the turn of the century the discussion of
prognosis got shorter and shorter, until about 30 years ago it
finally vanished, replaced by more and more detail on diagnosis and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It is small wonder that doctors now tend to feel anxious and
uncomfortable when pressed to predict a patient's survival. They
admit on surveys that they are poorly trained for the task, dislike
doing it and avoid it whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, there is an increasing interest in
reviving these lost skills. Often, people still want to know how
long they have left, and, of course, cadres of insurers and health
care economists all want to know, too, because all health care
budgeting and resource allocation ultimately rest on the same
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   So the science of predicting survival marches on. Numerical
scoring systems have infiltrated many medical specialties: they let
surgeons predict the survival odds of burn and coma patients, and
critical-care specialists estimate a patient's chances of making it
out of intensive care alive.
</P>
<P>
   Systems for estimating the survival rate of cancer patients by
the stage of their tumor _ how big it is and how far it has spread
_ give oncologists numbers to work with, too.
</P>
<P>
   But when doctors try to use these numbers in conversations with
actual patients, all scientific clarity seems to vanish and chaos
and misunderstanding descend.
</P>
<P>
   Studies repeatedly show that even when they know exactly what
stage of cancer a patient has, oncologists will accurately predict
the patient's prognosis less than half the time. They tend to err
on the side of optimism, wildly overestimating how long their
patients will live and suggesting that wishful human thinking can
easily morph those rigorous survival curves.
</P>
<P>
   In other studies, doctors are right on target in estimating the
survival of their sick patients, and it is the patients who grossly
overestimate their own chances.
</P>
<P>
   Were the doctors not talking, or the patients not listening? The
transmitting and receiving errors seem to run in both directions.
Some doctors admit they convey to patients more optimism than they
actually feel, convinced that patients who think they are ``going
to beat this thing'' do better than those who realize their chances
are nil.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients, for their part, simply deflect unappealing
information away from themselves. The most graphic illustration of
this particular instinct is the repeatedly confirmed observation
that cigarette smokers who can recite the health risks of smoking
with complete accuracy always grossly underestimate their own
personal risks: an example of the ``I'm going to beat this thing''
school of thinking run amok.
</P>
<P>
   The whole area of predicting survival threatens to become
medicine's version of ``don't ask, don't tell,'' a jumble of unsaid
questions and subtly elided nonanswers desperately in need of some
philosophic coherence. If you fail to ask, should I assume you
still want to know? If you ask, should I tell? If I tell, will you
hear?
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it, when a patient like Charlie cuts
through the murk of innuendo and subtext with the clarity of a
laser _ ``Whaddya say, doc? You gonna tell me this month?'' _ then
he is someone there are no answers for.

MAINLAND CHINA ISSUES BLUNT WARNING ON TAIWAN'S FUTURE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Less than one month before presidential elections in
Taiwan, the Chinese government on Monday released the bluntest
warning yet that it will not wait indefinitely for the island to
reunite with the mainland, declaring that a prolonged lack of
negotiations, in itself, could provoke a military attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have long made it clear that any moves by Taiwan
toward formal independence would lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's White Paper adds _ for the first time in such a
definitive policy statement _ that if Taiwan refuses indefinitely
to pursue ``the peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification
through negotiations, then the Chinese government will only be
forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of
force, to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the China Council of Advanced
Policy Studies, a private group in Taipei, said: ``This is a signal
that Beijing is getting impatient with the delays in the process of
reunification.' This is a warning to the people of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese government officials said they would not comment until
they had studied the document and as of Monday night, the
candidates in the March 18 presidential elections had not
responded.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000-word White Paper, titled ``The One-China Principle
and the Taiwan Issue,'' was released by the Taiwan Affairs Office
and the Information Office of the State Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It elaborates on China's longstanding proposal for a negotiated
return of Taiwan under a version of the ``one-country, two
systems'' formula, with even greater autonomy than was given to
Hong Kong. That formula has been rejected as too confining by
Taiwan's leaders and by all three of the leading presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The dire warnings in the document were a reminder of what an
emotional issue the reunification of Taiwan with the ``motherland''
is for the Chinese _ and how potentially explosive the
confrontation across the Taiwan straits is, potentially drawing the
United States into war with China.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's document lambastes the United States for providing
advanced weapons to Taiwan, which China says violates earlier
promises, and for proposals in Congress for a closer military
relationship with the island, which it calls a ``gross interference
in China's internal affairs and a grave threat to China's
security.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States officially supports the concept of ``one
China,'' but is also committed to aiding Taiwan if it comes under
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The paper does not provide any timetable or deadline for
negotiating progress, but it bitterly condemns Taiwanese President
Lee Tung-hui for destroying previous talks with his assertion last
summer that Taiwan would only talk with China on a
``state-to-state'' basis and his refusal to repeat the customary
homage to the concept of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lee's statement last summer, China broke off planned
high-level meetings, charging that that Lee was secretly scheming
for independence even though he professes to support reunion at
some distant point _ after the mainland, too, has become a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The White Paper is filled with invective against Lee and
condemns the suggestion of waiting for democracy as ``an excuse for
postponing and resisting reunification,'' since China has offered
to allow different systems to coexist under the banner of one
China.
</P>
<P>
   It was too early to tell Monday night what effect China's sharp
words would have on Taiwan's election campaign. In 1996, prior to
Taiwan's first direct elections for president, China was angered by
Lee's defiant actions and statements and lobbed missiles near
Taiwan as a warning. The United States sent two aircraft carriers
into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Lee won election handily and seemed to gain popular appeal
through his brinksmanship, but in the ensuing years, many Taiwanese
who had toyed with the idea of declaring independence thought
better of it.
</P>
<P>
   China lacks the military power to invade Taiwan, analysts say,
and is no match for American forces should they be drawn into a
confrontation. But China is steadily improving its navy and is
building up forces of ballistic and cruise missiles that could
cripple Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, this election campaign has involved fewer military
tensions and in Taiwan, the candidates have gone out of their way
to avoid sounding provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that a large majority of the Taiwan public, after
enjoying years of prosperity and democracy, does not want a
military confrontation with China.
</P>
<P>
   All three major candidates _ Vice President Lien Chan of the
governing Nationalist Party, James Soong, a former Nationalist
leader who is running as an independent, and Chen Shui-bian, of the
Democratic Progressive Party _ have made vague pledges to resume
negotiations of some sort with China and to encourage more trade
and business links.
</P>
<P>
   But not one endorses China's vision of reunification and exactly
what the two sides can talk about in future negotiations, giving
China the impression of progress toward unity, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts think that Monday's Chinese warning may
be intended, in part, to scare voters away from Chen, whose party
has long been associated with Taiwanese independence. The founding
charter of the DPP calls for a referendum on whether the island _
still named the Republic of China as it was when Nationalists led
by Chiang Kai-shek fled there in 1949 _ should be renamed the
Republic of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, seeking to broaden his electoral appeal, has declared that
since Taiwan is already independent in practice, it does not need a
formal declaration and that if elected, he would not pursue a
referendum on the issue unless Taiwan came under attack. At the
same time, he has offered to discuss enhancing communications and
economic ties, something the mainland badly wants. The Chinese
White Paper unequivocally rejects the legitimacy of any popular
referendum in Taiwan on the question of independence, warning:
``Any attempt to separate Taiwan from China through so-called
referendum would only lead the Taiwan people to disaster.''

   SCI-QUANTUM-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Appalled by the weird
implications of quantum mechanics, the rules that explain the
workings of the tiny particles that make up the universe, Albert
Einstein used to stroll the streets of Princeton wondering why the
moon wasn't smeared all over the sky. After all, the moon is made
of these particles, and quantum theory holds that until it is
observed, a particle doesn't have a definite position. It remains
suspended in a mathematical limbo: a state of pure potentiality
consisting of all the possible positions it could conceivably
occupy. Einstein had come face to face with the fundamental paradox
of quantum mechanics: why the laws that apply so precisely to the
subatomic realm do not appear to carry over into the domain of
everyday things. Some physicists believe they are coming closer to
an answer with a phenomenon called decoherence, in which the
particles themselves constantly ``observe'' one another,
eliminating the quantum fuzziness and yielding the familiar world
of solid objects. In recent weeks this theoretical notion received
what might be its strongest support yet. Experimenters at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo.,
observed decoherence in action. They used laser beams to gently
manipulate an atom, essentially putting it in two places at once.
Then they measured the breakdown of this perplexing state of

   SCI-COMPETING-SPERM (Undated) _ In the battle of the sexes,

conflict with the first, which govern love and desire and the
delicate games men and women play with one another. If these other
rules, the ones built into human nature, could be specified, they
would not tell what is right _ that is the province of the first
set of rules _ but they would help understanding of how human
sexual and social behavior have evolved. Primatologists, who study
the group of mammals that includes monkeys, apes and people, have
developed some surprising ideas about the nature of the human
mating system, suggesting that women may not be as faithful as
their mates may suppose. And some biologists think that the deceits
of the mating game may even be reflected in the hapless
spermatozoon. By Nicholas Wade.

DANGEROUS HICCUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Can hiccups kill you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ordinary hiccups, resulting from things like overeating and
stress, are usually benign. But hiccups can indicate a serious
problem, and a prolonged, uncontrollable bout may lead to
debilitating consequences like fatigue, weight loss, depression,
problems with heart rhythm, esophageal reflux and possibly
exhaustion and death in a weakened patient.
</P>
<P>
   In a famous case, Pope Pius XII had long periods of hiccups,
associated with gastritis, though he eventually died of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A hiccup is a spasm of the diaphragm, the sheet of muscle that
controls breathing, accompanied by a sudden intake of breath and
the closing of the epiglottis, the bit of tissue at the back of the
throat that can close the airway.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying cause of troublesome hiccups should be
investigated. For example, the complicated nervous pathways
involved in hiccups can be affected by diseases like multiple
sclerosis; in such cases, and for other serious hiccups, muscle
relaxants are often prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Other causes include gastrointestinal problems like obstruction
or inflammation; complications of AIDS or side effects of its
treatment; nervous system tumors; encephalitis and meningitis;
alcoholism, and problems with many medications. &QL;

HOW SMALL TOWNS IN TEXAS DEAL WITH HEALTH CARE

   CLARENDON, Texas _ There's no shortage of rugged pioneer
traditions in this town of 2,067, among the oldest communities in
the Panhandle. Founded as a liquor-free ``Christian colony'' in
1878, it was so overtly pious that wags dubbed it ``Saints'
Roost.''
</P>
<P>
   An immense brick Methodist church and a new campus for the
102-year-old Clarendon College bear testament to a rich past but
can't make up for the lack of a hospital, a movie theater, a mall
or even a shoe store. For several years, there was no doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months ago, Clarendon and the rest of Donley County got
their own general practice physician, and he's no ordinary man of
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Howard, 46, is a former naval flight surgeon with jet
flight training who stands 6-foot-5 and holds degrees in law and
medicine from Tulane University.
</P>
<P>
   His move from Corpus Christi to the country has meant lower
earnings. But Howard said he still enjoys a good income, and he and
his wife purchased a 4,000-square-foot home, which they could not
have afforded in the city. Then, citing church involvement,
Clarendon's low crime rate and strong community spirit, Howard
said: ``My standard of living has risen dramatically by anything
that matters in this life.''
</P>
<P>
   Few doctors see small-town medicine in that light.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five Texas counties are without a physician; 13 others
have just one. Two rural hospitals have closed in the past year,
and many others hang on from week to week, according to the Center
for Rural Health Initiatives, a state agency. Last year, Texas
suffered a net loss of 44 small-town health clinics. And more than
250,000 rural Texans eligible for benefits have no Medicare HMO in
their counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, rural Texans are worse off in their access to health
care than they were two years ago,'' said Sam Tessen, executive
director of the rural health center. He blamed reduced funding
brought about by the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which
cost some clinics as much as $20 per patient visit.
</P>
<P>
   To attract medical staff members, some small towns are
advertising generous salaries and start-up bonuses. Others try to
recruit doctors while they are still in medical school with offers
of hefty scholarships or future help in repaying loans. Similar
incentives are being offered to physician's assistants and nurse
practitioners, all with equally poor results, public health
officials and hospital administrators say.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the 15-bed hospital in Morton, a town of 2,600
located 57 miles west of Lubbock, has been offering a $150,000
salary plus $30,000 toward medical school loans as incentives for a
second doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult,'' said Paul McKinney, administrator of
Morton's Cochran Memorial County Hospital. ``First of all, we're
such a small community and it's not exactly the garden spot of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inundated with calls from foreign medical students who
want to stay after their schooling,'' McKinney said. ``The trouble
is getting the right one that the community will accept and who
will stay three or four years. They say they will stay, but most
just want to meet their obligation for a (permanent resident
status) green card by working in a medically underserved area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they leave,'' he said. ``I can't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   The professional isolation, lack of big-city amenities and
resistance to country living from spouses combine to make
recruitment and retention a never-ending challenge, many small-town
leaders say. Surprisingly, income is rarely the issue. Nationally,
the median income of rural family physicians is slightly higher
than that of their urban counterparts: $127,000, compared with
$126,000, according to a May 1998 survey by the American Academy of
Family Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Being on his own doesn't faze Howard, who cites his experience
as a Navy flight surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a place where I'd be the only doctor in
town,'' said Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an hour away from the nearest hospital (in Amarillo), an
hour away from a lot of colleagues,'' he said. ``Being alone is not
scary, but it would be nice to have some professional
interchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight miles to the southeast is Memphis, a
cotton-producing town that once boasted 14 physicians, including
one who dispensed 50-cent prescriptions for pints of ``medicinal
whiskey'' during Prohibition, recalled Dr. Robert Clark Jr. ``And
it was good whiskey.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1930s, Hall County, of which Memphis is the county
seat, has lost 76 percent of its population _ from 17,000 to 4,000.
And Memphis, which has dropped from 4,000 residents to 2,465, has
just two doctors, Clark, 70, and his 46-year-old son, Robert Clark
III, who moved back to Memphis last year. The younger Clark had to
give up surgery because the local hospital no longer has an
operating room. Neither father nor son delivers babies, so pregnant
mothers must travel to Amarillo, 80 miles to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital has recruited a third doctor, a Romanian-born
internist in Cleveland, Ohio, who will arrive this summer _ if the
struggling facility is still there.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day at noon, a half-dozen men in cowboy hats and
plaid shirts spilled out of a packed meeting on saving the town's
hospital, which is bleeding red to the tune of $300,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone knew Bill Gates, we could solve the problem like
this,'' retired pharmacist Dick Fowler said, snapping his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Memphis knows the billionaire Microsoft chairman. But
they do know the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis has been through this before.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, the town raised $330,000 to save Hall County
Hospital the first time. A hand-drawn sign urging donations from
passing motorists on U.S. 287 wound up in ``Time'' magazine. One
trucker handed over his entire paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   John Boff, chief executive of the Austin-based Texas
Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals, said Medicare and
Medicaid cutbacks, compounded by a managed-care system that directs
patients out of their communities, are to blame for the squeeze on
small-town medicine.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``If you close a hospital that serves 5,000, there are going to
be lives lost,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Having a doctor has been a concern from the start in Clarendon.
An early settler, famed cattleman Charles Goodnight, offered an
annual subsidy of $1,500 _ worth $30,000 in today's dollars _ to
recruit its first physician, Jerome Stocking.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, Clarendon got a new hospital but couldn't
find a doctor to staff it permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``One stayed a week, another two weeks, and a third a month,''
recalled Delbert Robertson, an undertaker who served as hospital
district president. ``One doctor stayed a year as medical director
before moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarendon closed the hospital and reopened it as a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   When the town's sole general practitioner retired several years
ago, Amarillo's Baptist St. Anthony's Health System put a
physician's assistant into its tiny clinic. Then that person
decided to leave. It had been in the red for five years, said Ron
Rives, a system vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Baptist St. Anthony's tried to recruit Howard years earlier for
its Clarendon clinic, but he took a job in Corpus Christi. Then he
and his wife decided to rear their children in the country and
learned that Clarendon still needed a doctor. The Georgia-born
physician came.
</P>
<P>
   Patients began returning, and the clinic turned profitable for
the first time, Rives said. Although the Amarillo hospital system
agreed to sell the clinic to Howard after a year, it talked about
helping the county build a new, larger clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``BSA said they'd help us do bricks and mortar, that they were
in it for the long haul,'' recalled A.L. Graham, administrator of
the Donley County Hospital District.
</P>
<P>
   But just a few weeks later, in September, Baptist St. Anthony's
did an about-face and said it would pull out after all on Jan. 1.
Graham said he wasn't surprised: ``I was more concerned about how
to retain the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The move left Howard's fledgling practice in a precarious
situation. He had only a few months to get federal certification
for Medicare and Medicaid, usually a drawn-out process.
</P>
<P>
   Howard took over the clinic with the help of a $15,000 grant
from the local economic development council. A $25,000 matching
grant from the hospital district and Center for Rural Health
Initiatives helped with startup costs. More important, the
community has embraced his practice, and the certification came
through quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's made it successful in Clarendon was having a doctor
willing to work hard and patients willing to see him,'' Rives said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient load has doubled to more than 40 a day, and Howard
is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing medicine in a small West Texas town presents
challenges not encountered by urban doctors.
</P>
<P>
   When an 82-year-old rancher was told he needed to go to Amarillo
so a heart surgeon could insert a pacemaker, the man refused,
saying, ``Who'll take care of my cows?''
</P>
<P>
   A part-time nurse-tech with a ranching background assured Howard
that he'd look after the herd, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Dr. Howard, my husband wouldn't have gone to
Amarillo,'' said the rancher's wife, Ola Stone, 85, who stopped by
recently for a check on her own kidney condition.
</P>
<P>
   Medical issues ran the gamut on a recent day.
</P>
<P>
   A young Clarendon woman came home from Texas Tech for treatment
after the campus health clinic in Lubbock gave her nothing for a
stubborn head cold. The basketaball coach from the local junior
college came in complaining of chest congestion, and a rural mail
carrier sought treatment for hip pain. There was no shortage of flu
cases and X-rays for possibly broken bones. Babies in their
mothers' arms arrived for vaccinations. Assorted residents got
their regular allergy shot or were treated for chronic conditions,
ranging from diabetes to high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   One woman had swollen legs; several children had ear infections.
And there are always dislocated shoulders from run-ins with steers.
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven's ``Eroica'' symphony wafted from his office as the
tall doctor bent low to examine where a plantar wart had been
removed from a small girl's foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what your son got on his math test,'' the blue-eyed
girl squealed.
</P>
<P>
   Clarendon is a very small town.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's wife, Lori, says she initially took her children on
regular runs to Amarillo for their favorite fast-food and mall
shopping. Once a real estate appraiser, she helps her husband with
insurance forms and appointments until 3 p.m. when their two
children show up from school and she's relieved by a part-time
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Like their mother, they say they prefer the country.
</P>
<P>
   And such attitudes, said Tessen of the Center for Rural Health
Initiatives, is the key to retaining medical professionals. He also
cited a study showing that communities have the best chance of
keeping a doctor if the physician or the physician's spouse has a
small-town background. And communities have to rally behind the
incoming doctor, Tessen added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my whole mission _ keeping Dr. Howard happy,'' Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Howards bought a comfortable house on the town's outskirts,
and although the doctor could make considerably more in Corpus
Christi, he emphasized, ``I am not living in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God placed me here,'' the country doctor said in a
quiet, almost embarrassed tone. ``My life up to his point prepared
me for this. In a different time in my life, I might not have been
ready to live in a town like Clarendon.''

THE BASE TENOR OF `SOPRANOS' TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 27)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a  &UR; goomah &LR; , and how does it differ from a  &UR; goombah &LR; ? Is
the adjective  &UR; skeevy &LR;  somehow related to the slang noun for
underwear,  &UR; skivvies &LR; ? Does the  &UR; come-heavy &LR;  Mafia talk on
television give you  &UR; agita &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   These are words from the HBO television series ``The Sopranos,''
which I first turned to hoping to hear a rendition of the mad scene
in ``Lucia di Lammermoor.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is centered on a relentlessly foulmouthed fictional
Mafia family with the surname of Soprano. My interest is in the
writers' adoption of a lexicon that is loosely based on Italian
words, a little real Mafia slang and a smattering of lingo
remembered or made up for the show by former residents of a
blue-collar neighborhood in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Goombah &LR;  is derived from  &UR; compare &LR; , `godfather' or `dear male
friend,''' says Frank Renzulli, co-executive producer and a writer
of the show. ``Southern Italians tend to make the  &UR; c &LR;  a  &UR; g &LR; , so
 &UR; compare &LR;  becomes  &UR; gompare &LR; . Dropping the last letter is very
Neapolitan, so it becomes  &UR; goompar &LR;  and then  &UR; goombah &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Green, another executive producer (it's hard to figure
from the titles who is the show's  &UR; capo di tutti capi &LR; ), contrasts
the ``godfather'' meaning of that word with  &UR; goomah &LR; , which she
defines as ``mistress.'' She adds, ``The language we're using is
from the neighborhood, a street language that's bastardized Italian
_ American forms of Italian words.''
</P>
<P>
   I ran  &UR; goomah &LR;  past Jimmy Breslin, the Newsday columnist who
wrote ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight,'' and he confirms
the ``alternative wife'' sense. While I had him on the phone, I
tried  &UR; come heavy &LR; , which Jimmy defined as either ``bring money''
or ``come armed''; the show's legion of executive producers prefer
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Agita &LR;  means ``acid indigestion.'' In that regard,  &UR; skeevy &LR; 
comes from  &UR; schifare &LR; , to disgust. The name of the mob leader's
boat is  &UR; Stugots &LR; , which Entertainment Weekly defined as ``idiot,''
but which has a meaning closer to the Spanish  &UR; cojones &LR; , ``the
courage symbolized by primary male sex characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   That should be enough to get you through a couple of episodes,
unless the other endless, unoriginal obscenities get you down.
HBO's parent company, Time Warner, had a useful glossary of what
the executive producers call their  &UR; mobspeak &LR;  on its Web site, but
the understandably offended National Italian American Foundation
all but  &UR; mock-whacked &LR;  the corporate brass who _ suddenly afflicted
with  &UR; agita &LR;  _ removed the offensive page.
</P>
<P>
   SWITCHEROO
</P>
<P>
   During the war of commercial spots between George W. Bush and
John McCain, Bush quoted The Wall Street Journal, saying McCain's
campaign was ``crawling with lobbyists,'' and McCain slammed back
with a charge that the Bush spot ``twists the truth like Clinton.''
When the McCain manager offered to call a truce, Bush reportedly
replied, ``It's the old game of  &UR; switch-and-bait &LR; : say one thing
and do another.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of the old game, as Bush quickly realized, is the
reverse:  &UR; bait-and-switch &LR; . In this dodge, an advertiser entices a
customer into the store with a low price on an attractive item, but
then says, ``We're out of it,'' and tries to sell a higher-priced
item.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a product or service is advertised at a price that seems
too good to be true,'' advises the Better Business Bureau of Los
Angeles, ``this may be a `bait' ad. Then, if the merchant refuses
to show you the advertised item, to take orders for it or to
deliver it within a reasonable time ... take this as a sign you are
being `switched.''' The point to remember in applying it
metaphorically in politics is that the  &UR; bait &LR;  always comes first.
Then comes the  &UR; switch &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been criticized for his overuse of alliteration. As
William Kristol noted on MSNBC's ``Hardball'' program,
``compassionate conservatism'' was followed by ``prosperity with a
purpose'' and then by ``a reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   But to me, alliteration always attracts. My favorite was the
unforgettable 1920 passage by Warren G. Harding, promising ``not
heroics but healing, not nostrums but normalcy, not revolution but
restoration, not agitation but adjustment, not surgery but
serenity, not the dramatic but the dispassionate, not experiment
but equipoise.''
</P>
<P>
   FAREWELL, MY LOVELY MISS/MS./MRS.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, reflecting the desire of the great
majority of its newspaper members, has just dropped the use of the
courtesy titles  &UR; Miss &LR; ,  &UR; Mrs. &LR;  and  &UR; Ms. &LR;  in its news reports.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the first reference to Emily Jones is her full
name, and the second reference is merely Jones, the same way men
are treated. Gee; after all the battling years ago in this space to
get The New York Times to adopt  &UR; Ms. &LR; , out it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Not completely; The Times, in the main news sections, will
continue to use courtesy titles on second reference for both men
and women. But, according to the stylebook, ``The Times Magazine
and the Book Review, edited in the more literary style of a weekend
periodical, omit all courtesy titles.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it all has to do with the appearance of sexual
equality. If you don't use the  &UR; Mr. &LR;  instead of repeating the first
name for men, equality demands the same treatment for women. And
who would be so boldly old-fashioned and out of joint as to stand
up for any form of inequality?
</P>
<P>
   Here goes. It's not such a hot idea, because it needlessly
conceals information useful to the reader _ specifically, the sex
of the person being written about.
</P>
<P>
   I could understand the change if first names reflected sex as in
olden times: ``Emily Jones today was appointed commandant of the
Marine Corps. Jones, who is 19, said ....'' In that article, the
reader knows that a woman was appointed and needs no courtesy title
in front of the second reference unless interested in the
commandant's marital status, which the reader knows is none of his
or her business, and do you have a problem with that?
</P>
<P>
   The problem I have with that is that you can no longer tell the
boys from the girls by their given names. A lineup of Alex, Chris,
Pat, Brett, Ashley, Cameron, Meredith, Adrian and Leslie could be a
bearded baseball team or a Miss America pageant (soon to be the
America pageant, skip the honorific).
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story: ``Cameron Jones today bench-pressed 300 pounds
in the Olympic trials. Jones, not even out of breath, said ....''
Is that a normal weight lifter's story, or a breakthrough for the
human spirit? How does an editor know, from the copy, whether to
bury it or call for a picture to be emblazoned across the front
page?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the new AP rule is a space saver and will boost
journalism's profits. It doesn't strike me as helpful to the
reader, and in my nonliterary style I will resolutely continue to
use the  &UR; Ms. &LR;  I fought for, but sometimes I feel as lonely as the
guy who played the harp in Phil Spitalny's All-Girl Orchestra.

SOMETIMES, THE IN-CROWD TURNS UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By SUSAN GILBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many other schoolchildren, Claire and Stuart Bullen of
Walnut Creek, Calif., have looked in awe at the people in the
in-crowd and wondered, how do they do it? What is so special about
them? But unlike many of their peers, Claire, 11, and Stuart, 8, do
not aspire to be in that social tier: they think being popular
means being unkind, making friends and then discarding them.
</P>
<P>
   This view may seem harsh, but several social scientists say it
may not be totally off base. Researchers are just beginning to
study the dynamics of popular students in elementary and middle
school, and some early findings show that while most popular
children are model students _ friendly, bright, athletic and
cooperative _ a significant minority can be cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some popular boys are extremely aggressive, intimidating and
mean,'' said Dr. Philip C. Rodkin, a psychologist at Duke, whose
study of popularity among elementary-age boys appeared last month
in the journal Developmental Psychology. ``I think a lot of them
are bullies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many popular girls are also highly aggressive, bullying
unpopular girls with snubs and gossip to maintain their high
status, according to research by a husband-and-wife team of
sociologists, Dr. Patricia Adler of the University of Colorado and
Dr. Peter Adler of the University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But in preliminary unpublished research, Rodkin found
aggressiveness more common in boys than girls. He and his
colleagues looked at characteristics of 452 boys in fourth, fifth
and sixth grades at schools in North Carolina and Chicago. They
asked the teachers to rank each child by popularity and by other
traits like athletic competence, friendliness and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the students were asked to identify three peers who
they thought best embodied certain traits, like ``cooperative,''
``disruptive,'' ``starts fights,'' ``leader,'' ``athletic,'' ``gets
in trouble'' and ``cool.'' The students could also place themselves
in any of these categories. Finally, the children were asked to
name groups of classmates who frequently were seen together.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers and students tended to agree on who was in and who
was out and on the traits of the boys in the class. Based on that,
the researchers concluded that most of the popular boys had
qualities generally considered socially positive, like being
friendly, cooperative and athletic.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 percent of the most popular boys had a combination of
some positive qualities and others that the researchers termed
antisocial. In addition to being athletic, they often got into
fights with classmates and were disruptive in class.
</P>
<P>
   Other behavioral scientists praised the study for being among
the first to look at popularity in preadolescents in great detail.
But they said that it was no surprise that the highly popular boys
often behaved badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It supports things that a number of us have said for a while,
that boys look up to other boys who are aggressive,'' said Dr.
William Pollack, author of a best-selling book, ``Real Boys''
(Random House, 1998), and co-director of the Center for Men at
McLean Hospital in Boston, which studies male behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Thompson, a clinical psychologist and co-author of
another best seller on boys, ``Raising Cain'' (Ballantine, 1999),
said that besides being aggressive, misbehaving helped boys gain
respect from peers. ``Taking on the teacher is considered brave for
boys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some researchers disagreed with the use of the term
antisocial to describe the disruptive boys. ``These boys were
highly social,'' said Dr. Patricia Adler. ``Being tough,
conquering, showing off _ these are exactly the same behaviors that
dominant male animals in herds engage in.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said that in common parlance, people were considered
antisocial when they misbehaved, but that the clinical diagnosis
was reserved for those who cared little for other people's
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Though many boys in the study fit the popular definition of
antisocial, he said, there was no way to know which ones fit the
clinical definition because the study did not investigate emotions.
He said he believed that many boys were highly social since they
behaved in ways considered masculine by society. ``We inculcate
boys to act tough, then we are surprised when they bully and harass
people,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   In their book ``Peer Power'' (Rutgers University Press, 1998), a
sociological study of their own children's classmates, the Adlers
said that most of the popular girls were high academic achievers,
whereas for boys there was a stigma to being seen as studious or,
worse, a teacher's pet.
</P>
<P>
   The Adlers also reported that being attractive and having good
clothes was important for girls' popularity but relatively
unimportant for that of boys. They found that athletic ability
elevated the status of boys and girls, but, like Rodkin, they
observed that boys who were athletic, and sometimes cruel, were
held in especially high esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has shown that aggressive behavior can be a
factor in social problems like substance abuse and school failure,
and Rodkin said that many children at high risk might be overlooked
if they were popular, with prevention programs focused mainly on
unpopular children.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have a more positive view. ``The popular,
aggressive children in the Rodkin study had few other social
problems,'' said Dr. Lewis Lewin, a psychologist at the Oregon
Social Learning Center, a research group. Lewin has studied what
happens to aggressive boys as they age.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some evidence that aggression accompanied by other
problems, such as withdrawal and shyness, is a stronger predictor
of antisocial outcomes than any single factor,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said most boys could resist temptations to be bad, if
they were shown other ways to be masculine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not get carried away and say that boys only like
negative leaders,'' he said. ``Seventy percent of the boys in the
study who were popular were model children, win-win social leaders.
There's a hunger in boys for positive leadership and also for this
other scary, negative leadership.''

   When Zora Brown got word that her pregnant, 29-year-old niece,
Lea, had breast cancer, she decided it was high time for a serious
family meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer had cut a swath through Brown's family for four
generations, striking all three of her sisters, her mother,
grandmother, great-grandmother, three great-aunts and Brown
herself. Now it appeared that the next generation, too, was under
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bullets coming toward us from every direction,'' said
Brown, 50, the founder of the Breast Cancer Resource Committee in
Washington, which offers black women education and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Brown invited Lea and 11 other adult nieces to a family retreat
in December 1998. She brought along a geneticist and an oncologist,
had her nieces record the dates of their last mammograms and breast
self-examinations and made them pledge to be vigilant about their
health care.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, Lea died. Last month, another niece found a
lump in her breast.
</P>
<P>
   Zora Brown's family may well have a particular predisposition
toward breast cancer. But she worries that black women in general
are facing a more aggressive form of the disease, a concern echoed
by many other African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fear that there is a black breast cancer and that
nobody is doing anything about it,'' said Ngina Lythcott, 54,
associate dean of the Columbia University School of Public Health
and an 11-year survivor of breast cancer. ``When black women get
together and talk about their tremendous fear of getting breast
cancer, the fear is that it's a disease that's different from other
breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Several facts underlie those fears.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of unprecedented advances, when overall death rates
from breast cancer are declining, black women are 12 percent less
likely than white women to get breast cancer, but far more likely,
once they contract the disease, to die from it.
</P>
<P>
   Among women with breast cancer, African-Americans are 50 percent
more likely than whites to get the disease before the age of 35,
when tumors are more aggressive. They are also 50 percent more
likely to die of breast cancer before they turn 50. And they are
twice as likely to receive the diagnosis at an advanced stage, when
the cancer has spread and is more difficult to cure.
</P>
<P>
   The racial mortality gap, meanwhile, is widening. A National
Cancer Institute study reported in November that a black woman's
risk of dying from breast cancer, which was slightly lower than a
white woman's in 1980, was 16 percent greater in 1990. By 1995,
that gap had jumped to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, using the same data but a different measuring
gauge, puts the mortality gap wider still. Dr. Sue A. Joslyn, an
epidemiologist at the University of Northern Iowa, found that black
women with breast cancer were 67 percent more likely than whites to
die of their illness. Race, she said, ``is a strong predictor for
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why these differences are emerging. But National
Cancer Institute researchers, who called attention to the mortality
gap in their study, caution that skin color probably has little to
do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gap didn't exist 25 years ago,'' said Dr. Otis W.
Brawley, an oncologist and epidemiologist, who is director of the
cancer institute's Office of Special Populations Research. ``And
the genetics of black folks didn't change in the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brawley, a co-author of the institute's study, believes that
race masks the real culprits: poverty, diet and inadequate health
care. Poor white women, too, he notes, are more likely than wealthy
white women to get the diagnosis when their cancers are advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody argues that poor white women are genetically
different from rich white women,'' Brawley said. ``A lot of these
problems are related to being poor, and being black may be a
surrogate for being poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some disparities may arise from differences in tumor
biology. Federal studies have shown that black women are more
likely than whites to have aggressive tumors that grow without the
help of estrogen, meaning that estrogen blockers like tamoxifen are
less effective in combating them.
</P>
<P>
   Tumors that are ``estrogen-receptor positive,'' latching onto
estrogen and feeding off it, can be fooled into latching onto
look-alike tamoxifen instead, and starved. From 60 percent to 70
percent of estrogen-receptor positive women benefit from tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are ``estrogen-receptor negative,'' meaning they have
far fewer estrogen receptors, have tumors that do not need to feed
off estrogen and, for reasons that are still unknown, grow more
rapidly. Only 15 percent to 20 percent of these women benefit from
tamoxifen. And blacks with breast cancer are twice as likely as
whites to have a form of the disease that is estrogen-receptor
negative.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and public health researchers are looking at every
piece of the puzzle, including increasing the use of mammography
and understanding the mechanisms that bring about tumor growth. But
each new study raises more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection is only part of the problem. Increasingly, black
women are just as likely as whites to have received mammograms. But
researchers suspect that they are not getting them regularly, and,
perhaps most important, are not receiving follow-up care after
suspicious ones.
</P>
<P>
   A recent federal study found that a black woman is less likely
to have an abnormal finding evaluated than a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   And once the disease is diagnosed, African-American women are
more likely than whites to get inadequate care for their breast
cancers, a National Cancer Institute study shows. Fewer are given
the proper surgical treatment and the appropriate level of
chemotherapy or radiation after surgery, Brawley said.
</P>
<P>
   When African-Americans get equal access to health care, their
survival rate can approximate that of whites. One long-term survey
monitored the survival rate of women who received similar care for
their breast cancers in Hyde Park, an affluent, integrated
community in Chicago. From 1946 to 1987, the 20-year survival rate
did not differ by race for women receiving a diagnosis at the same
stage of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a 1997 study, published in Cancer, the journal of the
American Cancer Society, found that African-American women treated
for breast cancer at United States military hospitals, where equal
medical access is mandated, had a 41 percent greater risk of death
than their white counterparts receiving the same care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Barbara E. Wojcik, an Army statistician and
co-author of the study, early screening may play a role. In a small
follow-up study, she found that, compared with whites and
Hispanics, a smaller percentage of the black women had received
diagnoses of breast cancer through mammography. Among those whose
breast cancers were detected by mammograms, there were no
differences in survival rates.
</P>
<P>
   Diet and body weight may also play a role. Most of the women in
the military study were civilian spouses, not subject to the Army's
physical requirements. On average, Brawley said, black women are
heavier and have denser breast tissue than whites, increasing both
their chances of breast cancer and the difficulty of detecting it
on a mammogram. Overweight white women also appear to have a higher
incidence of breast cancer than white women of normal weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, when it's all said and done, much of the problem will
relate to body fat and diet,'' Brawley said. ``I'm black, and I can
tell you that even though I'm middle class, the diets in my family
are radically different than my white colleagues. We eat more fried
foods, more fattening foods and eat fewer vegetables. So maybe
being black is a surrogate for being overweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathy Helzlsouer, an oncologist and epidemiologist at the
Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said that was not the whole
story. ``Weight becomes a risk factor only after menopause,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the black breast cancer debate is the sticky issue
of cultural habits, including a seeming resistance among some
blacks to seek medical care even when told they need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this in my own family,'' Brawley said. The myth, he
said, is that ``if it's cancer and they cut on me, they will spread
it.'`
</P>
<P>
   A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association found that blacks, more than whites, believed that
praying, not worrying and not having surgery were among the best
ways to deal with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings make Zora Brown angry. ``Sometimes we hear
stories that African-American women don't go to the doctor because
of their religion,'' she said. ``Well, that's bunk. I don't know
anyone who is more spiritual and religious than my mother, but she
always cautioned us to go to the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some health advocates believe that black women may need a higher
standard of care, including earlier mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, doctors dislike performing mammograms on younger
women because their breast tissue is denser, making the tests
harder to interpret. The National Cancer Institute and the American
Cancer Society recommend starting at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Medical Association, the black medical group,
now recommends that African-American women start getting mammograms
at 35; some black doctors recommend even sooner, at 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Black Caucus has jumped into the debate,
urging the federal government to pay for research into why cancer
appears to affect poor people and minorities disproportionately.
The National Cancer Institute spends about 3 percent of its budget,
or $76.6 million a year, specifically addressing that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do very focused research on African-American women
and breast cancer,'' Brown said. ``African-American women are ready
and willing to be part of research studies.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute is already studying why black women are getting
the disease so young and why their tumors tend to grow independent
of estrogen. But Brawley is wary of pursuing racial theories to
solve the breast cancer mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Race in itself ``is not a biologic category,'' Brawley said.
Concentrations of genetic mutations have more to do with family and
intermarriage patterns that often overlap with race, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brawley worries that speculation about racial difference could
lead scientists back to the days of ``race medicine,'' when blacks
were considered distinct from whites, and doctors treated their
ailments differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that 100 years ago, there were
veterinarians for dogs, allopaths for white people and race
medicine specialists for black people,'' Brawley said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, focusing on genetics distracts researchers
from identifying risk factors that can be changed, perhaps creating
a paralyzing fear among black women that can stop them from taking
protective steps. Lythcott at Columbia agrees that fatalism was a
problem. But like Brown, she also believes the issue of race and
breast cancer should be addressed squarely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be valuable to determine, once and for all, if there
is a black breast cancer,'' Lythcott said. ``I wouldn't want to let
people die simply because we haven't proven it.''

NURSE PROVIDES CARE BY USING TELEMEDICINE

<P>
   HART, Texas _ There's no doctor, no hospital, no clinic in this
farming community of 1,221, where grain elevators reach for the
sky. The nearest hospital is 35 miles away and the only available
health care is at school.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Retta Knox, who cares for the 450 students at Hart
Elementary School and Hart Junior-Senior High, is not your typical
school nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Using grant money, Knox has arranged to have a pediatrician
visit from the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center every
Wednesday and a ``telemedicine'' satellite link with another Tech
doctor each Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursdays, the dentist calls, and twice a week, there's a
dental hygienist. Then there's the social worker and once-a-week
psychotherapist running an ``abstinence'' program to curb teen-age
pregnancies. Knox provides space every other Tuesday to the Texas
Department of Health's WIC program for women, infants and children.
A converted broom closet serves as a pharmacy _ the only place in
Hart with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Monday, Knox worked alone and treated more than 60
children with strep throats, assorted viruses and infected ears.
</P>
<P>
   A tall woman of 51 with white hair, Knox has treated three
generations of students since 1972. She is adept at spotting and
stretching grant money. The Hart native also knows which parents
have used clothing to donate and which Lions Club member can
arrange eyeglasses for a needy student.
</P>
<P>
   Her clinic, across the parking lot from the schools, combines
her old office and a former Head Start classroom; the dental clinic
took over a tiny administration building. Both use refurbished
equipment, Army surplus and castoffs from retiring doctors in other
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went out lookin','' Knox said of her scavenging
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The whole undertaking began in 1992 when a friend noticed a
$75,000 state grant that would cover startup costs for an in-school
clinic, saying, ``This looks like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the clinic is funded to care for children who are
not covered by Medicaid but are too poor to otherwise afford
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought many of the parents didn't care. The kids
were always sick and missed lots of school,'' Knox said. ``But once
I started the clinic and mothers realized they could get low-cost
or free care, the health of the whole family changed. These people
were struggling to feed their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the in-school clinic covers the basics and more. The ties to
Texas Tech have led to rapid care for a third-grader's ruptured
appendix and a diagnosis of diabetes for a young teen who couldn't
maintain his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working 10 times harder as I did as a traditional school
nurse,'' she said. Asked why she has taken the program on, Knox
didn't hesitate to reply: ``The kids. The kids. You can do so much
more for the kids. It's a real nice feeling you are making a
difference in their lives.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barometric readings will be near 30.70 inches of mercury over
Maine on Tuesday morning, but instead of a dome of cold, dry air
covering the East, a milder air flow from the southwest should
dominate the country from the Plains to the Appalachians. A
retreating jet stream will also draw up patches of moist air above
10,000 feet resulting in varying amounts of clouds in most sections
west of the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Seaboard will be bright and noticeably milder after
a chilly dawn. A push of warmer air into New England will be marked
by some clouds over the interior. Strengthening onshore winds in
Florida will combine with a disturbance moving through the Bahamas
to bring coastal clouds and perhaps a shower to the northern
sections.
</P>
<P>
   The storm that drenched southern California on Monday will
emerge as a weaker disturbance in New Mexico on Tuesday. However, a
corridor of humid air streaming north from the western Gulf of
Mexico will set the stage for an outbreak of strong to perhaps
severe thunderstorms later Tuesday in west-central Texas and
Oklahoma. Showers will dampen a wider region of the eastern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm air will cover the Mississippi Valley and
Great Lakes promoting rapid snow melt in northern sections. Cool,
moist winds will ascend the west slopes of the Rockies causing
showers.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful front will push into the Northwest with gusty winds
and heavy rain at the coast from southern Washington to central
California. Showers will spread inland later on.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Eastern Avalanches
</P>
<P>
   Two lives were lost in freakish avalanches in the northern
Appalachians this past weekend. On Saturday, a skier was smothered
by snow at Lake Placid, N.Y., and another skier lost his life
Sunday on Mount Washington, N.H.. Last week was a snowy time for
this region, with two major snowfalls, and the vast majority of
avalanches occur within 24 hours after a snowstorm. Avalanches
usually form when either a cornice of snow breaks loose from the
edge of a mountain or a slab of snow slides off an existing snow
cover. It appears that the eastern avalanches were of the slab
type.

   WASHINGTON _ Arizona Sen. John McCain often invokes the revered
name of Ronald Reagan as he tries to appeal across party lines to
the independents and moderates once known as ``Reagan Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   His last commercial in South Carolina, for instance, bragged
that McCain is``a Republican like Ronald Reagan, who can win.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gov. George W. Bush seldom mentions his father's
predecessor in the White House, preferring to associate himself
with Bush administration strategists and surrogates, such as Dan
Quayle, his father's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have good political reasons for their approach.
McCain genuinely admires Reagan and was impressed by the way voters
treated the president as a rock star during his 1984 re-election
campaign. A star now himself, McCain identifies with Reagan and
finds embracing Reagan useful to stress his own conservative
credentials and optimistic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, is trying to project a youthful image of the
future that leaves the Reagan years behind. He was stung by early
accusations that he was leaning too much on his family name and is
now eager to be seen as standing on his own two feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have other reasons for overlooking the Reagan legend.
</P>
<P>
   In this, he is imitating his father's 1988 campaign; George the
elder never mentioned Reagan by name, as though he were trying to
erase a painful memory of the vice presidential years he spent as
Reagan's sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the White House, pappa Bush continued to ignore Reagan,
appearing with him in public only at the dedication of the Reagan
Library. He was repaying the Reagans in kind for their own
eight-year snub; they never invited Bush and his family to visit
them in the private White House quarters. Although the Bushes
attended official functions in the mansion's staterooms, they were
never asked to come upstairs where the presidential family really
lives.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush was preparing to seek the presidency in 1988,
conservative columnist George Will wrote a devastatingly critical
column accusing Bush of pandering to the rightwing. ``The
unpleasant sound Bush is emitting as he traipses from one
conservative gathering to another is a thin, tinny `arf' -- the
sound of a lapdog,'' wrote Will, who was close to Nancy Reagan and
had lunched with her shortly before writing the piece. It is widely
believed that she was the source of the ``lapdog'' crack.
</P>
<P>
   But Will was not alone in finding Bush a wimpy No. 2.
``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau accused Bush of putting his
manhood in trust when he served under Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush proclaimed the dawn of a ``kinder, gentler'' era in
his 1988 presidential nomination acceptance speech, the Reagans
were predictably offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kinder, gentler than who?'' Mrs. Reagan was heard to snap.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the Reagans and the Bushes was awkward
from the beginning. In the 1980 Republican primary, Bush had
campaigned against Reagan, calling his tax cut plan ``voodoo
economics.'' Bush then had to swallow his words when he joined the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also flip-flopped on abortion, abandoning his pro-choice
position to embrace Reagan's anti-abortion stand. Mrs. Reagan, of a
less forgiving nature than the Gipper, never trusted Bush after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Once elected president in his own right, Bush promptly cleaned
house, getting rid of Reagan's intimates and ruffling feathers
among rightwing activists. He had a right to his own team, but
Reagan loyalists felt mistreated and underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that stories are circulating that Nancy Reagan
prefers McCain to Bush's son and might even endorse McCain if he
survives to reach the California primary on March 7. The McCain
camp has been quietly lobbying for her support but she is unlikely
to wade into the fight if McCain looks like a loser.
</P>
<P>
   In light of his father's experience, it is telling that George
the younger now tells reporters that if he wins the GOP nomination
he would select as his running mate ``someone who likes me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smart politics means putting personal grudges aside when it is
in a candidate's interest to do so. The Bushes have never
complained publicly about the tension between them and the Reagans.
President Reagan remains so high in public esteem that attacking
him would only backfire, particularly now when he is too ill to
defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   But presidents and presidential candidates are human, too,
believe it or not. They cannot totally escape their inner feelings
in their attitudes toward competitors or anyone else.

   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain on Monday cast himself as the
underdog against Texas Gov. George W. Bush's juggernaut of $70
million in campaign funds and endorsements by leading Republicans,
including 175 House members, 38 senators and 26 governors,
including Michigan Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shooting from everywhere; everybody is against me,''
McCain told a thunderous, confetti-filled rally of high school
students in a school gymnasium here on Michigan's east coast. ``But
we're going to kill them, right? We're going to get them, right?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``If I win tomorrow in Michigan there's no
stopping us. I'm going right on to the White House.''

<P>
   Bush, resuming his role as frontrunner after his victory in the
South Carolina primary, generally ignored McCain's attacks and
talked about tax cuts. He told rallies in the Detroit area on
Monday that he is counting down the days until he could ``the end
of the Clinton-Gore era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did respond to McCain's ridicule of his claim to be a
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had said that Bush is the governor of a state ``that has
the most liberal campaign contribution laws. ... If Gov. Bush is a
reformer I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Monday that he is setting the pace in an important
area _ posting contributors' names on the Internet almost as fast
as their checks come in. He also criticized McCain for raising
money from lobbyists after criticizing the impact of special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Latest polls showed a too-close-to-call contest. A Detroit News
poll released Monday reported McCain leading Bush, 40 percent to 38
percent, a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign manager Rick Davis said he is preparing to
request protection for the candidate by the U.S. Secret Service in
the days leading up to the March 7 presidential primaries in more
than a dozen states, led by New York, California and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds were manageable before but they're getting bigger
and they're getting more enthusiastic,'' Davis said. ``If the
crowds keep building like this, it will just get to the point to
where there's a crush even with the friendly crowds and that could
be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law authorizes Secret Service protection for ``major
presidential candidates`` who request it during the primary
campaign. Former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., requested Secret
Service protection following the New Hampshire primary. Vice
President Al Gore already has protection because of his role as
vice president. Taxpayers pay the costs for Secret Service
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service protection also has two beneficial side effects:
The agents assigned to the candidate pay for their seats on the
candidate's plane, thus helping defer the cost of the airplane; and
agents add to the candidate's entourage, imparting an aura of
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is protected by the Texas Rangers law enforcement agency
because of role as governor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his Michigan chairman, state Sen. John Schwarz,
sharply criticized Bush's campaign tactics that they said include
``attack ads,'' negative ``push polling'' telephone calls designed
to steer voters toward Bush, direct mail attacks and surrogates
quietly going around to local audiences to spread negative
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never do and say the things that have been (said) by
that campaign,'' McCain said on NBC News' ``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told a roaring rally of more than 1,000 in Traverse City
that Michigan voters ought to ``reject this character
assassination, reject the low road to the presidency and support
those who want to take the high road. You deserve a lot better than
the trash that's on your television set and over the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he hoped to win Democrats and independents in
Michigan's open primary in which all registered voters may take
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole business of governing America is not to divide up
along party lines but to appeal to ... the great center,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is fueling his insurgency with pledges to ``break
the iron triangle of lobbyists, money and legislation'' that has
``stolen'' the government from the people, struck at his rival's
fund raising. Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush,
has set a record raising more than $68 million in campaign
contributions without federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cited cases of alleged access buying by generous
Democratic donors in 1996 and told his audience in Traverse City
that ``right now the Bush campaign is setting up the same apparatus
that the Clinton-Gore campaign set up in 1996 to funnel millions
and tens of millions of dollars of this so-called soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has become ``addicted to the huge checks'' from special
interest lobbyists, McCain added, citing $7 million in so-called
soft money contributions to the party by the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it what we want?'' McCain asked his audience. ``I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has vowed not to accept the packaged ``soft money''
contributions that unions, corporations and other special interest
groups are permitted to donate to political parties to help the
parties convey messages not directly tied to a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore re-election campaign raised more than $20
million in such contributions in 1996, including money from foreign
donors seeking access to Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said donor Johnny Chung, a generous contributor to the
Clinton campaign in 1996, made more visits to the White House in
1996 than did Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's 58 convention delegates make the state the richest
prize of in the delegate hunt so far. Bush came into Michigan with
66 delegates of the 1,035 delegates needed to win the nomination.
McCain had 13. Arizona, which also holds its primary on Tuesday,
offers 30 delegates.

<P>
   Anyone who plays Beethoven, Mozart or Bach faces issues that
have plagued performers throughout the centuries: namely, the
composer's score provides scant guidance on how to approach many
facets of the music. Performers make educated guesses as to how
loudly to play individual notes, for instance, or how to accent
four consecutive quarter notes, but they remain guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dr. Manfred Clynes, a neuroscientist and concert pianist who
lives in Sonoma, Calif., has discovered what he says are clues as
to how exactly the masters would have wanted their pieces
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes, a former neuropsychology professor at the University of
Melbourne, who coined the term ``cyborg'' and has performed to the
acclaim of people like Yehudi Menuhin and Albert Einstein, has
identified what he says are patterns in the music of master
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Those patterns, or ``pulses,'' show how a composer favors louder
and longer notes at consistent points in a phrase, much as poets
resort to patterns of phrasing or painters favor certain brush
strokes. Clynes argues that similar patterns exist on higher levels
in musical compositions, like the way composers stress certain bars
in a movement.
</P>
<P>
   Performances of Beethoven, for instance, carry his
characteristic strength and intensity when, in four-note sequences,
the second note is played shorter and softer than the others,
whereas the notes in Mozart's sequences are more consistent in
length and amplitude.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries were made in a series of experiments that
built on the work of Gustav Becking, a German musicologist who
first put forth the idea of composers' pulses in 1928. Becking
himself had extended the theories of Eduard Sievers, who found he
could mark the shift in the Bible's authors by following the rhythm
of the writing with the movement of a finger. The loops that
Sievers traced while reading each writer were distinct, he found.
</P>
<P>
   Just as each writer evoked consistent finger patterns, Becking
found, composers produced similar patterns. Clynes first measured
those shapes in 1967 by recording how musicians like Pablo Casals
reacted to certain pieces of music while using a device Clynes
invented, called a sentograph.
</P>
<P>
   A person using the sentograph listens to music and touches a
pad, which finely records finger pressure and translates that
pressure into shapes. When several such musicians reacted to the
same composers with similar shapes, Clynes said, ``we knew we had
something good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, using digitized performances of pieces by
well-known Western composers, Clynes experimented with variations
in each composer's pulse, and tested those pieces to see how true
they were to the patterns he had established for each. In this way,
he was able to chart the ``micro-structure'' of a composition _ the
most subtle aspects of a score, like the attack on an individual
note, which composers leave to performers and conductors to
discern.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes codified these findings in a computer program that allows
users to experiment with the pulses of various composers _ say,
what a Mozart symphony might sound like with Schumann's pulses _
and build interpretations of their own, using digitized music
rendered by computer. That program, Superconductor, is now used at
the Juilliard School and has won praise from musicians and from
scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Clynes has provided new tools for composers and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, Manfred has shown that a computer simulation
can be made good enough for many people to immediately take to it,
and that's not a trivial feat,'' said Dr. Jerry Lettvin, professor
of neuroscience at MIT. ``In fact, the difficulty of that is quite
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous incarnations of digitized music ``were a joke,'' said
Alice Shields, a composer who is the former associate director of
the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. ``They were wooden
and boring and had none of the emotional qualities that
noncomputerized music has,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Shields and others said, is that
computerized music often plays every note virtually the same, with
few subtle variations in aspects like tone or tempo found in
performances. In his computer program and in 240 computer-generated
recordings of works like Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Clynes uses
the pulse to avoid such an effect, but he also relies heavily on
another of his theories: predictive amplitude shaping, which
calculates the volume of notes in a phrase.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For many instruments, like a violin, individual notes can be
shaped differently, depending on how the amplitude rises and falls
during a note. A note can have a gradual build-up or can diminish
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes observed that the shape of a note's rise and fall is
affected by the next note. If the next note is a higher pitch, then
the amplitude will fall more sharply at the end. If the note that
follows is lower, the amplitude will fall more gradually.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the shorter the time between the beginning of the
first note and the beginning of the next, the more pronounced the
rise or fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes tested this idea by using time and amplitude equations
that represented virtually every shape a musician could use for a
note, and determining the formula that, to his ear, produced the
most natural results. His findings were first published in 1983 by
the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with Clynes' findings agree. ``A piece of music
isn't a pure mathematical collection of formulas,'' said Donald
Martino, a composer and an emeritus professor of composition at
Harvard. ``We write it down as if it is, as if each sixteenth note
is the same, but in fact, when you measure them, they're all
slightly different.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain collections of notes ``suggest to players slight
variants to the rhythm and volume'' that the musical score cannot
express, Martino said. ``These are things you couldn't really do so
well when just programming a piece by the formulas. Now with
Manfred's findings, it's possible to make electronic music which is
more human.''
</P>
<P>
   Clynes also theorizes that composers show patterns in how
vibrato is ideally used. For instance, he said, performers of some
composers should start the vibrato later in the note if the
succeeding note is higher, and earlier in the note if the
succeeding note is lower.
</P>
<P>
   This theory of vibrato has not been scientifically validated,
but Clynes has incorporated it into the Superconductor program.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes' software is useful in interpreting not just the works of
great masters, but whatever music a user wants to perform with a
computer, said Jeff Harrington, a composer who has had his music
performed in recent years by the North Carolina Chamber Players and
the Clemson University Symphony Orchestra, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that the software also allowed a composer to
create a musical performance for many instruments and control that
performance with a precision that conductors could never achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a bunch of musicians together to play your music,
there will be tons of places where it sounds bad,'' Harrington
said. ``When I compose, I know what a piece sounds like in my
imagination. So when it matches or sounds better than I imagined,
as is the case with this, that's when it blows you away. I think
it's miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Clynes said he hoped the software, which he released in the
mid-1990s and continues to refine, will also appeal to music
beginners. ``People spend their lives learning an instrument, and
they have to perform all kinds of acrobatics to play a piece, but
that has nothing to do with the essence of music, which comes down
to how someone interprets a piece,'' he said. ``This enables the
average person to take music and shape it to their own view of it,
just like a virtuoso can.''

 &HT;    SAGA OF ELIAN TWISTS, TURNS INTO U.S. COURTS; EXPERTS AGREE
RETURN JUST A MATTER OF TIME

<P>
   MIAMI _ The topsy-turvy story of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez took new twists Monday as a federal judge handling his
case fell ill, even as a South Florida nun who played a key role in
the saga made dramatic new revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports also circulated that the boy's father might
travel to the United States to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys arguing over whether the boy should stay here or
return to Cuba were scheduled to take up the key issue of
jurisdiction Tuesday before U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler,
but the 77-year-old Hoeveler suffered a stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Chief Judge Edward B. Davis would meet with
attorneys in the case Tuesday, but only to officially inform them
about the plans to replace Hoeveler and to announce that a new
judge will be selected randomly by computer. It was unknown how
long the developments would delay Elian's case.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler, a veteran federal judge who presided over the trial of
former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, was assigned the Elian
case after another judge withdrew last month because of a possible
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin _ who hosted a high-profile
reunion between Elian and his Cuban grandmothers in January _ said
that one of the grandmothers wanted to defect and that Elian's
Cuban family knew long in advance that the boy's mother planned to
flee the island with him by boat.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin _ who is president of Barry University and was asked
to host the reunion by her friend, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
_ also said that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had
physically abused the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin made the statements in an interview with the Miami
Herald. After the Herald story was published on Sunday, however,
O'Laughlin released a statement saying the article contained some
misinformation. She said she never met privately with the
grandmothers, but learned of the details about the Gonzalez family
from ``other sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Herald editors have stood by the story's accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin's stunning statements are unlikely to have a major
impact on the court proceedings surrounding the boy. But they will
likely spark a new round in the bitter war of words between Miami's
volatile Cuban exiles and the communist government of Cuba _ not to
mention the two branches of the Gonzalez family.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 other people
drowned after their small boat capsized on an ill-fated trip from
Cuba. Since then, Elian has lived with relatives in Miami's Little
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials have ruled that Elian should be
returned to his father in Cuba, a decision upheld by Reno in
January. Elian's Miami family filed a federal lawsuit challenging
the decision and asking that the boy be granted an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the law is squarely behind the government's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question,'' said David Abraham, a
University of Miami law professor who specializes in immigration
matters. ``Immigration admissions decisions are not reviewable by
the courts. The law is clear, and has been clear from the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   If a judge rules that the federal courts have no jurisdiction
and that immigration officials were correct in saying Elian should
return to his father, the Miami family could appeal, meaning the
boy's return would be delayed for several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to granting an asylum hearing, Elian's Miami
relatives want the federal courts to recognize a controversial
ruling in Miami-Dade County family court in which a judge awarded
custody of the boy to his Miami great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. Reno,
however, has ignored that ruling, saying the Florida court had no
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the dry legal proceedings seemed to take a back seat Monday
to the new controversy sparked by O'Laughlin's comments.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old Roman Catholic nun was chosen by Reno to host
Elian's reunion with his grandmothers because of her reputation for
compassion and integrity. A day after the reunion, however,
O'Laughlin surprised many observers by taking a strong stand,
saying Elian should not go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she went into the reunion feeling the boy should
go back, but changed her mind after sensing a deep but unspecified
fear on the part of the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   She remained vague on specifics until her interview in the
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction Monday from Elian's family in
Cuba, or from the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   But her comments that one of the boy's grandmothers wanted to
defect, that his father abused his mother and that the Cuban family
knew of boat trip 10 days in advance seemed likely to trigger anger
in Cuba. O'Laughlin has already been vilified in the official Cuban
press for saying the boy should stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a columnist for another South Florida newspaper
cited another journalist as the source of reports that Elian's
father, Juan Miguel, may travel to the United States to meet
secretly with his son. Official sources in Washington and Cuba have
said they know nothing of such plans, and Gonzalez has repeatedly
said in the past that he would not travel to America.
</P>
<P>
   However the case turns out, O'Laughlin says she fears it is now
too late for Elian to have a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had gone back immediately before so many people on both
sides wanted control of him, he would have been better off,'' she
told the Herald. ``But as it is now, I pray every day that whether
he stays or goes back, he can survive this.''

FROM A YEAST CELL, A NEW LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF AGING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A gene known to govern the rate of aging in yeast cells has been
found to be active in mice, yielding a new insight into why mice
and people age and into possible ways of enhancing life span.
</P>
<P>
   The gene's role is to ``silence'' DNA, meaning it seals off
suites of genes and prevents the cell from gaining access to them.
Since every cell in the human body has the same set of DNA
instructions, it is essential for each type of cell to activate
only the genes needed for its own agenda and to ignore the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how access to the genes is controlled is still
mysterious, but it must involve the versatile packaging material
that clads the DNA, known as chromatin because it takes up colored
stains.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding, reported in the current issue of the journal
Nature by Dr. Leonard Guarente and colleagues at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, is that a gene first found in yeast cells,
a common subject of laboratory study, silences the DNA by shaving
off a certain chemical group from sites along the chromatin. Loss
of the chemicals, known as acetyl groups, makes the chromatin bunch
up closer to the DNA, blocking access to the cell's
gene-transcription machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have long suspected that one of the cell's methods
for controlling chromatin was adding acetyl groups to open the
chromatin and removing the groups so as to repress the underlying
genes. But the protein that shaved off the acetyl groups eluded
discovery. A leading candidate, known as sir2 (for silent
information regulator No. 2), showed no sign of fulfilling this
role in test-tube studies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Guarente has found that sir2 is indeed the cell's acetyl
group remover, but it needs a special assistant that no one had
guessed before: a chemical deeply involved in the cell's energy
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible insight,'' said Dr. C. David Allis, a
chromatin expert at the University of Virginia. ``It looks more and
more like the cell is tweaking acetylation in a forward or backward
way to create a balance that must be very fundamental to the
business of the cell.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that the sir2 gene may be involved in human
longevity is indirect. In 1997, Guarente discovered that sir2
controlled the rate of aging in yeast cells. When endowed with an
extra copy of the sir2 gene, the yeast cells lived longer because
the gene suppressed production of waste genetic material that would
clog the cell.
</P>
<P>
   This clogging mechanism of aging does not seem to operate in
mammalian cells. But the sir2 gene occurs in mice and humans, and
Guarente believes it may be linked with aging in mammals through a
different mechanism, one that involves its newly found chemical
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical, known as NAD, for nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide, is an important intermediate in the cell's energy
metabolism. NAD is the uncharged form of an energy-carrying
chemical, and there is probably more of it around when the cell is
in a state of low energy production.
</P>
<P>
   The one intervention that is known to significantly prolong the
life of laboratory rats and mice is to put them on diets with very
few calories. No one knows why a calorically restricted diet
prolongs life. But Guarente's theory is that in caloric restriction
the amount of NAD in cells may increase, spurring the activity of
its partner sir2. Extra sir2 activity, he says, may prolong life in
rats and mice just as it does in yeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very interesting work because it provides a link
between the energetic state of the cell and its ability to undergo
gene silencing,'' said Dr. Tomas A. Prolla, an expert on the
genetics of aging at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cynthia Kenyon, who studies aging at the University of
California at San Francisco, described Guarente's work as a
``wonderful hypothesis that should stimulate a lot of research.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet known if caloric restriction _ a diet with 30
percent fewer calories but all necessary vitamins and minerals _
will also prolong life in humans. Monkey studies are under way but
are not far enough advanced to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it turns out that humans do benefit, very few people are
likely to be able to maintain such a difficult diet.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente believes there should be a way to reap the benefit of
caloric restriction without the pain, perhaps through a drug that
affects the relevant genes, once these are discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Is sir2 one of those genes? ``I think we have a framework now to
think about how mammalian aging might occur, and this hypothesis
frames the next generation of experiments we will do,'' Guarente
said. ``And the first has to be, `Can we make animals live longer
with sir2?'''
</P>
<P>
   He has engineered both mice and worms with extra copies of sir2,
and is now measuring their life spans.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary biologists have argued that aging is not the result
of a deliberate genetic program but that it comes about as a sort
of afterthought because natural selection cannot greatly favor
genes that benefit an animal after the age of reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente's assumption that there is such a program, and that it
may be governed by the same set of genes in organisms ranging from
yeast to mice to people, butts against this theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only a molecular biologist,'' he said, implying that deep
evolutionary questions were beyond him. But he suggested that it
might be useful for evolution to have a built-in
longevity-controlling program to rely on in selecting organisms
with life cycles adapted to different niches.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente declined to say if his genetically engineered worms
were living longer. Another scientist said a first batch of worms
had lived longer, but had received many extra genes besides sir2.
Such mutant worms can be bought off the shelf, whereas the ones
with just an extra sir2 gene are a special order. &QL;

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Five young cousins killed last month in a
horrific accident on Interstate 30 died as they lived: close
together, of necessity as much as fraternity. The accident shocked
the public, but questions arose when authorities learned that none
of the boys were older than 14 and four of them were carrying false
driver's licenses that misrepresented their age. Attempts to gather
details about the youths have led to a fragmented mosaic of the
culture from which they came: All were children of Irish Travellers

block is Lajitas, a resort town with 160 residents. Wedged between
Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park, Lajitas comes
complete with a golf course, a hotel, three motels, a 14-bed bunk

trading-post-turned-grocery, sewage plant, an 80-spot RV park,
restaurants, six subdivisions, a 4,800-foot-long airstrip and
heart-achingly scenic vistas on 24,000 acres. Then there's the
beer-guzzling goat named Clay Henry III, which was elected

   CLARENDON, Texas _ There's no shortage of rugged pioneer
traditions in this town of 2,067, among the oldest communities in
the Panhandle. Founded as a liquor-free ``Christian colony'' in
1878, it was so overtly pious that wags dubbed it ``Saints'
Roost.'' An immense brick Methodist church and a new campus for the
102-year-old Clarendon College bear testament to a rich past but
can't make up for the lack of a hospital, a movie theater, a mall
or even a shoe store. For several years, there was no doctor.
Thirteen months ago, Clarendon and the rest of Donley County got
their own general practice physician, and he's no ordinary man of
medicine. Dr. John Howard, 46, is a former naval flight surgeon
with jet flight training who stands 6-foot-5 and holds degrees in
law and medicine from Tulane University. By BARRY SHLACHTER.

is not your typical school nurse. Using grant money, Knox has
arranged to have a pediatrician visit from the Texas Tech

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the American burrowing beetle that tipped off Dr. Rob
Channell and Dr. Mark Lomolino, conservation biologists, that one
of the basic tenets of modern conservation theory might be
misguided, to the possible detriment of many endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The geographical range of the beetle, Lomolino discovered, had
shrunk drastically over the years and now, confined to Rhode
Island, the insect occupies only the merest edge of its original
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not where it should have been living, according to
conventional biological wisdom. Left to its own devices, experts
have long believed, a wild species will persist most abundantly and
robustly in the center of its geographical range; populations at
the edges are fragmented, disjointed, isolated, ephemeral _ and
more likely to die out.
</P>
<P>
   This common-sense proposition has long led conservation
biologists to concentrate on core areas as they delineate habitats
to protect, or sites to reintroduce species. They have largely
neglected the edges.
</P>
<P>
   But the burrowing beetle led Channell of Fort Hays State
University in Hays, Kan., and Lomolino of the University of
Oklahoma to undertake a study whose results suggest that
conservation strategies that ignore the fringes of endangered
species' ranges may sometimes fail.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the researchers said, is that conventional rules
often ignore the impact of people. Human activities like farming
and logging have already pushed many species out of their core
territories and relegated them to the edges, where they cling to a
precarious existence in less favorable habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human activity tends to spread like a contagion,'' Channell
said. The human presence typically moves like a wave front across a
species' range, he said, from one edge of the range, across the
middle, toward the far edge, destroying or disturbing habitat as it
goes, overwhelming the underlying natural ecology. The far edge in
many instances remains intact, and thus provides the only habitat
in which a fading species can be preserved and the only reservoir
from which it might eventually be able to reclaim some of its
former territory.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists gathered maps delineating the changes in the
extent of the ranges of 245 endangered species. They included
birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, mollusks, arthropods
and plants on all continents except Antarctica and several islands.
After digitizing and comparing the maps, Channell said, they found
geographic patterns of species survival ``completely contrary'' to
conventional expectation.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, from the giant panda of China to the
black-footed ferret, California condor and red wolf of North
America, plus scores of others, the maps told a clear tale: many
species have fled from the human onslaught and found refuge on the
peripheries of their ranges. The findings were published recently
in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``an extraordinarily regular pattern,'' said Stuart Pimm,
an ecologist and conservation expert at Columbia University. Like
humans, who mostly live in temperate zones rather than in the
arctic or the tropics, he said, wild species ``tend to pick the
places that are just right'' for them.
</P>
<P>
   That being so, he said, ``you might think that if you make life
hard for a species, it would withdraw from the periphery and move
to the center of the range where it has a better chance. But that's
not the pattern we see.''
</P>
<P>
   Many endangered species seem not to do very well once they
become rare, he said. ``The reason they do not,'' he said, ``is
that they are probably in the wrong place; they have never done
well at their edges, and now that's all they have left.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two major exceptions to the findings: Hawaii and
Africa. After humans arrived, species moved to the geographical
center of the Hawaiian Islands, not the periphery. But some
scientists have suggested that many Hawaiian species were confined
to the lowlands before humans arrived, and so inhabited
doughnut-shaped ranges. The interior volcanic highlands, therefore,
might properly be considered the ecological fringe of species'
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, species were distributed more uniformly across their
ranges than elsewhere. Channell and Lomolino note that people have
a longer history in Africa than anywhere else, and that human
activity has long been distributed rather than moving across it
like a wave front.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say this cannot be the whole explanation, since the
declines of African species examined by the two researchers are
recent. Overhunting might drive large species toward the center of
a range, suggested Dr. Thomas Brooks of the University of
Copenhagen, the University of Cambridge and Conservation
International, the Washington-based conservation group, in a
commentary in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks noted that 20 of the 24 African species included in the
Channell-Lomolino study were large mammals, compared with fewer
than half in other regions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the study's findings, Pimm said, there are still many
places in the world where core habitat areas are intact, or nearly
so. Obvious examples are the forests of Congo, Southeast Asia and
the Amazon, where a large proportion of the world's species live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It behooves us to get serious about protecting those areas
before they're reduced to fragments,'' Pimm said, adding that the
Channell-Lomolino study ``adds a new urgency to the conservation
actions we're already contemplating.''
</P>
<P>
   But while core habitat areas should not be ignored, Channell
said, conservationists should ``pay attention to the periphery
also,'' giving it equal status.
</P>
<P>
   This may be especially urgent in what experts call the world's
``hot spots'' of biological diversity. These are especially
biologically rich areas that, according to Brooks, contain perhaps
half of all the earth's species, even though they take up only 1.4
percent of its total land area.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Channell-Lomolino findings, Brooks wrote in Nature,
``we would expect disproportionate amounts of habitat to survive on
the peripheries of the hot spots.'' Conservationists cannot afford
to ignore these peripheral habitats, he wrote, since they ``may now
hold some of the last opportunities for conservation.''

<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MIRTH OF A NATION'' &QL; 
Edited by Michael J. Rosen (HarperPerennial, $15) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to make jokes at Yanni's expense, but we're
willing to laugh if someone else steps up to the plate. In this
case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;

<P>
   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;

   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;

<P>
   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

`NEW HAMPSHIRE OF THE WEST': ARIZONA GOT
 EDGE IN REGION'S GOP PRIMARIES

   &UR; (EDITORS: PRIMARY IS TUES., FEB 22.
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING IN CASE YOU MISSED THIS.
 &UR; ALSO MOVING IN ``K'' CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona's early Republican primary has thrust the
Grand Canyon State into the national limelight, but it almost
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the primary's fate dangled by a single thread in the
Legislature. The deciding vote was held by Sen. Jim Buster, a Yuma
Republican who was playing brinksmanship to save an environmental
bill from a veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary had friends, and Buster soon found out how
powerful they were. Near the end of the session, he was summoned
from a meeting and told that Sen. John McCain was calling _ from
North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was THAT important,'' Buster recalled. ``But
apparently he thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years before McCain himself would seek the nation's highest
office, he and then-Gov. Fife Symington wanted an early primary.
Both men supported Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and wanted to give him
an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best-laid plans of senators and governors often
go astray, and the primary was no exception. Gramm's presidential
bid fell apart before he reached Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain quickly switched his support to the eventual nominee,
Sen. Bob Dole, but millionaire publisher Steve Forbes won the
primary. In the end, most of Arizona's delegates went to Dole after
Forbes dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the primary still accomplished its goal, said former
state Sen. Stan Barnes, who sponsored the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be the New Hampshire of the West,'' Barnes said,
``the first Western state to come off and make a difference. And
you know what? We are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is a big factor in the selection of the next president
of the United States, and as an Arizonan, I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the Arizona primary, which is Tuesday, has
lost some luster, because South Carolina comes just three days
before, and Michigan is on the same day. On the positive side, the
state hosted two GOP debates this cycle, which never would have
happened without a primary.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP field narrowing to three candidates _ McCain, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and conservative pundit Alan Keyes _ the
dynamics have changed. Bush can simply write off a McCain win to
Arizona being that it's McCain's home state and keep gearing up for
Super Tuesday (March 7).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mike Hellon, Republican national committeeman for
Arizona, said other states have tried to steal Arizona's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the whole impetus behind the aborted effort to have a
Western regional primary among the Rocky Mountain states,'' Hellon
said. ``They're all very jealous of the attention that Arizona is
getting and they want to jump in on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the primary goes to Barnes, now a
lobbyist for energy and mining interests.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes shepherded the primary bill through the Legislature,
watching it die not once but twice. Democrats, forbidden by party
rules to participate in an early primary, attacked the bill with a
vengeance, and a few moderate Republicans joined them.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the primary was too expensive _ it ultimately
cost the state $2 million _ to be limited to one party.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of rhetoric, the primary bill would have gone
down a third time without some serious lobbying _ such as McCain's
phone call from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Under serious pressure, Buster decided to dicker with Symington,
who vetoed Buster's environmental bill anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an internal memo obtained by ``The Arizona Republic,''
a Symington aide poked fun at Buster, now a lobbyist for the state
Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buster should get the tough-guy award for his suicidal
negotiating style,'' Symington aide Chuck Coughlin wrote. ``You
need to be aware in the future that his style is to take you to the
edge and then jump off, hoping to catch a branch on the way down.''
Buster's leap notwithstanding, Barnes said there was little doubt
that McCain and Symington made the difference, although others had
agitated for a primary for years. An Arizona primary law was passed
in 1992, but it was vague on the date and had other technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain and Symington behind an early primary, Barnes said,
``you had the political will to finally get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say that it was done for Phil Gramm,'' he
added. ``That has never been true. However, the folks who wanted
Gramm to succeed also wanted an early Arizona primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is a wonderful environment for coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wasn't through tinkering with the primary. Last year, his
operatives lurked in the background as a bill popped up late in the
legislative session, seeking to move the primary back into March,
after Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   To McCain's opponents, the strategy was obvious: save McCain
from expending critical resources to defend his home state from a
George W. Bush incursion. A number of state Republicans rejected
the move, saying it would forfeit the spotlight that Arizona had
gained.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix, supported moving the
primary to the same day as city elections _ March 14 _ to
consolidate the process and save money. But it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the primary replaced an old-fashioned caucus system, in
which delegates were elected by party activists. That process
marginalized Arizona, because the state convention was held in May,
long after the heart of primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way was more insular,'' Hellon said. ``You had to be
more of an insider to participate. I think on balance we're
probably better off the more we open up the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old system, more than 1,000 delegates went to the state
convention, where they voted for about three dozen delegates, who
would attend the national GOP convention. The delegates campaigned
based on which presidential candidate they supported.
</P>
<P>
   The internecine warring made for some tense standoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, House Minority Leader John Rhodes, an Arizonan who
supported Gerald Ford, was slated to be chairman of the national
convention. But he had no support from state Republicans, who were
lined up behind Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rhodes almost received the ultimate snub for a
powerful congressman _ not being elected a delegate from his own
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to (elect him),'' Hellon said. ``But the
national Reagan campaign said he's going to control the gavel at
the convention, so we can't have him (ticked) off. You have to
elect him a delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the state party made headlines by electing as a
delegate former Gov. Evan Mecham, who had been impeached and
removed from office just a month before. The move came over the
objections of Sen. Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Hellon said there were advantages to the old system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are making the decisions, they typically know
more about the candidates,'' Hellon said, ``and from a political
standpoint, they make more informed decisions and are not as easily
influenced by short-term passions or media.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, all of Arizona's delegates are committed to the candidate
who wins Tuesday's (CQ: FEB. 22) primary. The delegates are back in
play if the winning candidate drops out before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention, there's a more pragmatic reason for
state Republicans to want a presidential primary. It makes money
for the party _ about $100,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the candidates come in and all the news people come in, so
now we have a good reason for them wanting to come in,'' said Dodie
Londen, former chairman of the state GOP. ``Every party needs money
in order to operate for the rest of the year.'' &QL;

NATO WARNS OF SERBIA TROOP BUILDUP NEAR KOSOVO  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NATO secretary-general, Lord Robertson, said on Monday in
Brussels that the alliance was monitoring what he called a buildup
of Yugoslav troops in areas bordering Kosovo and that it would not
be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly rising tension in the southern part of
Serbia, and large numbers of additional Yugoslav troops have moved
into the area,'' he said at a news conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would warn anybody who seeks to be provocative in that part
of the world, on whatever side of the divide they may be, that
again we will not tolerate action being taken,'' he said. ``Clearly
there are flash points in Kosovo and the surrounding areas. We
monitor them on a daily basis, and we take what robust and
contingency action is required.''
</P>
<P>
   While the apparent influx of Serbian forces may be intended to
provide psychological support for the Serbs in the northern part of
Mitrovica, the ethnically divided Kosovo city where Serbs have been
fighting Kosovo Albanians and peacekeepers have been attacked,
Serbian villagers in the strip of land between Serbia and Kosovo
have been complaining that armed Albanians are attacking them.
</P>
<P>
   There is a negotiated three-mile-wide zone along this internal
border that Serbian troops are not supposed to enter. But Serbian
villagers in the zone, especially around the town of Merdare, say
they feel unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a group of Albanians attacked a checkpoint with
automatic fire, the Serbian police said. In a two-hour gun battle,
the police called in reinforcements and a police vehicle hit a
mine, killing three people.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, abutting eastern Kosovo near the Serbian towns of
Bujanovac and Presevo, where many people of Albanian background
live, Albanians say they are being driven into Kosovo against their
will by Serbs, some of whom moved there when they fled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some Albanian irredentism here, too. Some Albanians
refer to the region as ``eastern Kosovo.'' Some Albanians in this
part of Serbia say they feel under pressure from more radical
Albanians in Kosovo, the southernmost province of Serbia, and armed
Albanians from Kosovo sometimes enter the area.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces have been moving into this region, too,
supposedly to stop the influx of armed Albanian groups, Serbian
officials say.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN TRYING TO BOLSTER SUPPORT AMONG WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not the problem that she or anyone one else expected.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the most enthusiastic supporters of Hillary Rodham
Clinton were women, who sympathized with her plight in the wars
over her husband's impeachment. Democratic, independent and even
Republican women also shared her concerns about education, health
care and children.
</P>
<P>
   Today Clinton's support among these women, even the Democrats,
has dropped, forcing her U.S. Senate campaign to make a priority of
bringing them back. Her advisers insist that she will.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the challenge, they admit, is to figure out why the
women abandoned Clinton in the first place, particularly as Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her Republican opponent, woos them himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers readily blame the wobbly beginnings of her
campaign, her political mistakes of the fall and the nature of the
women's vote in general, which does not necessarily support women,
particularly in New York. But right now they say privately that
they are also struggling to overcome psychological factors not
normally at play in political campaigns _ specifically, the
attitudes of women toward Clinton's marriage, ambition and the
power she derived from the most powerful man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged some of her problems with women in a recent
interview. ``I think it's understandable that people say, `Well,
who is she, and why is she doing this, where is she coming from,
and what has she ever done on her own?''' she said. ``And that is
part of what the campaign will have to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who in recent weeks has run statewide commercials
about the city's program to fight domestic violence, has declined
to discuss why he thinks Clinton's support among women has wavered.
And so far, at least, the polls do not show that the women who
abandoned Clinton are rallying to his side. But recently, one of
Giuliani's campaign advisers said that ``the manner in which she
has engaged has been frustrating to people,'' and added that
``people were expecting strong, decisive, independent _ and they're
not getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the numbers tell their own story: In a
January 1999 poll conducted by Marist College in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., 58 percent of the women polled supported Clinton, compared to
34 per cent who supported Giuliani. Among Democratic women, the
numbers were 81 percent for Clinton compared to 17 percent for
Giuliani. In a Marist poll this month, Clinton had support from 44
percent of women overall compared to 43 percent for Giuliani. Among
Democratic women, Clinton had 67 percent compared to Giuliani's 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say that what has happened is to a large extent
typical. ``It's a very common pattern with women candidates to have
an early surge with women voters,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic
pollster who is researching the nature of the women's vote for
Emily's List, a political action committee that raises money for
women candidates. ``At first, a lot of women voters are very
enthusiastic, but then they start to feel some ambivalence _ `Does
she support my values, or is she a challenge to my values?''' Lake
said. ``In the end, women who win tend to consolidate the women's
vote, and they usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same pollsters also say that Clinton is unlike any other
female candidate before her _ a first lady and a professional woman
who for decades put her husband's career first, then used her
extraordinary status and experience as the president's wife to
advance her own.
</P>
<P>
   While many feminists applaud her for that _ Gloria Steinem calls
Clinton one of the first ``crossover'' candidates in that she has
made use of both traditional male and female experience _ other
women find the multiple identities of Clinton confusing and
troubling. The same women who rallied to her side as a victim, for
example, seem to have mixed feelings about whether that should
translate into political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know who this woman is anymore,'' said Carol
Lalli, a Manhattan free-lance writer, a Democrat and a former
editor at Food &AMP; Wine, Simon &AMP; Schuster and Rizzoli. ``I don't
really know what she stands for. I don't know if this would be
happening if it weren't for her husband's position. I don't know
that we've been able to see what her real accomplishments could be.
She's been thrust upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Aldrich, a Democrat from Pelham, N.Y. and the
administrator of a health program, expressed other reservations.
``Right now, I'm somewhat unimpressed that she stayed with her
husband all these years, and I'm tired of the Clintons,'' she said.
But Ms. Aldrich also said that she did not know enough about the
issues yet to say how she would vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   To answer those concerns, the Clinton campaign has launched an
all-out effort to redefine their candidate for both working women
and mothers by emphasizing that Clinton has been both. An 18-minute
video shown at Clinton's official announcement of her Senate
campaign in Purchase on Feb. 6 shows her in a soft pink sweater and
pearls, but it also shows footage of her 1969 Wellesley
commencement speech and has an image of her as a young staff member
to a Watergate impeachment committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also distributed 400,000 eight-page leaflets,
titled ``Hillary: The Real Story,'' that focus on Clinton's work as
a staff attorney for the Children's Defense Fund, ``her pioneering
legal career,'' and her work for children and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though her days were full of court appointments, speeches and
meetings,'' the leaflet says, ``Hillary always made time for her
daughter. Soccer games, ballet recitals, even just shopping or
hanging out together, Hillary made sure she was there for
Chelsea.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is barely mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of women don't know about anything I did before
the White House,'' Clinton said in the interview. ``And again, it
is my burden to talk about the professional and public career I had
independently of my husband.'' She added, ``I mean, I have a very
long record of independent public service, but it was
understandably subsumed into the larger mission of the president in
1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that after her attempt to overhaul the
nation's health care system as first lady ended in well-publicized
failure, ``I went back to doing what I had always done, but none of
it had the high visibility or the tension that health care did. So
I think a lot of the awareness of what I was doing really kind of
faded from the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that a national tour to promote her 1996 book, ``It
Takes a Village,'' ``conveyed a lot of my beliefs about the kinds
of social responsibilities we should have toward families'' but
``you know, none of that was headline-grabbing. So the glimpses
that people had of me was part of this team, part of this
administration. And it was the same challenge that the vice
president faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers say they are confident that they can bring
their base voters back by focusing on the issues that polls show
are most important to women _ education, health care and Social
Security. ``We're positively convinced that our issues are the ones
that would move our constituency,'' said Bill de Blasio, Clinton's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the campaign is concerned enough about Clinton's wavering
support among women _ particularly white women, where she trails
Giuliani _ that advisers have gone back to look at how women voted
in previous New York elections. Mark Penn, Clinton's pollster,
recently asked researchers for the Marist poll to pull out the
voting patterns of white women in the 1998 Senate race, in which
Charles Schumer, a Democratic congressman, beat the Republican
incumbent, Alphonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Sept. 29 of that year, Penn found, white women were
supporting D'Amato over Schumer by 46 percent to 43 percent. But
the final vote in November showed that Schumer, the victor, beat
D'Amato among white women by 53 to 46 percent. ``The women's vote
tends to vote Democratic late,'' said Penn. Among nonwhite women in
the most recent Marist poll, Clinton leads Giuliani 79 percent to
11 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To shore up her support among women, Clinton is also
concentrating on women's groups, as she did this past Thursday in a
speech in New York City to a ``Women's Networking'' event organized
by women at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP;
Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   In her half-hour, anecdote-laden remarks to more than 500 women
lawyers and other professionals, Clinton spoke in personal terms of
her years as the first woman partner at the Rose Law Firm in Little
Rock, Ark., and of her 1979 pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just kept getting bigger and bigger, and my partners
just would avert their eyes as I walked down the hallway,'' Clinton
said to laughter. ``And they never said anything to me, and I
didn't at the time know what to say to them. This had never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a 29-year-old associate at the firm, Joan Malmud,
said Clinton's remarks had impressed her. ``I started off really
strongly for Hillary because she's such an articulate, intelligent
woman and her politics are mine,'' she said. ``And then I became
disillusioned. I felt that she was changing her character to meet a
political need. I was beginning to think that she was more
plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Clinton's speech, Ms. Malmud said, ``she came off to
me more as someone who breaks new ground.''

   Al Gore and Bill Bradley will go at each other Monday night in a
90-minute debate at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem. The event,
running from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., will be moderated by CNN's

   BATTLING IT OUT IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and John McCain were campaigning in Michigan on
Monday, with McCain, in Traverse City, accusing Bush of running a
campaign by ``character assassination.'' He was referring to TV ads
for Tuesday's Michigan primary. Bush, focusing on his economic
proposals in a Detroit speech, said he's ``taking nothing for
granted'' in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ANYONE'S GUESS IN MICHIGAN ...
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan GOP presidential race is close. A Detroit News poll
taken last week found George W. Bush and John McCain virtually
tied. Independent pollster John Zogby says he found the same thing
when he polled in Michigan on Sunday, after the South Carolina
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ... BUT MCCAIN SAFE IN HOME STATE
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters, political officials and potential voters all agree,
according to the Arizona Daily Star, that John McCain's defeat in
South Carolina shouldn't carry over Tuesday to Arizona, McCain's
home state. The paper says the the most likely effect ``will be to
boost the voter turnout _ already expected to be high. Anticipation
of a McCain victory hasn't changed. ... ``The question is by how
much _ and how much will be enough to make a significant political
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ENEMIES NO LONGER
</P>
<P>
   Communist Vietnam on Monday condemned John McCain's use of the
term ``gooks'' to refer to his Vietnam War captors, saying the slur
was hurtful and unworthy of someone running for the U.S.
presidency. ``The fact Mr. John McCain uses such words and makes
such statements that lack goodwill have hurt Vietnamese and Asian
people,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh said in
response to questions on McCain's quoted comments of last week.
</P>
<P>
   NADER'S VOICE ADDED TO RACE
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader is a presidential candidate again, officially
declaring his candidacy Monday for the environmentalist Green Party
nomination. The consumer advocate said corporate influence is
controlling government, and promised to put more power in the hands
of the people. Nader got less than 1 percent of the vote last time.
He says he hopes to win 5 percent this time.
</P>
<P>
   COURTING MINORITY VOTES IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday night's debate with Bill Bradley at Harlem's
Apollo Theatre, Al Gore renewed his call for an end to racial
profiling by police and passage of federal hate-crimes legislation.
Gore told a largely black audience of more than 800 in a church in
Albany, N.Y., that the Republicans who hope to take the White House
are ``morally blind'' to racial concerns. Gore, campaigning for the
first time this year in New York with Hillary Clinton, never
mentioned Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   THEY CAN WALK IN FREELY NOW
</P>
<P>
   A day before the 90-minute Democratic debate Monday at the
Apollo Threatre centering on urban and racial issues, theater stage
hands and management reached a contract agreement. That averted a
threatened strike that would have caused complications, because
both Al Gore and Bill Bradley had vowed not to cross a picket line.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH LOVE IN DETROIT
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, looking for support in Detroit's overwhelming
Democratic black community, focused on morality and self-reliance.
Keyes: ``It's all important to spread the word throughout this
country about what people can do if they are willing to put their
faith in God and one another.'' He called for morality in schools
and attacked affirmative action practices that provide
opportunities solely according to race.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT RESULTS, DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
</P>
<P>
   The flip-flop of the finish between the New Hampshire and South
Carolina primaries has brought a role reversal to the campaign
styles of John McCain and George W. Bush. McCain, who beat Bush
decisively in New Hampshire but suffered an 11-point loss in South
Carolina, has gone on the attack, saying, ``If Governor Bush is a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.'' Bush, on the other hand, reverted to
a front-runner's posture of trying to ignore his rival and instead
lay out his agenda for the country.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK LAWMAKER SWITCHES TO MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after his defeat in South Carolina, John
McCain got a boost in New York from Rep. Peter King, who announced
his switch from supporting George W. Bush to McCain. In recent
days, some Republican leaders in New York have expressed
ambivalence about Bush, but King, from Long Island, was the first
to publicly switch sides in defiance of Gov. George Pataki, Bush's
state campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   SPENDING NUMBERS ARE IN
</P>
<P>
   John McCain spent $6.8 million in January, bringing his total to
$21 million, according to reports filed with the Federal Election
Commission. George W. Bush spent $12.8 million, bringing his ttal
to $50.1 million _ more than any other presidential candidate ever.
On the Democratic side, Bill Bradley outspent Al Gore last month,
$5 million to $3.8 million, even as he lost both the Iowa caucuses
and New Hampshire primary. Bradley's total spending through January
is $24.4 million; Gore's is $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   GOING GETS TOUGHER IN OHIO
</P>
<P>
   Two potential weaknesses may hamper John McCain's campaign in
Ohio, site of one of the major Super Tuesday primaries March 7. The
Cleveland Plain Dealer reports that McCain's Ohio forces are thin
and poorly organized. More importantly, the independent vote that
helped him win the New Hampshire primary doesn't have a history of
turning out in Ohio primaries.
</P>
<P>
   HE'D LOVE TO SEE A CLINTON-GORE PROBE
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley publicly endorsed the appointment of a special
prosecutor to investigate campaign finance abuses by the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996, saying he thought there was clear
evidence that laws had been broken. Bradley asserted that the
decision by the Democratic National Committee to return money that
may have been collected improperly in 1996, and the criminal
prosecutions of several low-level Clinton-Gore fund-raisers
indicated that a broader investigation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   AND HER NEW HOUSE IS HEATED BY OIL
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton joined a growing chorus of Northeastern
lawmakers of both parties in calling for a regional oil reserve to
help states cope with future shortages of home heating oil and tamp
down soaring consumer prices. As OPEC has limited production, the
cost of heating oil soared to a peak of $2.02 earlier this month.
Her Senate opponent, Rudy Giuliani, has repeatedly criticized the
president for refusing to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to drive down the cost of home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   GRAHAM THE ONE TO WATCH SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) backed John McCain in the state's
GOP primary, but that isn't expected to hold him back. He's ``South
Carolina's hottest media darling since the late Lee Atwater,''
according to The State newspaper in Columbia. Graham has been
polishing his speaking style with the national media, which
discovered how quotable he was during the Clinton impeachment
hearings. Now, says the State, Graham is the best bet to snag the
state GOP nomination for Sen. Strom Thurmond's seat when Thurmond
retires in 2002.

HAMBURG IN BID TO BE ECONOMIC HUB BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ Hunting for the boom that never happened in
post-Cold War Berlin? Try this handsome port city that purrs with
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The boutiques _ from home-grown Jil Sander to Gianni Versace,
the cranes hoisting an enlarged port into being, the plans for a
vast new downtown on a former dockland area, the rising tide of
internet companies: all this speaks of boomtown Hamburg and of a
Germany still resisting the appeal of Berlin, its new capital.
</P>
<P>
   The theory when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 was that
German industry would return to Berlin, a city it largely abandoned
in 1945, and that the bourgeoisie that Hitler's war decimated there
would be partially reconstituted. Instead, what the last decade has
confirmed is postwar Germany's deep attachment to a decentralized
federalism.
</P>
<P>
   That is evident nowhere more than in Hamburg. Its growth in
recent years suggests that Berlin, for all its dreams of being a
``Weltstadt'' or world-class city, will never enjoy the dominance
over Germany that Paris and London exercise over France and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is booming because it has recovered its hinterland
since the Cold War's end,'' said Theo Sommer, the executive editor
of the influential Hamburg-based weekly Die Zeit. ``By comparison,
Berlin's development seems lethargic.''
</P>
<P>
   That hinterland is Central Europe, which was unnaturally cut off
from Hamburg by the Iron Curtain, a mere 20 miles to the east. Now
the city is once again the major port of Prague, up the River Elbe,
and the old trading links of the Hanseatic League have been
re-established with towns like Gdansk in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, container traffic at the port has increased to over
77 million tons from 55 million five years ago. Projected growth is
so strong that a new port area is being built and the Elbe River
deepened at a cost of $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1989, we won back our neighbors on the Elbe river,'' said
Mayor Ortwin Runde, a Social Democrat. ``Trade between Germany and
the Central European states that have emerged from communism is now
bigger than with the United States. As the port for more than 20
percent of German exports, we have naturally benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   In the neo-Renaissance city hall, the offices of the Chamber of
Commerce adjoin Runde's office. Nothing could more eloquently
express the fierce attachment of this city to trade, its feeling of
looking outward to the world rather than inward to an often
despondent Germany. And it does not look only to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains in London, the umbrellas go up in Hamburg,''
goes an old saying here. It reflects the city's sense of closeness
to the British capital, with which it shares a taste for
discretion, an intense pragmatism and an evident openness.
</P>
<P>
   Among the statistics that Riesling-sipping Hamburg businessmen
like to spout over plates of succulent sole is the fact that no
other city, apart from New York, has more than 90 consulates. The
consulates, of course, serve trade.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is a country of both merchant cities and court cities.
Among the former, Hamburg is joined by places like Cologne and
Leipzig. The latter include Berlin and Dresden, places where past
tragedy weighs heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Although no German town has escaped this country's 20th-century
trauma _ Hamburg was heavily bombed in World War II _ it often
seems that the practical bent of the trading towns has enabled them
to heal their wounds faster.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's repetitive bluster about becoming the new capital of
``middle Europe'' has remained unbacked by much solid evidence even
as Hamburg has moved fast to exploit new opportunities to the east.
Unemployment in the port city has fallen to 9.6 percent, from 12.6
percent, over the past two years; in Berlin it has remained at
about 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling sign of Hamburg's confidence is a $10-billion
development called Harbor City, planned on about 250 acres south of
the city center where old dockland warehouses now stand.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, the warehouses are to be replaced by
office space for more than 20,000 people, a terminal for luxury
cruisers, hotels, theaters, stores and several thousand apartments.
Construction begins this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bernd Tiedeman, the managing director of the project, said it
sums up ``Hamburg's new ambitions after unification.'' In his
vision, cruise ships will dock here bringing tourists who will then
go on excursions as far away as Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Hamburg as a gateway to Berlin may seem
far-fetched, but if a long-planned high-speed train is ever built,
the capital will be only 60 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it is a measure of the continuing isolation of the
capital _ deprived of its port by Poland's absorption of Szczecin
(the former German Stettin) after World War II, and still lacking a
direct flight to the United States _ that Hamburg may reasonably
see itself as a center from which to visit Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Berlin looks east, Munich looks south, and we look to
the west, which is where things are really happening for now,''
said Frank Sarfeld, the spokesman for America Online Europe, whose
headquarters are in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   He had a large muffin on his cluttered desk and a plate of ice
cream _ ``I only eat at my desk'' _ as he gazed at three television
screens providing news and stock prices. On his wall was a strategy
chart mapping out ``Operation Steady Drumbeat,'' a plan to keep AOL
Europe in the news by providing a relentless stream of press
releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of new media is coming here, because this is where the
old media companies are and the spirit is right,'' Sarfeld said.
``But with everyone looking for the same information-technology
people, you have to have a good stock-option program. That's a
must.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options were certainly not in the thoughts of the Allies
when, in 1946, they gave licenses in Hamburg to two of the first
postwar German newspapers _ Die Welt and Die Zeit. But they did
have in mind a decentralized Germany where no city could be as
dominant as Hitler's Berlin. In this strategic design their success
now seems conspicuous.

NADER ANNOUNCES SECOND BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, announced
Monday that he would make a second run for the presidency as a
Green Party candidate and vowed, as he did in 1996, to take on big
business and its influence on government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can no longer stomach the systemic political decay that has
weakened our democracy,'' said Nader, who will compete for the
Green Party nomination against three others. ``It is necessary to
launch a sustained effort to wrest control of our democracy from
the corporate government and restore it to the political government
under the control of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 65, whose quest for the White House in 1996 earned him
less than 1 percent of the vote, said at a news conference that he
will raise enough money to pay his campaign workers but will not
spend a nickel on polling, consulting firms or television ads. In
1996, he spent less than $5,000 of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   First known for his crusade against the automobile industry in
the 1960s, Nader founded a number of consumer advocacy groups over
the years, including Public Citizen, which focus on corporate and
government wrongdoing. The Green Party, an offspring of the
anti-nuclear and environmental movements, shares similar goals,
among them its pursuit of ``ecological wisdom'' and ``grass-roots
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as the only candidate willing to shake up the
system, Nader said he was concerned about the growing disparity
between rich and poor. ``Despite record economic growth, corporate
profits and stock market highs year after year, a stunning array of
deplorable conditions still prevails,'' Nader said in a statement
posted on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader acknowledged that he would face an uphill battle as
the Green Party nominee. Democratic and Republican candidates have
huge campaign war chests and months of campaigning already behind
them. Nevertheless, Nader said, he would be content to infuse ``a
powerful message'' into this year's presidential election.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since they busted out of Euro-pop obscurity to become
certified Broadway cash cows, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel
Schonberg have been labeled as guys who like to think big.
</P>
<P>
   Big-budget musicals with big casts. Big sets crammed with
barricades, scything helicopters and 12-foot statues of Ho Chi
Minh. Bigger-than-life characters projecting big, heart-swelling
melodies.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, big themes like, oh, the redemption of the human
soul, the fall of Saigon and the political upheavals of
19th-century France.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as a mild surprise to hear Connall Morrison describe
Boublil and Schonberg, authors of ``Les Miserables'' and ``Miss
Saigon'' _ two of the top-grossing musicals of all time _ as closet
minimalists who are most concerned with mundane matters of the
human heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're two Frenchman. They want to write about love,'' says
Morrison, the Irish director who guided the current production of
Boublil and Schonberg's latest opus, ``Martin Guerre,'' which opens
Wednesday night at the Ahmanson Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Boublil and Schonberg insist that with ``Martin
Guerre'' they were attempting to downsize the imperial scale of
their two previous blockbusters. In musicalizing the oft-told
legend of a 16th-century French soldier who returns home claiming
to be another man, the authors say they wanted to tell an intimate
love story that wouldn't be upstaged by the set design.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no Cadillacs. No replicas of 1840s Paris slums.
Just your basic Gallic menage a trois and a bunch of confused
peasants facing a moral dilemma bigger than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something a lot of the critics don't seem to
understand,'' Schonberg says, a bit testily, speaking by phone from
France. ``We're not trying to rewrite `Les Miz.' After `Miss
Saigon,' we didn't want to do another big literary work of the
French patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg's frustration is understandable, given the fits and
starts that have plagued ``Martin Guerre's'' long odyssey from the
drawing board to London's West End and finally to the current North
American tour, which will wrap up in April following its L.A.
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authors and producer Cameron Mackintosh originally
had hoped to take ``Martin Guerre'' to Broadway this spring, they
decided to pull the plug on the show, ostensibly because they were
unable to secure a ``midsize'' Broadway house such as the
1,400-seat St. James.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made to close the show in L.A. rather than
going in the wrong theater,'' says Boublil, on the line from
London. ``'Martin Guerre' is not that kind of show that you just go
anywhere. You have to create its own life.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Martin Guerre'' has continually had to fight the
impression that it was a musical dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   That perception acquired new steam during the tour's December
stop in the nation's capital, where the Washington Post's theater
critic pronounced it ``theatrically inert.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent decision not to take ``Martin Guerre'' to New
York has been seen as a blow to the megabucks clout and insider
connections of producer Mackintosh, the Englishman who brought the
world ``Cats,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' and both ``Les Miz''
and ``Miss Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Boublil takes a philosophical attitude about to the critical
drubbing ``Martin Guerre'' has received from the likes of the Post
and The New York Times. But he can't help speculating that some of
the adverse reaction stems from resentment over the authors'
decision to paint on a smaller canvas, after earning their
reputations (and their millions) with splashier spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I have to consider like a possibility,
(that) people would only accept us as being either really popular
or completely uncommercial,'' Boublil says. ``'Martin Guerre' is
somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching on issues of identity, sexuality, religion and the role
of society vs. the individual, the story of Martin Guerre is one of
those peculiarly French narratives with a universal ring, like the
Joan of Arc legend or the Dreyfus Affair.
</P>
<P>
   The essential facts are these: During the 16th-century religious
wars, a beautiful French peasant woman, Bertrande de Rols,
announced that the man she'd claimed for the past three years as
her husband, Martin Guerre, really was an impostor, a man from a
nearby village named Arnaud du Thil. A trial was held in Toulouse,
at which the real Martin Guerre turned up at the last minute to
unmask Arnaud. The court sentenced Arnaud to death and ordered the
chastened Bertrande to return to her real husband.
</P>
<P>
   The incident didn't become legend until the chief trial judge,
Jean de Coras, wrote a best-selling tell-all about it. The Martin
Guerre story subsequently has inspired philosophical essays,
poetry, plays and novels.
</P>
<P>
   Outside France, it's probably best-known from ``The Return of
Martin Guerre,'' Daniel Vigne's 1982 French feature film starring
Gerard Depardieu. It was remade in 1993 as ``Sommersby,'' with
Richard Gere and Jodie Foster, with the action transposed to the
American South following the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the subject seemed tailor-made for Boublil and
Schonberg, whose thoughtful and literate but broadly accessible
shows occupy a groove between the glossy romanticism of Andrew
Lloyd Webber and the highbrow angst of Stephen Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   After taking their initial cues from the French movie, Boublil
and Schonberg decided they didn't want to make their musical into a
mystery, in which the ersatz Martin Guerre's true identity isn't
revealed until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want to make a suspense musical, (because) why
would you go and see it again then?'' Boublil reasons. What's more,
he says, the theater audience immediately knows that Arnaud isn't
Martin Guerre because the characters are played by different
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the authors wanted to focus on the relationship between
Arnaud and Bertrande, and to examine the depth of Bertrande's
complicity in pretending that Arnaud is Martin, his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be something in every man's mind, like probably he
would like to be in his best friend's woman's bed without anyone
knowing it's him,'' Boublil says. ``That problem of identity, and
hidden identity, and who you are and who you'd like to be, and who
you are living with or who you would like to live with, and the
truth between who you can be and who you are only able to be, the
Martin Guerre story kind of embodies all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Morrison agrees that the story's sexual frisson is part
of what makes ``Martin Guerre'' tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slightly `Romeo and Juliet,' in that there's something
slightly verboten between (the two main characters) that sort of
adds to the potency,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Originally budgeted at $6 million, the show opened in London's
West End in July, 1996, to decidedly mixed notices from the
national press (``Wit-free and relentlessly predictable'' _ Daily
Telegraph). Still, after the show was briefly shut down and
reworked, it ran for 700 performances and captured Britain's
Olivier Award for Best New Musical.
</P>
<P>
   But its authors still felt that ``Martin Guerre'' was a small
musical trapped inside a big musical's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to write on this scale,'' Schonberg says.
``It's like running a mile. You want to maintain your pace so you
don't run out of oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Working closely with the tenacious Mackintosh, they decided to
remount the show at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, England,
whose artistic director, Jude Kelly, is regarded as one of
Britain's most talented and innovative young theater artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jude Kelly thought we had not finished our work,'' Boublil
says, ``and that's when we all got together, (set designer) John
Napier, the new team who did the new show.''
</P>
<P>
   With a revamped libretto, several new songs, additional lyrics
by Boublil and Stephen Clark, a new director (Morrison) and a cast
trimmed to 24, this leaner ``Martin Guerre'' was deemed worthy of
hopping the pond to North America. It launched its current tour at
Minneapolis' 1,400-seat Guthrie Theatre last September before
moving on to Detroit; Washington, D.C.; Seattle; and the Ahmanson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, however it fares in Los Angeles, its artistic team won't
feel its work is done until ``Martin Guerre'' marches into the
Manhattan promised land.
</P>
<P>
   After that, says Boublil, who knows? Schonberg is working on an
adaptation of ``Wuthering Heights'' for the English National
Ballet, but the duo aren't previewing any future projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did `Les Miz,' it happened to be very different than
anything else that existed, and we have changed something in the
way that musical theater has been done since,'' Boublil says. ``And
it's exciting to think that you can still do that _ maybe.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Museum of Television and Radio's annual William S. Paley
Television Festival, a series of evenings honoring various TV shows
and pioneers, generally offers a mix of genuinely classic
television, some series too new for the participants to offer much
historical perspective, and outright padding. This year's
assortment offers fewer of the dubious choices but more recent
series. The festival runs Feb. 29-March 14.
</P>
<P>
   One genuine must-see event, ``An Evening With Garry Shandling,''
kicks off the festival on Feb. 29. Shandling, an undisputed
original, is notoriously reticent about discussing or accepting
praise for his work, so this will be a rare opportunity to watch
him squirm up close.
</P>
<P>
   Paley Festival events usually screen an episode or two of a
program before those who worked on it begin their discussion; in
Shandling's case, a reel of career highlights will be shown before
he takes questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Classic series ``MASH,'' ``The Carol Burnett Show'' and ``Outer
Limits'' will be honored. The ``MASH'' event (March 6) will feature
Alan Alda and cast members and writers from throughout the show's
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Carol Burnett Show'' (March 3) will include the entire
cast and some writers of the variety show, and they'll no doubt cut
up and laugh over one another instead of sticking to the script
during the Q&AMP;A portion of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   As a science-fiction anthology series, ``Outer Limits'' (March
10) didn't feature a permanent cast, so the evening will likely be
a spotty hodgepodge of incomplete memories. Nonetheless, some
decent names have been assembled, including Martin Landau and
Robert Culp, writer Harlan Ellison, ``American Beauty''
cinematographer Conrad Hall and former ``Star Trek'' executive
producer Robert Justman.
</P>
<P>
   New shows being feted include ``The West Wing'' (March 7),
``Once &AMP; Again'' (March 4) and ``Freaks and Geeks'' (March 11).
Second-season hits will include ``Will &AMP; Grace'' (March 1) and
``That '70s Show'' (March 13) and ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' (March 8). All
series' principles before and behind the camera will be on hand in
each of these events.
</P>
<P>
   The anarchic tykes of ``South Park'' will likewise be enshrined
in a museum event March 3 featuring creators Trey Parker and Matt
Stone as well as other behind-the-scenes talents. Chris Elliott's
cult comedy ``Get a Life,'' about a 30-year-old paperboy still
living with his parents, will be deconstructed March 9. And Fred
Coe, producer of live dramas during TV's golden age, will be
honored March 14. &QL; 
______
</P>
<P>
   All events will be at the Directors Guild of America, 7920
Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles. Tickets are $15 and are on sale to the
general public now at the Museum of Television and Radio, 465 N.
Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. More information is available from
the festival hot line, (310) 786-1016, or the museum, (310)

TWO BRITISH INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Two of Britain's best-known insurance companies, CGU
PLC and Norwich Union PLC, announced Monday that they would merge
in a $12 billion stock swap that analysts depicted as a shield
against continental European predators.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would create Europe's fifth-largest insurer, with a
market value of around $28.3 billion. That would rank it close in
size to Britain's top insurer, Prudential PLC, but far behind
continental European insurance giants like Allianz of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took a dim view of the news. Norwich Union shares
dropped by as much as 9.8 percent and CGU lost up to 5.7 percent,
reflecting the perception that the absence of a premium offered no
cash reward to institutional investors. That in turn inspired
speculation that the deal could be threatened by a counterbid from
one of the big continental European insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after last year's acquisition of the British insurer
Guardian Royal Exchange by the AXA insurance company of France and
a wave of consolidation in Britain's financial-services market,
``it has long been perceived that the U.K. has been ripe for
another takeover or consolidation of this kind,'' said Chris
Rathbone, an analyst at the Williams de Broe brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Norwich Union shareholders would receive 0.48 of
a share in the new company, to be called CGNU, while CGU
shareholders would receive one new share for each CGU share.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement valued Norwich Union, Britain's fifth-largest
insurer, at 382.3 pence a share, 12 percent less than the price
when markets closed on Friday. The deal would give CGU shareholders
some 58.5 percent of the combined group, while Norwich Union
shareholders would control about 41.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But with both companies' share prices tumbling Monday, ``you
cannot rule out the possibility of a counterbid,'' said Trevor May,
an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The ferment in the insurance business is driven in part by the
prospect of rich pickings in the pensions business, as aging
societies in continental Europe force governments to consider
dismantling elaborate social networks.
</P>
<P>
   The shift towards private pension financing has been under way
much longer in Britain, where insurance companies are seen as
having accumulated valuable expertise coveted by their continental
rivals. At the same time, British companies say they are eyeing new
opportunities in continental Europe that resulted from the shift
away from state pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Scott, the chief executive of CGU, who would become the
chief executive of the combined group, said the merger would give
the new company more power in the growing market in continental
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that combining our resources will enable us to make
a much better job of pushing into the European life and savings
arena,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the merger would cost some $560 million as the two
companies shed some 5,000 of their 70,000 jobs _ 4,000 of them in
Britain _ the deal is expected to create annual savings of $400
million. The merged group will control global premium income and
retail investment sales of some $41.6 billion, with over $320
billion in assets under management, and will rely on life insurance
for 53.7 percent of its premiums.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pace of consolidation is made all the more brisk by intense
competition in Britain for new business, as insurers seek to offset
lower margins on premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That was illustrated Monday when United Assurance Group, a
British insurer with a market value of $2.4 billion, said it was
having talks with Royal London Mutual Insurance Society. The
negotiations could lead to a bid for United, which focuses on
door-to-door sales.

FCC DEBATES WHO SHOULD PAY FOR CELL-PHONE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A debate is raging at the Federal Communications Commission
about whether cellular telephone customers should pay to receive
calls as well as to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular companies have pressed for a rule change that would
extend the ``calling party pays'' model of traditional telephone
billing to wireless calls.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC had been scheduled to vote on final rules for such a
system last Thursday, giving cellular companies the option of
adopting caller-pays billing systems. But the vote was canceled
amid continued wrangling among commissioners, lobbyists and staff
members. The commission could still reach a decision over the next
few weeks, but with heavy lobbying from all sides, the process
could well stretch into the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the wireless industry's ability to become a true
competitor in the $100 billion local communications business. More
than 80 million American consumers now use wireless phones, but
only for very few of them has wireless become a true replacement
for the standard home telephone.
</P>
<P>
   When the telephone rings at home, people in the United States
generally answer without worrying about fees. Unless the call is
made ``collect,'' any charges will be the responsibility of the
person who placed the call.
</P>
<P>
   But as anyone with a cellular phone knows, wireless subscribers
almost invariably pay for incoming as well as outgoing calls. That
is a big reason that many wireless users do not give their numbers
to others and generally leave their phones off.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the rise of so-called ``one rate'' plans, pioneered by
AT&AMP;T, which eliminate roaming fees and long-distance charges,
subscribers still pay for incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residential local phone markets remain generally de
facto monopolies, dominated by the regional Bell companies and a
handful of independent operators including GTE Corp., which has
agreed to merge with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and wireless executives believe that eliminating
wireless fees for incoming calls _ as most other countries have
done _ could go a long way toward making wireless carriers viable
long-term competitors to local phone monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a level playing field with the local phone
companies,'' Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of Sprint Corp.'s
wireless unit, Sprint PCS, said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at almost every other country in the world, they
all have calling-party pays as a standard. In those countries where
you have calling-party pays, you have a much higher percentage of
people giving out their number and using it for inbound calls. In
this country there is a lot more hesitancy to give out the
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless carriers are not prohibited from offering calling-party
pays. But with the FCC having spent the last few years studying the
issue, few carriers have been willing to bring such plans broadly
into the market until they know what the commission's national
rules will be.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's wireless unit, for instance, began a trial
program in Delaware last November called ``Call Me,'' but has not
expanded the plan past a ``couple of thousand'' subscribers,
according to a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   As a general proposition, many of the communications
commissioners appear to agree that fostering calling-party pays
could increase overall competition between wired and wireless phone
operators, according to people close to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But there are big hurdles concerning consumer protection and the
internal financial structure of a caller-pays system that must be
cleared before any consensus can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding consumers, the most important issue is to make sure
that people who dial a wireless subscriber who uses a caller-pays
plan are made aware that they will be charged, and how much.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who makes a conventional telephone call from the United
States to, say, Kazakhstan, is not told the charges. But the caller
presumably has a reasonable expectation that the fee will be
substantial, if only because of making an international call to a
place so far away.
</P>
<P>
   The complication posed by a caller-pays system in the wireless
sector is that a call to what appears to be a local number could in
fact incur big per-minute ``roaming'' fees because the user is
traveling on the other side of the continent. Without some sort of
notification, the caller would have no way of knowing about those
fees until a bill arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless carriers appear to be in favor of less notification
rather than more. Sukawaty said that in five years a mere tone
before a call was connected could suffice to notify callers that
they were reaching a wireless number that incurs a charge.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where the caller-pays system is generally the rule,
wireless phone numbers usually include one digit more than do
traditional lines. So while European callers do not hear a
notification message, the additional digit indicates that
additional fees may apply.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, many communications experts say it would
not be feasible to add another digit to wireless numbers, if only
because the cost of modifying communications switches across the
nation could be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   It is also somewhat simpler for European carriers to implement
caller-pays systems, because most wireless companies in Europe own
nationwide licenses, reducing the prevalence of roaming fees. In
the United States, few wireless carriers own licenses for the
entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is thought to be leaning toward a substantial
notification system _ one that would require that a caller hear a
message indicating what the charge will be and that would give the
caller an opportunity to disconnect before incurring any fees at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the conventional local phone companies appear to hope
that extensive notification messages would discourage people from
calling wireless subscribers who use a calling-party-pays plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other major issue that stands in the way of consensus on a
caller-pays system is one that would not be obvious to most
consumers but which is vitally important for the carriers: billing.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, local phone companies are no longer obliged to
include the services of other companies on their bills. That is why
some consumers now receive separate bills from their local and
long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Extending that logic, some local phone giants are arguing before
the commission that they should not be obliged to include charges
on their bills for calls their customers make to wireless phones
under a caller-pays system.
</P>
<P>
   If that argument succeeded, it could mean that consumers might
receive separate bills from various wireless carriers. Or,
alternatively, they could be forced to use a credit card to make
such calls in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   All of the complications strike some consumer advocates as
ridiculous. They argue that people who choose wireless phones
should pay for their use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is one of the silliest ideas to hit the policy
arena,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office
of Consumers Union, a consumer-advocacy group. ``The notion that
people who don't use wireless phones should pay extra to reach
people who are using the new technology is just absurd.''

`BEOWULF': FATE AND BEOWULF MEET IN A MODERN POET'S LENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics.) 
(Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seamus Heaney's ``Beowulf'' rises from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the minutely few who mastered Anglo-Saxon in graduate
school (of the merely very few who struggled with it), our first
English classic, read in translation, has been a museum piece. We
patrolled it dutifully with a sense of importance, a flash or two
of insight and sore feet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he did in his great archaeological poems _ ``The Tollund
Man,'' for instance _ Heaney drops a ladder deep into the literary
Cenozoic. It is not excavation but a dialogue in situ. Addressing
the same mummified figure we once addressed _ with whatever
interest but little love _ he breaks our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney's verse rendition of the epic's 3,182 lines has
percolated for 15 years. The excavation became a double one: into
the poet's own national, poetic and linguistic roots as well as the
poem's.
</P>
<P>
   His Beowulf is no Geat in modern get-up (the monster-slayer
belonged to a Scandinavian people of that name). This translation
does something other than bring him up into our time. It transports
us to his and lets us wander there; after which home will never
seem entirely the same.
</P>
<P>
   Take the notion of fate. Yes, we had learned that this is what
those murky figures with consonant-clotted names _ Ecgtheow, Hygd _
are about as they splash through northern meres and mists, hacking
at ogres or each other with iron swords and wooden shields.
</P>
<P>
   Dark and strange, it seems; and we are not likely to recall that
the lucid light and language of Greek tragedy rested upon, though
it did not rest in, a sense of fate. Heaney brings the light and
the lucidity. His Beowulf circles with fate as humanly and
naturally as a woodcutter maneuvers around his falling trees.
</P>
<P>
   As Beowulf goes into the three battles of the epic: his
victories against the cannibal monsters Grendel and Grendel's
mother and, after a prosperous 50-year reign, his fatal combat with
the ``wyrm'' (dragon), we get lines like:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Whichever one death fells
</P>
<P>
   must deem it a just judgment by God.
</P>
<P>
   If Grendel wins, it will be a gruesome day ... .
</P>
<P>
   Then my face won't be there
</P>
<P>
   to be covered in death: he will carry me away
</P>
<P>
   as he goes to ground, gorged and bloodied ... .
</P>
<P>
   No need then
</P>
<P>
   to lament for long or lay out my body ... .
</P>
<P>
   Fate goes ever as fate must. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And as an old man, going out to rid his land of the wyrm, while
knowing he will perish:
 &UR; He was sad at heart,
</P>
<P>
   unsettled yet ready, sensing his death. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And, after receiving his mortal wound:
 &UR; For the son of Ecgtheow, it was no easy thing
</P>
<P>
   To have to give ground like that and go
</P>
<P>
   Unwillingly to inhabit another home
</P>
<P>
   In a place beyond; so every man must yield
</P>
<P>
   The leasehold of his days. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As belief in salvation allowed the religious martyrs to undergo
all kinds of painful handling, belief in fate does something
similar for the figures in the ``Beowulf'' epic. Each is a means of
stepping out of your own self so you can dispatch it, respectively,
toward the stake or an ogre's supper.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hamlet's ``to be or not to be'' was the ``not to be so as
to be'' of the martyr and the pagan warrior. Has this abstract
notion ever come so alive? Heaney's translation beats with a
recurring pulse, from homely and concrete to elevated and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   The great battle scenes are rendered with a power and grisly
horror both increased and made oddly transparent by a freshness and
innocence of diction. Beowulf tells of a battle with sea monsters:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ... in the morning, mangled and sleeping
</P>
<P>
   the sleep of the sword, they slopped and floated
</P>
<P>
   like the ocean's leavings. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After the fearsome struggle in which Beowulf rips off Grendel's
arm and shoulder, the monster flees, ``hasped and hooped and
hirpling with pain.'' He retreats to his fen
 &UR; exhausted in spirit
</P>
<P>
   and beaten in battle, bloodying the path,
</P>
<P>
   hauling his doom to the demons' mere.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshot water wallowed and surged,
</P>
<P>
   There were loathsome upthrows and overturnings
</P>
<P>
   Of waves and gore and wound-slurry.  &LR;  In sustaining contrast is
the lyricism, quiet yet immediate, of the small passages. (``I ...
have wintered into wisdom,'' the aging Danish king tells Beowulf,
his deliverer, discoursing on the vanity of power.) Morning comes
(``a hurry of brightness/overran the shadows''). A sense of evening
pervades the most rousing actions. Heaney renders the sunset light,
sadly or wryly or even with gaiety.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating, performing or recalling his great deeds, Beowulf
remains intently human. Not by substituting a present colloquial
for the old strangenesses: ``word-hoard'' for language,
``wave-vat'' for sea, ``ring-giver'' for king, and once, at least,
``battle-torch'' for sword. However, Heaney writes _ in a preface
that is part biography, part a testament of faith in language and
all shining essay _ ``I have tended to follow modern usage and in
the main have called a sword a sword.''
</P>
<P>
   We chew vertically; we read horizontally. Much of the Old
English chewiness _ the rigorous alliterations, the craggy
epithets, the caesuras in the middle of each four-beat line _ has
been retained, but some has been softened. An epic must flow to
remain alive. Heaney's flow of language, action and character is
poetry's fight against dying.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who will mind. Alfred Davis, an Old English
scholar, was detailed to keep an eye on Heaney by Norton, whose
editors commissioned the translation in the mid-1980s for its
Anthology of English Literature. (Later it arranged to share
publication with Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). ``Nevertheless, I was
often reluctant to follow his advice and persisted many times in
what we both knew were erroneous ways,'' Heaney writes.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least as fortunate as, and of course less bloody than,
Nelson's clapping his blind eye to his spyglass so as not to see
the signal to retreat. Translation is not mainly the work of
preserving the hearth _ a necessary task performed by scholarship _
but of letting a fire burn in it.

 &HT;    Computerized leg anticipates, regulates stride
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stacey Rice's tennis triumphs dangle from her red
equipment bag in the form of Atlanta Lawn Tennis Association
medals. She won them using her quick-pivoting wheelchair, which she
maneuvers with a swing of the hips.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 36-year-old faces an even greater challenge than
wheelchair tennis: playing the game fully upright.
</P>
<P>
   She has just been fitted with a computerized artificial leg that
allows her to bend both knees for ground strokes, put all her
strength behind a serve and slam home a backhand _ things her chair
just wouldn't allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played tennis before I lost my leg, so this stand-up
tennis is going to take some getting used to,'' Rice said Sunday
while hitting a few bright yellow balls with her purple racket, a
Wilson Sledge Hammer. ``My timing is way off. In wheelchair tennis,
the ball bounces twice to give us time to recover. And I'm used to
being lower to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she lost much of her right leg to bone cancer at age 15,
Rice has tackled many new activities: scuba diving, sky diving and
throwing the javelin in the Paralympic Games. Doubles tennis may be
next. What's giving her the chance to step up to the service line
is a new high-tech artificial leg called C-Leg, short for
computerized leg.
</P>
<P>
   Using a microcomputer placed behind the metal kneecap, hydraulic
controls and two tiny motors, the electronic knee of the C-Leg
regulates the rhythm of a wearer's walk and provides resistance
when the knee bends. While other companies make artificial legs
with flexible knees controlled by computerized electronics, the
C-Leg _ made by Otto Bock Orthopedic Industry Inc. _ is the first
system that anticipates and regulates movement, explained Will
Holbrook of Atlanta Prosthetics &AMP; Orthotics in Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time when the heel of the C-Leg touches the ground
until when it touches the heel on that same side again, the
electronic system is moving the knee at the rate of 50 times a
second,'' Holbrook said. Or as a beaming John Bagley said upon
trying out his new leg _ arriving just in time for his 30th
birthday: ``It's like having a prosthetist inside my knee making
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagley, who lives in Bold Springs,Ga., and breeds horses, is
missing his left arm, right leg below the knee and left leg above
the knee. Run over by a train in 1994 while working for a railroad
company, Bagley is believed to be the first triple amputee to use
the new C-Leg. He wears it only on his left leg because his right
leg uses a different type of extension and foot attached to his
remaining knee joint.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, Bagley and Curtis Lee were the first people in the
Southeast _ and among just 30 in the country _ to be fitted with
the C-Leg. They gathered last week at the Atlanta Prosthetics and
Orthotics to have the devices fitted and to attend a two-day
instructional workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel within 15 minutes I was walking better,'' said
Lee, a 23-year-old who lost his lower right leg after a
work-related accident. ``It felt almost normal when I put it on. I
should be able to go down ramps, steps, hills much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lee was one of 200,000 Americans who annually become
amputees, either from trauma, diabetes, infections, birth defects
or other illnesses. About 70 percent undergo leg amputations. The
C-Leg took five years to develop, and does not come cheap. The
total system costs about $50,000. Rice, Lee and Bagley's private
health insurance plans or workman's compensation coverage have all
agreed to pick up the charges. However, many insurance plans are
likely to question the need for such a sophisicated leg because
they ``just want to get amputees back up walking,'' said Larry
Rice, Stacey's husband, who is a prosthetist.
</P>
<P>
   The price is two to three times the cost of the more cumbersome
devices that the threesome were happy to take off for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This old leg, it's pathetic,'' Bagley said. ``This once was
the most high-tech leg on the market but there was only one setting
on it. I wanted to drive a standard transmission but I couldn't.
Now I should be able to.''
</P>
<P>
   The C-Leg will fit an amputee weighing up to 220 pounds. It's
made for active people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do run with it on,'' said Todd Anderson, a prosthetist
and technical manager with Otto Bock. ``They can't sprint. But it
is your 99-percent-of-life-activity leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee then demonstrated one such activity most people never think
twice about.
</P>
<P>
   Step by brick step, he walked down the front stoop of the
prosthetics office. He descended like an able-bodied person, knees
bending and weight shifting, except that he moved more tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go step over step,'' Lee said. ``Before, I went down
stairs sideways, with one leg at a time. I haven't been able to go
down like this. But the leg knows what it's doing. Until I put it
on and tried it, I didn't think it was going to be that good.''
</P>
<P>
   A custom-molded socket and suction connect the artificial leg to
a person's remaining upper limb.
</P>
<P>
   Most amputees treat their artificial legs like shoes, taking
them off to sleep and shower. Cosmetic covers are available to make
the device look more realistic, less bionic.
</P>
<P>
   But many amputees, such as Lee, don't care about hiding what
they don't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be open about it and to let people know that I have
an artificial leg,'' said Lee, who sports short, bleached hair and
a gold earring in his left ear. ``Just because you lose a limb,
your life is not over.'' Lee who lives in Jackson County, Ga.,
plans to test his new leg while hunting and fishing near his North
Georgia home.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his new clients raved about the new C-leg, Anderson
threw a reality check to the prosthetists who had just spent two
days learning how to program and adjust it. ``They're still going
to be amputees, and it's still an artificial leg,'' he said. ``It's
not magic. It's not the real thing. It's just a big step up. And it
still needs a person with fortitude and great motivation to use
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One such person is Rice, who is a minivan-driving mom to three
children, ages 9 months to 13 years, in addition to being a skilled
athlete and a coach to kids in the ALTA wheelchair division. To
date, she's gone through eight artificial legs but she thinks she's
finally found one that can keep up with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an amputee for 21 years and I've seen my share of
prosthetic devices,'' she said while trying the blue, shiny metal
leg on the rolling green slope of her front lawn. ``I did not
believe this could be as good as the videotape showed it to be. But
it is. I have total confidence in this leg.''

   Sex in the city: It helps sell Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   By Don O'Briant
</P>
<P>
   The March issue of Atlanta ($3.50) features a cover story on the
best lawyers in town, but the most intriguing article is Rebecca
Poynor Burns' expose of the city's sex business. Did you know, for
example, that you have a better chance of living next door to an
exotic dancer than to an employee of the Coca-Cola Co.? And that
the economic impact of nude dance clubs is greater than that of the
Atlanta Braves, the Atlanta Falcons and the Atlanta Hawks combined?
Despite moral protests, some officials say that nude dancing clubs
are the main reason Atlanta is a favorite destination for
conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rappers and rednecks: This month's Talk ($3.50) offers a
smorgasbord of subjects, from Jennifer Lopez and Sean ``Puffy''
Combs to Atlanta comedian Jeff Foxworthy. Why would a woman who has
transformed herself into a Hollywood diva risk it all for Combs?
It's love, she says. Of course, as one Los Angeles producer
observes, ``One false move, and she's Charo.'' In the Foxworthy
article, writer Eddie Dean notes that, although the ``You Might Be
a Redneck'' comedian lives in an exclusive gated community, he
knows his unsophisticated audience. They're the ones, he says,
who've ``got a few hundred dollars in the bank and the car's making
weird noises.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Entertaining politics: The most exciting political story these
days isn't the presidential campaign, but a weekly television
series. Both Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) and Brill's Content
($3.95) devote their covers to ``The West Wing,'' and both conclude
that the show does a better job of presenting a true picture of
political life than most journalists do.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to ``West Wing's'' success is Aaron Sorkin, 38,
a writer who relies on real-life politicos such as former Clinton
Press Secretary Dee Dee Meyers and former Carter administration
pollster Pat Caddell to sharpen the story lines and the dialogue.
Brill's Content writer Matthew Miller singles out a November
episode as an example of how the show teaches viewers about
government. More than one-third of that episode _ almost 15 minutes
_ focused on a plot line that gave a detailed explanation of the
impact of census tabulations. In comparison, Miller writes, the
network news devoted slightly more than two minutes to the census
in all of 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Donald: In his career as a free-lance journalist, Atlanta
writer Tom Junod has hung out with Tony Curtis, shared a bed (sort
of) with Nicole Kidman and seen Mr. Rogers naked. His latest
adventure, as brilliantly reported in Esquire ($3), is spending a
day on the golf course with Donald Trump and Ray Floyd. Trump,
Junod writes, is solicitous of the writer's mother, assigns
nicknames to people he's met only once, and is an incurable
backslapper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Self-interview: Premiere ($3.50) cuts out the middleman in its
cover story about Ben Affleck by letting the actor write about
himself. It's kind of refreshing for a celebrity to admit, as
Affleck does, that he wants to promote his movie ``Reindeer
Games,'' and therefore he has to do interviews with movie
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Art &AMP; Antiques ($4.95) offers a comprehensive
guide to the top treasures of the 20th century, including Dorothy's
ruby slippers in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' the 1964 Ford Mustang,
Jackson Pollock's painting ``Autumn Rhythm,'' Pablo Picasso's
``Three Musicians'' and Ansel Adams' photograph ``Moon Over New
Mexico.'' ... As guest editor for Marie Claire ($2.50), Brooke
Shields agreed to spend the night in an igloo in the Arctic with
her friend Chris Henchy and write about it. Very romantic, but very
cold, she says. ... Jane ($2.50) reports that Hollywood's hottest
health fad is Qi Gong. ``It is a beautiful dance,'' says Qi Gong
enthusiast Michael Stipe. ``A lot of the work I do with Master Liu
is almost like original tai chi.'' Qi Gong (pronounced chee-gong)
is an ancient Chinese philosophy that uses acupuncture, herbs,
exercise, diet and treatments for stress reduction.

EUROPE CONCERNED ABOUT MCI-SPRINT MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Commission's antitrust
regulators said Monday that they had ``serious concerns'' about the
plans of MCI Worldcom to acquire Sprint Corp. for $130 billion and
that they would carry out an intensive four-month investigation
into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation could easily cause MCI heartburn and may force
it to give up some of its high-speed Internet backbone networks to
satisfy regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In a toughly worded statement from Brussels, Belgium, the
commission's competition ministry said it was worried that the two
companies would control nearly 50 percent of the worldwide market
for Internet backbones _ the main conduits through which Internet
traffic flows before branching off into local connections. The
commission said that MCI controlled 30 percent to 40 percent of
this business and Sprint controlled a further 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said it was also worried about the combined
company's ability to dominate telephone links between the United
States and Europe. And it expressed concern about a merged
company's ability to control most of the market for services to
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, in a brief statement Monday, said it would
cooperate with the investigation but was confident that it would
win approval in time to complete the merger this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Though the deal is between two U.S. companies, the European
Commission has frequently invoked its authority to challenge
transactions in which the merging companies have significant
operations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When MCI and Worldcom agreed to merge in 1998, the commission
forced MCI to sell overlapping Internet networks. In doing so, it
pushed Worldcom beyond its original settlement proposal and
demanded that the company not try to win back customers from the
networks it had sold.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the competition ministry showed its mettle in
Europe by blocking a three-way multimedia alliance in Germany
involving Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom and the Kirch Group of
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the case against MCI Worldcom and Sprint was
hardly straightforward. Sprint has had no meaningful presence in
Europe since it reached an agreement late last month to pull out of
Global One, a joint venture with Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom that provides networking services for multinational
corporations. France Telecom is buying out both Sprint and Deutsche
Telekom and taking full control of Global One.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sprint does have Internet backbone services in the United
States and elsewhere, it stayed out of Europe precisely because of
its former partnerships with the French and German phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the commission said that Sprint's withdrawal
from Global One was not enough to satisfy its concerns. ``Given the
negligible involvement of Global One in the market for top-level
Internet connectivity,'' the statement said, ``this undertaking
could not remove the serious doubts raised.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Susen Sarkar, a senior analyst at Yankee Group Europe, a
research and consulting firm, said the merger would do little to
change the balance of power in Europe _ particularly given the
rapid construction of high-speed fiber-optic networks by companies
that include Mannesmann of Germany, KPN Qwest of the Netherlands
and Level 3 of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that this sort of concern doesn't really hold
water in the context of all the fiber being put in the ground,''
Sarkar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tscherney, a spokesman for the competition ministry,
said European regulators had received complaints about the deal
from companies here.
</P>
<P>
   The merger already faces scrutiny in the United States by the
antitrust division of the Justice Department as well as the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   One possible reason for additional European concern is that U.S.
companies continue to dominate the Internet's underlying network
structure. Many European Web sites are operated through computers
in the United States, with the result that much European Internet
traffic makes a round trip across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   While Sprint has little presence in Europe, MCI Worldcom has
already completed much of its pan-European network, called Ulysses.
In addition to providing long-distance fiber-optic networks between
cities, the network links high-speed local networks that serve
corporate customers.

BRADLEY, COURTING HISPANICS, CALLS FOR NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Courting the Hispanic vote, former Sen. Bill Bradley
stopped at a Brooklyn elementary school Monday morning and spoke
about the need for universal health insurance, noting the
disproportionate numbers of Latinos among the uninsured and
questioning Vice President Al Gore's commitment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore's attacks against his plan ``have cast doubt
on his commitment to a basic plank of the Democratic platform,
which is national health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley quoted figures from a recent Census Bureau study that
found that despite a strong economy, the numbers of uninsured
Americans grew to 44 million in 1998, including 11 million
children. Hispanics, the study found, were least likely to have
health coverage. More than a third of Hispanics were uninsured,
compared with 22.2 percent of blacks, 21.1 percent of
Asian-Americans and 11.9 percent of non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work, sometimes two jobs,'' Bradley said of the
uninsured. ``Their employers just don't provide health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a small audience at Public School 24, a new
dual-language (Spanish and English) elementary school in the
working-class neighborhood of Sunset Park, Bradley also outlined
his proposals to double federal Title I financing for schools in
poor neighborhoods, require teachers to prove their expertise in
the subjects they teach and offer scholarships and other incentives
to recruit teachers to needy rural and urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, he called for the need to spread the benefits of a
booming economy to the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be fixing our roof when the sun is shining,'' he
said, ``and the sun is shining now. There's a difference between
economic growth and broad-based prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions from the audience after the speech,
Bradley expressed his unequivocal support for bilingual education
programs as ``an important bridge'' and pledged to double a federal
block grant for affordable child care.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would end weapons testing by the U.S. Navy on
the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico. Gore has adopted the same
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing in Vieques should end,'' Bradley said. ``We should not
use it for live fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, President Clinton ordered a moratorium on all
training on Vieques after a Puerto Rican was killed in a bombing
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo Quinones, 53, a social worker from Sunset Park who asked
Bradley about Vieques, said he was gladdened by the vehemence of
the candidate's reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he follows through,'' Quinones said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley picked up the endorsement of Angel Rodriguez, a city
councilman from the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn who described
Bradley's priorities on health care, education and economic
development as the priorities of the Latino community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our issues are the nation's issues,'' Rodriguez said.

<P>
   MONTREAL _ It is just steel and stone, a rough line scratched
across an immense and largely empty landscape. But for much of the
last century, as the whistle of Canadian National freight trains
pierced the northern night, the ``government railroad,'' as CN was
known, helped define Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The grand old railroad ran from east to west, and so did
Canadian commerce _ even with American markets lying seductively
close to the border. So long as there was a separate Canadian
market, and a separate Canadian railway, generations of politicians
vowed, there would be a separate Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the current president of Canadian National Railway Co.,
Paul M. Tellier, has a different vision of the railroad, of Canada
and the American continent _ a vision that some people on both
sides of the border reject. Though his focus remains
transcontinental, he is looking south, across the U.S. border and
beyond that into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Tellier wants to merge the Montreal-based CN with a giant
American railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., and create
the most titanic railroad this continent has ever seen. The
behemoth would have 50,000 miles of track, combined annual revenues
of $12.5 billion, freight service to 32 states and eight Canadian
provinces, and cross-border access from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to
Mexico City to Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $6 billion rail pact is important for what it says
about one of America's oldest industries as well as what it shows
about how North America is changing. Perhaps more than any other
symbol, the alliance would underscore how far the formation of a
truly integrated continental economy has developed in the six years
since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a change in the mind of the peoples of North
America,'' said Halina Ostrovski, president of the Canadian Council
for the Americas, an economics-oriented research organization in
Toronto. ``They now see the three countries as one big market.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is willing to accept the vision of the new railroad
or the changes it represents. In the United States, shippers and
unions, burned by service disruptions after other big rail mergers,
oppose the deal, a cashless transaction that would create a new
holding company, North American Railways. Competing railroads have
warned that another merger at this time would push the industry
into a final round of consolidations that would end with just two
enormous networks to serve the entire continent of North America.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, shippers and farmers are worried that the merger
would reduce what little competition exists _ CN's only national
rival is Canadian Pacific Railway Co. And fervent nationalists see
the proposed merger as the loss of a revered national symbol and
the last spike in the dream of an independent, sovereign Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would probably not have the western part of the country in
Canada today if not for these railways,'' said David Orchard, a
prairie farmer and chairman of a Canadian group called Citizens
Concerned About Free Trade. ``This merger would be a betrayal of
everything that the founders of the country fought for.''
</P>
<P>
   Both freight lines are led by headstrong executives determined
to drag American railroads into a new era. Robert D. Krebs of the
Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern is a bred-in-the-bone
railroad man, with 34 years' experience running American trains.
Tellier, who joined CN eight years ago, is a former civil servant
with a passion for Descartes.
</P>
<P>
   The combined railroad, they say, makes perfect economic sense.
North-South traffic across the borders is expanding at a rate of 10
percent to 15 percent a year, while east-west traffic is rising no
more than 4 percent annually. U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has
continued to grow even when trade with many other countries
flattened out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing in North America is what you would expect
from the development of a free trading zone, but in many ways it
goes beyond that,'' said Jorge O. Mariscal, a managing director at
Goldman Sachs. ``It's now engulfing banking, telecommunications and
transportation in a quite remarkable way.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroads have taken pains to present the deal as a merger
of equals. Burlington Northern and CN would keep their own offices,
and their locomotives would continue to be painted with their
separate corporate logos.
</P>
<P>
   But the balance of power seems to tip toward the Canadians. The
parent company, North American Railways, will be located in
Montreal, and, by Canadian law, the majority of board members must
be Canadian. Krebs, 66, would become non-executive chairman and
Tellier, 60, chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 billion North American freight railroad industry has
already slimmed down considerably in response to relentless
competition from trucking, which began offering transcontinental
service a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truckers have been eating our lunch every day of the week,''
Tellier said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades the number of large, independent _
so-called Class I _ freight lines has declined substantially. In
1980, 26 such freight railroads operated in the United States,
according to the Association of American Railroads. Today, just
seven are left. While that decline was due in part to changes in
the way railroads are categorized, there is no doubt that national
railroads have been forced to get bigger to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over the Burlington Northern-CN alliance has reached
the Surface Transportation Board, the U.S. regulatory agency with
the power to review, and possibly block, rail mergers. The board
has scheduled an unusual public hearing next month _ before the
formal merger application is even filed _ to look at the rail
industry's future.
</P>
<P>
   If railroad consolidation ``plays itself out to the endgame that
some feel it will,'' Linda J. Morgan, chairwoman of the board,
wrote in response to the merger announcement in December, ``this is
the final round.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The most recent consolidations _ CSX and Norfolk Southern's
absorption of Conrail and the Union Pacific's acquisition of the
Southern Pacific _ have not gone smoothly. Disgruntled shippers
continue to suffer delays and interruptions caused by the last
mergers and are in no mood for yet more consolidation. Led by the
Chemical Manufacturers Association, they have made their
displeasure known to regulators and to key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just ensures that politics is going to be the operative
word,'' said James M. Higgins, a railroad analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``It has become a political issue, and politics
is more about perception than reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory environment in Canada is quite different. The
only significant review will be undertaken by the federal
Competition Bureau, which will assess the merger's impact on
competition within Canada, where the two railroads' lines overlap
just for short stretches in Manitoba and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian legislators, particularly in the grain-growing
west, where farms, mines and manufacturing plants rely on efficient
rail service, are concerned that the combined railroad will favor
Burlington Northern's more heavily used and profitable western line
in the northern United States over Canadian National's parallel
route. ``The big issue in western Canada is lack of competition,''
said Reg Alcock, a ruling party member of Parliament from Winnipeg.
``We don't have many options.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tellier of Canadian National acknowledges that support is
growing for Canada's House of Commons to use a coming revision of
the Canadian Transportation Act to give federal officials new
powers to review mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was back in my previous job would I argue that it makes
sense for the government of Canada to bring an amendment to
Parliament?'' asked Tellier, who was clerk of the Privy Council,
which made him the top bureaucrat in Canada, before taking control
of CN in 1992. ``Sure it makes sense. Do I expect something like
this to be passed overnight? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   He accuses Canadian nationalists and the competing railroads of
playing on emotions to fight the merger. ``We're not going to get
into any kind of emotional debate or confrontation,'' he told
analysts at a meeting in New York. ``We're going forward in a very
rational, Cartesian fashion to make our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the emotions are real. Perhaps more than any other
nation, Canada used the building of the railroad to stitch
disparate colonies into a nation. The fledgling federal government
used the audacious promise of building a rail line across the empty
western prairies to entice the faraway province of British Columbia
to enter the confederation in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   The building of the Canadian Pacific and what later became the
Canadian National were heroic undertakings, spurred more by
national pride than economic sense. The cost was sizable, with
billions of dollars in subsidies going toward keeping the railroads
running.
</P>
<P>
   By 1919, a group of money-losing lines was taken over by the
government and combined to form Canadian National. In the early
1990s, CN was privatized. More than 60 percent of the shares are
held by American investors.
</P>
<P>
   Tellier said he had no patience for those who think the alliance
represents the Americanization of Canada. Last year, he bought the
Illinois Central and it was an open secret that he was shopping for
another American line, the Kansas City Southern, which is
part-owner of the recently privatized line from Mexico City to the
border that carries about 40 percent of Mexico's rail traffic.
</P>
<P>
   CN already has a 15-year marketing agreement with the Kansas
City Southern that gives it access to the Mexico City line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at a map, it would be a logical extension at one
point in time,'' Tellier said, suggesting that CN might go after
the Kansas City Southern again. He also said that an alliance with
a carrier in the Northeast is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Tellier is sometimes criticized for thinking like a government
official and not like the chief executive of a tradition-bound
business that he has become. But Krebs, of Burlington Northern, who
has spent his whole career in railroading, is also convinced that
running the trains on a continental basis is not only logical but
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market forces are demanding a transcontinental system,'' he
said. ``It's just a matter of time.''

SURFING WORKERS A GROWING PROBLEM IN OFFICES

<P>
   Corporate crackdowns on personal use of office computers
apparently have not kept employees from trading stocks and shopping
online at work.
</P>
<P>
   A new study shows Americans spent an average of 21 hours online
at work last month _ more than twice the amount they did at home _
partly because their employers offered faster connections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the top 10 Web sites accessed from the office clearly
had nothing to do with work, according to the survey by
Nielsen/NetRatings. They included MyFamily.com, where users can
create a virtual family reunion, and RootsWeb sites, where people
can research their family trees.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the most popular site both at home and at work was eBay,
an auction site offering everything from Beanie Babies to
limousines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is potentially a distraction for people,'' said Allen
Weiner, vice president of analytical services for Nielsen/Net
Ratings.
</P>
<P>
   From their office computers, employees were more likely to shop,
plan vacations, and browse news sites. Investment firms ETrade,
Charles Schwab, and Fidelity Investments showed up on the list of
most popular at-work sites _ evidence that many employees are
trading online during office hours.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which was based on the Internet use of 6,500
employees in January, also found that people were taking advantage
of fast connections at work to download music at MP3 and other Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to adult Internet sites declined during office time.
About 12 percent of users acessed pornographic sites at work,
compared to 23 percent at home. But the amount of time spent ogling
_ four minutes _ remained unchanged at both home and work.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees may not be aware that an increasing number of
companies are monitoring their mouse clicks, online experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, officials at Xerox Corp. of Stamford, Conn., looked
over its employees' shoulders and discovered that some workers were
gambling, trading stocks, and leering at nudes online. Forty
employees were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were spending two to four hours a day on
nonbusiness-related Internet sites,'' Xerox spokeswoman Christa
Carone said. ``At the end of the day, they weren't getting their
work done.''
</P>
<P>
   But some workers, especially those at technology and start-up
firms, believe long work hours entitle them to personal Internet
use on the job. And they believe their employers will overlook
their cyberslacking as long as it does not affect productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know (the rules), but they don't believe they're doing
anything wrong,'' said Dr. Kimberly Young, executive director of
the Center for Online Addiction. ``They're just answering personal
e-mail or making plans for vacation. It seems harmless.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, however, can't seem to put the brakes on their
personal Internet use. An Oregon public official, for instance, was
fired for spending too much time on eBay's auction site, Young
said. She had begun by selling jewelry online but became obsessed
about checking on bids and reading what other eBay users had said
about her in reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, like hers, it started off as a little side
business,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a way to eliminate Internet abuse, some companies are
using software to filter out gambling and adult sites, among
others. But before blocking a Web site, employers should ask
themselves whether they're actually making workers more productive,
online experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather have a person taking out their checkbook and
paying their bills for an hour or have them spend 10 minutes doing
them online?'' asked Weiner of NetRatings.

HOW WOULD GREAT COMPOSERS PLAY IT? SOME CLUES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who plays Beethoven, Mozart or Bach faces issues that
have plagued performers throughout the centuries: namely, the
composer's score provides scant guidance on how to approach many
facets of the music. Performers make educated guesses as to how
loudly to play individual notes, for instance, or how to accent
four consecutive quarter notes, but they remain guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dr. Manfred Clynes, a neuroscientist and concert pianist who
lives in Sonoma, Calif., has discovered what he says are clues as
to how exactly the masters would have wanted their pieces
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes, a former neuropsychology professor at the University of
Melbourne, who coined the term ``cyborg'' and has performed to the
acclaim of people like Yehudi Menuhin and Albert Einstein, has
identified what he says are patterns in the music of master
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Those patterns, or ``pulses,'' show how a composer favors louder
and longer notes at consistent points in a phrase, much as poets
resort to patterns of phrasing or painters favor certain brush
strokes. Clynes argues that similar patterns exist on higher levels
in musical compositions, like the way composers stress certain bars
in a movement.
</P>
<P>
   Performances of Beethoven, for instance, carry his
characteristic strength and intensity when, in four-note sequences,
the second note is played shorter and softer than the others,
whereas the notes in Mozart's sequences are more consistent in
length and amplitude.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries were made in a series of experiments that
built on the work of Gustav Becking, a German musicologist who
first put forth the idea of composers' pulses in 1928. Becking
himself had extended the theories of Eduard Sievers, who found he
could mark the shift in the Bible's authors by following the rhythm
of the writing with the movement of a finger. The loops that
Sievers traced while reading each writer were distinct, he found.
</P>
<P>
   Just as each writer evoked consistent finger patterns, Becking
found, composers produced similar patterns. Clynes first measured
those shapes in 1967 by recording how musicians like Pablo Casals
reacted to certain pieces of music while using a device Clynes
invented, called a sentograph.
</P>
<P>
   A person using the sentograph listens to music and touches a
pad, which finely records finger pressure and translates that
pressure into shapes. When several such musicians reacted to the
same composers with similar shapes, Clynes said, ``we knew we had
something good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, using digitized performances of pieces by
well-known Western composers, Clynes experimented with variations
in each composer's pulse, and tested those pieces to see how true
they were to the patterns he had established for each. In this way,
he was able to chart the ``micro-structure'' of a composition _ the
most subtle aspects of a score, like the attack on an individual
note, which composers leave to performers and conductors to
discern.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes codified these findings in a computer program that allows
users to experiment with the pulses of various composers _ say,
what a Mozart symphony might sound like with Schumann's pulses _
and build interpretations of their own, using digitized music
rendered by computer. That program, Superconductor, is now used at
the Juilliard School and has won praise from musicians and from
scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Clynes has provided new tools for composers and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, Manfred has shown that a computer simulation
can be made good enough for many people to immediately take to it,
and that's not a trivial feat,'' said Dr. Jerry Lettvin, professor
of neuroscience at MIT. ``In fact, the difficulty of that is quite
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous incarnations of digitized music ``were a joke,'' said
Alice Shields, a composer who is the former associate director of
the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. ``They were wooden
and boring and had none of the emotional qualities that
noncomputerized music has,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Shields and others said, is that
computerized music often plays every note virtually the same, with
few subtle variations in aspects like tone or tempo found in
performances. In his computer program and in 240 computer-generated
recordings of works like Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Clynes uses
the pulse to avoid such an effect, but he also relies heavily on
another of his theories: predictive amplitude shaping, which
calculates the volume of notes in a phrase.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For many instruments, like a violin, individual notes can be
shaped differently, depending on how the amplitude rises and falls
during a note. A note can have a gradual build-up or can diminish
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes observed that the shape of a note's rise and fall is
affected by the next note. If the next note is a higher pitch, then
the amplitude will fall more sharply at the end. If the note that
follows is lower, the amplitude will fall more gradually.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the shorter the time between the beginning of the
first note and the beginning of the next, the more pronounced the
rise or fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes tested this idea by using time and amplitude equations
that represented virtually every shape a musician could use for a
note, and determining the formula that, to his ear, produced the
most natural results. His findings were first published in 1983 by
the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with Clynes' findings agree. ``A piece of music
isn't a pure mathematical collection of formulas,'' said Donald
Martino, a composer and an emeritus professor of composition at
Harvard. ``We write it down as if it is, as if each sixteenth note
is the same, but in fact, when you measure them, they're all
slightly different.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain collections of notes ``suggest to players slight
variants to the rhythm and volume'' that the musical score cannot
express, Martino said. ``These are things you couldn't really do so
well when just programming a piece by the formulas. Now with
Manfred's findings, it's possible to make electronic music which is
more human.''
</P>
<P>
   Clynes also theorizes that composers show patterns in how
vibrato is ideally used. For instance, he said, performers of some
composers should start the vibrato later in the note if the
succeeding note is higher, and earlier in the note if the
succeeding note is lower.
</P>
<P>
   This theory of vibrato has not been scientifically validated,
but Clynes has incorporated it into the Superconductor program.
</P>
<P>
   Clynes' software is useful in interpreting not just the works of
great masters, but whatever music a user wants to perform with a
computer, said Jeff Harrington, a composer who has had his music
performed in recent years by the North Carolina Chamber Players and
the Clemson University Symphony Orchestra, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that the software also allowed a composer to
create a musical performance for many instruments and control that
performance with a precision that conductors could never achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a bunch of musicians together to play your music,
there will be tons of places where it sounds bad,'' Harrington
said. ``When I compose, I know what a piece sounds like in my
imagination. So when it matches or sounds better than I imagined,
as is the case with this, that's when it blows you away. I think
it's miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Clynes said he hoped the software, which he released in the
mid-1990s and continues to refine, will also appeal to music
beginners. ``People spend their lives learning an instrument, and
they have to perform all kinds of acrobatics to play a piece, but
that has nothing to do with the essence of music, which comes down
to how someone interprets a piece,'' he said. ``This enables the
average person to take music and shape it to their own view of it,
just like a virtuoso can.''

MCCAIN (Undated) - It's crunch day for Arizona Sen. John McCain,
although any crunching sound would come from Michigan, not Arizona.
If McCain loses in Michigan and eventually pulls out of the race,
where does that leave him vis a vis Arizona, and in a state
Republican Party that split over his candidacy? By JEFF BARKER.

VERDE (Undated) - Indian tribes enriched by profits from casinos
are using their new-found clout. We focus on the case of the Camp
Verde Yavapai tribe, which owns the Cliff Castle Casino north of
Camp Verde. A year ago, the tribe indicated interest in starting a
sand and gravel operation on 225 acres of the Cloverleaf Ranch it
had purchased within Camp Verde town limits. It approached the town
with interest in getting a permit for the sand and gravel
excavation but was turned down because not enough information was
provided about the reclamation plan. So, the tribe went ahead and
started excavating without a permit and dared the town to do
anything about it. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the `A`

   HAMBURG, Germany _ Hunting for the boom that never happened in
post-Cold War Berlin? Try this handsome port city that purrs with
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The boutiques _ from home-grown Jil Sander to Gianni Versace,
the cranes hoisting an enlarged port into being, the plans for a
vast new downtown on a former dockland area, the rising tide of
internet companies: all this speaks of boomtown Hamburg and of a
Germany still resisting the appeal of Berlin, its new capital.
</P>
<P>
   The theory when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 was that
German industry would return to Berlin, a city it largely abandoned
in 1945, and that the bourgeoisie that Hitler's war decimated there
would be partially reconstituted. Instead, what the last decade has
confirmed is postwar Germany's deep attachment to a decentralized
federalism.
</P>
<P>
   That is evident nowhere more than in Hamburg. Its growth in
recent years suggests that Berlin, for all its dreams of being a
``Weltstadt'' or world-class city, will never enjoy the dominance
over Germany that Paris and London exercise over France and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is booming because it has recovered its hinterland
since the Cold War's end,'' said Theo Sommer, the executive editor
of the influential Hamburg-based weekly Die Zeit. ``By comparison,
Berlin's development seems lethargic.''
</P>
<P>
   That hinterland is Central Europe, which was unnaturally cut off
from Hamburg by the Iron Curtain, a mere 20 miles to the east. Now
the city is once again the major port of Prague, up the River Elbe,
and the old trading links of the Hanseatic League have been
re-established with towns like Gdansk in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, container traffic at the port has increased to over
77 million tons from 55 million five years ago. Projected growth is
so strong that a new port area is being built and the Elbe River
deepened at a cost of $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1989, we won back our neighbors on the Elbe river,'' said
Mayor Ortwin Runde, a Social Democrat. ``Trade between Germany and
the Central European states that have emerged from communism is now
bigger than with the United States. As the port for more than 20
percent of German exports, we have naturally benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   In the neo-Renaissance city hall, the offices of the Chamber of
Commerce adjoin Runde's office. Nothing could more eloquently
express the fierce attachment of this city to trade, its feeling of
looking outward to the world rather than inward to an often
despondent Germany. And it does not look only to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains in London, the umbrellas go up in Hamburg,''
goes an old saying here. It reflects the city's sense of closeness
to the British capital, with which it shares a taste for
discretion, an intense pragmatism and an evident openness.
</P>
<P>
   Among the statistics that Riesling-sipping Hamburg businessmen
like to spout over plates of succulent sole is the fact that no
other city, apart from New York, has more than 90 consulates. The
consulates, of course, serve trade.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is a country of both merchant cities and court cities.
Among the former, Hamburg is joined by places like Cologne and
Leipzig. The latter include Berlin and Dresden, places where past
tragedy weighs heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Although no German town has escaped this country's 20th-century
trauma _ Hamburg was heavily bombed in World War II _ it often
seems that the practical bent of the trading towns has enabled them
to heal their wounds faster.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's repetitive bluster about becoming the new capital of
``middle Europe'' has remained unbacked by much solid evidence even
as Hamburg has moved fast to exploit new opportunities to the east.
Unemployment in the port city has fallen to 9.6 percent, from 12.6
percent, over the past two years; in Berlin it has remained at
about 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling sign of Hamburg's confidence is a $10-billion
development called Harbor City, planned on about 250 acres south of
the city center where old dockland warehouses now stand.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, the warehouses are to be replaced by
office space for more than 20,000 people, a terminal for luxury
cruisers, hotels, theaters, stores and several thousand apartments.
Construction begins this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bernd Tiedeman, the managing director of the project, said it
sums up ``Hamburg's new ambitions after unification.'' In his
vision, cruise ships will dock here bringing tourists who will then
go on excursions as far away as Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Hamburg as a gateway to Berlin may seem
far-fetched, but if a long-planned high-speed train is ever built,
the capital will be only 60 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it is a measure of the continuing isolation of the
capital _ deprived of its port by Poland's absorption of Szczecin
(the former German Stettin) after World War II, and still lacking a
direct flight to the United States _ that Hamburg may reasonably
see itself as a center from which to visit Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Berlin looks east, Munich looks south, and we look to
the west, which is where things are really happening for now,''
said Frank Sarfeld, the spokesman for America Online Europe, whose
headquarters are in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   He had a large muffin on his cluttered desk and a plate of ice
cream _ ``I only eat at my desk'' _ as he gazed at three television
screens providing news and stock prices. On his wall was a strategy
chart mapping out ``Operation Steady Drumbeat,'' a plan to keep AOL
Europe in the news by providing a relentless stream of press
releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of new media is coming here, because this is where the
old media companies are and the spirit is right,'' Sarfeld said.
``But with everyone looking for the same information-technology
people, you have to have a good stock-option program. That's a
must.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options were certainly not in the thoughts of the Allies
when, in 1946, they gave licenses in Hamburg to two of the first
postwar German newspapers _ Die Welt and Die Zeit. But they did
have in mind a decentralized Germany where no city could be as
dominant as Hitler's Berlin. In this strategic design their success
now seems conspicuous.

<P>
   When Zora Brown got word that her pregnant, 29-year-old niece,
Lea, had breast cancer, she decided it was high time for a serious
family meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer had cut a swath through Brown's family for four
generations, striking all three of her sisters, her mother,
grandmother, great-grandmother, three great-aunts and Brown
herself. Now it appeared that the next generation, too, was under
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bullets coming toward us from every direction,'' said
Brown, 50, the founder of the Breast Cancer Resource Committee in
Washington, which offers black women education and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Brown invited Lea and 11 other adult nieces to a family retreat
in December 1998. She brought along a geneticist and an oncologist,
had her nieces record the dates of their last mammograms and breast
self-examinations and made them pledge to be vigilant about their
health care.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, Lea died. Last month, another niece found a
lump in her breast.
</P>
<P>
   Zora Brown's family may well have a particular predisposition
toward breast cancer. But she worries that black women in general
are facing a more aggressive form of the disease, a concern echoed
by many other African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fear that there is a black breast cancer and that
nobody is doing anything about it,'' said Ngina Lythcott, 54,
associate dean of the Columbia University School of Public Health
and an 11-year survivor of breast cancer. ``When black women get
together and talk about their tremendous fear of getting breast
cancer, the fear is that it's a disease that's different from other
breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Several facts underlie those fears.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of unprecedented advances, when overall death rates
from breast cancer are declining, black women are 12 percent less
likely than white women to get breast cancer, but far more likely,
once they contract the disease, to die from it.
</P>
<P>
   Among women with breast cancer, African-Americans are 50 percent
more likely than whites to get the disease before the age of 35,
when tumors are more aggressive. They are also 50 percent more
likely to die of breast cancer before they turn 50. And they are
twice as likely to receive the diagnosis at an advanced stage, when
the cancer has spread and is more difficult to cure.
</P>
<P>
   The racial mortality gap, meanwhile, is widening. A National
Cancer Institute study reported in November that a black woman's
risk of dying from breast cancer, which was slightly lower than a
white woman's in 1980, was 16 percent greater in 1990. By 1995,
that gap had jumped to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, using the same data but a different measuring
gauge, puts the mortality gap wider still. Dr. Sue A. Joslyn, an
epidemiologist at the University of Northern Iowa, found that black
women with breast cancer were 67 percent more likely than whites to
die of their illness. Race, she said, ``is a strong predictor for
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why these differences are emerging. But National
Cancer Institute researchers, who called attention to the mortality
gap in their study, caution that skin color probably has little to
do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gap didn't exist 25 years ago,'' said Dr. Otis W.
Brawley, an oncologist and epidemiologist, who is director of the
cancer institute's Office of Special Populations Research. ``And
the genetics of black folks didn't change in the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brawley, a co-author of the institute's study, believes that
race masks the real culprits: poverty, diet and inadequate health
care. Poor white women, too, he notes, are more likely than wealthy
white women to get the diagnosis when their cancers are advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody argues that poor white women are genetically
different from rich white women,'' Brawley said. ``A lot of these
problems are related to being poor, and being black may be a
surrogate for being poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some disparities may arise from differences in tumor
biology. Federal studies have shown that black women are more
likely than whites to have aggressive tumors that grow without the
help of estrogen, meaning that estrogen blockers like tamoxifen are
less effective in combating them.
</P>
<P>
   Tumors that are ``estrogen-receptor positive,'' latching onto
estrogen and feeding off it, can be fooled into latching onto
look-alike tamoxifen instead, and starved. From 60 percent to 70
percent of estrogen-receptor positive women benefit from tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are ``estrogen-receptor negative,'' meaning they have
far fewer estrogen receptors, have tumors that do not need to feed
off estrogen and, for reasons that are still unknown, grow more
rapidly. Only 15 percent to 20 percent of these women benefit from
tamoxifen. And blacks with breast cancer are twice as likely as
whites to have a form of the disease that is estrogen-receptor
negative.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and public health researchers are looking at every
piece of the puzzle, including increasing the use of mammography
and understanding the mechanisms that bring about tumor growth. But
each new study raises more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection is only part of the problem. Increasingly, black
women are just as likely as whites to have received mammograms. But
researchers suspect that they are not getting them regularly, and,
perhaps most important, are not receiving follow-up care after
suspicious ones.
</P>
<P>
   A recent federal study found that a black woman is less likely
to have an abnormal finding evaluated than a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   And once the disease is diagnosed, African-American women are
more likely than whites to get inadequate care for their breast
cancers, a National Cancer Institute study shows. Fewer are given
the proper surgical treatment and the appropriate level of
chemotherapy or radiation after surgery, Brawley said.
</P>
<P>
   When African-Americans get equal access to health care, their
survival rate can approximate that of whites. One long-term survey
monitored the survival rate of women who received similar care for
their breast cancers in Hyde Park, an affluent, integrated
community in Chicago. From 1946 to 1987, the 20-year survival rate
did not differ by race for women receiving a diagnosis at the same
stage of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a 1997 study, published in Cancer, the journal of the
American Cancer Society, found that African-American women treated
for breast cancer at United States military hospitals, where equal
medical access is mandated, had a 41 percent greater risk of death
than their white counterparts receiving the same care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Barbara E. Wojcik, an Army statistician and
co-author of the study, early screening may play a role. In a small
follow-up study, she found that, compared with whites and
Hispanics, a smaller percentage of the black women had received
diagnoses of breast cancer through mammography. Among those whose
breast cancers were detected by mammograms, there were no
differences in survival rates.
</P>
<P>
   Diet and body weight may also play a role. Most of the women in
the military study were civilian spouses, not subject to the Army's
physical requirements. On average, Brawley said, black women are
heavier and have denser breast tissue than whites, increasing both
their chances of breast cancer and the difficulty of detecting it
on a mammogram. Overweight white women also appear to have a higher
incidence of breast cancer than white women of normal weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, when it's all said and done, much of the problem will
relate to body fat and diet,'' Brawley said. ``I'm black, and I can
tell you that even though I'm middle class, the diets in my family
are radically different than my white colleagues. We eat more fried
foods, more fattening foods and eat fewer vegetables. So maybe
being black is a surrogate for being overweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathy Helzlsouer, an oncologist and epidemiologist at the
Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said that was not the whole
story. ``Weight becomes a risk factor only after menopause,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the black breast cancer debate is the sticky issue
of cultural habits, including a seeming resistance among some
blacks to seek medical care even when told they need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this in my own family,'' Brawley said. The myth, he
said, is that ``if it's cancer and they cut on me, they will spread
it.'`
</P>
<P>
   A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association found that blacks, more than whites, believed that
praying, not worrying and not having surgery were among the best
ways to deal with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings make Zora Brown angry. ``Sometimes we hear
stories that African-American women don't go to the doctor because
of their religion,'' she said. ``Well, that's bunk. I don't know
anyone who is more spiritual and religious than my mother, but she
always cautioned us to go to the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some health advocates believe that black women may need a higher
standard of care, including earlier mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, doctors dislike performing mammograms on younger
women because their breast tissue is denser, making the tests
harder to interpret. The National Cancer Institute and the American
Cancer Society recommend starting at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Medical Association, the black medical group,
now recommends that African-American women start getting mammograms
at 35; some black doctors recommend even sooner, at 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Black Caucus has jumped into the debate,
urging the federal government to pay for research into why cancer
appears to affect poor people and minorities disproportionately.
The National Cancer Institute spends about 3 percent of its budget,
or $76.6 million a year, specifically addressing that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do very focused research on African-American women
and breast cancer,'' Brown said. ``African-American women are ready
and willing to be part of research studies.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute is already studying why black women are getting
the disease so young and why their tumors tend to grow independent
of estrogen. But Brawley is wary of pursuing racial theories to
solve the breast cancer mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Race in itself ``is not a biologic category,'' Brawley said.
Concentrations of genetic mutations have more to do with family and
intermarriage patterns that often overlap with race, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brawley worries that speculation about racial difference could
lead scientists back to the days of ``race medicine,'' when blacks
were considered distinct from whites, and doctors treated their
ailments differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that 100 years ago, there were
veterinarians for dogs, allopaths for white people and race
medicine specialists for black people,'' Brawley said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, focusing on genetics distracts researchers
from identifying risk factors that can be changed, perhaps creating
a paralyzing fear among black women that can stop them from taking
protective steps. Lythcott at Columbia agrees that fatalism was a
problem. But like Brown, she also believes the issue of race and
breast cancer should be addressed squarely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be valuable to determine, once and for all, if there
is a black breast cancer,'' Lythcott said. ``I wouldn't want to let
people die simply because we haven't proven it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ It is just steel and stone, a rough line scratched
across an immense and largely empty landscape. But for much of the
last century, as the whistle of Canadian National freight trains
pierced the northern night, the ``government railroad,'' as CN was
known, helped define Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The grand old railroad ran from east to west, and so did
Canadian commerce _ even with American markets lying seductively
close to the border. So long as there was a separate Canadian
market, and a separate Canadian railway, generations of politicians
vowed, there would be a separate Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the current president of Canadian National Railway Co.,
Paul M. Tellier, has a different vision of the railroad, of Canada
and the American continent _ a vision that some people on both
sides of the border reject. Though his focus remains
transcontinental, he is looking south, across the U.S. border and
beyond that into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Tellier wants to merge the Montreal-based CN with a giant
American railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., and create
the most titanic railroad this continent has ever seen. The
behemoth would have 50,000 miles of track, combined annual revenues
of $12.5 billion, freight service to 32 states and eight Canadian
provinces, and cross-border access from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to
Mexico City to Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $6 billion rail pact is important for what it says
about one of America's oldest industries as well as what it shows
about how North America is changing. Perhaps more than any other
symbol, the alliance would underscore how far the formation of a
truly integrated continental economy has developed in the six years
since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a change in the mind of the peoples of North
America,'' said Halina Ostrovski, president of the Canadian Council
for the Americas, an economics-oriented research organization in
Toronto. ``They now see the three countries as one big market.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is willing to accept the vision of the new railroad
or the changes it represents. In the United States, shippers and
unions, burned by service disruptions after other big rail mergers,
oppose the deal, a cashless transaction that would create a new
holding company, North American Railways. Competing railroads have
warned that another merger at this time would push the industry
into a final round of consolidations that would end with just two
enormous networks to serve the entire continent of North America.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, shippers and farmers are worried that the merger
would reduce what little competition exists _ CN's only national
rival is Canadian Pacific Railway Co. And fervent nationalists see
the proposed merger as the loss of a revered national symbol and
the last spike in the dream of an independent, sovereign Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would probably not have the western part of the country in
Canada today if not for these railways,'' said David Orchard, a
prairie farmer and chairman of a Canadian group called Citizens
Concerned About Free Trade. ``This merger would be a betrayal of
everything that the founders of the country fought for.''
</P>
<P>
   Both freight lines are led by headstrong executives determined
to drag American railroads into a new era. Robert D. Krebs of the
Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern is a bred-in-the-bone
railroad man, with 34 years' experience running American trains.
Tellier, who joined CN eight years ago, is a former civil servant
with a passion for Descartes.
</P>
<P>
   The combined railroad, they say, makes perfect economic sense.
North-South traffic across the borders is expanding at a rate of 10
percent to 15 percent a year, while east-west traffic is rising no
more than 4 percent annually. U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has
continued to grow even when trade with many other countries
flattened out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing in North America is what you would expect
from the development of a free trading zone, but in many ways it
goes beyond that,'' said Jorge O. Mariscal, a managing director at
Goldman Sachs. ``It's now engulfing banking, telecommunications and
transportation in a quite remarkable way.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroads have taken pains to present the deal as a merger
of equals. Burlington Northern and CN would keep their own offices,
and their locomotives would continue to be painted with their
separate corporate logos.
</P>
<P>
   But the balance of power seems to tip toward the Canadians. The
parent company, North American Railways, will be located in
Montreal, and, by Canadian law, the majority of board members must
be Canadian. Krebs, 66, would become non-executive chairman and
Tellier, 60, chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 billion North American freight railroad industry has
already slimmed down considerably in response to relentless
competition from trucking, which began offering transcontinental
service a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truckers have been eating our lunch every day of the week,''
Tellier said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades the number of large, independent _
so-called Class I _ freight lines has declined substantially. In
1980, 26 such freight railroads operated in the United States,
according to the Association of American Railroads. Today, just
seven are left. While that decline was due in part to changes in
the way railroads are categorized, there is no doubt that national
railroads have been forced to get bigger to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over the Burlingthern-CN alliance has reached
the Surface Transportation Board, the U.S. regulatory agency with
the power to review, and possibly block, rail mergers. The board
has scheduled an unusual public hearing next month _ before the
formal merger application is even filed _ to look at the rail
industry's future.
</P>
<P>
   If railroad consolidation ``plays itself out to the endgame that
some feel it will,'' Linda J. Morgan, chairwoman of the board,
wrote in response to the merger announcement in December, ``this is
the final round.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The most recent consolidations _ CSX and Norfolk Southern's
absorption of Conrail and the Union Pacific's acquisition of the
Southern Pacific _ have not gone smoothly. Disgruntled shippers
continue to suffer delays and interruptions caused by the last
mergers and are in no mood for yet more consolidation. Led by the
Chemical Manufacturers Association, they have made their
displeasure known to regulators and to key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just ensures that politics is going to be the operative
word,'' said James M. Higgins, a railroad analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``It has become a political issue, and politics
is more about perception than reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory environment in Canada is quite different. The
only significant review will be undertaken by the federal
Competition Bureau, which will assess the merger's impact on
competition within Canada, where the two railroads' lines overlap
just for short stretches in Manitoba and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian legislators, particularly in the grain-growing
west, where farms, mines and manufacturing plants rely on efficient
rail service, are concerned that the combined railroad will favor
Burlington Northern's more heavily used and profitable western line
in the northern United States over Canadian National's parallel
route. ``The big issue in western Canada is lack of competition,''
said Reg Alcock, a ruling party member of Parliament from Winnipeg.
``We don't have many options.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tellier of Canadian National acknowledges that support is
growing for Canada's House of Commons to use a coming revision of
the Canadian Transportation Act to give federal officials new
powers to review mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was back in my previous job would I argue that it makes
sense for the government of Canada to bring an amendment to
Parliament?'' asked Tellier, who was clerk of the Privy Council,
which made him the top bureaucrat in Canada, before taking control
of CN in 1992. ``Sure it makes sense. Do I expect something like
this to be passed overnight? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   He accuses Canadian nationalists and the competing railroads of
playing on emotions to fight the merger. ``We're not going to get
into any kind of emotional debate or confrontation,'' he told
analysts at a meeting in New York. ``We're going forward in a very
rational, Cartesian fashion to make our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the emotions are real. Perhaps more than any other
nation, Canada used the building of the railroad to stitch
disparate colonies into a nation. The fledgling federal government
used the audacious promise of building a rail line across the empty
western prairies to entice the faraway province of British Columbia
to enter the confederation in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   The building of the Canadian Pacific and what later became the
Canadian National were heroic undertakings, spurred more by
national pride than economic sense. The cost was sizable, with
billions of dollars in subsidies going toward keeping the railroads
running.
</P>
<P>
   By 1919, a group of money-losing lines was taken over by the
government and combined to form Canadian National. In the early
1990s, CN was privatized. More than 60 percent of the shares are
held by American investors.
</P>
<P>
   Tellier said he had no patience for those who think the alliance
represents the Americanization of Canada. Last year, he bought the
Illinois Central and it was an open secret that he was shopping for
another American line, the Kansas City Southern, which is
part-owner of the recently privatized line from Mexico City to the
border that carries about 40 percent of Mexico's rail traffic.
</P>
<P>
   CN already has a 15-year marketing agreement with the Kansas
City Southern that gives it access to the Mexico City line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at a map, it would be a logical extension at one
point in time,'' Tellier said, suggesting that CN might go after
the Kansas City Southern again. He also said that an alliance with
a carrier in the Northeast is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Tellier is sometimes criticized for thinking like a government
official and not like the chief executive of a tradition-bound
business that he has become. But Krebs, of Burlington Northern, who
has spent his whole career in railroading, is also convinced that
running the trains on a continental basis is not only logical but
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market forces are demanding a transcontinental system,'' he
said. ``It's just a matter of time.''

`FRONTLINE': BEHIND MILITARY INTERVENTION IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About a year ago the United States and its NATO
allies found themselves involved in a war in Kosovo that continues
with little prospect of peace or of the West's extrication. Tuesday
night and next week ``Frontline'' on PBS offers ``War in Europe,''
a sharply drawn two-hour account of how the allies embarked on
NATO's military conflict and the shaky way in which it was fought.
</P>
<P>
   The program reports that the main American voice in behalf of
intervention belonged to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
champion of what the narrator, Peter J. Boyer, calls a doctrine of
``virtuous power.'' She ran up against a president distracted by
his Monica Lewinsky troubles and a Congress disinclined to risk
American lives in a distant cause. But the train of bloody events
in the Balkans, of provocation and repression, forced the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Policy makers and players tell the story of Western diplomats
caught between the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, determined to
win independence from Yugoslavia, and Serbs led by Slobodan
Milosevic, who had already gained a reputation as ``Europe's most
ruthless man.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton committed what Tuesday night's critics call a
fundamental error by announcing that the United States would not
send in ground troops. But television images of Serbian killings
and the forced exodus of 50,000 Albanians into the hills as winter
threatened increased the pressure on the West.
</P>
<P>
   Finally NATO began bombing the Serbs. But even here the NATO
powers proved divided and indecisive. Gen. Michael C. Short,
leading the bombing campaign, reports that his political allies
repeatedly told him, ``Our parliament won't allow us to strike that
target.'' A message of ``War in Europe'' is that military strength
without political determination is an undependable weapon.
</P>
<P>
   With the Serbs still resisting despite increased bombing,
Clinton, under pressure from Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair,
allowed that Western ground troops might be used and with the
intervention of Russia, a deal was struck to end the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With allied troops now assigned indefinitely to Kosovo to stop
the sort of clashes that have occurred between Serbs and Albanians
lately, no one is claiming a great victory for ``virtuous power.''

   Appalled by the weird implications of quantum mechanics, the
rules that explain the workings of the tiny particles that make up
the universe, Albert Einstein used to stroll the streets of
Princeton wondering why the moon wasn't smeared all over the sky.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the moon is made of these particles, and quantum
theory holds that until it is observed, a particle doesn't have a
definite position. It remains suspended in a mathematical limbo: a
state of pure potentiality consisting of all the possible positions
it could conceivably occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really believe, Einstein once asked a younger colleague,
that the moon exists only when you look at it?
</P>
<P>
   Einstein had come face to face with the fundamental paradox of
quantum mechanics: why the laws that apply so precisely to the
subatomic realm do not appear to carry over into the domain of
everyday things.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to quantum mechanics, a bottle of Coke should be
able to exist in a superposition of two locations, both here and
there,'' said Dr. Wojciech H. Zurek, a theorist at Los Alamos
National Laboratories in New Mexico. ``We do not see such states.
Ever. Bottles are either here or there. What eradicates quantum
weirdness?'' And could the solidity of reality really be dependent
on the presence of observers?
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists believe they are coming closer to an answer with
a phenomenon called decoherence, in which the particles themselves
constantly ``observe'' one another, eliminating the quantum
fuzziness and yielding the familiar world of solid objects.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks this theoretical notion received what might be
its strongest support yet. Experimenters at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo., observed decoherence
in action. They used laser beams to gently manipulate an atom,
essentially putting it in two places at once. Then they measured
the breakdown of this perplexing state of existence more
methodically than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seth Lloyd, an associate professor in the department of
mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and an expert in quantum theory, called the work an ``experimental
triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly no experiments have been done previously that so
carefully and thoroughly examine the decoherence process,'' he
said. ``The results confirm to a high degree of precision the
theoretical predictions of the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Though other groups have measured decoherence in the past, the
Boulder experiment is the first to systematically observe how
quickly quantum ambiguity is resolved when a particle is exposed to
different kinds of environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a significant piece of work,'' said Dr. Gerard
J. Milburn, head of the physics department at the University of
Queensland in Australia. Milburn's calculations about how quickly
quantum fuzziness gives way to tangible objects were borne out by
the demonstration. ``This is the most definitive experimental
validation of these predictions to date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In pure isolation, sealed off from the influence of its
surroundings, a particle is represented by a mathematical device
called a quantum wave function: all of the particle's possible
states (its position or momentum, for example) cling together in a
condition known as quantum superposition. In traditional
interpretations of quantum mechanics, it is the act of observation
that causes this wave function to ``collapse,'' forcing the
particle to choose one state or another.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have tried to discourage mystics by emphasizing that
the observer need not be a conscious being: an electronic detector
or a photographic plate will do. It is the collision with the
rock-solid world that resolves the particle's ambiguous existence.
</P>
<P>
   But many physicists find this explanation dissatisfying. They
would like quantum mechanics to be a completely self-contained
theory, with no need to invoke any kind of outside measurer. After
all, if quantum mechanics is taken to its logical extreme, the
universe itself can be described by a wave function, all its
possible histories hovering together in superposition. By
definition, there can be nothing outside the universe, no external
observer or measurer to conjure up this particular universe from
the plentitude of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all it takes to collapse the wave function, Zurek and his
colleagues propose, is for a particle to undergo some kind of tiny
disturbance, to come into contact with other particles. The
delicately balanced superposition in which all the possibilities
stick together, or ``cohere,'' would come unglued. It would
``decohere.'' Then the particle could assume a particular position.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Zurek has described it, ``the watchful eye of the
environment'' _ the particles and waves that pervade creation _ is
constantly making measurements, banishing quantum ambiguity and
conjuring up hard-edged reality, the familiar world dominated by
the commonsensical laws of classical physics.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no need for a curious observer or even a
measuring instrument to solidify Einstein's moon or to put Zurek's
Coke bottle on one side of the table or another. The decoherence
caused by the jiggling of an object's own atoms and the particles
around it would be enough.

<P>
   To dramatize the problems of applying quantum theory to the
classical world, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger devised
his famous thought experiment in which the fate of a cat is tied to
that of a single subatomic particle. In one version, a photon (a
particle of light) is fired at a half-silvered mirror, giving it a
50-50 chance of reflecting back or sailing through. If the photon
passes through the mirror, it strikes a photoelectric detector,
activating a circuit that breaks a vial of poison and kills the
cat. If the photon is reflected away from the detector, the cat is
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Schrodinger argued that until the box was opened and the outcome
of the experiment was registered, the photon would linger in a
superposition of the two possible paths it could take, leaving the
cat in the uncomfortable position of being simultaneously dead and
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Decoherence suggests why this is not worth worrying about. Each
atom in the cat is tied into a complex environment of other atoms
that constantly interact, spiriting away the quantum effects.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the theory predicts that the speed at which
quantum superpositions collapse, giving rise to what theorists call
``classicality,'' depends on how far apart the alternate
possibilities are in something called Hilbert space. Put more
colloquially, it depends on how different they are. A Coke bottle
on one side of a table is far removed from a Coke bottle on the
other side, and a live cat is very different from a dead one.
Hence, the superpositions _ the bottle both here and there, the cat
both dead and alive _ almost immediately go away.
</P>
<P>
   To observe decoherence in action, the researchers in Boulder
trained their sights on the ``mesoscopic'' realm _ between the
submicroscopic world, where particles can hover indefinitely in
superposition, and the macroscopic world of objects, where
superpositions disappear too soon to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment, reported Jan. 20 in Nature, Dr. David
Wineland and his colleagues trapped a charged atom inside an
electromagnetic field. Using laser pulses, the researchers coaxed
it into a ``cat state'' in which its outer electron simultaneously
had two opposite ``spins.'' It was as though a tiny sphere were
rotating clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time. Laser
beams were then used to nudge apart the two states separating them
by about 100 billionths of a meter.
</P>
<P>
   The experimenters had created weird superpositions like this
before. This time, though, they went on to see what would happen if
the ``cat state'' was exposed to various disturbances in the form
of electrical fields. As predicted by decoherence theory, this
interaction with an environment rapidly forced the superposition to
come undone and the atom took its place in the world. How fast this
happened depended, as theory predicted, on how far the two
superpositions were separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope these kinds of experiments may shed some light on the
inconsistencies between what quantum mechanics predicts and our
everyday experience,'' Wineland said. He also noted that a deeper
understanding of decoherence could help scientists build
experimental quantum computers.
</P>
<P>
   In these theoretical devices, all the calculations needed to
solve a problem would be performed simultaneously in quantum
superposition. The result could be extremely powerful machines that
crack problems now considered impenetrable. But first scientists
would have to learn how to control decoherence, keeping the
superpositions from collapsing before a calculation is done.
</P>
<P>
   Decoherence has also been measured in other laboratories under
entirely different conditions. In 1996, Dr. Serge Haroche and his
colleagues at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris created cat
states by putting an electromagnetic field into a superposition in
which its waves were simultaneously in different phases _ reaching
their crests and troughs at different times. Then they upset the
quantum balancing act by sending an interloping atom _ a ``quantum
mouse'' _ through the field. They too found that the larger the
separation between the alternate quantum states, the faster
decoherence came into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of the cases studied, decoherence behaves as predicted
by theory,'' Zurek said. ``What is best, they confirm the prejudice
of theorists (like yours truly) that quantum theory can explain
this emergence of classicality without any modifications (which
have been invoked by other, more desperate but no less reputable
theorists).''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Oxford physicist Roger Penrose, for example,
has proposed that the mystery of how classicality arises cannot be
completely understood without radically overhauling quantum theory
and uniting it with Einstein's general theory of relativity _ one
of the biggest challenges facing physics.
</P>
<P>
   Even if decoherence succeeds in solving the problem of
Einstein's moon, a central mystery will remain: the theory may
explain why people do not see the weird quantum state in which the
Coke bottle is on both sides of the table. But nothing explains
why, when the superposition collapses, the bottle ends up on, say,
the left side rather than the right.
</P>
<P>
   As some physicists see it, decoherence must cause the universe
to somehow split in two, spawning this world, where the bottle is
on one side, and another, parallel world where it is on the other.
According to this ``many worlds'' interpretation, all the different
ways history might have unfolded coexist in superposition.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists, like Dr. David Deutsch at Oxford, insist that
these parallel universes are as solid and real as our own. Others,
like Lloyd, believe they should merely be thought of as abstract
possibilities _ things that did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criterion for things being real ought to be that we're
able to get information about them,'' Lloyd said. ``The
alternatives in the other worlds are inaccessible and therefore
unreal. I really got up this morning and fried an egg for my
daughter and myself. There is another world where my daughter and I
had cereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cereal world is in the wave function of the universe, but
it's not real in the sense that any information I'm going to get
will falsify the hypothesis. All the information says we had eggs.
Look at my cholesterol level!''
</P>
<P>
   Is there another universe where he is picking a milk-sogged
Cheerio from the end of his spoon and wondering how anyone could
possibly think he had eaten eggs? As far as this Dr. Lloyd is
concerned, it does not really matter. &QL;

U.S.-CANADA SECURITIES AGREEMENT MAY BE CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In the last nine years, Canadian companies have raised
about $153 billion through debt and equity issues in the United
States, usually with little screening by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington, because their filing documents
had already been approved by Canada's provincial regulators.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement that is unique to Canada and the United States,
known as the multijurisdictional disclosure system, has allowed
issuers of Canadian securities to file in the United States
quickly, saving enormous amounts of money and time. But their
advantage, they fear, could soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The threat lies in proposals first made by U.S. securities
regulators in 1998 for revising the registration system. The SEC
questioned whether Canada should have an edge that other major U.S.
trading partners _ Japan, Mexico, members of the European Union _
do not.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mandel, a Canadian lawyer with the New York firm of
Morrison &AMP; Foerster, who specializes in underwritings for Canadian
companies in the United States, said the SEC regulators had simply
raised the question of whether the U.S.-Canadian agreement made
sense, and ``the implicit answer was that the SEC did not think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Bamberger, an SEC spokeswoman, said that the proposed
changes and industry comments were still under review and that no
decision had been made on the existing arrangement with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides automatic clearance by the SEC for
securities documents prepared in Canada and accepted by local
regulators, if information required by the SEC is included. That
means companies prepare one share-offering prospectus or takeover
offer or continuous disclosure filing, not two.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the longevity of this arrangement began to grow
only after the Ontario Securities Commission, in a memo last
September, drew the SEC's own question about it to the attention of
Toronto's investment community. So over the last few months,
Canadian issuers have written dozens of letters to the SEC, hoping
to persuade the agency to keep the registration agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the registration agreement was once regarded as the wave
of the future, coming into effect along with the North American
Free Trade Agreement, some Canadians wonder why the SEC might be
backtracking. Toronto investment dealers point to securities
scandals _ Bre-X, YBM Magnex, Livent Entertainment _ as a big
reason that U.S. securities regulators have lost some faith in
their Canadian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware of that perception,'' said Kathryn Soden,
director of corporate finance for the Ontario Securities
Commission, ``but that's not what we have been told.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussions between the Canadian and U.S. securities
regulators, Soden said, ``the focus has been that this is a
philosophical shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the SEC's reasoning _ there are indications that it
wants to act this spring _ Canada's securities industry would be
shaken by the loss of the registration agreement. A few
underwriters said it would prove beneficial because more effort
would go into raising money at home. But Canada's capital markets
lack the scope of those in the United States, so the optimists are
a minority.
</P>
<P>
   The majority view is that corporate issuers will lose
flexibility on timing, that lawyers and other advisers will lose
business to their U.S. counterparts, and that underwriters and
stock exchanges will lose new financings and listings. Even with
the registration agreement, there is growing concern about the
number of fledgling high-technology companies that bypass Canadian
underwriters and exchanges to go public with offerings only in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of two filings is not a big problem for senior issuers,
but the time it could take to get full SEC approval is a concern.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David Chaikof, a partner in Torys, a law firm in Toronto and New
York, said the SEC clears the way for a Canadian company's U.S.
financing in five days if it comes with the Ontario Securities
Commission's stamp. A separate filing by a foreign company can take
up to 60 days _ long enough to ruin a deal in a volatile market.
Mergers and acquisitions through share exchanges that involve
shareholders in the United States will face similar delays, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaikof is among those who hope the registration agreement is
not scrapped. ``Losing it would be more costly, more time-consuming
and less efficient,'' he said. ``If there's not enough review now,
maybe there is some intelligent action that can be taken, short of
abolishing the system.''

LETTERMAN RETURNS, TRUE TO FORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During David Letterman's much-publicized return to
his ``Late Show'' Monday night after quintuple-bypass surgery and a
five-week break, he walked onstage looking a little gaunt, but
immediately bent over to touch his toes. Later Robin Williams came
out in a surgical costume, carrying a cooler marked ``Human
Organs.'' (Michael Jackson's old nose and one of Cher's ribs were
inside, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Letterman got a little choked up while introducing his surgical
team, though he did not get nearly as emotional (at least not on
the edited version) as reports from Friday's taping suggested. Yet
the most telling moment came early, when Jerry Seinfeld walked out
briefly during the monologue, looked at him and said casually, ``I
thought you were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the same line Seinfeld used during his guest appearance
two weeks ago on ``Late Show Backstage,'' the shows that combined
old clips with new introductions during Letterman's absence. On
one, Charles Grodin said, ``Dave is faking, he never had an octuple
bypass.'' Seinfeld said, ``I thought Dave was dead,'' and the
entire enterprise fit seamlessly into the sharp, unsentimental tone
that ``Late Show'' thrives on.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's first night back worked in a similar way. It was not
outlandish or the slightest bit mawkish. It was, instead, true to
form, which is higher praise. He was clearly touched when he
brought on his doctors and nurses, introducing them one by one.
``It was five weeks ago today that these men and women saved my
life,'' he said. But he injected lightness into every introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Michelangelo with a bone saw,'' he said of the doctor who
cut him open, and concluded of the whole team, ``I couldn't be more
proud when these guys carved their initials in me.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained how bypass surgery was different from a simple
bypass. ``A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get the
`Tonight' show,'' he said. That fleeting reference highlights the
difference between Letterman, who remains the master of the
late-night form, and Jay Leno, whose ``Tonight'' show is worth
watching only during the monologue.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman even got in a snide Clinton joke. Referring to the
highly rated appearance by Hillary Rodham Clinton during his
next-to-last show before the surgery, he said: ``I have a whole new
respect for President Clinton. I spent a half an hour with Hillary,
half an hour, and look what happened to  &UR; me &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he never wants her back on. But after her appearance,
which came after a very funny series of on-air offers and
negotiations, he had already moved on to a new project: getting
Gov. George W. Bush to appear. ``He's a pinhead, isn't he?''
Letterman asked his band leader, Paul Shaffer, at the time. Even
the targets of his jokes may have something to gain by turning up.
</P>
<P>
   During his many guest appearances, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
seemed to be a guy with a sense of humor about himself, contrary to
every other media appearance he has ever made. Letterman is
endlessly irreverent about politicians behind their backs and
perfectly respectful when they show up in person, which puts his
audience in a winning position.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman will appear three nights a week at first, returning on
Wednesday with Julia Roberts as his guest. (Bill Cosby will be the
guest host Tuesday night and, unfathomably, Kathie Lee Gifford on
Thursday.) Last night, the guests were much less the point than the
host. Regis Philbin, who had appeared on the last show before
Letterman's operation and had an eerily prescient conversation
about heart surgery, was introduced as ``the last man to see me
alive.'' When Philbin said how much Letterman had been missed, the
host laughed, ``It's surprising that people would miss me, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The front-page attention his surgery got was surprising. But if
the well-orchestrated publicity for Letterman's return has worked,
it's because ``Late Show'' had achieved such a high level before he
left, and he seems to have picked up right there.

BATTLE OF THE SEXES IS DISCERNED IN SPERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the battle of the sexes, there are the formal rules _ the
rich variety of variously heeded laws and customs by which each
society tries to constrain reproductive behavior. Then there are
the other rules, often in conflict with the first, that govern love
and desire and the delicate games men and women play with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   If these other rules, the ones built into human nature, could be
specified, they would not tell what is right _ that is the province
of the first set of rules _ but they would help us understand how
human sexual and social behavior have evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Primatologists, who study the group of mammals that includes
monkeys, apes and people, have developed some surprising ideas
about the nature of the human mating system, suggesting that women
may not be as faithful as their mates may suppose. And some
biologists think that the deceits of the mating game may even be
reflected in the hapless spermatozoon.
</P>
<P>
   People's two closest evolutionary cousins, gorillas and
chimpanzees, have evolved two very different patterns of sexual
behavior and social organization. Gorillas practice ``female
defense polygyny,'' with one male guarding a harem of females,
whereas chimpanzees band together in multimale, multifemale groups.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior and anatomy, as might be expected, are closely allied.
When female chimpanzees ovulate, they may mate with every unrelated
male in the group, despite the dominant male's attempts to control
access. One female observed by the primatologist Jane Goodall
copulated with seven males 84 times in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, a male's chances of paternity require
the delivery of large volumes of sperm to flood out the
competition, and infants are conceived after competition in the
reproductive tract between sperm from rival males. Hence,
chimpanzees have evolved large testicles, in relation to their body
weight, and can ejaculate high sperm counts many times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Gorillas have small testicles compared with their body size,
presumably because the reigning silverback can prevent his troop
from being inseminated by other males; his sperm need only
fertilize, not compete.
</P>
<P>
   This gorilla-chimp difference provides an interesting scale on
which to try to place humans. In relation to his body size, a man's
testicles are considerably smaller than a chimpanzee's, but larger
than a gorilla's. So is sperm competition a feature of the human
mating system, at least in the evolutionary past if not now?
</P>
<P>
   Men have evolved ``to defend at the sperm level against their
mates' having another lover in the same fertile period _ not many
others, but one or two,'' Alison Jolly, a Princeton primatologist,
wrote in her 1999 book ``Lucy's Legacy'' (Harvard University
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Men, too, seem adapted to take more than one partner, to judge
from the size difference between men and women. In the monogamous
primate species, males are generally the same size as females, but
this 1-to-1 size ratio increases with the degree of polygyny,
reaching 1.36-to-1 in chimpanzees and 2-to-1 in gorillas and
baboons. By this index, humans are not a monogamous species,
because the male-female size ratio is about 1.15-to-1. ``We
conclude that human males `expect' perhaps two or three mates,''
Jolly writes. ``Mild polygyny,'' in her judgment, is the condition
under which this size difference evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Sperm competition, if it exists in humans, would have
considerable bearing on the innate rules of sexual behavior, as it
would imply women were often inseminated by more than one male
during their fertile period. ``Sperm competition is possible in
Homo sapiens, though whether it has played a significant role
during human evolution remains highly debatable,'' Dr. Alan F.
Dixson, director of the Center for the Reproduction of Endangered
Species at the San Diego Zoo, wrote in his 1998 book ``Primate
Sexuality'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   In a striking study, two English biologists, Dr. Mark A. Bellis
and Dr. R. Robin Baker, found that men's sperm counts were higher
the longer they had been separated from their partners, as if to
compensate for any infidelity in their absence. Baker believes that
the many malformed sperm seen in human ejaculates have a purpose _
to block or kill competing sperm. But others argue that human sperm
is of low quality for exactly the same reason as is a gorilla's _
the general lack of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Into this academic tussle, the human genome project has inserted
a remarkable new finding. Drawing on the information piling up in
DNA databanks, Dr. Chung-I Wu and other geneticists at the
University of Chicago reported last month that three genes related
to sperm function had been evolving at a particularly rapid clip in
both humans and chimpanzees, but somewhat more slowly in gorillas.
A brisk rate of evolution, as reflected in the number of changes in
the genes' DNA sequence, implies intense selective pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Wu noted that his finding fit neatly with the primatologists'
inferences about sperm competition in chimpanzees, and its relative
absence in gorillas. And his data seem to put humans in the same
camp as chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is ready to buy this implication. ``Humans nowadays
don't look as if they have any history of sperm competition,'' said
Dr. Richard Wrangham, a chimpanzee expert at Harvard. He infers
that the mating system of early human groups, probably with females
having ``a principal partner plus occasional others,'' was very
different from the multimale system of chimps, with many matings on
the same day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: Whenever I need my manager's advice or
approval, he keeps giving me the brushoff. His most common reply is
that he will deal with the matter later, and then usually it's too
late. How do I get him to take some action when I need it? K.F.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Managers who regularly give their employees the brushoff
are way off in many areas. If a manager is looking for a way to
create dissatisfaction, errors and chaos, the classic brushoff is
the way to go. When your manager's typical response is that he will
address your concerns later, he is actually saying he will act like
a manager later.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with this type of manager, one approach is to look
carefully for the best time to meet with him. There may be certain
periods during the day when he has the time and perhaps the
inclination to deal with issues raised by the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Let him see the benefits to him and the department if he takes
action on the matters you raise, and also let him see the costly
consequences that will arise if such matters are addressed later.
If he insists on handling things later, set a specific time to meet
and clearly indicate what will need to happen at such a time.
</P>
<P>
   His brushed-off managerial style is bound to create some
problems in your department, and ultimately they will catch the eye
of senior management. Unless your manager starts focusing on now
rather than later, management may say, see you later.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In our company, we have a small group of employees. One of
our co-workers, a sales rep, has extra-long conversations with
friends and customers. My co-workers have noticed this and are
beginning to complain. How can we minimize the talk time without
offending the sales rep? S.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rather than trying to minimize the sales rep's talk time, you
may be better advised to minimize the amount of time you are
focusing on what the sales rep is doing. It is quite normal for
salespeople to spend a good deal of time chatting with customers
and potential customers, and although such conversations can appear
to be hapless banter, they are often much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most critical elements in sales is trust, and many
salespeople build it by finding areas, experiences and pursuits
that they share with their customers. As a result, conversations
can easily focus on nonwork topics. In addition, if the
salesperson's pay is heavily based on commission, then he or she
has even more discretion in determining how much time to spend on
calls with customers or friends.
</P>
<P>
   In order to determine if the sales rep is spending too much time
chatting, and too little time selling, all one has to do is look at
sales figures. And the person to do that is your manager. Speaking
of your manager, perhaps it is time for him or her to do some
team-building in your department so that the troops understand each
other's jobs a little better and understand each other a little
better as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work for a small, privately owned company. The owner, who
has an office in the building, always wonders aloud why we cannot
keep any workers. The reason is the managers. One manager hires his
relatives and favors them, and another throws money away on
frivolous things. I find it hard to believe that the owner cannot
see this. Should I tell the owner? S.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: One has to wonder about an owner who wonders aloud about the
employee exodus. The act of wondering is not exactly at the core of
effective management. Employee turnover is a problem in and of
itself, and it also is a symptom of various factors that may be
pulling or pushing employees from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   You are in the best position to know if this owner is receptive
to the input and suggestions of the employees. If the owner is an
open, fair and communicative leader, you and some of your fellow
employees can meet with him or her to discuss your views regarding
the cause of the turnover. In doing so, try to focus on the issues
of nepotism, favoritism and questionable spending priorities,
rather than focusing on the managers per se.
</P>
<P>
   A less threatening approach is the next time the owner wonders
why the turnover is so high, you can suggest he or she consider
conducting an anonymous survey of the employees. If the company has
a human resources director, this person can do it, or there are
plenty of consultants who can be contacted. If the owner balks at
these approaches, one can only assume he or she prefers living in
wonderland.

 UNDATED: same day.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander Harcourt, an expert on gorillas at the University
of California at Davis, notes that women have evolved many means to
protect the uterus from invading bacteria, and that these defenses
will also harm sperm. It may be the sperm's need to co-evolve
counterdefense mechanisms, not sperm competition, that explains the
signs of evolutionary pressure seen in the DNA data, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   One notable difference in the sexual behavior of people and
chimpanzees lies in the females' ways of advertising their
receptivity. Chimpanzees display a visible swelling during their
fertile period. Women, on the other hand, evolved ``enlarged
breasts and buttocks, permanent advertisements to any male
around,'' in Jolly's words, yet they concealed the time of
ovulation.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of women's concealed ovulation has attracted much
speculation among primatologists. Is it a strategy to keep a
favored partner around, so he can be sure of his paternity? Or a
means for a woman to sleep with many men, buying protection for
herself and her children by allowing each poor dupe to assume his
paternity? Or perhaps both?
</P>
<P>
   Dixson, having surveyed the sexual behavior of some 200 primates
in considerable detail, suspects the concealed ovulation question
is being approached the wrong way. Just as likely, he believes,
unobtrusive ovulation may have been the normal state of affairs and
it is the flamboyant sexual swelling among chimpanzees and baboons
that needs to be explained.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, on the other hand, sees concealed ovulation and sperm
competition as two sides of the same coin. To give her children the
best genetic endowment, he believes, a woman should foster sperm
competition and act so as to ``promote sperm warfare,'' he wrote in
his book ``Sperm Wars'' (BasicBooks, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Baker's views on sperm competition, though different from those
of most primatologists, rest on important biological data _ chiefly
the collection of intimate secretions from many assenting couples _
that so far only he has obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The view of women as wielding considerable manipulative powers
offers an interesting counterpoint to the usual descriptions of
male dominance. ``You can't pretend biology isn't there, and from
many points of view, it is liberating, portraying active,
entrepreneurial, ambitious females,'' Jolly said.
</P>
<P>
   From one society to another, men and women flaunt the property
the other sex needs to assure its genes safe passage to the next
generation. Men advertise their wealth and power, which women need
to protect themselves and their children. To signal their
reproductive potential, ``Women use rouge to make the cheeks rosy,
indicating that they have either been exercising or are sexually
aroused, and lipstick to mimic the dark, blood-engorged state of
the lips during sexual excitement,'' writes Dr. Bobbi S. Low in
``Why Sex Matters'' (Princeton University Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Baker, a firm believer that sperm competition occurs in people,
argues that women look for men to provide both resources and good
genes, and the obvious strategy is to choose the best available
compromise candidate as a husband. But the available choice of
long-term resource-providers may be limited. So the alternative
strategy for women, Baker writes, is that ``they can choose the
best available long-term partner, and then rely on infidelity to
obtain the best genes.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it, in fact, common for a child's biological father to be
someone other than the social father? No reliable studies seem to
be available, no doubt in part because of the severe ethical
difficulties of trying to conduct one. But when testing family
members for inheritable diseases, genetic counselors stumble across
evidence of discrepant paternity surprisingly often. For the
population as a whole, ``The generic number used by us is 10
percent,'' said Dr. Bradley Popovich, vice president of the
American College of Medical Genetics, although he guesses it is
less in Oregon, where he directs a genetic diagnostic laboratory at
the Oregon Health Science University.
</P>
<P>
   Discrepant paternity would suggest that some women may exercise
a certain selectivity in the choice of a biological father, but it
does not prove the condition for sperm competition, which is
insemination by two or more men within the few days that sperm are
viable. From a questionnaire asking 4,000 women in Britain how
often they had sex with two different men within a space of five
days, Baker estimated that 4 percent of British children were born
as a result of sperm competition _ far less than in chimpanzee
societies, where probably most infants are conceived this way, but
probably enough to exert selective pressure on the evolution of
sperm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of primatologists 10 years ago said everything is run by
the males,'' Baker noted, but his and other biologists' evidence
now point toward a more powerful though less obvious role for
women. ``They are showing subterfuge and mating with males in
secret to their own best advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, however, is ahead of most primatologists, who see a clear
distinction between human and chimpanzee mating systems. Even
though the two species shared a common ancestor only 5 million
years ago, fossil evidence shows that the male-female size ratio in
humans has been the same for the last 1.9 million years, Wrangham
said. This suggests the mating system too has remained constant,
and different from the chimp's, for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The film, fashion and fiction industries promote the notion that
people are great lovers. Those familiar with Bacchanalian romps of
chimpanzees have a less heroic view of human sex lives. ``Despite
the desire of human beings to believe we are very sexy, we don't
have very frequent copulatory behavior compared to macaques, chimps
and bonobos,'' Dixson said.
</P>
<P>
   For primatologists, human sperm competition is still unproved,
and their milquetoast appraisal of the species' mating system _
``mildly polygynous'' _ suggests a not so daring excursion from
plain monogamy.

ATLANTA LOSES JOBS BUT STILL NEEDS HIGH-TECH WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANNE BERRYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The layoff announcements seemed to be coming in waves.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp. said it would cut 800 workers beyond 2,000
who lost their jobs last year. BellSouth announced that it was
eliminating 1,300 jobs. Worst of all, Coca-Cola, long a bulwark of
the economic and social scene here, said last month that it was
laying off 2,500 workers _ 40 percent of its Atlanta work force.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page article, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked,
``Is something going wrong?'' The question echoed widespread
worries that Atlanta's economy was in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A broad consensus of economists, government officials and
businessmen here believe, however, that if Atlanta's economy has
run into a rough patch, it is not because there is a shortage of
jobs. To the contrary, they say, there is a lack of people to fill
them, particularly in technology.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts have received wide publicity. But in reality they
are not having a major impact on the job market, with unemployment
hovering just above 2.5 percent. The job losses make a splash, said
David Echols, a Georgia Department of Labor statistician, ``but the
ripple is never going to make it to the shoreline.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ratacjak, a Georgia State University economist, said:
``It's going to hurt. But we think that Atlanta will still be a
significant job generator for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Atlanta created 113,600 jobs, more than any other
major metropolitan area in the nation. By comparison, metropolitan
New York, defined as New York City plus Putnam, Rockland and
Westchester counties, created 105,600 jobs in 1999, said Mike Wald,
regional economist for the Department of Labor. New York City alone
created 92,100 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, 15,000 technology workers are needed, said Sam A.
Williams, president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, even
though the ``dot-coms and telecommunications companies in Atlanta
added more than 30,000 workers'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talent-starved,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even with the layoffs, the chamber is running
advertisements in college newspapers at Rutgers University, Harvard
University, New York University and other schools around the
nation, as well as reaching out to students with its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The ads beckon the young to fast-paced fun and work in Atlanta,
where they can ``live in the current.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent news about the city has not been entirely positive,
however. In addition to the layoffs, Atlanta's battle with urban
sprawl has been the subject of news reports, along with the seamier
side of local night life after the pro football star Ray Lewis was
charged along with two other men in two stabbing deaths here the
morning after last month's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials are keeping a distance from the
employment issues. Gov. Roy Barnes is concerned about the hardship
for workers making transitions to other positions, said Henry
Thomassen, the governor's economic adviser. ``There is, of course,
nothing we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell has issued no public statements concerning
the job cuts, his spokesman confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Cardoza, commissioner for the Georgia Department of
Industry, Trade and Tourism, said each company had ``good solid
reasons for doing what they did.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's a little hard to interfere with the decisions that
corporate America has any right to make,'' Cardoza said.
``Everybody from a personal standpoint is very sorry for the people
who are losing their jobs.'' Not all of the workers will have
skills to match those needed for technology positions, Cardoza
said.
</P>
<P>
   For many laid-off employees at Coca-Cola, this is an extremely
painful time. Few have been willing to talk publicly about it.
``All my friends are being let go,'' said one employee who has
worked for the company for 20 years and who spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   She worries about a laid-off worker in his late 40s. ``Who's
going to hire him?'' she asked. She also worries about women who
have become their family's primary breadwinners. ``They have
$200,000 to $300,000 homes and they don't have jobs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Jacobi, 32, laid off Tuesday after two years as a Coca-Cola
marketing manager, said: ``I want to stay in Atlanta because of my
wife. I'm hoping to find a decent job here. So, we'll see. It's a
strong economy. If ever there were a time to be laid off, it's
now.''

THE LAST OF THE STROGANOFFS FINALLY SEES WHAT SHE LOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Helene de Ludinghausen took one look around the
Portland Art Museum here on Thursday, raised both hands to her
cheeks and in a deep, throaty voice let out a long ``Ooooohh.'' The
joy on her face was as evident as snow in a Russian winter.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed before her were portraits of her ancestors, a vitrine of
exquisite German porcelains, a marquetry commode and _ in the
middle of the room _ a malachite coupe, or basin, that is usually
the centerpiece of the Malachite Room of the State Hermitage Museum
in St. Petersburg. And this was only the start: several more
galleries lay beyond, filled with icons, manuscripts, antiquities,
fine furniture, paintings by Botticelli, Van Dyke and other old
masters and other art objects drawn from a half dozen Russian
museums and archives.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness de Ludinghausen is the last of the Stroganoffs, the
Russian aristocrats who are now most famous for, yes, that rich
beef stew. But she had never seen these objects together before.
Some 80 years ago, the Bolsheviks nationalized the treasures her
family had collected over four centuries; later the Soviet Union
sold some in the West and dispersed others to Russian institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 230 of them are in Portland, reunited in an
exhibition called ``Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a
Russian Noble Family.'' The catalog documented what de Ludinghausen
had long heard and surmised about her family's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a miracle,'' she said. ``But being a Russian, I was
taught to never lose faith. If we had not lost everything in the
revolution, I would not be here today. I would not be able to enjoy
this with so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   From their roots in the 14th century, the Stroganoffs grew to be
the richest family in Russia _ probably even wealthier than their
royal friends, the Romanovs _ by dealing in salt, timber, fur, iron
ore and gold. They had opened Siberia and so been deeded it by Ivan
the Terrible. They had founded schools and churches, imported
artists to develop the Stroganoff style of icon painting and built
the baroque Stroganoff Palace on Nevsky Prospekt that remains a St.
Petersburg landmark despite severe damage during the Soviet era.
Peter the Great ennobled them. And they were great arts patrons who
both preserved local traditions and introduced Western art, helping
to shape the culture of Russia. The works on view here alone are
insured for $200 million. The exhibition, which remains in Portland
until May 31 and then travels to the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort
Worth and possibly to Sydney and Versailles before going to the
Hermitage, chronicles that saga. But like all great Russian
stories, the show is also laden with subplots.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the Portland museum's coup in organizing
it, a bid to raise its ranking among American art centers and
position itself for the better shows. Until the other day, de
Ludinghausen, who lives in Paris, had never been to Portland. But
after being introduced to the museum's executive director, John E.
Buchanan Jr., in 1996, she chose to work with him rather than
approach a more prestigious museum.
</P>
<P>
   There is the remarkable turnaround that has occurred in Russian
cultural history over the last decade. As Dr. Mikhail B.
Piotrovsky, the director of the Hermitage, noted in the exhibition
catalog, it was not always safe to mention the name Stroganoff.
``The museums of Russia have done too little to perpetuate their
memory,'' he wrote, adding: ``The exhibition we are presenting and
the book created to go with it represent a partial attempt to atone
for our sins and repay some of our debt.''
</P>
<P>
   By honoring private arts patronage of the past, the Russians are
trying to encourage private support from the West for their
cash-starved museums.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the gamesmanship, inherent in every international
cultural exchange, over exactly which art works would be allowed to
leave Russia. It reached a showdown over the malachite coupe, which
prompted de Ludinghausen to issue an ultimatum: ``No coupe, no
exhibition.'' The Hermitage caved in to her, but Piotrovsky drove a
hard bargain on a huge Baroque history painting by Luca Giordano
that Buchanan badly wanted for the show. To get it, the museum had
to pay for its restoration at a cost of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the twist that de Ludinghausen, unlike many who
lost their possessions in the political upheavals of the 20th
century, has no desire to reclaim her family's treasures. Rather,
she started the Stroganoff Foundation in 1992 to restore the family
name and preserve the artistic treasures and historic sites it once
owned or financed.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has never seen anything like this. With a cost of $3.5
million, ``Stroganoff'' is the biggest art show ever initiated in
Oregon. To celebrate, there were two gala dinners (one black tie,
one white tie). The over-the-top opening ceremony on Friday
featured Russian gypsy singers and a troop of Cossack dancers who
changed costumes three times and leaped, whirled, kicked,
back-flipped and stomped before a standing-room-only audience of
1,250 schoolchildren and museum members (dozens of others had been
turned away).
</P>
<P>
   Also present were Oregon's governor; both of its senators;
Svetlana Ushakova, the wife of the Russian ambassador; and
Portland's mayor. Piotrovsky and nearly 60 other Russian officials
and curators flew in. Only Vladimir Gusev, the director of the
State Russian Museum, stayed home: at the last minute Acting
President Vladimir Putin called him to a meeting on the museum's
budget.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As much as this exhibition is about artistic treasures, it is
also about history lost and history regained, thanks to the last
Stroganoff. Now 57, de Ludinghausen is the only child of Princess
Xenia Shcherbatova-Stroganova (who lives in Paris but, at 87, could
not travel to Portland) and Andrei, Baron de Ludinghausen, who is
no longer living. As children both fled Russia with their parents,
taking nothing from the family collections but jewelry, a few
Faberge eggs and a few icons, de Ludinghausen said. She was born in
Paris, but the family soon moved to Rio de Janeiro. They maintained
some Russian traditions, and de Ludinghausen learned Russian as a
child because her paternal grandmother refused to speak anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``I was brought up with Russia as a dream, the Russia
of my grandparents, and the Russia of the day was for me foreign,
threatening, scary _ they were Communists and they were enemies.
There was that gap, and so I never wanted to go to Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying in the United States and Switzerland, de
Ludinghausen settled in Paris in 1963, went to work for Yves Saint
Laurent in 1969 and two years later became the director of his
couture salons, her current position.
</P>
<P>
   It was her husband, an Englishman named Robin Smith-Ryland, who
pushed her to go to Russia in 1985, just before their marriage. De
Ludinghausen was delighted by the country's beauty, she recalled,
but depressed by the sadness of the people. She did not return
until 1992, when a Russian friend she had met through her job put
her in touch with Gusev, whose museum has responsibility for the
Stroganoff Palace.
</P>
<P>
   De Ludinghausen did not ask Gusev for any of her family's
possessions. ``I knew I would never get them,'' she said. ``And I
have no children. If I had children, it might have been different.
This has become my child; this is my way of keeping my family
alive. If all of this were mine, I would be happy to leave it to
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But a friend pushed her to do an exhibition, she met Buchanan,
and their work began. They did not have much to start with.
``Helene lent me two books that her grandfather and her father
kept,'' Buchanan said in his office here, unwrapping two large
catalogs. One is an 1835 catalog of the collection of Count
Alexander Stroganoff (1734-1811), a close friend to Catherine the
Great, who bought many French paintings and who opened the palace
gallery to anyone interested in art.
</P>
<P>
   The other book is the catalog of the works sold in Berlin in
1931 by Soviet officials. In it, the Stroganoffs had penciled in
the prices the works brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fall 1996 we went to Russia together and the doors were
flung open,'' Buchanan said. At that time the Russian museums did
not disclose provenance on their wall labels. ``The curators knew
what was Stroganoff,'' Piotrovsky said in an interview. Museum
directors instructed staff members to help, and as de Ludinghausen
and Buchanan walked through galleries, Buchanan took notes and
Polaroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to make inventories,'' he said. ``It became a
wonderful research fest,'' not least because the Stroganoffs had
assembled a universal collection that, extraordinarily for
Europeans at that time, included even pre-Columbian works from
Mexico. In five trips to Russia, Buchanan estimates, they looked at
as many as 2,000 artworks. To help edit them, he hired Penelope
Hunter-Stiebel, a former decorative arts curator at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art who is vice president at Rosenberg &AMP;
Stiebel, a Manhattan gallery.
</P>
<P>
   They were shown everything that belonged to the Stroganoffs but
were not allowed to borrow everything they wanted. Buchanan coveted
a pair of Egyptian-style tables whose lapis lazuli tops were too
fragile to travel. Hunter-Stiebel wanted a Fra Angelico gold
painting on panel that travel might also jeopardize. But they did
get a lot _ as much, Piotrovsky said, as any large museum, like the
Met, would have gotten. ``We wanted to pay homage to the family,''
he said. ``If we had done it ourselves, it would have looked very
much like this. It is very much in our style; it's academic and
it's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Piotrovsky, on his first visit to Portland, said he was not
disappointed that the show was not going to bigger art centers. ``I
am absolutely sure the exhibition will be appreciated here, and we
want people to appreciate art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither that nor anything else seemed to bother de Ludinghausen.
Over four days here, she rarely stopped beaming, at least in
public. ``More and more I am feeling I am Russian,'' she said.
``And I admire the Russian people tremendously for their suffering
and for their dignity.''

   AL-MUFAQARA, West Bank _ Wrapped in a head scarf against the
rain that lashed the barren rocky hills southeast of Hebron, Mahmud
Hamamdeh stood recently in the home that he had been expelled from
and extolled the virtues of life in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade this for anything,'' Hamamdeh, 35, said of
the cave from which he, his wife, nine children and a flock of
sheep were ousted along with scores of other Palestinian cave
dwellers by Israeli soldiers in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather opened this cave,'' said Hamamdeh, who raises
sheep and goats and farms land in the valleys among the hills. ``I
was born here. My children were born here. My wife gave birth here.
This was our hospital and clinic. If we were sick, we went out to
the field, collected herbs and made medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, it's as cool in here as if it were
air-conditioned, and in winter it's warm. I'm used to this, and I'm
not comfortable anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamamdeh and his family now occupy an abandoned one-room
structure in a neighboring village, storing belongings in a tent,
like others who were forced out of their caves.
</P>
<P>
   The evictions from Al-Mufaqara and other cave hamlets in an area
of the Hebron hills that the Israeli army has declared a firing
zone can be seen as another chapter in the grinding struggle
between Israel and the Palestinians over how much land each side
will control if they finally negotiate a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be seen as the latest encroachment on a
centuries-old way of life that has been caught up in political
conflict as the Israeli authorities try to restrict the
cave-dwelling shepherds and farmers who roam the rugged hills near
the West Bank's southern boundary with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, the army has been emptying and sometimes
sealing caves on the grounds that the people were living in closed
military areas, usually declared firing zones.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Jewish settlements were built on some hills. Now,
as Israel and the Palestinians have begun negotiating a final
agreement to divide the disputed land, the military authorities
seem to be consolidating their hold on West Bank areas that remain
under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   The removals from Al-Mufaqara and neighboring hamlets were
carried out on Nov. 16, a few days after Israeli soldiers and
police dragged away militant Jewish settlers and their supporters
from Maon Farm, a nearby outpost that the government said had been
built illegally in the firing zone.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers demanded equal enforcement against the
Palestinians, and days later soldiers moved on the caves.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses here described children as crying and women as
pleading with soldiers who ordered them out: ``Where will we go?
This is our home. God help us.'' People gathered mattresses and
kitchen utensils and loaded them on tractor-drawn wagons. Tents and
sheep pens were torn down, and soldiers hauled away bedding and
animal feed, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The people of Al-Mufaqara and other hamlets trekked to
neighboring villages, where they took shelter in tents and empty
buildings. According to a list compiled by residents and given to
an Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, 300 people were evicted.
The Israeli military government in the West Bank, known as the
Civil Administration, said it had received reports from the Red
Cross of more than 100 people displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said cave dwellers were seasonal farmers who
lived in the caves a few months a year when they were cultivating
their land and grazing flocks, while actually maintaining houses in
the neighboring town of Yatta. They were allowed into the firing
zone 90 days a year and on weekends and Jewish holidays, when the
army does not train, to cultivate their lands in season, an
administration spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamamdeh and neighbors at Al-Mufaqara said they were part of
a core group that lived there year-round, joined by others who
arrived in the rainy farming season. Some people have relatives
living in family homes in Yatta, residents said, but the houses are
full and cannot accommodate the displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after it had been emptied, Al-Mufaqara still bore signs of
long-term settlement. One cave had a large wood door, locked by its
owner with a big key, with a small herb garden and earthen oven
outside. Hamamdeh had a rain-fed well near his cave, and among the
debris inside were a battered cupboard, plastic and tin
kitchenware, bags of sheep dung that had served as fuel, and
branches for a fire. A cooking stove supplied by gas canisters and
a television set powered by a car battery had been taken away, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The emptying of Al-Mufaqara and surrounding communities has
hastened the decline of what was a widespread way of life in the
hill country south of Hebron for generations of Arabs, dating from
the Muslim conquest of Palestine in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   A 19th-century American biblical geographer, Edward Robinson,
referred to cave dwellers in the area in a book published in 1841.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yaacov Havakook, an Israeli who has written a study of cave life
in the Hebron hills, said that 20 years ago the communities there
were among the most extensive known in the world, with more than
8,000 people living in hundreds of hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   But evictions of cave dwellers and restrictions on their access
to farm land by the Israeli authorities over the years have reduced
their number to a third of what it had been, Havakook said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest people to be displaced are now living in limbo,
feeling cut off from the distinctive way of life that sustained
them for hundreds of years. Israeli lawyers have petitioned the
Israeli Supreme Court to allow them to return.
</P>
<P>
   On a muddy hillside swept by wind and hail, Niman Jabarin and
his extended family camped in burlap tents that provided little
shelter from the cold. Evicted from a hamlet that was cleared a few
weeks before Al-Mufaqara, they are hunkering down with their
flocks, keeping alive the hope that they will be permitted to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a life,'' Jabarin said as red-nosed children in
thin sweaters picked their way among the tents. ``It's like living
in a jail. We have to go back.''

CHICAGO'S LATEST ANTI-LOITERING LAW TARGETS HIGH-CRIME AREAS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Trying to thwart gangs without running afoul of
constitutional rights, the Chicago City Council has passed an
anti-loitering law that allows police to order suspicious crowds to
scatter.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which limits enforcement to high-crime areas, drew
criticism from some council members, who said it singled out racial
minorities. But a majority of black council members approved the
bill as a needed tool to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure passed in 1992 was struck down last June in a
6-3 vote of the U.S. Supreme Court, which said it was too vague.
But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a concurring opinion, wrote
that the Chicago measure could be rewritten in ways to make it
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure, backed by Mayor Richard M. Daley and passed by
the Council in a 44-to-5 vote last Wednesday, addressed the
concerns about the earlier measure's vagueness by specifically
citing ``gang and narcotics loitering.'' It allows the police to
order loiterers to disband within five minutes, and to ``remove
themselves from within sight and hearing'' of a designated spot for
at least three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, the city would limit enforcement to
designated ``hot spots'' in neighborhoods with high rates of crime.
Under the earlier anti-loitering law, which was lifted in 1995
after lower courts ruled against it, the police made more than
40,000 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago law is one of dozens of anti-loitering measures
passed throughout the nation in recent years by cities trying to
deal with crime and, in some cases, homeless people. The City
Council in Annapolis, Md., approved a measure last week that bars
convicted drug dealers from loitering in designated areas and
allows the police to scatter crowds suspected of dealing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council in Grand Prairie, Texas, passed an ordinance
last November that allows the police to scatter loiterers if
officers suspect drug dealing. Officials in Cleveland are
considering rewriting an anti-loitering measure aimed at
prostitution after a federal court struck down an earlier version.
And many cities, including San Francisco and New York, have
conducted sweeps aimed at removing homeless people from the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The action in Chicago drew criticism from the American Civil
Liberties Union here, which released a statement saying it was
``disheartened'' by the measure. ``This ensures that thousands of
innocent persons of color will be arrested for no good reason,''
the ACLU statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago measure won approval from 15 black council members,
including Michael Chandler, who said the issue was not civil
liberties, but rather ``people selling heroin to our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Several council members said people were being made prisoners in
their homes because they feared gang members on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   But Leslie Hairston, a black councilwoman, said the law
``legalizes racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Another black councilwoman, Dorothy Tillman, called the measure
``anti-black'' and ``inhumane.''
</P>
<P>
   Hairston also asserted that neighborhoods designated as
high-crime areas would see property values fall.
</P>
<P>
   For Daley, who has steadily built support among blacks since
first winning office in 1989 with only about 10 percent of the
black vote, moves aimed at making poor neighborhoods safer have
been central to his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, in her opinion last year, said that the law would be
permissible if its language would take aim at loiterers ``with no
apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable
areas, to intimidate others from those areas or to conceal illegal
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley said the new measure was written to closely follow
O'Connor's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they will begin enforcement of the measure
within a month, after working with community leaders to select
areas that qualify under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Police Superintendent Terry Hillard, who is black and supports
the measure, said his officers would be trained to enforce the law
without overstepping its scope. Critics of the earlier law say the
police used that measure to make indiscriminate sweeps in some
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping to do is give them a warning _ `You don't
need to be on this corner,''' Hillard said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, a city of about 2.7 million, is about 40 percent white,
40 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic.

COMMENTARY: REMEMBERING A GEORGE FOR ALL SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy Washington's Birthday! Tuesday we celebrate the career of
a George who became first in the hearts of his countrymen without
conducting a single town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, by the way, was actually born on Feb. 11, not 22. In
1752 Britain and its colonies jumped ahead 11 days in order to get
their calendar in sync with the rest of Europe. After that, he was
never entirely certain about his birthdate, or even birth year,
since the Americans also shifted New Year's Day from March 25 to
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Excuse me, but why in the world are you telling me all this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I just thought it would be a nice millennial touch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Uh-huh. Actually, I was hoping you'd explain how the Bush
campaign managed to spend $50 million so fast.
</P>
<P>
   A: George W. Bush was asked that very question last week. He
told reporters that ``We have a plan in place,'' and also that
``We're on the plan.'' He went on to say that his campaign had
``got a plan,'' which was ``a broad plan'' and ``a plan that's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So in other words, it's a plan.
</P>
<P>
   A: The official theory is that the Bush campaign cannily and
deliberately threw all its resources into smashing John McCain in
South Carolina, confident that it would still be able to raise
heaps more money later on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the unofficial theory?
</P>
<P>
   A: Contrarians believe that Bush, like Al Gore before him, fell
victim to the Law of Financial Leakage, which dictates that a
candidate's assets will quickly come into equilibrium with
supporters' desire to spend them. Cynics refer to this as the
District Chairmen With Unemployed Relatives Rule, and it is far
more effective than the Federal Election Commission in leveling out
the presidential playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you tried that out on the Bush campaign people?
</P>
<P>
   A: They prefer it to the Gramm-Connally Law, which states that
presidential candidates who emerge from Texas bearing pots and pots
of money inevitably come to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is George Bush really a completely different candidate now?
How do you get a middle-aged man to change himself so fast?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stylistically, Bush has simply adopted the Al Gore tactic of
demonstrating his sincerity by raising his voice. But while Gore
likes to yell out entire sentences, Bush simply goes for every
other noun. (``The people of THIS STATE can start the end of the
CLINTON ERA in Washington D.C.'')
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you remind me again what compassionate conservatism is?
</P>
<P>
   A: To quote Bush: ``It is conservative to lower taxes. It is
compassionate to give the money back to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you lowered taxes, who else would you give the money back
to?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hey, you can't claim the low road from a high horse. We're
talking about reducing the toll booth to the middle class and
demolishing the tolls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How come when the other candidates are fuzzy on an issue,
reporters say they're ``ducking,'' but when John McCain does it
they say he's ``evolving''?
</P>
<P>
   A: When reporters point out contradictions in his positions,
Senator McCain often says, ``That's a good point, I'll have to
think about that.'' This is what we call evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How come he got whomped in South Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   A: Look, it's an unusual place. Half of American history
involves efforts to get South Carolina to stop acting out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw the Democrats had a debate last night. Whatever
happened to that primary?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some say John McCain sucked the air out of Bill Bradley's
campaign. My own theory is that Bradley's troubles began when women
realized that he sounds a lot like an extremely pompous husband
pretending to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does he still have a chance?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bradley is trying to re-start his campaign even as we speak.
He says the state of Washington could be the firewall that stops Al
Gore in his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Say what?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's the plan, and if it keeps the race alive until my
state gets a chance to vote, let there be firewalls. The Washington
primary, by the way, is on Feb. 29. Have I mentioned that, because
of calendric reforms initiated by Pope Gregory XIII, this is the
first '00 leap year since 1600?

NEWS ANALYSIS: CLINTON RISKS IRE IN INDIA OR PAKISTAN
</HEADLINE>
   (kd) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Will he or won't he? Should he or shouldn't
he?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions are the talk of the capitals of India and
Pakistan as President Clinton _ who has announced that next month
he will become the first president since Jimmy Carter to visit
India _ makes the excruciatingly difficult decision about whether
he will also stop in Pakistan, where the military seized power in a
coup four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is steep either way he calls it. India is
unequivocally opposed to such a visit. Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee has warned that the public here will be deeply offended if
Clinton goes. Likewise, Pakistan is prepared to take great umbrage
if Clinton does not pay his respects there. Pakistani officials
warn that his absence could generate a vicious anti-American
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk in the current angry, charged atmosphere _ one
in which both sides have dug in their heels on some of the most
contentious issues _ that Clinton's trip will stir resentments in
both countries and leave peace just as distant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The last serious attempt at a peace initiative ended
disastrously. A year ago Monday, the prime ministers of India and
Pakistan held a news conference in Lahore, Pakistan, and promised
to work out their differences at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the Pakistani army apparently supported an infiltration
of forces into the Indian-held part of Kashmir, a Himalayan
territory that both countries claim, provoking an armed conflict
there last summer that replaced the nascent good will between the
two nations with bitter mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is hoping to persuade India to return to negotiations
with Pakistan, he is likely to be disappointed. Once burned and
twice shy, India is unwilling to talk until it is convinced that
Pakistan is no longer sponsoring attacks on Indian forces in
Kashmir, which India sees as terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians contend that a presidential visit to Pakistan would
legitimize and prolong a military dictatorship that they say is
using Islamic militants to intensify its proxy war against India in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Every few days, several Indian soldiers and policemen are killed
in Kashmir by militants, which India says is evidence of Pakistan's
continuing bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on the region also worry that Clinton is
overestimating the power of his personality to get the two sides
talking again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president may not get the message how committed the
Pakistani army leadership is to fomenting violent insurgency in
Kashmir and how readily Pakistani leaders in the past have told
Americans what they want to hear, only to take advantage of their
naivete later,'' said George Perkovich, a security analyst and the
author of ``India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   The military government has not given ground on the major
American concerns: a timetable for the return of democracy, a
crackdown on terrorists operating in Pakistan and help in
persuading Pakistan's allies who control much of Afghanistan, the
Taliban, to turn over Osama bin Laden, the terrorism suspect who is
believed to be living there.
</P>
<P>
   And the Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, or Fighters Movement, is still
functioning in Pakistan. American officials say the group, which is
on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations, was
behind the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane in December,
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the group, Javed Jabbar, a close friend and adviser
to Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, said: ``The
acts of particular individuals who may do certain things do not
necessarily reflect a particular organization's conscious policy.
To focus on that while ignoring the state terrorism of 500,000
Indian troops in Kashmir is so disparate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials and some experts argue that a Clinton visit
to Pakistan is essential if he is serious about trying to further
the cause of peace because there are two adversaries and it makes
no sense to talk to only one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military leaders, like their civilian predecessors,
have sought to put Kashmir at the center of the international
agenda. Earlier this month, the general went to Muzaffarabad,
capital of the Pakistani-held part of Kashmir, and gave a fiery
speech in support of the militants fighting Indian rule on the
other side of the ``line of control'' that divides the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians recently ruled out once again the proposal long
put forward by Pakistan to have the United States or the United
Nations mediate the conflict. And Clinton said he would not press
for that without an invitation from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many difficulties, Stephen P. Cohen, a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution, said Clinton should open lines of
communication to the general that would be important if India and
Pakistan end up in an armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians will resent this,'' Cohen said, ``but they should
resent even more the long delay in going to their country.
Hopefully they'll be polite hosts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials and intellectuals warn that a presidential
snub of their country, an old Cold War ally, would enrage Islamic
militants and weaken secular-minded modernizers in the army, making
conflict with India more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would certainly strengthen those forces in our society that
are extremist and skeptical of the United States,'' Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistanis' willingness to brandish the specter of a
nuclear-armed Pakistan threatened by rising Islamic fundamentalism
and weakened by a deeply troubled economy irritates Indians, who
see it as a kind of blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   But some American diplomats find the specter real and
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an element of rhetorical blackmail, but these
concerns are real,'' said a senior administration official. ``This
is a country with a demonstrated nuclear capacity that has
increasing concerns about terrorist organizations, about jihad,
about sectarian violence.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, it does not appear likely that the
president will collect any easy victory in either country on issues
of war and peace. He has hoped that both countries will sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a step that Washington says would
slow the nuclear arms race here, but neither country seems inclined
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalist-led government of India, which sought no
national consensus before it tested nuclear weapons in May 1998,
insists that it must build just such a consensus now before it
signs the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton has decided that it is in American
interests to engage India, a democracy that is home to one-sixth of
humanity, on issues ranging from the environment to trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be stupid of the United States to ignore India's
potential economically, or its role in dealing with global
problems,'' said an American diplomat. ``It would not serve our
purpose well if we shunned India or sent it to the gulag of bad-boy
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton will have to make similar calculations about
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes that this is a close call,'' said an
administration official, who seemed relieved that it was not his
call.

MISSING SKIER, 10, FOCUSED ON RESCUE, NOT COLD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERVILLE VALLEY, N.H. _ Lost Sunday night on a pitch-black
mountainside covered with snow drifts up to 7 feet, a frightened
10-year-old Ryan Lanagan fought off thoughts of death by convincing
himself rescuers were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 hours later, the young skier was found _ a wet and
hungry fourth-grader waving desperately at a Black Hawk helicopter
who had just spotted him with an infrared scope.
</P>
<P>
   After a mug of hot chocolate following his rescue Monday
morning, the 85-pound boy, missing only skis and mittens, was
declared physically fine and released to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dark and I was scared,'' said an exhausted Ryan Monday,
his voice still scratchy and raw from the adventure in 10-15 degree
temperatures. He had trudged for hours in chest-high snow. ``I laid
down in the snow and got all wet and cold...but I knew they would
come for me. Then the men came and they gave me a peanut butter
sandwich and I kept saying, `Thank you for finding me. Thank you
for finding me.' I was really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a 100 rescue workers broke out in cheers when Ryan was
brought down the mountain in a sled shortly after 9 a.m. Monday.
Many skiers celebrating the start of school vacation had offered to
help look for the boy, but authorities declined, fearing they too
would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of rescue workers mobilized as soon as Ryan's parents
reported him missing around 6 p.m. Working through the night on
foot and skis and with dogs and infrared devices, the group scoured
the mountain twice, the base camp and town. Helicopters that were
prevented from searching for the boy because of bad weather Sunday
night joined the search at daybreak Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just grabbed him and hugged him and told him I loved him,''
said Tom Lanagan, Ryan's father, after the boy was brought down the
mountain. ``This is awesome...he said he knew we'd find him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan became lost after he took a shuttle bus to the slopes from
the vacation condo his family had rented. Ryan was to meet his
father at the bottom of the White Peak lift, rescuers said. But
bored or eager to ski one last time, he took the lift up.
</P>
<P>
   After finding only strangers at the top of the mountain, Ryan _
a solid skier _ turned right to go down the trail. After starting
down, he went over the left hand edge and into the trees. He fell,
and because of the deep snow, he decided to walk down.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan didn't realize he was descending farther and farther
into the valley _ and away from the ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got thick so I took my skis off and started walking down
and I got almost to the bottom and thought it wouldn't end,'' Ryan
said Monday, after taking a nap with his mother for more than two
hours. Usually rambunctious, Ryan was low-keyed Monday, family
members said. ``I started walking up but I got really tired and
just fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of his rescue, Ryan had awoken at 8 a.m., he told
rescuer Robert Eames, one of the first workers to reach him. When
Eames asked Ryan how he knew the time, the boy considered the
question and then said calmly ``Well, it could have been quarter to
eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers praised the boy for having the sense to stay calm
and in one place. Ryan found a small trail of packed snow, stuck to
it and fell asleep on it. He was found about 150 yards off the
Tangent Trail and about three-quarters of the way up the mountain,
rescuers estimated.
 heard the helicopters during the night and knew they were
there. I woke up and started waving at them and then the men showed
up,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he remembered what to do through an outdoor survival
program his older brother went through at Old Rochester Junior
High: How he shouldn't waste energy. How he should try to stay in
one place.
</P>
<P>
   He was also dressed well, rescue workers said: a burnt orange
and black ski parka, blue ski pants, a black helmet and layers
underneath. He was skiing on short, double-ended skis.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's father, Tom, said he cannot begin to properly thank
rescue workers from the state police, Waterville police, New
Hampshire Fish and Game, the National Guard and others.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Day, the resort's general manager, arranged for the family
to use a condo during the rescue. Debbie Moore, another worker at
the resort, comforted Ryan's mother, Laura, through the night.
Monday night, the family met with rescue workers at a local
restaurant to thank them.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lanagan has been skiing with his wife and three children
every weekend in Waterville this year, along with about five other
families. They spent much of last winter there as well. No one
thought twice about having Ryan meet his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course now, you kick yourself for having them ski alone,
especially that time of day,'' said Tom Lanagan. ``And he was
trying to catch up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Eames said there have been deaths on the mountain in the
last 35 years, he cannot recall anyone getting lost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Waterville and Tom Lanagan said the happy ending to
what could have been a tragic tale contains a warning for parents:
Just because ski areas look safe, they are still in the middle of
the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think parents...go to ski resorts that are perfectly groomed
and they get this sense of security,'' said Waterville deputy
police chief Al Burbank. ``Take heart...this is the wilderness and
if kids get separated it's no different than getting lost on a
hiking trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ryan says he can't wait to hit the slopes again. He
may take a day off. But he expects to be skiing again Wednesday.

MCCAIN IN CONTROL IN HOME STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The winter has been so dry here that strong winds over
the weekend blew up a blinding dust storm, causing traffic
accidents and veiling this Valley of the Sun in a brown haze. In
local politics, there's also turbulence in the air, and the dust
may not settle until well after Tuesday's GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, Arizona's three-term US senator, is the heavy
favorite to beat his rival, Texas Governor George W. Bush, in the
primary. But if it's not a romp, it will be because Jane Hull, the
state's Republican governor, has led a drive to embarrass McCain
and deny him the kind of victory a popular senator would expect on
his home turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a governor, you quickly learn that the buck stops with you.
I admire what George Bush has done in Texas, and for that reason I
am supporting him,'' Hull said during a news conference at the
state Capitol Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said she did not expect Bush to beat McCain, but anything
short of a 30-point advantage for the senator would be unimpressive
and not helpful, she predicted, particularly if McCain also loses
Tuesday's important Michigan primary on the heels of a bitter
defeat Saturday in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain and I have a healthy respect for each other,''
Hull continued, though it is well-known here that she thinks he has
treated her rudely and dismissively. Hull said she hoped she wasn't
``being Pollyanna-ish'' to believe there was no political risk in
endorsing Bush and crossing the state's senior senator.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away and five stories up in a sleek office building,
Hull's son, Mike, is managing Bush's Arizona campaign. He is
overseeing phone banks, neighborhood canvassing (the Arizona
governor herself went door-to-door in nearby Mesa over the
weekend), and a television-advertising blitz that started in
December. Bush said he intends to spend $2 million here, a hefty
sum to win 30 delegates in an opponent's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has spent a fortune, and his goal is to keep John's
margin of victory down,'' said US Representative John Shadegg, a
Phoenix Republican who is backing McCain and predicts he will win
by a ``double-digit margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate that Shadegg is right and Bush's
aggressive campaign here hasn't entirely paid off. According to a
survey conducted by the Arizona Republic newspaper last week,
McCain leads Bush by 23 points, 52 percent to 29 percent among
registered Republicans, the only ones who can vote in the primary.
McCain's lead in last week's Grand Canyon State poll was even
wider, 60 to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's effort here is more modest than Bush's. Headquartered
in an office storefront not far from the candidate's north Phoenix
home, the campaign is relying on volunteers, a single radio ad, and
the maverick senator's history of popularity among voters, if not
his fellow GOP officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Gullett, McCain's longtime political operative in Arizona,
expects the campaign here to cost $200,000, but it will not respond
to what he says is a barrage of negative attacks from Bush's
backers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have called John McCain a liberal, a hypocrite,
everything but FDR,'' Gullett said. ``The governor has called
John's temper into question and said less than positive things
about him. It's been very disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   If preliminary voting is any guide, Republicans could come out
in record numbers. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix,
26,000 absentee ballots had been cast by the end of last week, up
from 16,000 returned in 1996. About 1 million Republicans are
registered in Arizona, and both the Bush and McCain campaigns
believe as many as 40 percent of them will vote.
</P>
<P>
   David Hardt of Phoenix expects to be one of them, though Monday
he still hadn't decided who to support. A Navy veteran of Desert
Storm, he likes McCain because he believes the president should
have a military record. An avid gun-rights advocate who carries a
concealed weapon, Hardt has been persuaded by the National Rifle
Association that Bush would be a stronger opponent of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning, it's Bush, by the night, it's McCain,'' Hardt
laughed. ``I need to make up my mind.''

DISSIDENTS TO PRESS FOR SHAKEUP OF PIONEER GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After two years of trying to keep its troubles inside
the family, Pioneer Group Inc. appears headed for a shakeup led by
outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund group two weeks ago hired investment bankers to
review its strategic options, including a possible sale of the
company. But Lens Investment Management, a high-profile activist
investor group, says that's not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   In a release, Lens called Pioneer's announcement ``superficial
and disappointing.'' The Portland, Maine, investment firm declared,
``We plan to to press the company to take more aggressive steps to
increase shareholder value. We're exploring stronger actions.''
</P>
<P>
   What's stronger than mulling a sale? That could become clearer
this week, as Lens is expected to lay out its recommendations for
Pioneer. Lens is run by Bob Monks, a former top executive of the
Boston Co. who later did a stint overseeing pension plans in
President Reagan's Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Lens has quietly become a significant _ but not dominant _
shareholder in Pioneer, acquiring about 4.1 percent of the stock
late last year. That's dwarfed by a 17.9 percent stake held by
Southeastern Asset Management Inc. of Memphis and 8.9 percent owned
by the Gabelli funds.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Pioneer's chairman, Hale and Dorr partner John F.
Cogan Jr., who holds 13.6 percent of the stock, according to a
recent securities filing.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer seems to be courting the favor of its biggest investor.
The firm named Southeastern Asset's retired cofounder, W. Reid
Sanders, 50, to its board this month, in one of three new director
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   David Tripple, president of Pioneer's mutual fund unit, said
expanding the board is ``all part of good corporate governance.''
He said the director seat for Southeastern had been a ``standing
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripple said Southeastern, which runs the Longleaf Partners
funds, has ``made good money'' on its Pioneer investment. That's no
small claim. Pioneer shares slumped 20.3 percent in 1999 after
diving 30 percent in 1998. This year they've climbed back 13.5
percent, to 17 7/8 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund analysts have long regarded Pioneer, one of the
industry's oldest fund firms, as a buyout candidate, because of its
modest size. The firm manages $24.5 billion worldwide, up less than
5 percent in a year when stock markets soared.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's value-investing style has been a competitive problem
in a market in which fast-growth Internet stocks have dominated.
Geoffrey Bobroff, an independent fund consultant in East Greenwich,
R.I., said Pioneer entirely missed the growth surge of the late
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've added a couple of growth funds, but it's been a slow
grind for them,'' Bobroff said. ``Hopefully the purpose here is to
refocus the company.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pioneer, 1999 was a year of shrinking ambitions. The fund
firm had once hoped to build a portfolio of far-flung businesses,
from a Ghanaian gold mine and a Polish brokerage to Russian bank
and timber operations.
</P>
<P>
   It has now closed the once-profitable gold mine, after failing
to sell it. The Polish brokerage was sold, but Pioneer is still
losing money on its pension unit in Poland. The company lost $2
million on Russian timber last year. Its Russian bank became
corrupt and was shut down in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nagging problems, Tripple insists the company is on
its way to a turnaround. The fourth quarter marked its first profit
since early 1998. The question is whether investors want to wait
for improvements that could boost a sale price for the company.

   Said Tripple, ``If we wanted to sell the company, we'd have gone
out and cut a deal with somebody.''

<P>
   Lens may not sit idly by and wait for that to happen.

FOX SCRUBS `MULTIMILLIONAIRE' AMID CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fox network, mired in an embarrassing controversy over the
background of the first groom featured on ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'', has hastily scrubbed plans to air future
episodes of the ratings blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be going forward with any of these specials
in the future,'' a Fox spokesman, Tom Tyrer, said in an interview
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's abrupt abandonment of ``Multimillionaire,'' whose live TV
nuptials of complete strangers drew nearly 23 million viewers when
it aired last Tuesday night, vividly illustrates the risks inherent
in ``reality programming,'' a lurid format the networks have
embraced in a quest for smaller costs and larger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy blew up in Fox's face when it was reported that
42-year-old Rick Rockwell, the first ``multimillionaire'' to appear
on the program, had been the subject of a restraining order
obtained in 1991 by an ex-fiancee who had alleged in court
documents that Rockwell had assaulted and threatened her.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell denied the allegations to reporters Monday, saying:
``At no time have I ever struck any of my girlfriends, ever, for
any reason.'' But the old charges were enough to sink
``Multimillionaire'' just one week after it emerged as one of the
phenomena of the current TV season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' offered a two-hour
spectacle of women parading onstage in bathing suits and wedding
gowns while Rockwell, seated in shadows, made his choice: Darva
Conger, a 34-year-old emergency room nurse from Santa Monica,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, a veteran standup comedian who has performed in Boston
and who now describes himself as a real estate developer, proposed
to Conger on bended knee. The pair were married and left for a
Caribbean honeymoon, from which they returned Monday. Conger could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of sweeps-period stunts,
``Multimillionaire'' was viewed as extreme. But in ratings terms,
it was a coup for Fox, which had planned to rerun the program
Tuesday until controversy over Rockwell's past erupted.
``Multimillionaire'' ignited plenty of water-cooler buzz after its
Tuesday broadcast, and it touched off a national debate about
gender relations, with op-ed columns and newsmagazines weighing in.
</P>
<P>
   One person who wasn't sorry to hear the death knell for
``Multimillionaire'' is Patricia Ireland, president of the National
Organization for Women, who cracked last week that ``it took
something like this to make the Miss America pageant look good to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Boston Globe, Ireland said the program
``portrayed marriage as if it were no more important than a blind
date . . . It portrayed the most retro and regressive stereotypes
of women and men. It was women competing for a man based on their
looks and charm, and all they needed to know about him was his
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it, my next question was: `How long is it before
they're going to want to show the honeymoon?' '' Ireland added. ``
`Who Wants to Honeymoon with a Millionaire?' This time, at least,
we had the fadeout before the honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the ``Multimillionaire'' debacle begin the fadout for
``reality'' programs? Few analysts think so.
</P>
<P>
   J. Max Robins, a columnist for TV Guide, said reality programs
are likely to survive because they tap into ``voyeuristic side of
viewers,'' though he predicted the networks will be ``a little more
careful in how they set it up, and police themselves a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rash, senior vice president at the Minneapolis-based
advertising agency Campbell Mithun Esty, also sees no end in sight.
``For right now, the networks are more than willing to risk
short-term embarrassment for even shorter-term ratings gain,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings gains can be dramatic. ABC's ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire,'' which kicked off the current craze, displaced NBC's
``ER'' as the most-watched show on television, drawing more than 30
million viewers and singlehandedly pulling ABC out of the ratings
doldrums. Likewise, ``WWF Smackdown!'', a low-brow wrestling show,
has almost resuscitated the UPN network.
</P>
<P>
   Other networks have taken note, and are developing ``reality''
programs of their own for the months ahead. Normally sedate CBS
plans to devote 13 weeks this summer to ``Survivor,'' a ``Lord of
the Flies''-like program in which 16 contestants will be stranded
on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, one contestant is kicked off the island by a vote of
the others. The final contestant left wins a cash prize. In a
version of ``Survivor'' that aired in Sweden, one contestant
committed suicide after he was eliminated from the program.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also plans to air ``Big Brother,'' which throws a dozen
strangers together in a house and records their every move with
cameras and microphones; viewers can look in on them, night or day,
on the Internet. A syndicated show called ``Wed at First Sight''
will debut this fall, featuring a marriage per day.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darnell, the Fox executive behind ``Multimillionaire,'' has
earned big ratings with such specials as ``When Good Pets Go Bad.''
It was Darnell who proposed last year that Fox crash an empty plane
on live TV _ an idea the network rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox is not likely to forswear reality programs altogether.
The network was trying Monday to figure out what had gone wrong.
Sources said contestants for ``Multimillionaire'' had undergone a
lengthy screening process, including a background check, but that
the screening had failed to discover the restraining order against
Rockwell because he had not been convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The network concluded, sources said, that it was best to
discontinue ``Multimillionaire'' because it is impossible to learn
every aspect of a contestant's background and potential behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet whether the production company behind
``Multimillionaire'' will be able to interest another network in
airing it. What is clear is that ``Multimillionaire'' is one of the
more memorable flameouts in recent TV history.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, founder of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University, called the ``Multimillionaire''
concept ``in incredibly bad taste, a ludicrous, terrible idea''
that nonetheless kept him riveted to his chair last Tuesday. It was
a combination of revulsion and fascination apparently shared by the
nearly 23 million other other viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Reality programs ``are using real people in what could be
fascinating stories, but have the potential for danger,'' Thompson
said. ``You're essentially taking these people and letting them be
absorbed by a process they may lose control of.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Alex Arena is trying to pull off the biggest deal in
the history of Hong Kong _ one that has confounded analysts and
roiled markets here for more than a week. But Arena, the managing
director of Pacific Century CyberWorks, seemed remarkably at ease
Monday, as he stopped for a sandwich between meetings in a
conference room packed with investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking a while for people to understand our strategy,''
Arena said. ``But I don't mind, because we like to have some
element of surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise has not been lacking in the short, fiery history of
Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd. Since going public last April, this
Hong Kong Internet company has amassed a market capitalization of
$31 billion, invested in more than 30 start-ups and drawn an
avalanche of press coverage. Ten days ago, it disclosed that it
might bid for Hong Kong's flagship telephone company, Cable &AMP;
Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Pacific Century and Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT
continued here Monday, and a growing number of analysts now predict
that Pacific Century will trump previously disclosed merger talks
between Cable &AMP; Wireless and Singapore Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Arena declined to comment on the status of the negotiations, but
he left little doubt that his company was dead serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expression of interest in Hong Kong Tel represents the
sort of acquisitive position we're in as a company to accelerate
our business plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like America Online and Time Warner in the United States,
Pacific Century's bid for Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT dramatizes the
gravity-defying levels of Internet stocks in Asia. But Pacific
Century's gambit is in some ways even more brazen than AOL's: The
company has no operating profits, no customers and has not even
started the Internet and television service that is supposed to be
its core business.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century remains almost entirely a bet on the pluck of
its 33-year-old chairman, Richard Li, the son of Hong Kong's
legendary tycoon, Li Ka-shing. The younger Li started the company
in 1993 and owns a majority of its stock. So far, he _ and the
connections of his family _ have been enough to overcome skepticism
about its stratospheric share price and sketchy business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a classic Hong Kong mania,'' said David Webb, who
edits Webb-site.com, a site that tracks local stock offerings. ``We
had one for China-related stocks in `97, and we're having one for
Internet stocks now. Hong Kong always seems to catch this fever
worse than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, a former investment banker, contends that Pacific Century
should have a market value of about $7.5 billion, based on its
existing assets and the anticipated future profits from its
Internet-access service. He said it traded at $31 billion _ more
than Amazon.com _ because of the perceived value of Li and the
general euphoria over anything Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century is not the only shooting star among Hong Kong
start-ups. People mobbed local banks Monday to pick up applications
for shares in Tom.com, a Chinese-language Internet portal that
plans to issue shares in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Analysts note that
Tom.com is the Internet vehicle of the elder Li's company _ a fact
that seems to outweigh the portal's rather meager offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But while Li Ka-shing has a hot stock, his son may soon acquire
one of Hong Kong's largest employers and most entrenched
monopolies. Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, which is 54 percent-owned by
Cable &AMP; Wireless of Britain, is itself valued at over $30 billion.
The company was for years the jewel in its parent's crown, though
its profits have been eroded by deregulation in the Hong Kong
communications market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that politics will help Pacific Century in its
bid. Neither the Hong Kong nor the mainland Chinese government is
pleased by the prospect of Hong Kong's local phone company being
taken over by archrival Singapore. Richard Li, by contrast, is seen
as a local boy made good. And his father has cultivated close ties
with senior Chinese leaders in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cable &AMP; Wireless has a tricky task in negotiating with
Pacific Century. Any offer is likely to be largely, or even wholly,
in the form of Pacific Century stock. Before agreeing to a deal,
the Cable &AMP; Wireless directors will have to estimate the underlying
value of the company's shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be stupid to accept large quantities of PCCW's
paper for what is still a valuable business,'' Webb said. ``When
you've got a solid currency, you shouldn't trade it for a
hyper-inflated currency.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena declined to comment on the stock. But he said it was
unfair to characterize Pacific Century as an empty vessel. He noted
that it had amassed a portfolio of Internet investments rivaling
those of Softbank of Japan and CMGI of the United States _ and
turned a $1 billion profit in the process. And he said it had
broken ground on Cyberport, a $1.7 billion technology park here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where this belief comes from that we don't have
any businesses,'' Arena said. ``We do have businesses, and we have
a huge pipeline of Internet investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century's biggest imponderable is its core business. In
two months, it plans to begin rolling out an Internet-access and
interactive television service, immodestly called Network of the
World, that will be transmitted via satellite to cable operators
throughout Asia. The cable systems would then deliver the service
to subscribers, whose homes would be outfitted with modems
_allowing them to receive it either over their television sets or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to create a new kind of medium,'' said Greg
Feldberg, an analyst at Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities in Hong Kong.
``The success or failure of this service is the big gamble here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pacific Century has focused on cable distribution,
Arena said the company would gladly deliver its service over
telephone lines or by wireless transmission. Indeed, analysts said
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT would give Pacific Century instant
distribution in Hong Kong because the phone company is aggressively
upgrading its network to deliver broadband services in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the logic of a deal, Arena conceded that Pacific
Century's bid for its hometown phone company was, at heart, a
seat-of-the-pants move. ``Until the 24th of January, when Singapore
Tel and Cable &AMP; Wireless made their announcement, we didn't know
the asset was for sale,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He lived on Wall Street, a Turkish carpet on his
parlor floor, casks of Madeira in his cellar. His tall house had
scrolled dormers and fluted chimneys, which ships seeking New York
moorage sought out as landmarks. A family man with two daughters,
he owned a pew at Trinity Church.
</P>
<P>
   But the privateer William Kidd wanted more. Most especially, he
wanted a life free of 17th-century strictures.
</P>
<P>
   He fortified his ship, named Adventure, with 34 big guns and
more than a hundred men, and between 1696 and 1698 became a terror
of the seas, amassing a fortune in gold, silk and jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure was uncommon in that it was a true galley, boasting
not only sails but oars. When the wind failed, Kidd could push
ahead relentlessly, taking over a becalmed merchant ship with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Three centuries after the infamous pirate was forced to abandon
his flagship, leaving it scuttled and partly burned, a team of
marine explorers probing waters off Madagascar has found what
appears to be the Adventure's remains. Tantalizing clues include a
large pile of ballast stones, burned wood, rum bottles and Ming
porcelain shards dating from the Kidd era. Most notable of all, the
team found a large metal oarlock a foot long.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of Kidd's galley, if verified by further study of
the sunken wreckage, would reveal much about one of history's most
colorful and ill-fated pirates, who was tried and executed in
London in 1701, his body displayed as a warning to kindred souls.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say the ship's wreckage is unlikely to yield treasure.
But if it is one of the few pirate artifacts to come into modern
hands, the hulk will illuminate a lost age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with pirates is there's so little they left
behind,'' said Robert C. Ritchie, a historian and author of
``Captain Kidd and the War against the Pirates'' (Harvard, 1986).
``So to find the Adventure galley would be lovely. It's one of the
most famous pirate ships in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Indisputably, experts say, the remains of the Adventure lie
somewhere in the harbor of Ste. Marie, a tiny isle off Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates in the age of discovery hid there and would venture out
from its palm thickets to raid shipping in and around the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the Adventure is now found, or whether
the uncovered hulk is the remains of some other lost ship.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Kidd expedition, Barry L. Clifford of
Provincetown, Mass., is well known among historians and
archaeologists for having located in 1985 the Whydah, a fabled
pirate ship that sank in 1717 off Cape Cod in a fierce storm.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Whydah is the only pirate ship whose identity has
been verified, although in 1997 archaeologists found what they
believe may be the remains of Blackbeard's flagship, Queen Anne's
Revenge, off North Carolina. But the Blackbeard evidence is so far
circumstantial.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Clifford, a veteran diver just back from the
Madagascar site, said he set his sights on Adventure about three
years ago. The hunt led him to historical documents in British and
American archives, satellite images of the tropic harbor and
underwater gear that detects metal and uses high-frequency sound to
probe mud and silt.
</P>
<P>
   This month, his team of a dozen experts explored the watery
grave for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost dropped the anchor on top of the wreck,'' Clifford
said of his lucky start. ``It's a preliminary investigation. But
we're sure we've located it. Everything lines up perfectly,
especially the fact that we found this very large oarlock on the
main ballast pile.''
</P>
<P>
   Further study of the wreckage will reveal more of how Kidd and
his men lived and died, Clifford said, probably producing artifacts
like china, glassware, guns, coins, tools and a better
understanding of how Adventure was built and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a lot more investigation,'' Clifford said,
adding that readings from an underwater detector showed that the
wreckage was dense with metal. ``You never know,'' he remarked,
``they might have had silver ingots in the bilge.'' In those days,
the precious metal was sometimes used as heavy ballast to help keep
a ship steady.
</P>
<P>
   William Kidd was born in Scotland in 1645, apparently to a
family of modest means, and went to sea as a young man. In the West
Indies and off North America, he sailed as a privateer for Britain,
successfully fighting the French. In his late 40s, an established
sea captain and ship owner, he married a rich widow in New York
City in 1691 and came to own what is now some of the world's most
costly real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Winston, author of ``No Man Knows My Grave'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1969), a study of pirates and privateers, lists Kidd's
properties as corresponding to 56 Wall St., 86-90 and 119-21 Pearl
St., 52-56 Water St. and 25, 27 and 29 Pine St.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of (or perhaps because of) his growing domestic
responsibilities, Kidd sailed for London. In 1695 he received a
royal commission and investors, including some of King William's
ministers, to go fight pirates attacking ships of the British East
India Co. in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   When he got there, however, he avoided doing battle with the
brigands and instead became one himself.
</P>
<P>
   He still had a conscience, of sorts. His refusal to attack a
Dutch ship roused his crew to near mutiny, and Kidd in an angry
exchange hit his gunner so hard the blow proved fatal.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing up to a half dozen ships, including ones of
Indian and Portuguese origin, he sailed his increasingly leaky
flagship into Ste. Marie's harbor, the sea lapping at the decks.
</P>
<P>
   The crew emptied much of the sinking ship, which was then
burned, apparently by Kidd to save some metal parts for trade and
sale. He then sailed a captured merchant ship for home.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Boston and London, Kidd explained his thievery as
forced by rowdy crews lusting for gold. But the British government
dismissed evidence of rebellion and had Kidd hanged _ twice, it
turned out. The rope broke the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth J. Kinkor, a historian who works with Clifford, said
Kidd was a fall guy. ``It wouldn't have made nearly such a stir''
but for Kidd's government investors. ``They needed a scapegoat to
pacify the Mogul empire in India, and the East India Co.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities recovered some of Kidd's treasure. But stories
persist about missing hoards, the loot allegedly buried in places
like Hispaniola, Long Island at Hempstead Harbor and off the
Connecticut coast on the Charles and Thimble Islands. So far, all
fortune seekers have apparently come up empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, scholars know of no authenticated personal property of
Kidd or his men, only accounts of his life and adventures, which
are often contradictory or frustratingly vague.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford's bid to find the pirate's flagship was largely
financed by the Discovery Channel, which plans a half-hour news
special on the hunt on Feb. 25 at 9 p.m. and a documentary later
this year or next. The venture's scholarly side was aided by John
de Bry, a doctoral candidate at the Sorbonne, who specializes in
historical archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the ship hunters said the main clue to the
Adventure's grave came from testimony at a pirate trial in which a
crewman said the ship had been abandoned in the harbor near a
careening area. In the age of tall ships, careening was a necessary
job in which ships were rolled on their sides so crewmen could
scrape off barnacles and repair hull damage. Such work was
especially vital for pirates hoping to strike fast.
</P>
<P>
   The sandy beach of a tropic isle was the perfect place for a
ship to be pulled ashore and tipped for such maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Clifford and his team, the harbor at Ste. Marie
turned out to have but one beach free of rocks, marking it like an
``X'' on a treasure map. The careening spot was on a small harbor
island, named Madame, where drunken pirates are said to have
cavorted with women.
</P>
<P>
   During the team's hunt, the water was murky and the seabed thick
with sea urchins, lion fish and stone fish, whose rocklike
camouflage and poisonous spines make them a bane of divers.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, the team's second day exploring the site, Clifford
was diving over the muddy bottom off the careening beach when he
started to see what looked like ballast stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had assumed the whole thing could be buried,'' he recalled.
``Then, looming in front of me was a big, big pile of rocks. It
looked like a pin cushion, covered with huge sea urchins, their
spines a foot long. It was scary. Stone fish were everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovering over the wreck, careful to touch nothing, Clifford saw
among the ballast stones little bits of blue, which turned out to
be Ming dynasty porcelain. ``It was everywhere,'' he said. ``I
sucked my tank dry'' before being forced to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The array of large wreckage was in water some 22 feet deep and
some 125 feet off the careening beach. Further study disclosed two
other, smaller ballast piles nearby. ``These wrecks were completely
virgin,'' Clifford said. ``Not a stone was overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, Clifford looked hard for a ship's bell. It was
his discovery in 1985 of the Whydah's, inscribed ``The Whydah Gally
1716,'' that definitively marked that wreck as a lost pirate ship.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, he has found no bell off Madagascar. One day,
however, Clifford did spy a promising lump in the murk and was
fanning off the silt until, he recalled, he stopped suddenly ``an
inch short'' of hitting what turned out to be a deadly stone fish.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the team found a total of four of five different
wrecks, most probably pirate and identified by name in old
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Paris, where he went after the
expedition, de Bry said he had discovered in the French national
library a new map, dated 1755, that showed not only the careening
area but the location of two lost vessels, which the legend
identified as sunken pirate ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly where Barry found the wrecks,'' he said. ``You
can't get better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford has told Madagascar's minister of culture of the find
and is seeking permission to perform a test excavation of the
watery site. He hopes to return in the next few months and
ultimately learn enough about the Adventure to publish scholarly
papers and build a model of the ship in Boston as part of a pirate
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived on Wall Street and was the ultimate corporate
raider,'' Clifford said. ``But who was he, really?''
</P>
<P>
   The newly found wreckage, he said, may finally give the world
``a chance to find out'' a lot more about the failed adventurer,
Kidd, once a scourge of the high seas.

MCCAIN, BUSH FACE VOTE BY DIVERSE ELECTORATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeWITT TOWNSHIP, Mich. _ The men and women sitting around the
Edwin J. Leyanna Post 671 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars nursing
beers Sunday afternoon said they were for John McCain, and the news
that McCain and George W. Bush split the veterans' vote in the
South Carolina Republican primary had them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us here would like to see McCain get it,'' said Claude
Murdock, a past commander of the post, pushing his gray plaid tam
back on his forehead and shifting a well-chewed cigar from one side
of his mouth to the other. ``But I don't think he's going to make
it. He lost bad in South Carolina. I thought he would do better
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the expectations of probable voters interviewed
across central Michigan since the South Carolina vote last
Saturday, McCain faces an uphill battle in Tuesday's primary. The
polls say the race is too close to call, but Bush has strong
support from Michigan Governor John Engler, the party establishment
and whatever momentum his South Carolina victory provides.
</P>
<P>
   People here are figuring out what to make of McCain's defeat in
a much smaller state with a political culture that seems more than
a region away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be close,'' said Robert Wood, a Bush supporter and
insurance broker in Howell, a rock-solid Republican town that is
the seat of the fastest-growing county in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about it at the round table,'' he said,
referring to the old oak table by the grandfather clock in Hunter's
Family Restaurant where the town fathers meet to talk politics.
``You could almost flip a coin around this table _ it's half
McCain, half Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Wilfred ``Bud'' Erwin, a McCain supporter and
former municipal judge, nodded in agreement. ``Bush has got the
edge because of Engler,'' Erwin said, ``but it depends who gets out
and votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Engler factor cuts both ways, people said, because the state
Republican party is rife with dissension, especially over education
issues. The state chairwoman, a member of one of Michigan's most
influential families, recently resigned after falling out with the
governor. And a poll published in the Detroit News said more voters
felt negatively than positively about the governor's staunch
support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, they said, that while Michigan and South Carolina both
have strong concentrations of religious conservatives, people here
are more inclined to tolerate differences of opinion and to balk at
moral prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those veterans'' who voted for Bush in South Carolina,
``they're vets, but they're part of the religious right too,'' said
Keith Penton, who calibrates manufacturing machinery for General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling you if you're not a right-to-life person
you're not a Republican,'' Penton said. ``Well, I'm a Republican,
and . . . everybody's entitled to their own opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was shared by Scott Hilbert, a participant in
Howell's round table discussions, who said Bush's embrace of the
religious right in South Carolina helped him decide how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like religion. I think it is good,'' Hilbert said. ``But we
have separation of church and state in this country, and that is
getting too close to the line for me. It bothers me. Bush has lost
me over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, voters and outside observers alike point out, is
significant beyond the accident of timing that makes its vote this
year so vital for McCain. It is by far the most-populous, diverse
state to vote so far, with strong similarities to other
delegate-rich states of the upper Midwest such as Ohio and
Illinois. It is less conservative than South Carolina, less
contrarian than New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan is very much a microcosm of the whole country, the
first primary state that is a swing state in the general
election,'' said Mike Murphy, a top strategist for McCain and a
Michigan native whose family's farm was near Engler's family's,
outside Beal City.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy worked on Engler's last campaign, and the stratgist said
that ``not a day goes by that I don't wish he was with us. But
there's no Engler machine in Michigan, no machine that tells people
how to vote. Conservative Democrats and independents can vote'' in
the Republican primary, ``and many will.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising war that flared between Bush and McCain in the
last week of the South Carolina campaign is less prominent here,
though both men's attack ads were shown here at the time. Now, Bush
ads continue to accuse McCain. McCain criticizes Bush in public
discussions, but has withdrawn ads charging the governor with
Clintonesque untruthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bummer!'' said Daniel Markey, night clerk at the Muskegon
Holiday Inn, on the western border of the state, as the South
Carolina results rolled in. ``I like McCain because he just says
what he really thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But McCain made a big mistake calling Bush like Clinton,''
said Markey, who described himself as very conservative. When he
saw the McCain ad likening Bush to Clinton, ``it was, like, ouch!''
Markey said. ``It was not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also hurt himself, according to Adam Sobczak, who was
selling campers at a trade show in the Muskegon Mall, because he
lacked grace in defeat in South Carolina. ``He accused Bush of
taking the lower line, but it was McCain who was tossing the mud,''
Sobczak said.
</P>
<P>
   As in South Carolina, while some people here resent what they
see as Bush's attempt to ride to victory on his father's
reputation, far more give him points for his paternity. They also
said Bush senior has been better campaigning on his son's behalf
than he was on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was funny and relaxed, a delight to listen to,'' said Roger
Dachter, police chief in Northern Shores, near Muskegon, after
listening to the former president. ``He did a Ross Perot imitation
that cracked me up. If George senior had been like that in '92,
he'd have beaten Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   At a front table in Hunter's Family Restaurant, Lori Westendorf
and Jackie Bohn, friends and nursing colleagues at McPherson
Hospital, went back and forth over McCain and Bush at breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Westendorf said she liked Bush because ``he's a little more
conservative gentleman. . . . He's got a lot of those Midwestern
values I find important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohn said she liked McCain ``for all the reasons she just said
about Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of debate that, in Michigan at least, will only
end with the voting.

 &HT;    `Downshifting': Atlantans exchange corporate jobs for careers
with a mission
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A man who ditched a public relations job at
Scientific-Atlanta with the nutty notion of painting pictures for
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who left Bank of America after 30 years to run a church
shelter for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   A man who started on the fast track and then slowed down for his
child.
</P>
<P>
   A man who got downsized by Coca-Cola and upsized his enjoyment
in a bicycle shop.
</P>
<P>
   The four metro Atlantans profiled below have, in current
parlance, ``downshifted.'' Mostly by choice, they made a dramatic
change in career or lifestyle, giving up well-paying jobs they had
worked years to attain.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because something in their lives was missing. Call it a
sense of mission _ even spiritual fulfillment _ in their work.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. Some observers feel that such midlife career
changers are the leading edge of a broad-based reaction against the
intense careerism of our time. Sometimes it's a 50th birthday _ and
a lot of baby boomers are having them these days _ that reminds
them they don't have so many years left to do what they dreamed of
doing before they got sidetracked into more lucrative work. But
downshifting isn't limited to boomers: Witness the announcement
last month that high-flying, 33-year-old Turner Broadcasting
executive Bill Burke was leaving to spend time with his family and
consider his career. ``I don't know what's missing,'' he declared,
``but I'm looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing more and more people saying, `This job is hollow
for me _ I can't fake it anymore,''' says Joan DiFuria, who
switched from international business to psychology and co-founded
the Money, Meaning and Choices Institute, a California organization
that counsels people on how to use their energies and capital.
``Regardless of income, there are more people asking, `What kind of
message does my work send to my children? What can I do that I can
be proud of?'''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of regrettable career choices may go all the way back
to school days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The educational system blindly guides kids toward preparing
for a career they think they'll want, before they're even old
enough to know who they really are,'' says Gerald Celente, director
of New York's Trend Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Jef Murray, 40, a research engineer at Georgia Tech, runs a
group that meets to exchange views about simplifying their lives
and reducing expenses in order to afford doing the work they love.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are working harder to buy more in a fruitless
attempt to buy happiness,'' Murray says. ``Whether it's a vacation
home or a $7 latte, it's just a way to reward themselves for a
workweek in hell. The moment's pleasure keeps them locked to work
they hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our group,'' he says, ``we see many dreams pulled out of
closets, dusted off, shined up.''
</P>
<P>
   Following are four such dreams.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN FEIGHT
</P>
<P>
   You never know what you're going to find on a quiet suburban
lane. Push the doorbell of a handsome home on a wooded hilltop
overlooking the Chattahoochee River, for example, and presently,
amid the yipping of a dachshund, the door is answered by a
pleasant-looking, middle-aged fellow wearing surgical scrubs
spattered with multicolored paint.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a visual riddle: Is this a physician who gets carried
away with his art hobby, or a professional artist who likes to
dress up as a doc?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is odder still. John Feight, 60, is a former
advertising and public relations exec who is now devoted to
creating art for hospitals _ painting it himself, and helping
patients in hospitals all over the world paint it, too. This is not
some semi-retirement lark. It has been Feight's dream for 25 years.
Today, his Foundation for Hospital Art, operating out of his roomy
basement, stacked to the ceiling with canvases and paints, has
placed paintings in 500 hospitals in 165 countries.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio native, Feight swept up the ladder of a leading New York
ad agency in his 20s. But he always had a mystical side. He still
quotes from ``Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,'' a key
document of 1970s zeitgeist, as if it were published yesterday. He
portrays himself not as the mastermind of the foundation but simply
the conduit for generous people who have helped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good idea,'' he says, quoting the Brazilian
writer Paulo Coelho, ``all the universe will conspire to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Feight's idea, and the happy conspiracy, developed in stages.
After moving to Atlanta to join Coca-Cola and head its Fresca ad
campaign in 1969, he gave his wife, Linda, some art supplies. He
ended up as the one dabbling with them. His first painting in a
medical setting went up in a friend's animal clinic.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the ever-restless Feight volunteered to
work Sunday evenings in a hospital psychiatric ward and was struck
by the sight of a young patient staring at a blank wall. Soon he
was showing the patients slides of paintings and instructing them
to create their own.
</P>
<P>
   Feight: ``Hospitals look so sterile, I wanted to fill those
walls with color, get that young woman thinking about her painting
instead of her pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with a grant from the Woodruff Foundation, he quit his
job as head of public relations for Scientific-Atlanta to devote
himself to his foundation, which has a budget of $200,000 from
donations and pays him a modest salary. (Linda's schoolteaching job
``is our security blanket,'' he says.) During the Barcelona
Olympics in 1992, Feight led an ``Olympic Paint Fest'' _ athletes
and everyday citizens painting hospital murals for 16 days _ that
brought requests for his work from all over the world. On March 25,
he'll coordinate a Global Paint Fest, consisting of his own
painting session with inner-city youngsters in Baltimore and
simultaneous events in England and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   One of Feight's strategies is to prepare stacks of small
canvases with outlines of color-coded scenes that even artistic
novices can fill in with paint. The canvases are then assembled
into murals that may represent the collaborative painting of an
entire hospital ward. As Feight leads a tour of his basement mural
factory, one sees outlines of palm trees, zebras, tropical birds
and flowers _ images of dreamy lushness and escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, of all places, shouldn't a hospital be beautiful?'' he
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Once, at Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Ga., Feight
was struggling to help a patient who could barely speak or control
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put my hand next to his cheek and leaned his head right
into the canvas,'' Feight recalls, ``and I realized that he was
steering my brush in the only way he could.'' Suddenly Feight was
reminded of his grandfather, a tireless country doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I've always wanted to make a difference,'' Feight
says, ``the way he did.''
</P>
<P>
   MARY JOE DELLINGER
</P>
<P>
   Bankers can surprise you: Look at T.S. Eliot. Another who long
harbored a poetic passion is Mary Joe Dellinger. Last year, at the
age of 54, she walked away from a 30-year career with Bank of
America to become the full-time head of community outreach programs
for the First Presbyterian Church of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Her income took a tumble, of course, as she left the post of
assistant vice president _ but she didn't hesitate to take the
leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I decided that I wanted to do something more than
crunch numbers _ and that was the day this job became available,''
the Charlotte, N.C., native says at her church office. ``I wanted
to deal with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading a tour of the 14-bed women's shelter at First
Presbyterian _ including a dining room with books, paintings,
flowers on each table _ Dellinger couldn't be more proud if she
were showing off a sprawling new office complex that she'd financed
in her former life.
</P>
<P>
   She'd arrived a bit late for the interview: She'd been driving
one of her homeless clients on vital errands, above and beyond the
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Joe's amazing, always giving of herself,'' says her
assistant, Rick O'Neal. ``I don't know if she takes any time for
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dellinger, a member of ``First Prez'' since almost the
day she arrived in Atlanta in 1963, admits that volunteer work _
building Habitat for Humanity homes, managing the church's food
bank and clothes closet _ has consumed countless nights and
weekends. She's never married: ``Didn't have time, I guess,'' she
says with a laugh. But she does have an indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horseback riding!'' she exclaims with a flash of her steady,
penetrating dark eyes. ``I started seven years ago. I'm part of a
saddle club that's planning to ride across Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' she adds, gazing out the window at a cusp-of-spring
afternoon, ``I wish I were riding right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, commitment _ ``duty'' would be too harsh a word _ calls.
Today Dellinger is busy enlisting more volunteer supervisors so
that she can expand the shelter to 20 beds.
</P>
<P>
   Her rewards are many.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my first day on the job here, in October, I received calls
from three people who used to stay at the shelter,'' she recalls.
``All had found a place in life. One _ a person we asked to leave
because she wasn't trying to improve her situation _ turned her
life completely around and just called to say `Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger smiles. ``That's when I knew: This is where I'm
supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   LMICHAEL GREEN
</P>
<P>
   Jetting hither and yon around the world, from one five-star
hotel and expense account meal to another, LMichael Green in 1994
was the Southeastern regional director for marketing with Pepsi
Cola. Only in his mid-30s, he was one satisfied man.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then his daughter was born, bringing real joy, but with it a
troubling question. Holding the infant in his arms, he thought back
to his boyhood home in Berkeley, Calif., and his parents, who were
cheerful crusaders for social justice, leading the boycott of a
winemaker that they believed exploited migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down at my beautiful baby,'' recalls Green, 43, ``and
I thought, `What am I going to tell her that I did with my life? Am
I proud of selling these products?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of spending my time on planes,'' he adds, ``I wanted
to spend it with her.''
</P>
<P>
   By a chance that he calls a godsend, CARE had recently relocated
to Atlanta and offered Green the position of head of marketing. He
sat down with his wife; they decided they could handle the 40
percent cut in family income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comfort in my soul is the compensation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There's still some glamour in his work: He got to work with
Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam to arrange the marketing of that band's
benefit album for CARE. There's still more travel than he'd like,
though the trips put him more, not less, in touch with the real
world. Seeing women in Ecuador who pick through garbage heaps,
finding cardboard to recycle into beautiful hand-painted cards,
``was an image that tears at your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's daughter is now in first grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do the geography lessons,'' he says, ``I love to tell
her what CARE is doing in each country.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMIE ADAMS
</P>
<P>
   For 26 years, as a market research manager for Coca-Cola, Jamie
Adams draped his hearty, Falstaffian frame with respectable office
attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my time at Coke, and I was lucky enough to get hold
of some company stock back in its golden age,'' says the longtime
Atlanta resident, 52. ``But I was never sure that pushing
carbonated water was going to save mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that selling bicycles will achieve that lofty goal, either.
But at least it's what Adams enjoys, and he can afford to do it
only a few days a month, whenever his friend, the owner of Intown
Bicycles, is short-handed. On the first springlike day of the year,
Adams cracks that he is ``dressed for success _ bike shop style.''
He's wearing a tie-dyed shirt _ ``bright colors are a survival
technique in Atlanta traffic'' _ running shoes and black shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're regular shorts, though,'' Adams adds. ``They don't
make bike shorts in my size.''
</P>
<P>
   This disarming wisenheimer has a classic Atlanta resume: raised
in Cascade Heights, got a math degree at Georgia Tech, ``then
walked across the street'' to Coke. Unlike the other three people
described here, Adams wasn't questing for deeper meaning in life
when he downshifted. He simply pined for more time to goof off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of these Calvinists who believe in the inherent
value of work,'' he declares. ``I believe you do it and then you're
outta there.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' story is also different from the others in that he did
not end his corporate career by choice. When his job was eliminated
in a 1988 reorganization, he had enough severance to realize his
longtime dream of biking from Los Angeles to Savannah. When he was
rehired a year later, he and his wife, who also had a corporate
job, made a point to eliminate their debt and pump up their
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   So when the downsizing ax fell again on Adams in 1994, they were
ready. And free. Adams' wife took early retirement, and they took
off for a biking tour of back-country New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We travel cheap: just solid country food, wine and beer,''
Adams declares. ``Especially beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams loves working in the shop. ``I get to talk about bikes,
travel. Sometimes I meet homeless people whose bikes are their only
transport; I also meet people who ride $5,000 bikes. Everyone's
interesting, nobody's angry. It ain't like selling water heaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here partly though preparation, partly dumb luck,'' he
adds. ``Either way, I'm having a good time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AL-MUFAQARA, West Bank _ Wrapped in a head scarf against the
rain that lashed the barren rocky hills southeast of Hebron, Mahmud
Hamamdeh stood recently in the home that he had been expelled from
and extolled the virtues of life in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade this for anything,'' Hamamdeh, 35, said of
the cave from which he, his wife, nine children and a flock of
sheep were ousted along with scores of other Palestinian cave
dwellers by Israeli soldiers in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather opened this cave,'' said Hamamdeh, who raises
sheep and goats and farms land in the valleys among the hills. ``I
was born here. My children were born here. My wife gave birth here.
This was our hospital and clinic. If we were sick, we went out to
the field, collected herbs and made medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, it's as cool in here as if it were
air-conditioned, and in winter it's warm. I'm used to this, and I'm
not comfortable anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamamdeh and his family now occupy an abandoned one-room
structure in a neighboring village, storing belongings in a tent,
like others who were forced out of their caves.
</P>
<P>
   The evictions from Al-Mufaqara and other cave hamlets in an area
of the Hebron hills that the Israeli army has declared a firing
zone can be seen as another chapter in the grinding struggle
between Israel and the Palestinians over how much land each side
will control if they finally negotiate a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be seen as the latest encroachment on a
centuries-old way of life that has been caught up in political
conflict as the Israeli authorities try to restrict the
cave-dwelling shepherds and farmers who roam the rugged hills near
the West Bank's southern boundary with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, the army has been emptying and sometimes
sealing caves on the grounds that the people were living in closed
military areas, usually declared firing zones.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Jewish settlements were built on some hills. Now,
as Israel and the Palestinians have begun negotiating a final
agreement to divide the disputed land, the military authorities
seem to be consolidating their hold on West Bank areas that remain
under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   The removals from Al-Mufaqara and neighboring hamlets were
carried out on Nov. 16, a few days after Israeli soldiers and
police dragged away militant Jewish settlers and their supporters
from Maon Farm, a nearby outpost that the government said had been
built illegally in the firing zone.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers demanded equal enforcement against the
Palestinians, and days later soldiers moved on the caves.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses here described children as crying and women as
pleading with soldiers who ordered them out: ``Where will we go?
This is our home. God help us.'' People gathered mattresses and
kitchen utensils and loaded them on tractor-drawn wagons. Tents and
sheep pens were torn down, and soldiers hauled away bedding and
animal feed, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The people of Al-Mufaqara and other hamlets trekked to
neighboring villages, where they took shelter in tents and empty
buildings. According to a list compiled by residents and given to
an Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, 300 people were evicted.
The Israeli military government in the West Bank, known as the
Civil Administration, said it had received reports from the Red
Cross of more than 100 people displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said cave dwellers were seasonal farmers who
lived in the caves a few months a year when they were cultivating
their land and grazing flocks, while actually maintaining houses in
the neighboring town of Yatta. They were allowed into the firing
zone 90 days a year and on weekends and Jewish holidays, when the
army does not train, to cultivate their lands in season, an
administration spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamamdeh and neighbors at Al-Mufaqara said they were part of
a core group that lived there year-round, joined by others who
arrived in the rainy farming season. Some people have relatives
living in family homes in Yatta, residents said, but the houses are
full and cannot accommodate the displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after it had been emptied, Al-Mufaqara still bore signs of
long-term settlement. One cave had a large wood door, locked by its
owner with a big key, with a small herb garden and earthen oven
outside. Hamamdeh had a rain-fed well near his cave, and among the
debris inside were a battered cupboard, plastic and tin
kitchenware, bags of sheep dung that had served as fuel, and
branches for a fire. A cooking stove supplied by gas canisters and
a television set powered by a car battery had been taken away, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The emptying of Al-Mufaqara and surrounding communities has
hastened the decline of what was a widespread way of life in the
hill country south of Hebron for generations of Arabs, dating from
the Muslim conquest of Palestine in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   A 19th-century American biblical geographer, Edward Robinson,
referred to cave dwellers in the area in a book published in 1841.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yaacov Havakook, an Israeli who has written a study of cave life
in the Hebron hills, said that 20 years ago the communities there
were among the most extensive known in the world, with more than
8,000 people living in hundreds of hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   But evictions of cave dwellers and restrictions on their access
to farm land by the Israeli authorities over the years have reduced
their number to a third of what it had been, Havakook said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest people to be displaced are now living in limbo,
feeling cut off from the distinctive way of life that sustained
them for hundreds of years. Israeli lawyers have petitioned the
Israeli Supreme Court to allow them to return.
</P>
<P>
   On a muddy hillside swept by wind and hail, Niman Jabarin and
his extended family camped in burlap tents that provided little
shelter from the cold. Evicted from a hamlet that was cleared a few
weeks before Al-Mufaqara, they are hunkering down with their
flocks, keeping alive the hope that they will be permitted to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a life,'' Jabarin said as red-nosed children in
thin sweaters picked their way among the tents. ``It's like living
in a jail. We have to go back.''

STRUGGLING EURO HAMPERS EFFORTS OF PRO-EUROPEAN FORCES IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Almost a year ago, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
seemed to nudge this country closer to joining in the European
single currency, offering a cautious and conditional timetable for
signing up to use the euro.
</P>
<P>
   It was, at best, a tentative testing of the cloudy waters of
British nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, even that nebulous schedule _ foreseeing
possible entry somewhere between 2002 and 2005 _ has receded as the
economics of the euro have sunk ever deeper into the politics of
British ambiguity toward Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The currency itself, down more than 15 percent against the
dollar since its introduction in January 1999, has lost 14 percent
of its value against the pound, pushing the price of British
exports to Continental Europe ever higher. Opinion surveys have
shown sentiment in this country swinging not simply against joining
the euro zone, but for a sizable minority, against remaining a
member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Some representatives of British big business, citing the
government's lack of leadership, have backed away from their
previously vocal support for the single currency. And Blair's
euroskeptic adversaries have delighted in developments _ ranging
from the continued ban on British beef in France and Germany, to
European Union calls for harmonized tax policies _ citing them as
evidence of Continental malevolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a particularly bad year for the European cause,'' said
Ben Hall, research director at the Center for European Reform,
which is pro-European, ``and the decline in the euro did not make
it easier to persuade the British people to ditch the pound.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Blair has switched tactics. Rather than try to persuade
his compatriots of Europe's virtues, he is increasingly telling his
European partners that it is up to them to make themselves more
alluring in British eyes by embracing the kind of freewheeling
economic ways that Britain has sought to import from the United
States. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last
month, he told the powerful and the wealthy: ``The question for
Europe is clear. Can it take on the attitudes and interests of the
past and move decisively to gain a lead in the new economy and
industries of the future?''
</P>
<P>
   The risks of remaining outside the euro zone are clear, too. At
Davos, Noboyuki Idei, president of the Sony Corp., bluntly told the
prime minister that Sony's future investments in Britain would be
jeopardized by the government's refusal to commit itself to joining
in the single currency.
</P>
<P>
   That raised a question about Britain's role as Europe's most
powerful magnet for investment by companies who see their British
operations as a springboard to the European Union's single market _
and who seek the simplicity of a single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs have been brought into the argument, as well. The trade and
industry minister, Stephen Byers, cited recent studies Monday to
say that 3 million British jobs _ 1 million of them in exporting
industries _ depended on membership in the European single market.
More than half of Britain's trade, he said, is with Continental
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, these arguments fudge the issue. By portraying the
euro's opponents as enemies of British membership in the European
Union, Blair's government is seeking to discredit its critics as
people prepared to put what Byers called ``political dogma'' before
the nation's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party,
said Monday that Blair was ``trying to link the mainstream majority
who want to keep the pound with the extremist minority who want to
leave the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real debate in British politics is not about Europe _ in
or out _ as Tony Blair wants us to pretend,'' said Hague, who
recently embarked on a tour of the country in a truck emblazoned
with the Union Jack, part of a campaign to keep the pound. ``The
real debate is about the euro _ in or out _ and Tony Blair knows he
is losing the argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Blair's ministers acknowledge that Hague may have a
point. ``I accept criticism, either of me personally or perhaps of
other members of the government, that we haven't done enough,''
Byers said Monday. ``And what we now need to do, I think, is to
engage in the debate. There is a real battle here that we have to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That is important because the government has committed itself to
seeking popular support for joining in the single currency in a
referendum after the next national election, which must be held by
May 2002 and may be held earlier. And if Hague has his way, the
election will hinge partly on the question of British adoption of
the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has laid down five conditions for joining in the euro,
one of which is that there be ``sustainable convergence'' between
the British and Continental European economies. Those conditions do
not prevail today: Britain's short-term interest rates are roughly
twice the level of the 11 euro zone countries, while its
unemployment rate below 5 percent is perhaps half the Continental
European average.
</P>
<P>
   But the single currency has never been a purely economic issue
anywhere in Europe, least of all in Britain, the only major
European country where the question of membership has been aired in
a public, if sometimes fanciful debate. For some opponents here of
the single currency, the Europeans are often depicted as conducting
a sinister plot, especially by France and Germany, to dictate a
political and economic agenda contrary to British interests.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's shift in demanding reforms on the Continent _ where some
Britons see only slow attention to issues of economic change _ is
intended as an antidote to that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Blair is seen to be shaping the reform agenda,'' said Hall
at the Center for European Reform, ``the theory is that that will
persuade the British people that things are moving in our direction
and not just run by the French and the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate, he said. ``never will be rational.''

HOUSTON EXPANDS ITS PROFILE IN FINE ARTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For years the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston has
enjoyed a national reputation and attracted prominent traveling
exhibitions, most recently the work of Diego Rivera. Last year, 1.3
million people visited the museum, underscoring its importance in
Houston's profile as a cultural destination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many of the museum's antiquities and paintings have
languished in storage, unseen for lack of space to display them.
Now that problem has been solved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, three years after groundbreaking, museum officials
will open the Audrey Jones Beck Building, an expansion that with a
single flourish takes the museum from 30th to 6th largest in the
country measured in the amount of space dedicated to exhibitions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a mini version of the Met,'' said the museum's
director, Peter C. Marzio. ``That's the model.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marzio, who grew up in New York, thinks that the expansion will
finally give the 100-year-old museum a size worthy of the nation's
fourth-largest city and its 40,000 works of art. ``You'll be able
to visit virtually every culture in the world,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The grand opening comes as the oak-lined museum district south
of downtown is undergoing a face lift. The nearby Hermann Park,
owned by the city, is in the midst of a major renovation, and the
adjacent Park Plaza Warwick Hotel has finished a renovation that
includes a new outdoor patio bar and restaurant facing the museum
and the Mecom Fountain on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Within easy walking distance are several city museums: the
Contemporary Arts Museum, the Museum of Natural Science, the
Holocaust Museum and Memorial, the Children's Museum and the Health
and Medical Science Museum. The renowned Menil Collection of art is
a short drive away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Beck Building was designed by Rafael Moneo (Mies van der
Rohe designed the principal building), the Pritzker Prize-winning
Spanish architect. Clad in Indiana limestone, it rises three levels
and occupies a city block. Inside, visitors will find an 80-foot
lobby-atrium flooded with natural light. An underground tunnel
connects the building with the Caroline Wiess Law Building and a
newly constructed visitors center and parking garage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 192,447 square-foot Beck Building will offer a range of art
for visitors. Shortly after the groundbreaking, the museum
announced the purchase of 18 works from the estate of Jackson
Pollock, nine of which will be on view on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   The building will also serve as the primary repository for
European art from antiquity to 1920. An Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist section on the second floor will include works
by Braque, Monet, Renoir and Seurat, and Baroque art from the Sarah
Campbell Blaffer Foundation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the first floor, permanent galleries will be dedicated to
American art from the late Colonial period through World War II,
including prints, drawings, photography and other works on paper.
Roman, Greek and Egyptian antiquities will be on permanent view. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of the art and antiquities of China opened in the
existing building this month and continues through May 7. In the
new galleries for traveling exhibitions, two shows will be part of
the grand opening. From March 25 through June 4, ``Irving Penn: A
Career in Photography'' will display more than 100 vintage prints
from the photographer known for his portraits of celebrities like
Truman Capote as well as his fashion and travel photography. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Faces of Impressionism: Portraits from American Collections,''
March 25 through May 7, includes ``Woman Reading'' by Mary Cassatt,
``Clovis'' by Gauguin, and paintings by Degas, Cezanne, Manet and
Renoir. The exhibition was seen last year at the Baltimore Museum
of Art and will go to the Cleveland Museum of Art after leaving
Houston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marzio said he hoped that the expansion would bring further
recognition for the fine arts in Houston. Too many outsiders, he
said, still equate the city with oil and cowboys, though cowboys
are seen only during the annual rodeo and livestock show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe,'' he said, ``that the next 10 years will
make all the rest of the history of the museum look like we were
asleep.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Sprint invests $77 million in EarthLink
 &HT;    By Frances Katz and Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In an effort to make sure it holds on to a piece of
the residential Internet access market, Sprint Corp. has invested
an additional $77 million in Atlanta-based EarthLink Inc., bringing
its holdings to 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That investment preserves Sprint's option to increase its
investment further or even to eventually purchase all of EarthLink.
The company became the nation's second-largest Internet service
provider with its merger this year to MindSpring Enterprises. While
EarthLink remains one of the few large ISPs, Sprint's decision
seems to signal that the company could become part of a
telecommunications giant someday.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint itself has agreed to be acquired by Mississippi-based MCI
WorldCom, but telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan said the
investment in EarthLink is warranted whether or not that deal is
consummated. ``This is something Sprint would do without regard to
the (WorldCom) merger. This might be a way of hedging their bets in
case something happens with the merger. Then they still keep a
strong residential Internet position.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint plans to use EarthLink to provide Internet service when
it launches ION, its service package that will include high-speed
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``This additional investment in EarthLink signifies Sprint's
commitment to maintaining its long-term relationship with
EarthLink,'' said EarthLink chief executive Garry Betty.
``Currently, part of the alliance we have is, as Sprint bundles
Internet service and other products, we are that Internet
service.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink issued additional stock for the Sprint purchase, just
as it did when Apple Computer invested $200 million in January. In
fact, it was the Apple investment that forced Sprint's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, the third-largest telecommunications company in the
United States bought 2.73 million shares at about $28.10 a share.
The Kansas City, Mo.-based telecommunications company made the
investment following regulatory approval of Apple's $200 million
investment. Apple's new stake in the company reduced Sprint's
ownership in EarthLink to a level that put its two seats on the
EarthLink board in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the original Sprint-EarthLink agreement,
Sprint has the option of adding to its investment in EarthLink to
maintain its percentage of ownership when others buy shares in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   At an analysts' meeting in January, Betty said Sprint had six
months after the close of the MindSpring merger to ``top up'' its
investment level. If the telecommunications company decides not to
do that, its ownership will fall below 20 percent and the company
will lose its two board seats. Those seats are held by William S.
Esrey, Sprint chairman and chief executive officer, and Len J.
Lauer, president of the company's consumer services group.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint merged its own Internet access customers into EarthLink
when it first invested, and Sprint Vice President Bill White said
the company is pleased with the payback. ``We believe they provide
outstanding service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has until August to decide whether it wants to boost its
share of EarthLink. It originally held 28 percent and returning to
that level is an expensive proposition. At EarthLink's current
per-share price, 14.7 percent of its stock is worth $455 million,
so doubling the Sprint share would cost about that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't decided what we will do,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink President Michael McQuary said he is uncertain how
Sprint's acquisition by MCI WorldCom would affect EarthLink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they are trying to do is keep all of their
options open,'' he said. ``If they didn't top up, it could limit
their options in terms of the alliance after WorldCom or future
acquisition possibilities. As long as they continue to top up, they
have maximum flexibility to make decisions on what they do or don't
want to do with us.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom's Vice-Chairman John Sidgmore was among the early
members of the EarthLink board. He resigned from the EarthLink
board when then-rival Sprint made its first investment.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications analysts say Sprint's actions continue the
blurring of lines between different kinds of services as well as
between different ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you could separate players. ISPs,
broadband, technology vendors. ... But what's happening is that to
be really successful on the Internet, you need to do everything,''
said Jack Staff, chief Internet economist for Zona Research.
   Staff also said the investment in EarthLink is valuable for
Sprint and for WorldCom, if and when it merges with Sprint. Staff
endorsed the notion that WorldCom does envision a post-Sprint
purchase of EarthLink. ``I think that is definitely part of the
deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``EarthLink provides access to customers,'' Staff said. ``The
content offerings get the most press, but beneath the surface, when
you take a financial stake, you also have access to customers. And
customer acquisition costs can be very, very high.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink's business-to-business Web hosting is another key part
of the deal, he said. ``One thing that EarthLink does that phone
companies don't do so well is Web hosting for business. That
really, I suspect, is the sweet spot behind the deal.''

HOTEL ARE RUSHING TO OPEN _ SOMETIMES BEFORE THE PAINT IT DRY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio)  (af) 
 By TERRY TRUCCO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall I spent a night at the W Tuscany, a stylish, newly
refurbished hotel in New York. My room was comfortable, quiet and,
for the most part, smartly renovated. The lobby was another matter.
No one had warned me when I made my reservation that it was still
under construction. The elevators opened near a new front desk
still shrouded in packing wrap.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, the hotel set up a Continental breakfast in an
old sitting room next to the new lobby. As I poured my coffee, buzz
saws screamed and hammers pounded. I fled to my room, appalled but
not particularly surprised.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are buoyant times for the hotel industry, with new
properties opening and old buildings being refurbished at a speedy
pace. But an increasing number of hotels are throwing open their
doors prematurely, taking in guests almost as soon as the ink dries
on the certificate of occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has become almost accepted practice for new hotels to
house guests before a restaurant or health club is complete, in
today's fervid climate it is not unusual to stay in a hotel with a
construction site for a lobby, padded elevators, and hallways
awaiting car-pets.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall I was shown a room at the Belleclaire, a renovated,
moderately priced hotel in New York, that had wires dangling where
the light fixture was supposed to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotels are so anxious to cash in on this boom that they
are being more aggressive about opening than they should,'' said
Chekitan Dev, a professor of marketing at Cornell University's
Hotel School. ``If a hotel stays closed for one more day, it loses
revenues.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With fewer hotels and resorts owned by private individuals and
more by large corporations, the pressure to show returns quickly
has increased. ``If you've already given the analysts a projection
for third-quarter results and it includes that hotel, you're going
to want to make the money, even if it means alienating a few
guests,'' Dev said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel publications can add to the problem. If a hotel receives
a blaze of advance publicity, the management may be tempted to open
it even if not everything is ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The practice, known as a soft opening, of accepting guests
before a hotel is finished isn't new and isn't always a problem.
Soft openings are the hotel equivalent of an out-of-town opening
for a Broadway play, a low-key period when management and staff can
correct mistakes before hundreds of guests arrive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels stage soft openings for insiders, including friends,
members of the management, and travel operators, as knowledgeable
but sympathetic guests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once a hotel opens to the public, the management often limits
the number of guests until things run smoothly. ``Some places even
overstaff during soft openings, because they don't want people to
have a bad experience on their first visit,'' said James Eyster, a
professor emeritus at Cornell University's Hotel School. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more accurate term for the recent rash of soft openings, which
can drag on for months, is under-construction openings. Since most
hotels lower their prices during construction, rooms can be a
bargain. But be sure to ask what services will be missing if you
stay in an unfinished hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what price they give, the property should tell you
up front there are no pros on the tennis court or there's a snack
bar but no restaurant,'' said Doris Schechter, a travel agent at
Valerie Wilson Travel in New York. Or that construction noise will
be starting at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   However you book _ by telephone or over the Internet _ find out
what to expect in the way of service cutbacks. And if a price seems
too good to be true, ask if you'll be rooming next to the guys with
buzz saws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Construction is a complex process that can defy the best of
plans, which is one reason so many hotels are only partly
completed. ``You don't have to slip behind in your construction
schedule very much to have a problem,'' Richard Brush, a dean at
Johnson &AMP; Wales University, said. ``It could be a strike at the
furniture plant in North Carolina or a large building project that
uses up all the steel in the state.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Club Med in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic,
which reopened the week before Christmas after an extensive
six-month renovation. ``We arrived to find huge mud puddles,
dangling electric wires, no stair lights, pathways not lit, dirt
everywhere and trucks creating clouds of dust,'' said Anne Sager of
New York, who had gone to the resort for a weeklong holiday with
her husband, their children and grandchildren from France, and a
son and his fiancee from California. Worse still, there was no
air-conditioning or hot water, and the toilets did not flush.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The resort offered a variety of compensations, including
transfers to other Club Med villages and lodging at another hotel
on the island with shuttle services to the resort for meals and
activities. Full and partial refunds, linked to whether guests
stayed, returned home or moved to another property, were also
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the resort failed to inform guests that the property
wasn't ready, Carole Boucard, a Club Med spokeswoman said: ``There
were last-minute delays that got us off the timetable, but we fully
expected to have things fixed by then.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hotel construction delays also marred a visit to New York for
Alan Hart and his wife from Akron, Ohio. After seeing a newspaper
ad, Hart booked a room at On the Ave, a new boutique hotel in New
York, for $135 a night. After receiving a written confirmation, he
paid for their flights and ordered opera tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before they were to arrive, the Harts received a call
saying that because construction of two floors of the hotel had not
been completed, they could not stay. The caller suggested they stay
at the Habitat, an affiliated but less expensive hotel. Since many
Habitat rooms have shared baths, Hart declined and wound up paying
$320 a night for a room elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say a hotel should offer some compensation to a
guest if it can't honor its agreement to provide a room. ``The
generally accepted practice is to offer a complimentary or upgraded
room for one night at a hotel in your group,'' said Eyster of
Cornell. ``If you have to send the person to a more expensive hotel
outside your company, you pay the difference.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the policy at On the Ave, Ron Simoncini, a spokesman
for the hotel, described Hart's canceled reservation as an
embarrassment, but added that the policy is to provide a free room
at another hotel only if someone with a reservation shows up and
can't be accommodated. ``Part of the reason the prices are so low
right now is because the hotel is under construction,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When is the ideal time to try out a new or renovated hotel?
Schechter says she usually waits six months, especially if she is
sending a client to a resort. Knowing when to open a hotel can, in
fact, be something of an art.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wait for everything to be done, you'll never open,''
said Nancy Polley, a travel agent with Valerie Wilson Travel. ``But
once you open, you had better hop to and get things done.''

REV. JACKSON RIPS BUSH ON RACE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson excoriated presidential
candidate George W. Bush Monday, warning that the Republican
front-runner's stances on important racial issues _ particularly
the question of whethth Carolina should fly the Confederate
flag over its state capitol _ has reframed the primary season as
``not Bush versus McCain, but Bush versus the history of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before former Senator Bill Bradley and Vice President Al
Gore focused on black voters in a debate at Harlem's Apollo
Theater, Jackson said he was not prepared to endorse a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But he criticized Bradley for ``offering no leadership in a
crunch time'' when the issue of racial profiling surfaced in his
home state of New Jersey last year. To win black converts, Jackson
added, ``Mr. Bradley must have some action that distinguishes him
in order for people to transfer their loyalty'' from Gore, Bill
Clinton's appointed successor.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore ``have an awful lot in common, but Gore has the
inside track,'' Jackson said. ``Bradley has good ideas, and so does
Gore, but Gore has the most relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in Cambridge as part of a lecture series honoring the
founder of the African Methodist Episcopal church, has maintained a
studied distance from the presidential primaries. His central focus
was on an intiative to educate African-American children about
financial markets, thereby ensuring them a future as
``shareholders, not sharecroppers.''
</P>
<P>
   But his critiques of the Democratic and Republican presidential
candidates came ahead of the New York primary, at a moment when
Democrats have swung much of their attention to race and the urban
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   During the last week Gore racked up endorsements from a long
series of influential black political leaders in New York,
including former New York City mayor David Dinkins, Manhattan
borough president Virginia Fields, and US Representative Charles
Rangel. And some who heard Jackson's remarks said his message for
Gore was explicit enough.
</P>
<P>
   Tayo Idowu, a 46-year-old computer programmer, said support for
Bill Clinton still runs so strong in African-American communities
that even if Jackson doesn't come out explicitly in support of
Gore, his passionate condemnation of Bush would serve the same
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where Jesse Jackson comes in, to remind us, `Remember
what this guy did for us yesterday,' '' Idowu said. ``He speaks in
codes. People know there are going to be two people vying for the
presidency. So if I'm saying something bad about Bush, it's got to
be (on behalf of) Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson lectured on economic empowerment at St. Paul AME as part
of the Richard Allen Lecture series. Last month marked the
publication of a book Jackson authored with his son, ``It's About
the Money: The Fourth Movement of the American Symphony: How to
Build Wealth, Get Access to Capital, and Achieve Your Financial
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals Jackson brought forward were for churches to
teach children about financial markets in Sunday school. His
Chicago-based agency, Rainbow/Operation PUSH opened an office on
Wall Street in 1997, and has initiated a program to bring groups of
35 ministers to Wall Street for a week's training in trading and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're born in debt, we're great debt manipulators, we wear
debt, we travel in debt,'' Jackson said. ``That's the mindset of an
ex-slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hour-plus speech lit on a number of political topics,
with the harshest words reserved for Bush, who has avoided taking a
stance on whether South Carolina should continue flying the
Confederate flag above the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's watch this week over Texas's 120th execution ``makes him
armed and extremely dangerous,'' Jackson said. He also zeroed in on
Bush's ``high calculation'' earlier this month in agreeing to speak
at Bob Jones University in Greenville, a Christian fundamentalist
school that forbids interracial da
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people like (retired general) Colin Powell and (Oklahoma
congressman) J.C. Watts'' _ prominent blacks who have allied
themselves with the GOP _ ``must be embarrassed,'' he said in
remarks after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also promised that the Latino and African-American vote
``will determine the next president,'' and said Bush's opponent,
John McCain, had ``made a huge mistake'' by abandoning his earlier
stand against the confederate flag, sacrificing crossover support
that could have helped him win the state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That issue was dropped in his lap,'' Jackson said. ``He could
he going into Michigan with one more arrow in his quiver.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain's high command huddled
conspiratorially in the darkened aisle of his chartered campaign
plane on Sunday night, plotting their latest move to stop Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They fretted that Bush had been scheduled to appear first on
NBC's ``Today'' program on Monday, followed by McCain. No way, they
decided. McCain would go first on the highest rated morning program
_ or defect to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McCain prevailed and appeared on ``Today,'' accusing
Bush supporters of ``calling up little children and telling them
that John McCain is a thief and a liar.'' Bush wound up on ``Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch was a minor triumph for a presidential candidate who
after his whopping win in New Hampshire never had to scrap for
position on the morning programs. Only two weeks ago, his beaming
face was emblazoned on the cover of Time and Newsweek; this week,
it is Bush staring resolutely from both covers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of the primary here on Tuesday, McCain and his
aides are still thunderstruck by their loss to Bush in South
Carolina three days ago _ the first defeat of the senator's
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Inside McCain's famously chatty bus, the afterglow of New
Hampshire is dimming by the day. Despite friendly crowds from
Traverse City to Grand Rapids to here in Saginaw _ and polls that
show the Republican rivals neck and neck in Michigan _ McCain and
his aides were revisiting what might have been. They said that
while they got too mired in tactics in New Hampshire and did not
adequately respond to the governor's onslaught of advertising and
oratory, they are still struggling to grasp what went awry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his prediction before the South Carolina primary
that a high turnout would assure a win for McCain, Weaver _ who
just days ago was being hailed in the press for his political
deftness _ confessed, `'Obviously, we didn't know what we were
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bush's victory was not even close, as polls had
predicted, Rick Davis, the campaign manager, said, ``Everyone ought
to be firing their pollsters.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, McCain refuses to yield, acknowledging that ``we took
a shot to the stomach,'' but reminding audiences that he has
``crashed a few airplanes'' and knows how to recuperate. As he put
it at a packed rally Monday morning in Traverse City, ``I'm telling
you, we're coming back! We're coming back!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of McCain's upbeat talk about primaries next month
in possibly friendly territory, like California and New England _
``I still think this thing will be decided by March 7,'' the
senator told reporters on his bus _ two senior campaign officials
said privately that their hopes of snatching the Republican
nomination would be effectively over if he does not win here.
</P>
<P>
   The big quandary for McCain is how to make up his mind over how
aggressively to respond to the relentless 30-second broadsides from
Bush that started in South Carolina and are continuing here.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in South Carolina fresh from New Hampshire,
McCain announced that unlike Bill Bradley in the Democratic race,
he had no qualms about defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Bradley campaign,'' he said then. ``We will
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   But days later, McCain pulled a commercial questioning Bush's
trustworthiness _ and comparing him to President Clinton _ and he
has essentially ceded the airwaves to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Michigan, McCain has faced the very conundrum Bradley
has in his battle with Vice President Al Gore: If he goes on the
attack, McCain undermines his theme that he is a reformer who will
not stoop to going negative. Yet, by not attacking, McCain allows
Bush to define him.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain has settled on a strategy in which he came out
swinging at Bush at stop after stop in Michigan, saying if Bush is
really a reformer, than ``I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has not dared run television commercials that denounce
Bush, even as the governor is running his own advertisements
pounding McCain's record. It is a somewhat ambivalent approach _
and one that is strikingly reminiscent of the high-minded tone of
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the guy doesn't want to run a negative ad,'' said Greg
Stevens, McCain's media adviser. ``Does it make me a little edgy?
Nervous? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflicting impulses were on display in the senator's
truculent concession speech on Saturday night: He insisted that he
would ``keep fighting clear,'' even as he pounced on Bush _ without
citing him by name _ for a ``negative message of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, questioned aboard his bus, refused to acknowledge that
he had not followed his own counsel to avoid the trap Bradley put
himself in: ``I don't want 20 years from now when my kids are grown
and they're majoring in political science and they pick up a book,
`And so, John McCain, in South Carolina, out of desperation because
he was losing, launched negative attacks on George Bush.'''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse the Bush campaign of dirty, negative
tactics. ``We all know what caused the loss,'' he said. ``I would
never be associated with people and the things that were done in
that race in South Carolina and I'm proud that we had nothing to do
with that kind of campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I probably didn't do as well as I should have or
could have. But do you think that would have made any difference? I
could have invented a cure for cancer and it couldn't have
mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, McCain acknowledged what his advisers
have said bluntly: ``Perhaps I should have defined myself a little
more as far as different positions on issues,'' he said. ``We're
doing more of that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator still harps on how offended he was when Bush held an
event in South Carolina at which a former prisoner of war
questioned whether he had sufficiently fought for veterans. And
Monday, the campaign distributed articles that cited the Bush
operation's under-the-radar efforts to crush him in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At campaign events here, the silver confetti still falls and the
disco music still pounds, but the loss in South Carolina is in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   In East Lansing, at a rally at Michigan State University, John
Schwarz, a state senator, sounded in his warm-up for the challenger
as if he had to justify his endorsement of McCain over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one defector on the Michigan Legislature,'' Schwarz
said. ``I'm  &UR; still  &LR; comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has tried mightily to persuade the press that his
campaign is not sputtering. ``By the way,'' he said on the bus
Sunday, ``small item: Since yesterday, there's an uptick in our
contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about the size of the uptick, McCain said it was ``like
ten or fifteen thousand'' dollars ``from what it was the day
before.'' But more than anything else, the sum underscores how the
dynamic has changed. After New Hampshire _ and before South
Carolina _ the campaign took in roughly $3 million on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also made sure to trumpet the endorsement of Rep. Peter King,
R-N.Y., who defected this week from the Bush camp. But on the eve
of South Carolina, some McCain aides had predicted that a win in
that state would have spurred countless big-name Republicans to
jump as well.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush's newfound potency has clearly addled the McCain camp.
Officials say they are bewildered at polls showing that South
Carolina voters now see the governor as the more genuine reformer.
And they admitted that their merry band of rebels would benefit
from some Republican reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really getting tired of being defended by Bill Press,''
Davis said of the co-moderator on the CNN program, ``Crossfire,'' a
former chairman of the California Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain and his supporters are mindful that the days of an
exciting insurgency hinge on what happens here, now. The senator
cannot for much longer be introduced, he as was in East Lansing, as
``The winner of the New Hampshire primary by a landslide!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he tries not to think too hard about his mistakes or
his prospects, though he quipped that ``I hum `Hail to the Chief' a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he fixes his thoughts on Bush, and what that win in South
Carolina might do for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have gotten some bounce,'' said the senator who had
hoped that bounce would be his. ``But who knows?''

MCCAIN, BUSH DUEL FOR DEMOCRATS MICHIGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ On the eve of the Republican primary here, Democratic
voters were the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, asserting that ``everybody's against me''
and calling himself the victim of a character assassination
campaign, raced through Michigan Monday seeking support from
independents and Democrats for Tuesday's potential make-or-break
primary vote.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George W. Bush responded that he, too, was reaching
across party lines in the open primary, citing the example of a top
Texas Democrat who crossed party lines to support his run for
governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling effort by the two main Republican presidential
candidates to seek Democratic votes underscored one way in which
the race here may be different from South Carolina, which Bush won
with mostly conservative Republican votes. In Michigan, the turnout
is expected to include many more moderate Republicans, Democrats,
and independents than was the case in the Palmetto State.
</P>
<P>
   With the two candidates dashing through Michigan over the past
two days, this industrial powerhouse state has turned into a sort
of madcap Republican road rally and proving ground. The outcome may
well have a dramatic impact on the chances of McCain or Bush to
pick up momentum _ and the nomination. Separately, McCain's home
state of Arizona is also holding a Republican primary Tuesday, with
McCain far ahead in the polls there.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, at a town hall meeting in Traverse City in upstate
Michigan, accused Bush of ``character assassination'' as the Texas
governor competes for the presidency in what McCain calls the
``worst way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' he said, ``reject this negative campaigning,
reject this character assassination, reject the low road to the
presidency and support those who want to take the high road. You
deserve a lot better than the trash that's on your television set
and over the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, McCain said Bush and the state establishment,
led by Governor John Engler, were against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling ya, they're shooting at me from everywhere.
Everybody's against me, Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the
governors, all the senators. But we're going to kill them, right,
we're going to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning furiously across Michigan with Engler by his
side, expressed the confidence he has had before every previous
primary _ even the one he lost, New Hampshire. ``I like what I feel
here in Michigan,'' he said, hailing a party ``organization that's
been in place quite awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood up to charges, made by McCain, that he had failed to
achieve any real reforms as Texas governor. Repeating his
self-description as a ``reformer with results,'' Bush said he had
overhauled the tax code and the education system, raising test
scores in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Detroit, Bush even fell back on the
support he once received from the now-deceased Democratic
lieutenant governor of Texas. Bob Bullock, he said, ``endorsed my
candidacy'' during the gubernatorial race of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might want to explain to Senator McCain that Lieutenant
Governor Bob Bullock thought I had done such a good job as the
governor of Texas that he crossed party lines to endorse my
candidacy when I ran against a Democrat,'' Bush said. ``Given the
chance to lead, given the chance to set an agenda, I have done so
in my state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the race was a dead heat in numerous polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nip and tuck race,'' said Mike Murphy, McCain's media
strategist, eyeing polls showing McCain with just a slim, two-point
edge. ``There's not a lot we can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Candice S. Miller, who supports Bush, is
predicting a record turnout in a race that drew just 11 percent _
or about 525,000 voters _ during the 1996 and 1992 presidential
contests. This year, she says about 900,000 people may vote in the
primary. This state of about 10 million people has about 7 million
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors could determine the race:
</P>
<P>
   --Religious conservatives. The religious conservative movement,
which swept Bush to victory in South Carolina, is not as strong
here. But the state has a heavy concentration of Catholics, some of
whom were offended by Bush's visit to Bob Jones University in
Greenville, South Carolina, where school officials have described
Catholicism as a cult to beware of.
</P>
<P>
   --Reagan Democrats. In South Carolina, where many former
Democrats have long since become Republicans, Democrats accounted
for 9 percent of the turnout. But here many Democrats have remained
in the party as conservative ``Reagan Democrats,'' just the sort of
voter that McCain is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   --Minority voters. In South Carolina, only one percent of the
voter turnout was by blacks. In Michigan, however, a significantly
higher number may turn out.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign Monday gave reporters a copy of what it called
a flyer from the McCain campaign that urged Democrats to vote for
the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are not holding a presidential primary in
Michigan but you can still make your vote count by voting in the
Republican presidential primary on Tuesday, Feb. 22,'' according to
the flyer, which featured a picture of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, said, ``It's
all a question of turnout. ``Do the independents and Democrats turn
out and vote in this thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ballenger said, about 26 percent of the voters in the
Republican race were Democrats and independents. This year, there
have been estimates of 35 to 40 percent, he said. ``If it is,
McCain is just killing Bush with those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, both candidates view Michigan as crucial to McCain's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't win here, where's he going to win?'' asked
Joseph A. Schlesinger, an emeritus political science professor at
Michigan State University. ``It leaves him with really relatively
little direction to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, seemed anxious to assume he will be the nominee
and that Vice President Al Gore will be his Democratic opponent.
Bush seemed indignant when Gore's comment that Bush was not
committed to racial issues, especially after his visit to Bob Jones
University in South Carolina. The school bans interracial dating.
Of Gore, Bush said: ``Shame on him. Shame on him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see our rally yesterday?'' Bush challenged reporters.
``We had a rally 1,000 or more people from all walks of life that
came out to support me. What Vice President Gore loves to do is the
typical Washington politics of calling people names. That's what he
like to do. He likes the politics of personal destruction and
America is sick of it.''

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Thousands of ethnic Albanians from
throughout Kosovo marched on this divided city Monday and clashed
with a phalanx of NATO-led troops who used tear gas and fists to
keep them from reaching the Serbian district.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 25,000 protesters tried to cross the main bridge
that divides the Serb and Albanian sections of this mining town,
but were turned back as thousands of Serbs stood watching from the
other side. The Albanians repeatedly pushed against the lines of
British and Canadian soldiers and French gendarmes as fights broke
out and demonstrators were hauled away.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's showdown came as tensions continued to build in this
ethnically divided city of 90,000 people. The violence of the past
two weeks has left 11 people dead and dozens wounded, including two
French soldiers who were shot in gun battles.
</P>
<P>
   Wave after wave of protesters arrived Monday on foot from
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province, 25 miles away, and from
the western towns of Pec and Srbica among others. Young men strode
up the main street waving red Albanian flags and banners as they
tried to breach the military lines.
</P>
<P>
   Across the River Ibar, Serbs held the Serbian tricolor aloft and
played Serbian nationalist songs on loudspeakers. For several hours
peacekeepers struggled to contain the crowd and French police
resorted to volley after volley of tear gas over the heads of the
British and Canadians, often leaving the soldiers choking and
retching along with the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall the protesters, some of whom had walked for 10
hours, grew tired and drifted away. The commander of the
peacekeeping force, German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, climbed atop a
British tank to talk to the crowd. He praised his troops for their
restraint and said they had prevented any serious injuries or
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he understood the demonstrators. ``They have shown
the way they want to live and are demonstrating for a better
future. They want a united city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his words underlined the intractable problem this city
presents for the peacekeepers and the U.N. administration. The
Albanians all speak of liberating the city, by which they mean
moving back into the Serb district en masse, which in turn would
force the Serbs to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to liberate the other side,'' said Shyrete Gela, a
35-year-old optician who lives in Mitrovica, as she took shelter in
a shop from the clouds of tear gas. ``I have cousins who live over
there. My friend has her flat there too but Serbs are living there
now. Serbs killed my brother, you know. And now people came from
Pristina to help us liberate the city, so we must run with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Mecinaj, 21, who had walked five hours, said: ``We want
the north side to be the same as the south. I want to see my
friends on the other side and for them to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica still bears terrible scars from the Kosovo war when
Serb forces bulldozed dozens of Albanian shops and houses and
destroyed an ancient mosque on the riverbank. Thousands of
Albanians have been unable to return to their homes on the north
side of the city as the Serb community has determinedly defended a
safe area for itself. The few hundred Serbs who lived on the south
side have long since fled.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers' efforts are now focused exclusively on trying
to contain the immediate violence, with little time or energy left
for developing a long-term solution. The British commander on the
bridge, Lt. Col. Nick Carter, spoke throughout the afternoon to the
crowd through a bullhorn, telling the Albanians that he wanted what
they did, a united Mitrovica. That brought loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Later he said he knew that the Albanian vision was quite
different from that envisioned by the international community.
``Don't think that we don't realize we are only buying a little bit
of time here. All I'm doing is holding this ring,'' he said. ``Of
course this is not tenable.''
</P>
<P>
   After the protesters dispersed, Reinhardt, the German general,
told the press: ``There is no switch that you can switch and
everything is better.'' He said his response to the last two weeks
of violence had been to launch a massive security operation
throughout the city during the past five days.
</P>
<P>
   He has ordered more than 2,000 soldiers and police to conduct
house searches for weapons and criminals. Troops, including
American paratroopers, were out again Monday conducting searches,
but the haul of illegal weapons has been small, with fewer than a
dozen Russian Kalashnikov rifles found.
</P>
<P>
   American troops, who were stoned by Serbs in northern Mitrovica
on Sunday, confined their activities to a predominantly Albanian
quarter and encountered no resistance Monday. But they found no
weapons because the area had recently been swept by the French,
raising questions about the value of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally these operations are of a more political value than
anything,'' Mario Morcone, the U.N. administrator in Mitrovica,
said of the general search operation. He maintained that security
in the city had improved nevertheless, with a curfew and numerous
checkpoints set up at night.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he hoped that in the next few days some of the
hundreds of Albanian families who fled their homes in the past two
weeks would be able to return to the Serb side. Apart from that, he
acknowledged, he had few ideas left on how to deal with the
problems.

IN MICHIGAN, MCCAIN RIPS BUSH VISIT TO BOB JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Since he landed on Michigan soil, John McCain
has minced no words about George W. Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University, a fundamentalist institution in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigots,'' he calls the university officials there who forbid
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid,'' he says of their views of the Pope, and of
Catholicism as someting of a cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idiots,'' he adds for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had comparatively little to say about the Bush visit
while the Arizona senator campaigned in the Palmetto State, where
fundamentalists make up at least 33 percent of the population and
provided Bush with his winning edge in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Michigan, the Christian conservative community is
far less potent and far less radical. They make up anywhere from 13
to 17 percent of the population compared to Roman Catholics, which
compose about a quarter of the state. And the McCain campaign hopes
to energize these Catholic voters, spurring them on to protest
Bush's Bob Jones visit with a vote on behalf of McCain Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Religion and politics are intricately intertwined in the race
for the Republican nomination for president this year. Although
both Bush and McCain oppose the practice of abortion, the National
Right to Life has backed Bush and opposed McCain, informing people
in phone calls throughout South Carolina and now Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the two campaigns volleyed accusations about telephone
campaigns that turn on accusations of religious intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   First, the McCain camp said it had uncovered evidence _ on the
answering machine of a McCain voter _ that the Reverend Pat
Robertson has taped a message that is being played for voters
across this state urging them to vote against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protect unborn babies and restore religious freedom once again
in America,'' Robertson says. ``Tomorrow's Republican primary may
determine whether our dream becomes reality or whether the
Republican Party will nominate a man who wants to take First
Amendment freedoms from citizens groups while he gives unrestricted
power to labor unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also slams McCain for choosing former New Hampshire
Senator Warren Rudman as his national chairman, calling him ``a
vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics
are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a message that drew a sharp rebuke from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous. It's disgraceful. Pat Robertson should go
back to wherever he came from,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two Michigan women reportedly called the Bush
campaign to say that they had receive taped messages that broadly
characterized Bush as anti-Catholic, for having made the Bob Jones
visit, and McCain as a friend to Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The latest point-counterpoint comes after a South Carolina
campaign in which religion proved a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Sanford, the wife of South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford,
called McCain Monday to tell him that churches throughout her state
had told parisioners last weekend that they should not support a
man who's wife is a drug addict. Cindy McCain, the senator's wife,
was once addicted to perscription painkillers after suffering from
chronic back problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bush took umbrage at suggestions that he might be
anti-Catholic, when Rep. Peter King, the New York Republican,
switched allegiances to McCain. King said he was offended as a
Roman Catholic by the governor's visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   ``That to me just showed a willingness to take any road to the
White House,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is a Methodist, denounced the inference that he is
biased against Catholics, noting that his younger brother practices
Catholicism. At his side was Governor John Engler, a Catholic, who
vouched for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Catholic voters in Michigan have been paying close
enough attention to the Bob Jones debate in the final 48 hours
before the primary remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue for McCain and Bush is with those moderate
Catholics,'' said John C. Green, an expert on politics and religion
at the University of Akron. ``Are they going to vote in that
Republican primary and how are they going to react to this
controversy?''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Schlesinger, an emeritus political science professor
at Michigan State University, said he does not believe Catholic
voters are a distinct voting bloc. Many, in fact, are liberal and
vote Democratic, while others are more conservative and vote
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of them know anything about Bob Jones University, I
don't know,'' Schlesinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Green warned that while McCain tries to energize Catholics,
he may inadvertently fire up the Christian right here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were advising Senator McCain, I would say, `Be very
careful about the rhetoric,' '' Green said. ``That 13 to 17 percent
in Michigan could be decisive in a close election, and that group
could get really irritated by that language.''

 &HT;    It's `Smooth' sailing for Santana at Grammys
 &HT;    By Michael Corcoran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Here we go again. It's time for that annual act
of shooting minnows in a horse trough known as predicting the
Grammys. Last year I made the mistake of thinking the Grammy voters
were as sick of that ``Titanic'' song as the rest of us, and I got
slaughtered. More than half of the readers who took up the ``Beat
the Critic'' challenge bested my 7-9 record, and we, briefly,
considered changing the name of this exercise to ``Pummel the
Pundit.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's gonna be different, my friends. I think I might be
able to pick the winner in every one of these major categories. I
can at least write the headline for the morning after the Wednesday
evening awards ceremony. ``Widespread Hispanic'' is a little
esoteric, so it'll just say ``Ole!'' after Grammy signals this as
the ``Year of the Latino.'' Look for Carlos Santana to pull an Eric
Clapton and walk away with a lifetime of golden gramophones in one
night. The only bit of suspense is which God he's going to thank.
</P>
<P>
   RECORD OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   ``I Want It That Way,'' Backstreet Boys
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe,'' Cher
</P>
<P>
   ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' Ricky Martin
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth,'' Santana Featuring Rob Thomas
</P>
<P>
   ``No Scrubs,'' TLC
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: ``Smooth.'' Capping off Santana's night
of ``Smooth'' sailing will be this well-deserved nod for the song
that was No. 1 for 12 consecutive weeks. A possible upset could be
the omnipresent ``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' Last year's Grammys
telecast was Martin's coming out party of sorts, and the grateful
National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences could reward him for
this kernel of catchiness.
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium,'' Backstreet Boys
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly,'' Dixie Chicks
</P>
<P>
   ``When I Look In Your Eyes,'' Diana Krall
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural,'' Santana
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanmail,'' TLC
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Santana. There's absolutely no contest.
A brilliant guitarist for more than 30 years, Carlos Santana put it
together on an album that just sounds better than everything else.
What's more, the record was a career triumph for Clive Davis, the
Arista chief who was rumored to be on his way out around balloting
time.
</P>
<P>
   BEST NEW ARTIST
</P>
<P>
   Christina Aguilera
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tedeschi
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Christina Aguilera. Unless, of course, a
``Shakespeare In Love'' vs. ``Saving Private Ryan'' situation
arises and Macy Gray's highbrow beats out Mariah2000's mass appeal.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FEMALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``Genie In A Bottle,'' Christina Aguilera
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful Stranger,'' Madonna
</P>
<P>
   ``I Will Remember You,'' Sarah McLachlan
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank U,'' Alanis Morissette
</P>
<P>
   ``... Baby One More Time,'' Britney Spears
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Christina Aguilera. This could go to
Spears as a concession for losing in all her other categories. Or
Grammy fave McLachlan, the best pure singer of this bunch, could
take it.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``I Need To Know,'' Marc Anthony
</P>
<P>
   ``Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of ...),'' Lou Bega
</P>
<P>
   ``Sogno,'' Andrea Bocelli
</P>
<P>
   ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' Ricky Martin
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand New Day,'' Sting
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Andrea Bocelli. Every Grammy voter has
probably eaten in an Italian restaurant this year, so they've heard
this song. Ricky Martin could very well walk away with this one,
but I can't see it going to any of the other three.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FEMALE R&AMP;B VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``All That I Can Say,'' Mary J. Blige
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Doesn't Count,'' Brandy
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Like This,'' Faith Evans
</P>
<P>
   ``Do Something,'' Macy Gray
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Not Right But It's Okay,'' Whitney
</P>
<P>
   Houston
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Whitney Houston. Blige is the best of
this bunch, but Grammy voters tend to stick with the old faves.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MALE R&AMP;B VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``Did You Ever Know,'' Peabo Bryson
</P>
<P>
   ``When A Woman's Fed Up,'' R. Kelly
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunate,'' Maxwell
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Lady,'' Tyrese
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying Power,'' Barry White
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: R. Kelly. Will Barry White get
sentimental votes? Maybe, but not enough to beat the guy who's
still riding the anthem ``I Believe I Can Fly'' in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ROCK ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakdown,'' Melissa Etheridge
</P>
<P>
   ``Significant Other,'' Limp Bizkit
</P>
<P>
   ``Echo,'' Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers
</P>
<P>
   ``Californication,'' Red Hot Chili Peppers
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural,'' Santana
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Santana. Bet the double wide.
</P>
<P>
   BEST POP ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium,'' Backstreet Boys
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe,'' Cher
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Martin,'' Ricky Martin
</P>
<P>
   ``Mirrorball,'' Sarah McLachlan
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand New Day,'' Sting
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Backstreet Boys. ``Millennium'' was the
best-selling album of 1999, which should sway those who might think
of selecting ``Mirrorball'' for credibility's sake.
</P>
<P>
   SONG OF THE YEAR (to the writer)
</P>
<P>
   ``I Want It That Way,'' Andreas Carlsson &AMP; Max Martin,
songwriters (Backstreet Boys)
</P>
<P>
   ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' Desmond Child &AMP; Robi Rosa, songwriters
(Ricky Martin)
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth,'' Itaal Shur &AMP; Rob Thomas, songwriters (Santana
Featuring Rob Thomas)
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpretty,'' Dallas Austin &AMP; Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins,
songwriters (TLC)
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got A Way,'' Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange &AMP; Shania Twain,
songwriters
</P>
<P>
   (Shania Twain)
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: ``Smooth.'' The best thing about
``Smooth'' is the guitar, not the composition. But when it rains it
pours on Grammy night and this will clearly be the night of
Santana's golden armload. Shania also has a good chance because
she's been passed over in this category the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   BEST R&AMP;B ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary,'' Mary J. Blige
</P>
<P>
   ``My Love Is Your Love,'' Whitney Houston
</P>
<P>
   ``R.'' R. Kelly
</P>
<P>
   ``Back At One,'' Brian McKnight
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanmail,'' TLC
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: TLC. Critically acclaimed and
multiplatinum: a can't-miss combo.
</P>
<P>
   BEST RAP ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   ``E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event - The Final World Front),''
Busta Rhymes
</P>
<P>
   ``Da Real World,'' Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott
</P>
<P>
   ``The Slim Shady LP,'' Eminem
</P>
<P>
   ``I Am,'' Nas
</P>
<P>
   ``Things Fall Apart,'' The Roots
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Will Smith. OK, that's a Chris Rock
joke. I can't see Eminem winning, because the Grammy electorate
rarely awards artists who are being sued by their mothers. The
Roots and Nas will split the ``rap as an art form'' vote and Busta
Rhymes is, well, he's Busta Rhymes. Let's go with Missy Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FEMALE COUNTRY VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary Heart,'' Emmylou Harris
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Me Let Go,'' Faith Hill
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget About It,'' Alison Krauss
</P>
<P>
   ``I Love You,'' Martina McBride
</P>
<P>
   ``Man! I Feel Like A Woman!'' Shania Twain
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Shania Twain. Harris and Krauss are
Grammy pets and McBride won this category at the CMA awards, but
Shania's just got too much sales power to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MALE COUNTRY VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Come Cryin' To Me,'' Vince Gill
</P>
<P>
   ``Choices,'' George Jones
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Right (You're Not From Texas),'' Lyle Lovett
</P>
<P>
   ``Please Remember Me,'' Tim McGraw
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy Little Thing Called Love,'' Dwight Yoakam
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: George Jones. This award could really go
to any of the five, which is why I'll give the nod to the legend.
Plus it would be a good chance to show up the rival CMA awards,
which snubbed Jones a few months back by not allowing him enough
time to sing the entire song
</P>
<P>
   BEST COUNTRY ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With Bob,'' Asleep At The Wheel
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly,'' Dixie Chicks
</P>
<P>
   ``Trio II,'' Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt &AMP; Dolly Parton
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Hard Truth,'' George Jones
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget About It,'' Alison Krauss
</P>
<P>
   And the winner will be: Dixie Chicks. They won it last year, and
this album is even better.

 &HT;    Bush backs off McCain heading into Michigan primary
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, the former Navy
fighter pilot, continued blasting away at George W. Bush on Monday,
while Bush, in contrast to his South Carolina campaign, labored to
avoid attacking his chief rival as the Republicans finished up two
frenetic days of campaigning leading up to today's Michigan
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll released by WDIV-TV in Detroit showed the race
to be a statistical dead heat going into today's voting. McCain led
Bush 46-42, based on weekend interviews conducted with 500 likely
voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A similar poll conducted by the station before Saturday's South
Carolina primary _ which Bush won decisively _ showed McCain
leading 46-38.
</P>
<P>
   With such a close margin between the two Republicans, a
statewide backlash against a third _ Michigan Gov. John Engler _
could have consequences for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by mostly black, mostly Democratic Detroit, voters are
promising to turn out en masse to vote against Bush only because he
is being supported by Engler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it will send a message to Engler to vote for McCain, I
will,'' said autoworker Sheila McCaulley, a Detroit Democrat who
said she plans to vote in the GOP primary today.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pinned his hopes here on a big turnout, which would
include crossover votes from Democrats such as McCaulley who are
free to vote in today's GOP primary under Michigan law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a very large turnout, there's not a doubt in my
mind, we'll win,'' McCain said Monday evening to about 200 people
near Detroit, before flying off to Arizona, which also has a GOP
primary today.
</P>
<P>
   Engler's decision to turn control of the Detroit public schools
over to a board appointed by the mayor drew widespread wrath among
residents. They also object to Engler's decision to merge two local
court systems and his signing of a bill that did away with
residency requirements for city employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a lifetime Detroiter, I feel real disrespected at this
point,'' said Carol Banks, 39, as she handed out leaflets urging an
anti-Engler vote for McCain. ``I think the only way we're going to
send a message is to let him know that our votes do count.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Engler has used the Democratic pro-McCain strategy
as a walk-up call to Republicans to get out and vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your help is urgently needed because some of Al Gore's
supporters here in Michigan ... plan to interfere with our ...
primary,'' Engler wrote to Bush supporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, spent Monday in populous southeastern Michigan,
greeting workers at a Detroit factory, addressing a breakfast
meeting of The Economic Club of Detroit and a President's Day rally
at Michigan State University, and working the crowd at a restaurant
in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he invoked his South Carolina win and, except
when pressed by reporters, took swipes at Vice President Al Gore
rather than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates want to win in Michigan _ the first state
in the nominating process that provides a microcosm of the nation _
a victory is more important to McCain than Bush, said political
scientist John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of
Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's credibility as a successful insurgent took a big hit
when Bush defeated him soundly in South Carolina, Green said. He
needs to regain the momentum that began with his victory in New
Hampshire if he wants to successfully compete March 7, when 12
states _ including Ohio, New York and California _ hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's first stop Monday was the town meeting in Traverse
City, in northern Michigan, where he depicted Bush as a
mean-spirited campaigner who will stoop to anything, even character
assassination, to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reject the negative campaigning. Reject the character
assassination. Reject the low road to the presidency,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was out early, shaking hands at the American Axle &AMP;
Manufacturing plant in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a blue ``Gov. George W. Bush'' windbreaker under a wool
dress coat, he bounded off the bus and moved inside to the factory
lobby to talk with workers.
</P>
<P>
   He continued the upbeat mood later at a packed GOP President's
Day rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel victory here in Michigan,'' he told the crowd. ``It's
voting time in Michigan. It's time for the people of this state to
stand up and say, `Tomorrow is the beginning of the end of the
Clinton-Gore era in Washington, D.C.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Michigan, Bush has tried to avoid attacks on
McCain, answering reporters' questions about McCain's recent
remarks, but not broaching the subject himself. That's in stark
contrast to the bitterly fought South Carolina battle where Bush
began daily news conferences by attacking his main Republican
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't duck McCain completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Senator McCain wants to make sure that there is campaign
funding reform, what he ought to do is stand up and put his
contributors on the Internet,'' Bush said in answer to a reporter's
question. ``... And he ought to support my calls for banning
contributions from federal lobbyists to members of the legislature
during legislative sessions. You know, he talks about the Iron
Triangle in Washington, D.C. He's been ringing that Iron Triangle
like a dinner bell raising the money from lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush softened his tone when asked if he would consider McCain as
a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain does not want me talking about him in terms of the
vice presidency,'' Bush said. ``He's running for president. So long
as he's a viable presidential candidate, I think he deserves the
respect of not being talked about in terms of the vice
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he could, Bush saved his scorn for Gore _ a nod more to
the general election in November than to today's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to Vice President Al Gore coming into your city
to explain to the workers why his statements about the automobile
industry make sense,'' Bush told roughly 1,200 people at The
Economic Club of Detroit. ``I look forward to him standing up there
and saying, `You know, my vision for America is one that you won't
be working.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore called for
eliminating the internal combustion engine within 25 years _
perhaps a tough sell in the Motor City.

   RICHMOND, Va. _ If Roger Zygmunt Comte de la Burde had been
found dead in his Jaguar or Mercedes Benz downtown on Broad Street,
David M. Riley, a senior special agent of the Virginia State
Police, said, ``the whole world would have been a suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   There were the victims of his shady art and real-estate deals as
detailed in court records. There were his enemies, whether real or
perceived, at his former employer, Philip Morris. There were his
many women, including an ex-wife, a lover, and a married biochemist
who was carrying his baby, not to mention the woman's disapproving
husband.
</P>
<P>
   But de la Burde, a 60-year-old Polish emigre, tobacco-research
scientist and collector of African art whose pedigree was as
suspect as the paintings he aged in the rain on his roof, did not
die on the streets of Richmond. He died at Windsor, his 220-acre
estate, under circumstances that greatly narrowed the list of
possible suspects. He died on a couch in his library under icons of
Eshu, a Nigerian deity of chaos, with a bullet in the head from his
own revolver found in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case is under judicial review, the violent end of
the enigmatic de la Burde seems as much a riddle as ever. Was it
murder? Or was it suicide?
</P>
<P>
   If it was murder, a murder driven by jealousy and greed as a
jury concluded, the killer, to the satisfaction of Riley, is
serving 22 years in the Pocahontas Correctional Center in
Chesterfield.
</P>
<P>
   If it was suicide, the same prisoner _ Beverly Anne Monroe, an
organic chemist and mother of three who ended her marriage for de
la Burde and became his closest companion for 12 years _ is a
victim of a miscarriage of justice stemming from admissions coerced
by Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, years after the 1992 shooting and trial, a judicial ruling
on an appeal by Monroe's family has renewed interest in the case.
Last April, a federal judge in Richmond, Richard L. Williams,
questioned whether her conviction had been justified, and he has
given the defense an opportunity to present evidence questioning
whether prosecutors had established her guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt and whether her constitutional rights to counsel had been
violated. The findings could come sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Monroe, put herself at the setting of her
lover's death. She said they had dinner, worked on an art-book
manuscript and kissed goodbye hours before he took his life in
despair over failing health and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Riley focused quickly on Monroe in what he believed was a murder
and, after she flunked a polygraph examination, presented her with
his idea of what happened: that she had been present during the
shooting but had blocked it from her mind. Eventually she agreed
with him, and prosecutors then charged her with murder, although no
forensic evidence tied her to the shooting and she had an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not kill Roger,'' Monroe, 62, said in a recent prison
interview, reiterating the innocence she has maintained over the
years. ``I loved Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters, led by a daughter who has devoted her legal
career to vindicating her mother, include Richard A. Leo, a
professor of criminology and psychology at the University of
California at Irvine and a specialist in police interrogations,
confessions and wrongful convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most outrageous cases I've ever seen,'' said
Leo, accusing Riley of crossing the line from permissible police
deception into illegal intimidation. Leo characterized Monroe as
someone who begins ``to imagine they could have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he was precluded from discussing the case but offered
no apologies for the conviction of a defendant he has portrayed as
a clever actress who, when shortchanged in de la Burde's latest
will and spurned for a pregnant rival, turned to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the testimony concerned the convoluted doings of de la
Burde, a man consumed by art, music, science, business and romance.
</P>
<P>
   He had boasted that he was the descendant of a royal overseer of
tradesmen in 14th-century Paris, but The Richmond Times-Dispatch
uncovered some discrepancies in his claim. He also said that he had
fled Poland in the 1950s and married a West German pediatrician and
that they had two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually settled in Richmond, where his background in
organic chemistry landed him a research job with Philip Morris in
1961. He stayed with the company until 1987.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1969, de la Burde also served as a U.N. technical
adviser to Nigeria, where he acquired tribal sculpture which he
later claimed to a writer for the journal ``African Arts'' had been
collected by his father before World War I. A curator for the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Susan Vogel, later found evidence
contradicting the claim.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, witnesses testified, he was trading in suspect
art. A stone carver, Frank Vegas, said he was employed to produce
fakes of well-known sculptures which de la Burde then donated as
originals to Radford University, the alma mater of one of his
daughters, Corinna. The FBI confirmed that there had been an
investigation but said it was dropped after de la Burde's death.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Monroe, meanwhile, had grown up on a farm in South
Carolina and obtained a degree in organic chemistry. She married a
scientist and had two daughters and a son.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1979, Monroe was hired by Philip Morris to work in the
patents department. She soon met de la Burde and they began an
affair. She and her husband, Stuart, separated in 1981, and de la
Burde and his wife, Brigette, split up not long after.
</P>
<P>
   At Philip Morris, de la Burde had developed a carbon dioxide
process to expand tobacco, which the company later acknowledged
saved about $300 million from 1979 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was cheated out of promised rewards, de la Burde sued,
and Philip Morris countersued, accusing him of threatening to
disclose ``certain confidential information and documents.'' The
lawsuit was settled with a payment to his estate and a return of
documents after his death.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, meanwhile, court testimony established, de la
Burde had affairs with co-workers and a married biochemist,
Krystyna Drewnowska. Consumed by a desire for a male heir, he
contracted with Drewnowska for a child. Monroe, learning of the
unorthodox arrangement, informed Drewnowska's husband, Wojtek.
Drewnowska gave birth to a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors seeking to show that Monroe was angry enough to kill
later produced a letter, written in 1990, in which she berated de
la Burde for his unfaithfulness.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of March 4, 1992, as Monroe told it, she left
Windsor about 9:30 p.m. and drove home, stopping for gas. Arriving
about 10 p.m., she said, she talked to her son, Gavin, and drove to
a Safeway store. She said she tried to call de la Burde but he did
not answer.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, she said, she decided to pass by Windsor,
where she and the caretaker found him on a couch, with a
.38-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson gun in his right hand and a bullet wound
above his right eye. In checking for a pulse, the caretaker later
recalled, he might have dislodged the gun.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The death scene was compromised in other ways, police witnesses
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe told investigators that de la Burde had been depressed.
But other witnesses insisted that he had been making plans _
including a sexual threesome for later that week _ and that
jealousy had unhinged Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Riley quickly focused on Monroe, suspecting that although no
fingerprints or other forensic evidence tied her to the shooting,
she had wielded the gun and then planted it in de la Burde's hand.
</P>
<P>
   He remained skeptical of her claim, which was supported by a
Safeway receipt stamped 10:40 p.m. _ around the time de la Burde
was first believed to have died _ and a canceled check to the
store, that she had left de la Burde alive, since he made a
telephone call around 10 p.m. Later an eyewitness from the store
came forward as well. Prosecutors countered that Monroe could have
returned to Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the death, Riley asked Monroe to take a
polygraph examination. Monroe waived her right to a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was naive and stupid,'' she said in an interview.
But she said she had been taught to cooperate with the police and
felt she had nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe was told that her responses had indicated that she was
not telling the truth. Then Riley pressed her to acknowledge that
she might have been present when de la Burde shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   Because, as Riley later testified, he had forgotten to restart
the tape recorder, most of Monroe's responses were not recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Police witnesses later testified that Monroe acknowledged being
present, but Riley was unable to get her to say that on tape after
restarting the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Amid prosecution pressure for a confession, Riley testified that
he arranged to meet Monroe again on June 3, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Again the exchange was not taped. But at the end, after an
encounter that was later portrayed by Monroe as intimidating and by
Riley as congenial, he wrote a series of statements to which Monroe
put her signature. They began: ``I was on the sofa. Roger was on
the other sofa. A noise made me jump. I don't recall getting up. I
recall standing over Roger who was on the sofa and seeing the
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the statements veered into the hypothetical: ``The
above I remember clearly but I don't remember exactly what happened
next, but I do know that having seen Roger in that circumstance my
natural reaction would be (not knowing whether he was alive or dead
at that instant) to try to stop him and that reaction would have
been to try to take the gun away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My next reaction would be (upon realizing he was dead) to put
back the gun. It would be natural to have put the gun back where I
thought it had been or where it would appear it should have been
considering the position of his body. It would have been natural
for anyone realizing they shouldn't have touched the gun to have
wiped it off before putting it back.''
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of both sides, the jury took only two hours and
55 minutes to find Monroe guilty. She posted bail to remain free
during appeal but in March 1996 began serving her 22-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Williams granted defense depositions on six issues,
including whether prosecutors relied on statements by Monroe that
were involuntary and in violation of her constitutional rights, and
whether prosecutors erred in failing to disclose a witness who saw
a black Bronco speeding out of Windsor's driveway on the night of
the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general the court is impressed with the substance of many
of Monroe's claims,'' Williams wrote.

RANGERS CHANGING TO `SMALL BALL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ These are strange times for that ballclub
forever known as the Arsenal in Arlington. Partly by design, partly
by surprise, the Rangers have opened this Florida camp committed to
a nuclear-disarmament program.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, and generally to the detriment of all else, the
big-bang theory had become a franchise trademark. Over the years,
and the decades, the game plan was pretty simple: Let somebody hit
a three-run homer, and then pray the bullpen could hold an 8-7
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, baseball in Arlington may have to be a case of
mind over muscle. And for that to happen, and if it's going to be
successful, then manager Johnny Oates says the transformation will
have to begin right here in the Charlotte County swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of six weeks of spring training, what Oates has promised
will be more like a baseball version of sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, men, is what's called the bunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I saw the bunt sign, I remember it well,'' left
fielder Rusty Greer said yesterday. ``It was two years ago, and I
struck out on three pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat scary is that under this new concept, Greer will be
considered one of the team's better bunters.
</P>
<P>
   Oates: ``Once we begin the games down here \RMarch 3\S, every
player in our lineup will be bunting, and every player will be on
his own \Ron the bases\S. I want to find out right now who can
bunt, who can possibly steal a base, who can hit-and-run, and so
on. We are going to need all this later on.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``small ball'' game, of course, will be a radical change for
the Rangers. But if it actually works, it will also be a positive
change, as long as the other component of ``small ball'' is in
place. Which means better pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Big, hulking first baseman-DH Lee Stevens was sitting beside
Greer in the clubhouse yesterday after a morning workout. Stevens
said it was also two years ago when he last saw a bunt sign from
Oates. ``The funny thing was, I had homered the bat before,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``But while every one thinks it's a given we won't be scoring
runs like we always have,'' continued Stevens, ``what if our
pitching is better? What if our staff ERA drops a full run, which
it could? That means over the season, we'd give up 162 less runs.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, is the way the Rangers are promoting the
2000 season. Less pop, much-better pitching.
</P>
<P>
   How much better pitching, well... that's a promising concept, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the last two postseason offensive
disasters against the Yankees hammered home the oldest point in
baseball: Nobody outscores good pitching. Leading the world in
almost every offensive category, as the Rangers did in 1999,
resulted in one whole run in 27 innings last October. And the
October before that, there had also been one run in 27 innings
against the same Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it was time to try something else, but neither general
manager Doug Melvin nor Oates planned it exactly this way. In other
words, the change is more drastic than they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Juan Gonzalez was by design. In the name of preventing a
long-term salary problem, Melvin moved out Juan last November in a
deal with Detroit that has been hailed throughout baseball as
shrewd. Actually, it's Melvin himself who is repeatedly advising
caution in judging that trade ``because you don't give up Juan's
run production and his presence] in a lineup without a lot of
sleepless nights,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin wanted the big-bang drain to stop right there.
Nothing was on his drawing board about also losing third baseman
Todd Zeile. In a shocker to Melvin, he suddenly learned Zeile
wouldn't be accepting the contract Melvin thought Zeile had
accepted. Instead, Zeile was gone to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Between Juan and Todd, that's a combined 63 homers and 226 RBI
from 1999 that won't be reporting here this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find ways, and manufacture ways, to make up what we
no longer have,'' said Oates, known as a managerial disciple of the
great Earl Weaver. And Weaver lived by the doctrine of ``pitching,
defense and the three-run homer.'' In other words, Weaver would
have given up smoking before he'd dare bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make chicken salad if you don't have any chickens,''
added Oates. ``I will never know if Juan could bunt because I never
wanted to find out. But I like to think I can adjust to the talent
I've been given.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the adjusting starts immediately; from the big bang to
the little bunt, the Rangers are very different this spring.
Better? Don't know. But definitely different, and two runs in two
Octobers says it was time to try another way.

COMMENTARY: DEAR EHUD, HAFEZ AND YASSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Memo From: &LR;  Bill Clinton
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To: &LR;  Ehud Barak, Hafez Assad and Yasser Arafat
</P>
<P>
   Dear boys, it's been a while since we've talked, but with all of
your negotiations now derailed it's time we had a blunt
conversation. I just have a few basic questions: Hafez, can you
spell? Yasser, can you subtract? And Ehud, can you add and spell?
</P>
<P>
   Hafez, when I ask ``can you spell?'' what I'm asking is, can you
spell the word ``peace'' any way other than ``h-a-t-r-e-d''? I've
started to wonder if that's the only spelling you know. Look at
you: The peace talks don't go to your liking, so you unleash the
Hezbollah to start killing Israelis in South Lebanon, and your
newspaper starts calling the Holocaust ``a myth.'' Then on Jan. 27,
your foreign minister, Farouk Shara, gave a speech to the Arab
Writers Association in Syria. He was asked whether by ending the
struggle with Israel Syria wasn't granting ``the Zionists a right
in Palestine.'' Farouk answered: ``This is an important question,
because even the Baath Party, of which I have the honor of being a
member, understands that restoring Palestine in its entirety is a
long-term strategic goal, that cannot be achieved in one stage ...
The first stage is the stage of restoring the occupied lands (of
1967) and of guaranteeing the national inalienable right of the
Palestinian Arab people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, ain't that great! Farouk just wrote the perfect bumper
sticker for Ehud Barak's opponents in any Israeli referendum over
whether to give back the Golan. I can see the Likud bumper stickers
now: ``Farouk Shara says Israel's withdrawal from the Golan is just
stage one. What's stage two?''
</P>
<P>
   When I read stuff like that, Hafez, my first reaction is that
you guys are just being stupid. But then I wonder: Is this
stupidity or is this autobiography? Is this you being stupid or
being yourselves? In fact, the more I listen to Farouk the more I
think he's not looking for a peace deal, he's looking for an alibi.
In that same speech, he said that if the Israelis didn't agree to
Syria's terms: ``We will lose nothing, because we will win the
sympathy of Arab and international public opinion ... because we
will tell them: `We did all we could. We went, we talked, we showed
open hearts and minds, but the expansionist racists want to force
their terms on us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nice, Hafez. It's poetry like that that's sure to win the hearts
of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yasser, I know you can add to 100 _ that you want 100
percent of the West Bank and Gaza and East Jerusalem as part of any
final peace with Israel, but can you subtract from 100? Let's get
real here, pal. The most you can expect is something like 70 to 80
percent of the West Bank and some symbolic presence on the edge of
Jerusalem. I know you don't want to subtract until you are sure
that Barak can add, but as long as you don't start subtracting in
public, Barak is able to get away without adding.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to you, Ehud. I know you can add to 50 _ that
the Palestinians will get 50 percent of the West Bank. But can you
add to 75? I'm all for letting the 80 percent of Israeli settlers
who comfortably live on 25 percent of the West Bank stay. But 25
percent ain't 50 percent, pal. There will be no stable peace
without the Palestinians getting some 75 percent of the West Bank
back, plus a Palestinian toehold around Jerusalem and some
restitution for their refugees. As long as you don't make clear
that you can add those three things, you'll never really know
whether Arafat can subtract.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud, I have to confess: I'm still not quite sure who you are.
Are you just the guy who is going to implement what Netanyahu said
he would implement, but never did, or are you a Rabin _ someone
ready to really break the mold? Do you spell your name ``B-i-b-i''
or ``Y-i-t-z-h-a-k''? And while I'm checking, I also need to know
if you know how to spell ``Syria.'' Because you keep spelling it
``L-e-b-a-n-o-n.'' Ehud, leave the Lebanese alone. You and the
Syrians are playing a dishonest game. Instead of hitting each
other, you keep punching the Lebanese. They aren't the problem or
the cure. You know the Syrians are behind the war in South Lebanon,
so stop bombing Beirut's power stations.  &UR; Hit the Syrians! &LR;  Make
Hafez pay in his own coin. Then at least we'll find out who  &UR; he
 &LR; really is.
</P>
<P>
   Boys, we've done all the easy stuff. Now we're down to hard-core
basics _ adding, subtracting and spelling. When you all show me you
can do that, we're in business again. Until then, it's recess.

NO BREAKTHROUGH EXPECTED IN BOEING STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representatives of Boeing Co. and its striking engineers and
technical workers are expected to meet separately with federal
mediators this week amid signs that tension between the two groups
is escalating.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's 17,000 engineers and technical workers, represented by
the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
union, walked off their jobs Feb. 9 after contract negotiations
broke down over wages and health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bofferding, the executive director of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees, said that he expected to meet
with federal mediators Tuesday but did not expect an imminent
breakthrough in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason as of yet to have a joint meeting with
Boeing,'' Bofferding said. ``But I share that view'' (of some Wall
Street analysts) ``that our differences in the contract dispute
with Boeing are not that far apart. I don't understand why Boeing
doesn't say, `Let's work together to solve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Conte, a Boeing spokesman, said the company was willing to
speak with federal mediators, but had no scheduled meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations Monday, neither Boeing nor its engineers
appeared willing to back away from sticking points in their
bargaining positions. The union, which represents 22,000 engineers
and technical workers at Boeing, has demanded guaranteed wage
increases and a bonus plan similar to the one that the company
granted last year to its machinists. As a group, the machinists
should receive bonus pay of about $4,400 each.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has refused to grant the bonus plan to its engineers. The
company has proposed to set up three funds for merit raises. The
engineers would receive increases of about 8 percent during the
first year of the contract, while technical workers would receive 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conte said Monday that Boeing was willing to negotiate with the
union but not on any of their new demands, including a bonus plan.
</P>
<P>
   That remark riled Bofferding, who said, ``Well, if that's true,
then we don't have much to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Condit, the chairman of Boeing, said last week that the
company could maintain its position in the strike for a long time.
Union officials have echoed similar sentiments, but both groups
have begun to feel the effects of the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Since the strike began, Boeing has missed scheduled deliveries
on seven jetliners. The company delivered one last week and three
others over the weekend. Two more jets were expected to be
delivered Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has also frightened Boeing's investors. After
approaching a 52-week high of $47.625 in mid-January, Boeing's
stock has tumbled 24.4 percent to close Friday at $36 a share.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Boeing's engineers have also begun to feel the pinch of lost
paychecks. The union, which had no strike fund, has raised about
$70,000, largely through donations, to help overcome its members'
hardships. Bofferding said Monday that the fund has already paid
one member's power bill and other disbursements would be made as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had warned that a drawn-out dispute could damage morale
at Boeing, just when the company's commercial jet division had
begun to show signs of a financial recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of ill will are becoming increasingly evident. Union
officials have said that if they are forced to return to work, they
will begin a ``work to rule'' campaign to stall operations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's striking engineers were also skeptical about the
company's recent claims that it had delivered jets. Boeing has
admitted that the strike has lengthened the time it takes to have
engineering processes certified by qualified engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Bofferding noted that all but 24 of Boeing's 416 designated
engineering representatives, who certify the planes, are on strike.
The certification process, Bofferding said, usually requires 50
engineers for each plane.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said that it has enough engineers, who are not on
strike, to complete the certifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boeing is delivering planes, then we don't know how they're
doing it,'' Bofferding said. ``They don't have enough engineers.
The ones they have must be spread around like a dog's breakfast.''

TEE CARSON, 70, PIANIST IN COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (kd) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Tecumseh (Tee) Carson, who inherited the piano chair from
Count Basie after the band leader's health failed, died on Feb. 13
at his home in Cedar Park, Texas. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said Shirley Cason, his sister.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his career as a jazz musician, Carson was a U.S.
marshal working at the Justice Department on surveillance duty. He
retired from the department in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, when Count Basie's health problems began,
Carson started to fill in occasionally as pianist. He was something
of a Basie protege, having a similarly self-editing, bare-bones
rhythmic style.
</P>
<P>
   When Basie died in 1984, Carson became the band's pianist,
playing in the posthumous Count Basie Orchestra alongside such jazz
luminaries as the saxophonist Frank Foster and the longtime Basie
guitarist Freddie Green.
</P>
<P>
   John S. Wilson, writing in The New York Times about a 1985
performance of the Basie orchestra under the direction of Eric
Dixon, said that Carson ``manages to suggest Basie's manner without
adopting it, using single-note lines that are a variant of Basie's
lines, and dropping gentle but propitious chords behind the
soloists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s Carson recorded with the Basie band as well as
with the saxophonists Frank Wess and Richie Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington, Carson became an electronics engineer at the
Federal Aviation Administration in the early 1950s and joined the
Army in the mid-'50s.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Washington area in the late '70s, he lived in San
Francisco for a time, where he played jazz and was a jazz disc
jockey on WCSM.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, of Fairfax, Va., Carson is survived
by his wife, Robin LaStofka Carson; two daughters, Ja Don Carson of
Las Vegas and Jan Hill of Boise, Idaho; a son, Donald, of Austin,
Texas; and two grandchildren.

SPORTS COLUMN: NO LONGER MISSING FROM NBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Los Angeles Clippers were being introduced
at the Garden on Monday, you heard, ``the assistant coaches, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar. ...'' And there he was near the bench, holding a
clipboard, standing tall and slim in a gray double-breasted suit,
his dome shaved slick, his mustache and goatee flecked with gray.
</P>
<P>
   His name provoked a quick cheer that might have been even louder
had more people realized he was hired last Friday after a decade as
pro basketball's missing person.
</P>
<P>
   After having been the 7-foot-2-inch center of gravity on six
National Basketball Association championship teams, a six-time
winner of the most valuable player award and the career scoring
leader with a total of 38,387 points and another 5,762 in the
playoffs, he had all but disappeared from the NBA planet.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Abdul-Jabbar was missing by choice. He wrote three
books, lectured, worked as an actor and film producer, signed
card-show memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very burned out when I retired,'' he was saying now
about leaving the Los Angeles Lakers. ``It took me three or four
years to get a sense of equilibrium back.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Abdul-Jabbar realized that he wanted to coach, that
basketball was still in his blood. But whenever he tried to get a
coaching job, nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Mr. Sterling once or twice two or three years
ago,'' he said, referring to the Clippers' owner. ``I talked to
some of the NBA general managers: Al Attles, Wes Unseld, Wayne
Embry, Ernie Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the chancellor at UCLA when Jim Harrick was in a
bind there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his reputation as aloof and moody still lingered.
</P>
<P>
   Had he felt blackballed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken aback by why I couldn't get interviews,''
Abdul-Jabbar said. ``That bothered me. I talked with Willis Reed at
the Nets and he was very encouraging, but I never heard anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In his frustration, he spent five months last year helping to
coach high school boys on the White Mountain Apache Reservation in
Whitewater, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoops was not what that was about,'' he said. ``It was about
teaching them how to lead productive lives, to go to college. A lot
of the kids there didn't want to leave the reservation. They don't
think they can cope with the world outside the reservation. One of
those kids is now in college in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, last Friday, the Clippers hired him.
</P>
<P>
   By joining the Clippers at age 52 as an assistant (along with
Dennis Johnson) to Jim Todd, the recently appointed head coach,
Abdul-Jabbar was obviously willing to start at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their 16-season existence, the Clippers have been the
NBA's worst franchise. Including Monday's 87-76 loss to the Knicks,
they have lost 11 in a row. Their 11-43 record is the worst in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole lot about the game is not being translated,''
Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Young guys don't know how to do things I
learned in high school. They've got size and agility, but they
don't know how to get it done with four other guys. How to play
defense. How to help teammates on defense. How to be instinctive on
offense when you see the opportunity. They don't stay in college
long enough to learn how.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom, the Clippers' prize rookie, whom he described as a
``giant Swiss Army knife; he can do everything,'' played only one
season at Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the money,'' he said. ``These kids dream of
being wealthy, but they don't understand the game. And college is
losing its best players. It's something the NBA, the NCAA and the
AAU has to address.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged having learned ``everything'' about basketball
from John Wooden in his three championship seasons at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Wooden taught the mental approach to the game, what the
team knew as a group,'' he said. ``You have to practice that way.
Of my pro coaches, the guy that really impressed me was Jack
McKinney, who was only with the Lakers for a few months when he had
a bicycle accident and couldn't coach anymore. He understood the
game and the players.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Pat Riley, his longtime Lakers coach?
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three different incarnations,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``He
changed. Sometimes success has its problems. I'm not putting him
down. He had a lot to cope with.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hope to be a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do this well,'' he said, ``and ultimately. . . .''

   UNITED NATIONS _ If rock-throwing mobs in Kosovo can turn their
rage on well-armed and expertly trained American troops, what can
be in store for U.N. police officers?
</P>
<P>
   The question sends a chill through officials and diplomats here
who see a roster of dangerous law-enforcement assignments that may
add up to more than the organization can tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. department of peacekeeping operations is scrambling for
thousands of police officers for operations in the Balkans, East
Timor, several war zones in Africa, Cyprus, Tajikistan, Haiti and
Guatemala. And few police departments have officers to spare.
</P>
<P>
   And Secretary-General Kofi Annan does not have the freedom to
move staff members to augment the peacekeeping department of about
400 people, among them only 230 professionals and the rest support
staff. The group is half the size of the organization's public
information department.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Annan can no longer accept unlimited free experts
provided by governments because a lobby of developing nations
decided that too many were drawn from Western military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping office is being asked ``to run operations on
three continents in four difficult places _ East Timor, Kosovo,
Sierra Leone and soon Congo,'' said Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative. ``They are not adequately staffed to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks to the U.N. of failure are very great if they don't
do it right,'' Holbrooke said in an interview Monday. ``This is not
a secret; it is widely understood. But the solution is elusive
because of the way the U.N. system is structured.''
</P>
<P>
   A special General Assembly committee on peacekeeping is now
meeting to consider the department's problems, many of which have
been caused by a General Assembly committee dealing with budgets
and allocations for new staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi, the deputy director of
peacekeeping, said that because of Security Council instructions,
officers will be on active patrol for the first time in Kosovo and
East Timor, and in Kosovo, will be armed. Until now, the police
officers sent on peacekeeping missions have been unarmed monitors
or instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of officers required for missions have also jumped.
The United Nations, with no police force of its own, is required to
deploy nearly 9,000 officers as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That includes 4,718 for Kosovo, 2,057 for Bosnia, 1,640 for East
Timor and other contingents for smaller missions.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have sent 5,122 officers as of Monday. That includes
fewer than half those needed in Kosovo, where some have been sent
back as unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia was the largest civilian police mission, with 3,600
people, but even there they had ``supervising or training functions
but were not taking over from the local police,'' Annabi said in an
interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was new last year with Kosovo and East Timor is that we
were given direct executive law enforcement powers. We were asked
to assume responsibility for law and order, apprehensions and
arrests, which we had never been given before. That is a
qualitative leap.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Council on Foreign Relations, Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on
the United Nations, said that the world body needs help in
rethinking its operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there's been any question of where to put together
a really robust police force, everybody has ducked,'' Wedgwood
said. ``It's something that the Pentagon and NATO really have to
face up to. The United Nations does not have the military.''
</P>
<P>
   David Malone, a Canadian Foreign Service officer who is
president of the International Peace Academy, an independent
research group in New York, said that Annan, a former head of
peacekeeping in some of its most troubled years, needs more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think of the headquarters organizations of the national
militaries, they have thousands of people, not hundreds,'' Malone
said Monday. ``And the complexity for the U.N. is all the greater
in that they have a number of missions, some of them large, spread
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when missions can be fielded with some urgency, said
Malone, the job can be harder than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the security forces historically have been largely
repressive and unfriendly to the local population,'' he said,
``it's extremely difficult to bring the population around to the
view that the police are providing a public service and are
friends.''

<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain's high command huddled
conspiratorially in the darkened aisle of his campaign plane on
Sunday night, plotting their latest move to stop Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They fretted that Bush had been scheduled to appear first on
NBC's ``Today'' program on Monday, followed by McCain. No way, they
decided. McCain would go first on the highest rated morning program
_ or defect to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director, uttered an expletive
about the Bush campaign, and added, ``That's what it's come down
to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McCain prevailed and Bush wound up on ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a minor triumph for a presidential candidate who
after his convincing win in New Hampshire has not had to scrap for
position on the morning programs. Only two weeks ago, his beaming
face was emblazoned on the cover of Time and Newsweek; this week,
it is Bush staring resolutely from both covers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of the primary here on Tuesday, McCain and his
aides are still thunderstruck by their loss to Bush in South
Carolina three days ago _ the first defeat of the senator's
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Inside McCain's famously chatty bus, the afterglow of New
Hampshire is dimming by the day. Despite friendly crowds from
Traverse City to Grand Rapids to here in Saginaw _ and polls that
show the Republican rivals neck and neck in Michigan _ McCain and
his aides were revisiting what might have been. They said that
while they got too mired in tactics in New Hampshire and did not
adequately respond to the governor's onslaught of advertising and
oratory, they are still struggling to grasp what went awry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his prediction before the South Carolina primary
that a high turnout would assure a win for McCain, Weaver _ who
just days ago was being hailed in the press for his political
deftness _ confessed, `'Obviously, we didn't know what we were
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bush's victory was not even close, as polls had
predicted, Rick Davis, the campaign manager, said, ``Everyone ought
to be firing their pollsters.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, McCain refuses to yield, acknowledging that ``we took
a shot to the stomach,'' but reminding audiences that he has
``crashed a few airplanes'' and knows how to recuperate. As he put
it at a packed rally Monday morning in Traverse City, ``I'm telling
you, we're coming back! We're coming back!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of McCain's upbeat talk about primaries next month
in possibly friendly territory, like California and New England _
``I still think this thing will be decided by March 7,'' the
senator told reporters on his bus _ two senior campaign officials
said privately that their hopes of snatching the Republican
nomination would be effectively over if he does not win here.
</P>
<P>
   The big quandary for McCain is how to make up his mind over how
aggressively to respond to the relentless 30-second broadsides from
Bush that started in South Carolina and are continuing here.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in South Carolina fresh from New Hampshire,
McCain announced that unlike Bill Bradley in the Democratic race,
he had no qualms about defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Bradley campaign,'' he said then. ``We will
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   But days later, McCain pulled a commercial questioning Bush's
trustworthiness _ and comparing him to President Clinton _ and he
has essentially ceded the airwaves to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Michigan, McCain has faced the very conundrum Bradley
has in his battle with Vice President Al Gore: If he goes on the
attack, McCain undermines his theme that he is a reformer who will
not stoop to going negative. Yet, by not attacking, McCain allows
Bush to define him.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain has settled on a strategy in which he came out
swinging at Bush at stop after stop in Michigan, saying if Bush is
really a reformer, than ``I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has not dared run television commercials that denounce
Bush, even as the governor is running his own advertisements
pounding McCain's record. It is a somewhat ambivalent approach _
and one that is strikingly reminiscent of the high-minded tone of
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the guy doesn't want to run a negative ad,'' said Greg
Stevens, McCain's media adviser. ``Does it make me a little edgy?
Nervous? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflicting impulses were on display in the senator's
truculent concession speech on Saturday night: He insisted that he
would ``keep fighting clear,'' even as he pounced on Bush _ without
citing him by name _ for a ``negative message of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, questioned aboard his bus, refused to acknowledge that
he had not followed his own counsel to avoid the trap Bradley put
himself in: ``I don't want 20 years from now when my kids are grown
and they're majoring in political science and they pick up a book,
`And so, John McCain, in South Carolina, out of desperation because
he was losing, launched negative attacks on George Bush.'''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse the Bush campaign of dirty, negative
tactics. ``We all know what caused the loss,'' he said. ``I would
never be associated with people and the things that were done in
that race in South Carolina and I'm proud that we had nothing to do
with that kind of campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I probably didn't do as well as I should have or
could have. But do you think that would have made any difference? I
could have invented a cure for cancer and it couldn't have
mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, McCain acknowledged what his advisers
have said bluntly: ``Perhaps I should have defined myself a little
more as far as different positions on issues,'' he said. ``We're
doing more of that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator still harps on how offended he was when Bush held an
event in South Carolina at which a former prisoner of war
questioned whether he had sufficiently fought for veterans. And
Monday, the campaign distributed articles that cited the Bush
operation's under-the-radar efforts to crush him in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At campaign events here, the silver confetti still falls and the
disco music still pounds, but the loss in South Carolina is in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   In East Lansing, at a rally at Michigan State University, John
Schwarz, a state senator, sounded in his warm-up for the challenger
as if he had to justify his endorsement of McCain over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one defector on the Michigan Legislature,'' Schwarz
said. ``I'm  &UR; still  &LR; comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has tried mightily to persuade the press that his
campaign is not sputtering. ``By the way,'' he said on the bus
Sunday, ``small item: Since yesterday, there's an uptick in our
contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about the size of the uptick, McCain said it was ``like
ten or fifteen thousand'' dollars ``from what it was the day
before.'' But more than anything else, the sum underscores how the
dynamic has changed. After New Hampshire _ and before South
Carolina _ the campaign took in roughly $3 million on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also made sure to trumpet the endorsement of Rep. Peter King,
R-N.Y., who defected this week from the Bush camp. But on the eve
of South Carolina, some McCain aides had predicted that a win in
that state would have spurred countless big-name Republicans to
jump as well.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush's newfound potency has clearly addled the McCain camp.
Officials say they are bewildered at polls showing that South
Carolina voters now see the governor as the more genuine reformer.
And they admitted that their merry band of rebels would benefit
from some Republican reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really getting tired of being defended by Bill Press,''
Davis said of the co-moderator on the CNN program, ``Crossfire,'' a
former chairman of the California Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain and his supporters are mindful that the days of an
exciting insurgency hinge on what happens here, now. The senator
cannot for much longer be introduced, he as was in East Lansing, as
``The winner of the New Hampshire primary by a landslide!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he tries not to think too hard about his mistakes or
his prospects, though he quipped that ``I hum `Hail to the Chief' a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he fixes his thoughts on Bush, and what that win in South
Carolina might do for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have gotten some bounce,'' said the senator who had
hoped that bounce would be his. ``But who knows?''

AS IRAN COUNTS BALLOTS, SOME FEAR BACKLASH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Evidently headed for a dramatic victory in
parliamentary elections, Iran's triumphant reformers said on Monday
their challenge now will be to manage the pace of change to avoid a
dangerous backlash from the weakened but still-potent
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The chief political adviser to President Mohammad Khatami,
Hossein Valeh, said in an interview that if the reformers'
predictions are realized, the president will have a clear mandate
to act on his pledge to remake Iran from an insular country of
disjointed ruling elites into a democratic state ruled by a clear
set of constitutional laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Valeh, one of the president's closest confidants for more
than 10 years, warned that the victory carries substantial risks.
Khatami, he said, will have to temper the zeal of his new majority
while rooting out the internal threats to democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the opposition is very weak, the majority becomes a
little extravagant,'' he said. ``Our direction will be the same,
but it will be a question of the speed and scope of reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Valeh said that based on his analysis of the returns,
pro-Khatami reform candidates won 73 percent of the parliamentary
seats that were decided outright in the first round of elections
held Friday and could well find themselves controlling 90 percent
after a second round of voting in April.
</P>
<P>
   Official returns from the Feb. 18 elections for the 290-seat
Parliament have not yet been announced, and votes in several big
cities, including Tehran, are still being counted by hand. A
candidate needs at least 25 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Since his landslide election in 1997, Khatami has largely
avoided direct confrontation with the conservative Parliament and
the rigid religious hierarchy that intrudes into nearly every
aspect of Iranians' daily lives. But he has clearly tapped into his
youthful country's restlessness for change. He now faces the
problem of meeting the runaway expectations that the election of
his supporters has unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   Valeh said the president is well aware of his mandate for
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great obstacle has been removed by this election and the
president will be empowered to push his reformist program faster in
the future than he could in the last two and a half years,'' he
said. ``Whether or not his moves will keep pace with the
accelerating demands of the people in Iran, we have to wait and
see. But I anticipate that he will not be as slow as he has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the men and women around Khatami, Valeh was a
student _ only 19 _ at the time of the Islamic revolution and
believed, even as it ushered in a violent era of executions and
purges, that it could do no wrong. But when speaking now about the
revolution, he described it as a dream of freedom and order that
was hijacked by reactionaries after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revolution was not a renaissance,'' he said. ``It was a
more a riot, in my view.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the reformers who may soon dominate the Parliament and
look to Khatami for a progressive program, he said they will have
their divisions and disputes but are united on principles. ``What
we all have in common is our distance from revolutionary
totalitarianism and lawless order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Republic will remain,'' he added, ``but its content
will change broadly.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's goals, he said, include consolidating his
control over the many extra-legal institutions, including the
morals police and the clerical court that has arrested and
imprisoned many reformist journalists and liberal clerics over the
past two and a half years. With the help of an obliging Parliament,
he added, the Khatami government also hopes to clean up the state
oil industry, which is widely viewed as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Valeh described the government that Khatami inherited upon his
election in 1997 as a discordant assembly of separate fiefs that,
if threatened too quickly or too forcefully, could disrupt the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's ambitious agenda would pit the president and his
supporters against these entrenched traditional power-brokers. The
reformers must act with caution, Valeh said, because their
opponents have already demonstrated their hostility and their
propensity for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he referred to the vigilantes who attacked student
protesters at Tehran University last summer. He said he does not
know who ordered them to attack, but added that he is convinced the
attackers were mobilized in an effort to destabilize the country
and to give the conservative Parliament an excuse to oust Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Valeh's statement about the student demonstration is just one
sign of the new confidence felt by Khatami and his team to confront
their opponents head-on. He also spoke of the president's goal of
controlling the hard-line institutions that have grown up in the
last 15 years but that, in his view, have no legal basis.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Organization for the Promotion of Virtue and
Prevention of Vice _ in effect, an unconstrained force of morals
police _ that hauls in women whose headscarves slip to show some of
their hair, nabs couples on a stroll through the park if they
cannot prove they are married, and marches into private homes to
confiscate illegal satellite dishes or Western videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the Special Court for Clergy, which has been
particularly active since Khatami's election encouraged the
independent press to take on politically and religiously sensitive
topics and sometimes to treat them with irreverence. The judges
have closed newspapers and jailed editors who questioned the
tyranny of religious conservatives, among them Abdullah Nouri, a
cleric who is a personal friend of Khatami and is serving a
five-year prison term imposed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   But Valeh said the reformers around Khatami do not want to
decapitate the religious order or dispense with Islamic law; they
only want to organize them in line with democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. Khatami is trying to say is there should be one rule
of law,'' he said. ``You have to coordinate everything according to
this single criterion. Logically it means that all institutions
should be brought to obey the legal order. There is a duality but
it doesn't mean the constitutional setup is necessarily contrary to
the traditional religious setup.''

CHECHEN REFUGEES TELL OF CIVILIAN MASSACRE BY RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia _ Refugees trickling out of Chechnya into the
makeshift camps that pock the Caucasus foothills near Nazran are
bringing stories of what could be one of the worst civilian
massacres to date in the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   They charge that ``kontraktniki'' _ Russian men hired by the
army to fight in Chechnya _ staged a drunken rampage of looting and
gunfire through the tiny, bombed-out, straw-brick homes of a
neighborhood in the Chechen capital of Grozny called Aldi. They say
the mercenaries executed women and elderly men and burned houses
and animal pens to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Russians left, carting away furniture, jewelry
and money on loaded-down armored personnel carriers, dozens if not
scores of residents had perished, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors also tell the story of how Zina Labazaneva died,
and of how a woman she never met, a 40-ish mother of teenagers
named Sapiyat, helped give her peace in death, because that first
Saturday in February there was no relative to wash Labazaneva, wrap
her in a white shroud and lay her in her grave.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen witnesses of what happened in Aldi that day _
though not Sapiyat _ have been interviewed by the New York-based
organization Human Rights Watch, which has compiled what it calls a
credible list of 30 victims in Aldi. Other survivors have
circulated a list of 82 dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after all this is finished, and we are out, we know that
115 were killed,'' Sapiyat, a tall, hollow-eyed woman in a long
print dress and owlish glasses, said between sobs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way yet to verify any of these figures, much less
the circumstances of the deaths. The Russian government has denied
that its troops have engaged in atrocities, and has called such
reports malicious propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   While refugees seem to have been generally safe from retribution
for their statements, virtually all have refused to give their full
names in interviews with reporters. One refugee was reported
arrested this week after complaining in an interview about abuses
in a Russian-run detention camp near Grozny. Neither Sapiyat's full
name nor her precise location are used in this article.
</P>
<P>
   In a long interview in one of Nazran's many refugee huddles,
where she arrived not long ago, Sapiyat said she is alive today
because of where she lived _ on Almaznaya Street, the very last in
a warren of curving, interlocking lanes that make up the Aldi
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of January, Russian troops pressing their final
assault on Grozny began bombarding Aldi almost around the clock
with artillery and airstrikes. The Islamic guerrillas who
controlled the area left on Jan. 29, but the bombing continued for
three more days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, suddenly, it became calm,'' Sapiyat said. ``And the
troops started mopping up. We thought they would just check
everyone's passports. But it was a cleansing of everything alive.
They killed cattle, dogs, people _ children and old people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Saturday, Feb. 5. Sapiyat said she did not witness what
occurred, because she was hiding in her two-room house, listening
to the shouts and gunfire outside, watching the flames and smoke of
homes burning nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But survivors and other witnesses who gathered afterwards told
the story: A convoy of soldiers, in tanks and armored personnel
carriers, began moving up and down the streets of Aldi, tossing
grenades in cellars where families were hiding, forcing residents
onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   At various stops, they demanded money, gold and other valuables.
Those who resisted were shot. Sometimes those who gave were shot as
well.
</P>
<P>
   On Voronezhskaya Street, three members of the Musayev family,
from 27 to 76 years old, were said to have been shot dead. At least
three more _ a father and two sons _ died on Bryansky Street. At 88
Zemlyansky St., two sons died, only two days after burying their
mother in their yard.
</P>
<P>
   On Second Zemlyansky Pereulok, Yan Sultanovich, onetime
administrator of Aldi, was shot in his yard. On Third Zemlyansky,
Adurahman Tasuyev, 51, and Ziyardi Akhmerzuyev, about 44, were shot
in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   On Mesayev Street, said one survivor interviewed by Human Rights
Watch _ a woman too frightened to be publicly named _ 75-year-old
Akhmed Abulkhonov rushed from his home to volunteer 300 rubles in
tribute. The soldiers threw it in his face, the witness said.
</P>
<P>
   He ran into his house and returned with $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have dollars and you only wanted to give us rubles,'' the
survivor quoted one soldier as saying. By her account, they beat
Abulkhonov and shot him, set his cattle shed afire, then roped his
hysterical daughter, Lucia, to a personnel carrier and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Zina Labazaneva, single and in her early 50s, lived on Mesayev
Street, too, with her brother Husein. Exactly what befell them is
unclear. Sapiyat, several streets away, knows only this much:
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and were standing with our passports outside,''
she said. ``I saw a soldier come; he wasn't a regular, but a
kontraktnik. And then a whole herd came. The soldier shot his gun
around the street'' _ she made a side to side motion _ ``and said,
`Everyone go into your houses.'''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, she said, were very drunk. ``They didn't come into
the houses on the last street. They were probably tired of looting
and killing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midafternoon silence, as survivors collected to exchange
rumors, a woman approached Sapiyat and begged her to come to
Mesayev Street. Her neighbors were dead, she said, and she needed
help in washing a woman's body for burial.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cardinal rule of Islam that no one should go to his
grave unclean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I can't; I'm too afraid,'' Sapiyat said. Two months
earlier, as she helped wash the bodies of two other victims of an
artillery attack, a shell landed nearby, sending shrapnel into the
room and killing another woman. But the woman insisted. Sapiyat
agreed, and her 16-year-old daughter demanded to accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I went to Mesayev Street, and I saw corpses outside,''
she said. ``There was a man whose brains could be seen. There were
a brother and sister killed, and he was an invalid. It was
definitely gunfire. The bullets had gone through them.''
</P>
<P>
   And inside the little brick house where the neighbor took them
lay Labazaneva and her brother. Sapiyat said the woman looked
perhaps five years younger than her age. Her hair was dyed dark,
though tinges of gray showed through. Two rows of automatic rifle
bullets marched across her body, one at her chest, another at the
abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Sapiyat, her daughter and the neighbor undressed the dead woman,
bathed her and wrapped her in a white cloth from the neighbor's
house. Then, she said, Zina Labazaneva and her brother were buried
in their front yard, side by side with Abulkhonov and another man.
</P>
<P>
   They worked two hours. And then Sapiyat and her daughter began
the walk home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the neighbor to run home very quickly, that it was
still dangerous,'' she said. ``We had to go across Voronezhskaya
Street. We saw two armored vehicles on one side, and two tanks on
the other, and so we ran back, looking for places to hide. All the
gates were locked. We found a hole in a wooden fence, and so we got
in and waited in a bathroom for everyone to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, she said, Russian military commanders
rounded up the men in the area, gave them their confiscated
passports and told them to forget that they had ever seen each
other.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Sapiyat left Grozny for good. ``I couldn't bear it
anymore. I had to leave for my children and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouckaert said Human Rights Watch has not yet published its
investigation of the Aldi events or notified the Russian government
of its findings. It was not possible to reach Russian officials for
comment Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir V. Putin named a senior official last week to
investigate complaints of atrocities like the ones alleged at Aldi.
Bouckaert indicated that he is likely to be busy for some time to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are returning to their homes to find their relatives
shot to death all over the city,'' he said. ``What happened in the
last two weeks are the most severe abuses we've seen in the war.
It's as if a sledgehammer was slammed into Grozny after soldiers
took the place.''

   &UR; A Burmese Cruise Far Beyond Mandalay &LR;
</P>
<P>
   East is east and west is west, but for four years they have met
on the Road to Mandalay, a luxury ship sailing the Irrawaddy River
in Myanmar. It has allowed Westerners to explore the exotic land
that many still call Burma, mainly between Mandalay and Bagan to
the south. This August they can sail north to and beyond Bhamo in a
special sailing through the rarely visited Three Narrows area of
the Irrawaddy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Nick Varian, chief executive of Venice
Simplon-Orient Express, operators of the ship, there are about six
weeks after the rainy season when the water is high enough for the
Road to Mandalay to sail north of Bhamo. ``This is a completely
different part of Burma,'' he said, ``untouched for thousands of
years.'' During a test sailing last August he visited villages
whose residents had never seen Westerners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In these northern areas, the Irrawaddy twists and turns through
three sets of narrows less than 100 yards wide between cliffs and
forests. The current gets fast and whirlpools are common. The Road
to Mandalay will not be able to navigate the last set of narrows to
Sinbo, 55 miles north of Bhamo, and passengers will take an
excursion through them on Zodiacs and, perhaps, small local boats,
Varian said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-board amenities include a pool and air-conditioning.
Passengers can choose from a variety of excursions each day _
including one to a camp that trains elephants for logging _ or
explore villages on their own.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This cruise, from Aug. 15 to 26, is limited to 90 passengers
(with a crew of 70) and is close to a sellout, Varian said; if it
sells out, Orient Express may add a second cruise. The cost is
$3,340 to $6,230 a person, double occupancy, plus air fare.
Reservations: (800) 524-2420.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cape Town Scenic Road Closed by Falling Rocks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chapman's Peak Drive, one of the Cape Town area's most
breathtaking routes, will be closed until the end of May. The road
was closed after a motorist was killed by a falling boulder last
month. The coastal road, about six miles long, has become a popular
route for sightseers traveling between Cape Town and Cape Point,
the tip of South Africa. But with lots of loose rock, the hills
that overlook the drive have made it risky, forcing frequent
closings during heavy rain or strong winds. This time rock climbers
have been sent up to remove or secure the boulders thought most
likely to fall.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 80-year-old road was not heavily used until about a
decade ago, when travel on it increased from as few as 800 vehicles
a day to as many as 8,000 now, according to Chris Atkins, the chief
roads engineer for the Cape Metropolitan Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until 1989, there had been no deaths recorded on the road; since
then there have been four involving rocks, including this latest
one, Atkins said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The traditional routes of two of the season's biggest events,
the Cape Argus Pick 'n Pay Cycling Race in March and the Two Oceans
Marathon in April, both include Chapman's Peak Drive, and
organizers of the events have been forced to map out new, more
grueling routes for the thousands of people planning to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ohio Museum Explores Midwestern Identity &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition at the Columbus Museum of Art in Columbus, Ohio,
examines the Midwest through historical works and four newly
commissioned pieces. ``Illusions of Eden: Visions of the American
Heartland,'' continuing through April 30, tries to place past
artists in a contemporary context. Works by 31 painters from the
first half of the 20th century, including Grant Wood, Thomas Hart
Benton and John Steuart Curry, will be on display, along with
photographs by Margaret Bourke-White, Walker Evans and others.
Newly commissioned work by Malcolm Cochran, Maya Lin, Mary Lucier
and Kerry James Marshall forms the contemporary component. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus Museum of Art, 480 East Broad St., is open Tuesday
through Sunday. Admission is $4, free on Thursday evening.

   &UR; A Hotel Group for Branson and Friends &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Branson, who is almost as well known for piloting a
hot-air balloon as he is for founding Virgin Atlantic Airways, is a
man who readily mixes pleasure with business. And when he recently
announced his new hotel collection, Limited Edition by Virgin,
Branson said that it was more about good times than good strategy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It might be shrewd marketing to have hotels in cities served by
the airline, Branson conceded, but ``it's not a lot of fun.''
Instead, the group's five hotels are in places Branson likes and
expects his friends to like: Necker Island, his home in the British
Virgin Islands; Ulusaba Private Game Reserve _ the only new
property in the collection _ near Kruger National Park in South
Africa, with 20 rooms in two lodges; La Residencia, set on 30 acres
in Mallorca, with 63 rooms plus a beach house; the 12th-century
Palazzo Sasso, with 43 rooms in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast in
Italy; and Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, which has 32 rooms on 27
acres in Oxfordshire outside London. Except for Palazzo Sasso,
Branson owns all or part of the hotels. Several were part of an
earlier venture, Virgin Hotels, largely in Britain and Ireland,
most of which were sold last year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Necker Island rents for $14,000 to $27,000 a day, depending on
the number of guests (up to 26), except for two weeks during the
year when couples can reserve rooms for $12,000 a week without
reserving the whole island. Those prices include meals, drinks and
activities such as sailing. The lowest rates are at La Residencia,
beginning at $150 a day and ranging up to $750, including
Continental breakfast. The other properties fall somewhere in
between: Ulusaba is $720 to $1,600 a day per couple, with meals and
activities such as game drives and tennis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information and reservations: Resorts Management at (800)
557-4255 for Necker and Ulusaba, (800) 225-4255 for the other
hotels.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain's high command huddled
conspiratorially in the darkened aisle of his chartered campaign
plane on Sunday night, plotting their latest move to stop Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They fretted that Bush had been scheduled to appear first on
NBC's ``Today'' program on Monday, followed by McCain. No way, they
decided. McCain would go first on the highest rated morning program
_ or defect to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McCain prevailed and appeared on ``Today,'' accusing
Bush supporters of ``calling up little children and telling them
that John McCain is a thief and a liar.'' Bush wound up on ``Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch was a minor triumph for a presidential candidate who
after his whopping win in New Hampshire never had to scrap for
position on the morning programs. Only two weeks ago, his beaming
face was emblazoned on the cover of Time and Newsweek; this week,
it is Bush staring resolutely from both covers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of the primary here on Tuesday, McCain and his
aides are still thunderstruck by their loss to Bush in South
Carolina three days ago _ the first defeat of the senator's
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Inside McCain's famously chatty bus, the afterglow of New
Hampshire is dimming by the day. Despite friendly crowds from
Traverse City to Grand Rapids to here in Saginaw _ and polls that
show the Republican rivals neck and neck in Michigan _ McCain and
his aides were revisiting what might have been. They said that
while they got too mired in tactics in New Hampshire and did not
adequately respond to the governor's onslaught of advertising and
oratory, they are still struggling to grasp what went awry.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his prediction before the South Carolina
primary that a high turnout would assure a win for McCain, John
Weaver, McCain's political director _ who just days ago was being
hailed in the press for his political deftness _ confessed,
`'Obviously, we didn't know what we were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bush's victory was not even close, as polls had
predicted, Rick Davis, the campaign manager, said, ``Everyone ought
to be firing their pollsters.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, McCain refuses to yield, acknowledging that ``we took
a shot to the stomach,'' but reminding audiences that he has
``crashed a few airplanes'' and knows how to recuperate. As he put
it at a packed rally Monday morning in Traverse City, ``I'm telling
you, we're coming back! We're coming back!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of McCain's upbeat talk about primaries next month
in possibly friendly territory, like California and New England _
``I still think this thing will be decided by March 7,'' the
senator told reporters on his bus _ two senior campaign officials
said privately that their hopes of snatching the Republican
nomination would be effectively over if he does not win here.
</P>
<P>
   The big quandary for McCain is how to make up his mind over how
aggressively to respond to the relentless 30-second broadsides from
Bush that started in South Carolina and are continuing here.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in South Carolina fresh from New Hampshire,
McCain announced that unlike Bill Bradley in the Democratic race,
he had no qualms about defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Bradley campaign,'' he said then. ``We will
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   But days later, McCain pulled a commercial questioning Bush's
trustworthiness _ and comparing him to President Clinton _ and he
has essentially ceded the airwaves to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Michigan, McCain has faced the very conundrum Bradley
has in his battle with Vice President Al Gore: If he goes on the
attack, McCain undermines his theme that he is a reformer who will
not stoop to going negative. Yet, by not attacking, McCain allows
Bush to define him.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain has settled on a strategy in which he came out
swinging at Bush at stop after stop in Michigan, saying if Bush is
really a reformer, than ``I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has not dared run television commercials that denounce
Bush, even as the governor is running his own advertisements
pounding McCain's record. It is a somewhat ambivalent approach _
and one that is strikingly reminiscent of the high-minded tone of
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the guy doesn't want to run a negative ad,'' said Greg
Stevens, McCain's media adviser. ``Does it make me a little edgy?
Nervous? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflicting impulses were on display in the senator's
truculent concession speech on Saturday night: He insisted that he
would ``keep fighting clear,'' even as he pounced on Bush _ without
citing him by name _ for a ``negative message of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, questioned aboard his bus, refused to acknowledge that
he had not followed his own counsel to avoid the trap Bradley put
himself in: ``I don't want 20 years from now when my kids are grown
and they're majoring in political science and they pick up a book,
`And so, John McCain, in South Carolina, out of desperation because
he was losing, launched negative attacks on George Bush.'''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse the Bush campaign of dirty, negative
tactics. ``We all know what caused the loss,'' he said. ``I would
never be associated with people and the things that were done in
that race in South Carolina and I'm proud that we had nothing to do
with that kind of campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I probably didn't do as well as I should have or
could have. But do you think that would have made any difference? I
could have invented a cure for cancer and it couldn't have
mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, McCain acknowledged what his advisers
have said bluntly: ``Perhaps I should have defined myself a little
more as far as different positions on issues,'' he said. ``We're
doing more of that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator still harps on how offended he was when Bush held an
event in South Carolina at which a former prisoner of war
questioned whether he had sufficiently fought for veterans. And
Monday, the campaign distributed articles that cited the Bush
operation's under-the-radar efforts to crush him in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At campaign events here, the silver confetti still falls and the
disco music still pounds, but the loss in South Carolina is in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   In East Lansing, at a rally at Michigan State University, John
Schwarz, a state senator, sounded in his warm-up for the challenger
as if he had to justify his endorsement of McCain over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one defector on the Michigan Legislature,'' Schwarz
said. ``I'm  &UR; still  &LR; comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has tried mightily to persuade the press that his
campaign is not sputtering. ``By the way,'' he said on the bus
Sunday, ``small item: Since yesterday, there's an uptick in our
contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about the size of the uptick, McCain said it was ``like
ten or fifteen thousand'' dollars ``from what it was the day
before.'' But more than anything else, the sum underscores how the
dynamic has changed. After New Hampshire _ and before South
Carolina _ the campaign took in roughly $3 million on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also made sure to trumpet the endorsement of Rep. Peter King,
R-N.Y., who defected this week from the Bush camp. But on the eve
of South Carolina, some McCain aides had predicted that a win in
that state would have spurred countless big-name Republicans to
jump as well.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush's newfound potency has clearly addled the McCain camp.
Officials say they are bewildered at polls showing that South
Carolina voters now see the governor as the more genuine reformer.
And they admitted that their merry band of rebels would benefit
from some Republican reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really getting tired of being defended by Bill Press,''
Davis said of the co-moderator on the CNN program, ``Crossfire,'' a
former chairman of the California Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain and his supporters are mindful that the days of an
exciting insurgency hinge on what happens here, now. The senator
cannot for much longer be introduced, he as was in East Lansing, as
``The winner of the New Hampshire primary by a landslide!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he tries not to think too hard about his mistakes or
his prospects, though he quipped that ``I hum `Hail to the Chief' a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he fixes his thoughts on Bush, and what that win in South
Carolina might do for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have gotten some bounce,'' said the senator who had
hoped that bounce would be his. ``But who knows?''

   (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio)  
 HOTELS ARE RUSHING TO OPEN _ SOMETIMES BEFORE THE PAINT IS DRY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27)  
(af) 
 By TERRY TRUCCO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall I spent a night at the W Tuscany, a stylish, newly
refurbished hotel in New York. My room was comfortable, quiet and,
for the most part, smartly renovated. The lobby was another matter.
No one had warned me when I made my reservation that it was still
under construction. The elevators opened near a new front desk
still shrouded in packing wrap.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, the hotel set up a Continental breakfast in an
old sitting room next to the new lobby. As I poured my coffee, buzz
saws screamed and hammers pounded. I fled to my room, appalled but
not particularly surprised.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are buoyant times for the hotel industry, with new
properties opening and old buildings being refurbished at a speedy
pace. But an increasing number of hotels are throwing open their
doors prematurely, taking in guests almost as soon as the ink dries
on the certificate of occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has become almost accepted practice for new hotels to
house guests before a restaurant or health club is complete, in
today's fervid climate it is not unusual to stay in a hotel with a
construction site for a lobby, padded elevators, and hallways
awaiting car-pets.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall I was shown a room at the Belleclaire, a renovated,
moderately priced hotel in New York, that had wires dangling where
the light fixture was supposed to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotels are so anxious to cash in on this boom that they
are being more aggressive about opening than they should,'' said
Chekitan Dev, a professor of marketing at Cornell University's
Hotel School. ``If a hotel stays closed for one more day, it loses
revenues.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With fewer hotels and resorts owned by private individuals and
more by large corporations, the pressure to show returns quickly
has increased. ``If you've already given the analysts a projection
for third-quarter results and it includes that hotel, you're going
to want to make the money, even if it means alienating a few
guests,'' Dev said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel publications can add to the problem. If a hotel receives
a blaze of advance publicity, the management may be tempted to open
it even if not everything is ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The practice, known as a soft opening, of accepting guests
before a hotel is finished isn't new and isn't always a problem.
Soft openings are the hotel equivalent of an out-of-town opening
for a Broadway play, a low-key period when management and staff can
correct mistakes before hundreds of guests arrive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels stage soft openings for insiders, including friends,
members of the management, and travel operators, as knowledgeable
but sympathetic guests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once a hotel opens to the public, the management often limits
the number of guests until things run smoothly. ``Some places even
overstaff during soft openings, because they don't want people to
have a bad experience on their first visit,'' said James Eyster, a
professor emeritus at Cornell University's Hotel School. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more accurate term for the recent rash of soft openings, which
can drag on for months, is under-construction openings. Since most
hotels lower their prices during construction, rooms can be a
bargain. But be sure to ask what services will be missing if you
stay in an unfinished hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what price they give, the property should tell you
up front there are no pros on the tennis court or there's a snack
bar but no restaurant,'' said Doris Schechter, a travel agent at
Valerie Wilson Travel in New York. Or that construction noise will
be starting at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   However you book _ by telephone or over the Internet _ find out
what to expect in the way of service cutbacks. And if a price seems
too good to be true, ask if you'll be rooming next to the guys with
buzz saws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Construction is a complex process that can defy the best of
plans, which is one reason so many hotels are only partly
completed. ``You don't have to slip behind in your construction
schedule very much to have a problem,'' Richard Brush, a dean at
Johnson &AMP; Wales University, said. ``It could be a strike at the
furniture plant in North Carolina or a large building project that
uses up all the steel in the state.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Club Med in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic,
which reopened the week before Christmas after an extensive
six-month renovation. ``We arrived to find huge mud puddles,
dangling electric wires, no stair lights, pathways not lit, dirt
everywhere and trucks creating clouds of dust,'' said Anne Sager of
New York, who had gone to the resort for a weeklong holiday with
her husband, their children and grandchildren from France, and a
son and his fiancee from California. Worse still, there was no
air-conditioning or hot water, and the toilets did not flush.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The resort offered a variety of compensations, including
transfers to other Club Med villages and lodging at another hotel
on the island with shuttle services to the resort for meals and
activities. Full and partial refunds, linked to whether guests
stayed, returned home or moved to another property, were also
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the resort failed to inform guests that the property
wasn't ready, Carole Boucard, a Club Med spokeswoman said: ``There
were last-minute delays that got us off the timetable, but we fully
expected to have things fixed by then.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hotel construction delays also marred a visit to New York for
Alan Hart and his wife from Akron, Ohio. After seeing a newspaper
ad, Hart booked a room at On the Ave, a new boutique hotel in New
York, for $135 a night. After receiving a written confirmation, he
paid for their flights and ordered opera tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before they were to arrive, the Harts received a call
saying that because construction of two floors of the hotel had not
been completed, they could not stay. The caller suggested they stay
at the Habitat, an affiliated but less expensive hotel. Since many
Habitat rooms have shared baths, Hart declined and wound up paying
$320 a night for a room elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say a hotel should offer some compensation to a
guest if it can't honor its agreement to provide a room. ``The
generally accepted practice is to offer a complimentary or upgraded
room for one night at a hotel in your group,'' said Eyster of
Cornell. ``If you have to send the person to a more expensive hotel
outside your company, you pay the difference.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the policy at On the Ave, Ron Simoncini, a spokesman
for the hotel, described Hart's canceled reservation as an
embarrassment, but added that the policy is to provide a free room
at another hotel only if someone with a reservation shows up and
can't be accommodated. ``Part of the reason the prices are so low
right now is because the hotel is under construction,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When is the ideal time to try out a new or renovated hotel?
Schechter says she usually waits six months, especially if she is
sending a client to a resort. Knowing when to open a hotel can, in
fact, be something of an art.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wait for everything to be done, you'll never open,''
said Nancy Polley, a travel agent with Valerie Wilson Travel. ``But
once you open, you had better hop to and get things done.''

 McCAIN HAS STRONG SUPPORT IN HIS HOME STATE  
(See also MCCAIN-MOOD) 
(lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The home-state headquarters of the campaign that John
McCain has called a crusade is a drab stucco office court known as
Camelot Square, and on Monday a hardy core of volunteer knights
errant like Bryan Erion, a 61-year-old Navy veteran, made a last
round of get-out-the-vote calls on the eve of the Arizona primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has represented us in Congress for 17 years, and now we
can show America that we need an Arizonan as president,'' Erion
read over and over again from the script in front of him, even when
the only answer was a machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has made our state proud in this campaign, and now we
need to make him proud by voting on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems little doubt that Arizonans will vote for McCain on
Tuesday. How proud they will make him is another question, since
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has spent considerable effort, and an
estimated $2 million on a television-advertising and direct-mail
blitz, aimed at embarrassing the Arizona senator by keeping him
from winning in the sort of blowout that native sons usually enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Talk radio in Phoenix buzzed on Monday with prognostications
about McCain's likely margin of victory, and what kind of win would
really be a win, and whether he could bounce back from his defeat
in South Carolina, and why his concession speech there had seemed
so sour.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk, too, of the famous McCain temper, and constant
reminders that the state's top Republican office-holder, Gov. Jane
Dee Hull, is backing Bush. In fact, she walked precincts for him on
Saturday, and also made a television advertisement that has been
broadcast heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less a question of Governor Bush getting a win than
Senator McCain avoiding a loss,'' Jay Heiler, a Bush supporter who
was chief of staff to former Gov. Fyfe Symington, said on ``High
Noon,'' a conservative talk show on KTKP-AM.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain does not win by 20 to 25 points, Heiler said, it will
be a blow. ``This is his layup, and if he doesn't make the layup,
he goes back to the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the latest poll by The Arizona Republic found McCain
leading by more than 20 points among registered Republicans, with a
margin of error of three percentage points. Other polls of likely
voters have given the senator an even larger edge, but on Monday
his campaign aides said the outcome depended entirely on turnout,
with a higher turnout being better for them.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in a strong sign of interest, a record number of
absentee ballots have been returned in Maricopa County, which
surrounds Phoenix, and some experts estimate that overall turnout
could reach 50 percent, up from the typical 35 percent in a
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta win the delegates, gotta win the delegates, gotta spend
no money, got it?'' said Wes Gullett, a McCain aide, summing up the
campaign's goal here, where even a one-point victory gives the
winner all 30 of the state's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a big turnout, we'll do well. A win is a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some polls last fall actually showed Bush with a slight
edge here, and although Steve Forbes, who carried the state four
years ago, had a large staff on the ground before dropping out, the
Arizona contest has never loomed as a particularly significant test
this year, precisely because of McCain's favorite-son status.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made no recent visit to the state, and even McCain was
not due to arrive until late Monday evening from Michigan for a
final rally at the University of Arizona in Tucson, before voting
Tuesday morning in Phoenix. The only visible signs of an election
were the small McCain signs studding the occasional front yard, and
Bush's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advertisements have been on the air since December, but
McCain could afford only about $200,000 in radio advertisements
appealing to Arizonans' state pride, Gullett said, noting that he
had received five pieces of targeted mail from the Bush campaign in
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to South Carolina, where a variety of interest
groups ran independent advertising campaigns aimed at supporting
Bush, no such ads have run here, McCain aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Merrill, a pollster and political science professor at
Arizona State University in Tempe, said the Bush campaign appeared
to be purely an effort to show its financial strength and
establishment support.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were them, I'd take the money and go some place where it
could really help them,'' Merrill said. ``If McCain loses in
Michigan, he's done. I think he's done already, frankly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic, with whom McCain has long had an
adversarial relationship, in sharp contrast to his smooth sailing
with much of the national press this year, declined to endorse him,
or Bush, in an editorial on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to some reservations on domestic policy, we fear
that McCain's approach to politics doesn't fit the need or
temperament of the times,'' the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain too frequently is dismissive of those who disagree with
him, and their reasons for that disagreement. We believe, for
example, that there is much to dislike about the current system of
financing campaigns. But we also believe that First Amendment
concerns are more than an irritant, or a ruse, as McCain treats
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial went on: ``McCain's political style is not that of
persuasion; too often, it's the politics of brow-beating,
confrontation and intimidation. It's no accident that only four of
his Senate colleagues support his candidacy, and this is for
reasons that go well beyond McCain's calls for campaign-finance
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no telling that to volunteers like Erion, who
worked the McCain phone banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an American,'' Erion said simply. ``I think the best way
to describe John is like the movie `Saving Private Ryan.' You
remember where the guy says, `Earn this.' Well, John McCain did
earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   When voters had questions about McCain's record on education or
other subjects, Erion would turn them over to a staff member, like
Bettina Nava.
</P>
<P>
   ``And did you find out where your voting location is?'' Ms. Nava
asked one woman, before hanging up the phone and telling Erion: ``I
think she's persuaded. She's tired of the mudslinging.''

CLINTON TO ORDER ALL HOSPITALS TO REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will order all hospitals in the
United States to take steps to reduce medical errors that kill tens
of thousands of people each year, and he will support mandatory
reporting of all such errors, administration officials said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Tuesday, Clinton plans to call for a
nationwide system of reporting medical errors, somewhat like the
system used by airlines to report aviation safety hazards, the
officials said. Rather than imposing a federal requirement now, he
is pressuring the states to adopt reporting requirements within
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and the American Hospital
Association have vehemently opposed mandatory reporting of errors,
saying it could expose doctors and hospitals to more lawsuits. If
doctors and hospital employees fear being sued, they said, they
will be reluctant to discuss the lessons that could be learned from
their mistakes. Even Clinton's own advisers had suggested that the
administration move cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   But aides said Clinton would endorse virtually all the
recommendations made three months ago by the National Academy of
Sciences in a report on medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they said, Clinton will endorse the academy's goal
of reducing medical mistakes by 50 percent over five years. He will
also ask Congress for $20 million to create a Center for Quality
Improvement and Patient Safety, as part of the federal Agency for
Health Care Research and Quality, in the Department of Health and
Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the president's recommendations require
congressional approval, he already has ample authority under
existing laws to require other steps.
</P>
<P>
   For example, officials said, the federal government is
developing a regulation to require more than 6,000 hospitals that
participate in Medicare to have programs to reduce medical errors.
Under the regulation, to be published this year, hospitals would,
in most cases, have to establish automated systems for ordering
prescription drugs, to avoid the mistakes caused by a doctor's bad
handwriting or by confusion over telephone orders.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals must meet federal standards as a condition of getting
Medicare money, which accounts for about 40 percent of hospital
revenue, on the average. Using this lever, the federal government
sets detailed standards covering every aspect of hospital activity,
from sanitation to fire safety to infection control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals, or something similar, seem likely to become
reality for four reasons. The issue has great appeal to consumers,
and this is an election year. The government already has the power
to do much of what Clinton wants. Congress is eager to take action.
And lawmakers have a convenient vehicle, the patients' bill of
rights, now pending before a conference committee of House and
Senate negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   White House documents say the Food and Drug Administration will
develop new standards to prevent errors caused by drug names that
sound alike and packages that look alike. In addition, new labeling
standards will require drug makers to highlight dangerous drug
interactions and common dosage errors.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is also developing a system to allow doctors, nurses and
pharmacists to report medication errors online.
</P>
<P>
   All 500 military hospitals and clinics and more than 3,000 blood
banks will have to report serious errors under the president's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the most controversial element of the president's plan is
his support for mandatory reporting to the states of all medical
errors that cause serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals reporting errors would be publicly identified. The
names of doctors, nurses and patients would be kept confidential.
But doctors and hospitals said that such details could often be
inferred and that even the public reports could be used to
strengthen the hand of plaintiffs' lawyers in malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president, like the National Academy of
Sciences, will call for voluntary reporting of less serious errors,
including close calls, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House struggled to find the right balance between
mandatory and voluntary reporting, between secrecy and disclosure.
In interviews last month, federal health officials said they were
unwilling to embrace the academy's call for a new federal law
requiring hospitals to report all mistakes that cause serious
injury or death. Despite such concerns, Clinton decided to support
mandatory reporting.
</P>
<P>
   White House documents show that Clinton will announce three
basic conclusions on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients should have access to information about ``preventable
medical errors'' that cause serious injuries. If a person dies
because of such a mistake, the patient's relatives should be able
to get information about the error.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress should pass legislation to prevent patients and their
lawyers from gaining access to a hospital's analysis and
investigation of the causes of medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients should not lose any of the rights they now have to
sue doctors and hospitals for malpractice or negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said: ``These actions will significantly reduce the
likelihood of lawsuits and concerns about liability. We will avoid
errors and problems that might be subject to litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiative leaves some important questions
unanswered: What is the definition of a serious medical error? What
is the federal role in the proposed new reporting system? Will
states get additional money to catalog and analyze reports of
errors?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, former president
of the American Medical Association, said: ``We are opposed to
mandatory reporting. It may well drive underground the very
information you need to improve safety. A number of states have
mandatory reporting, and there's no evidence that they have greater
safety or fewer errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Davidson, president of the American Hospital
Association, said his group had been invited to the White House
event but would not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had an agreement to work with the White House in
a public-private partnership, but there has been little or no
consultation,'' Davidson said. ``That's a serious disappointment.
The idea that a mandatory reporting system is going to change
behavior is naive at best. You need to focus on making a cultural
change in hospitals, to promote open discussion of errors, and
that's not possible if some plaintiff's attorney is climbing on
your back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that 18 states already required hospitals
to report certain kinds of mistakes and ``adverse events.''
However, in many states, the number of reports is relatively small,
because doctors and hospitals fear the data will be used in
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's goal is to ensure that ``all 50 states have
mandatory reporting systems'' within three years, the White House
said. If that does not happen, federal health officials will offer
further recommendations on what should be done to achieve the goal.
And if research shows that mandatory reporting does not enhance
patient safety, the White House said, federal officials will
reconsider their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the National Academy of Sciences last November
touched off a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill. Members of
Congress from both parties _ led by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, both Democrats _ have held a half-dozen hearings and
drafted several bills to reduce medical errors. Lawmakers say that
passage of legislation this year appears likely.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the academy's Institute of Medicine said that
medical errors caused 44,000 to 98,000 deaths a year _ more than
the number resulting from auto accidents, breast cancer or AIDS,
and far more than the numbers killed or injured in plane crashes
each year. More than 7,000 Americans die each year as a result of
``medication errors,'' the academy said.  &QL;

 &HT;    Cross-over and GOP votes a must for McCain to win Michigan
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Voters in Michigan and Arizona get their turn today to
decide whether the Republican nomination race ends early or keeps
rolling toward the March 7 primary when 11 other states vote.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John
McCain in a virtual tie in Michigan, which divides its 58
convention delegates by percentage, with 10 going to the overall
winner, and 3 to the winner in each of 16 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, where the overall winner takes all 30 delegates,
McCain's supporters are hoping for a double-digit victory
comparable to his lead in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   His Arizona advantage makes it likely McCain will add to the 16
delegates hehas picked up, compared to 69 for Bush after his solid
victory in South Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But unless he can regain his momentum with a convincing showing
in Michigan, prospects for a McCain insurgency will rapidly begin
to dim.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the final polls before the New Hampshire and South
Carolina primaries have accurately named the winners but
significantly underestimated the margin of both McCain's win in New
Hampshire and Bush's victory in South Carolina. Republican pollster
Whit Ayres says that's because late-deciders moved strongly in the
direction of the winner.
</P>
<P>
   That could be good news for Bush, if he gets a boost from South
Carolina. The polls show the GOP front-runner, who stepped up his
ad campaign in Michigan, has been regaining the support he lost to
McCain in Michigan after his New Hampshire loss.
</P>
<P>
   In a Zogby poll conducted in Michigan after the South Carolina
primary, McCain led by 43 percent to 41 percent. In a Detroit News
poll conducted before the South Carolina primary, McCain's lead was
40 percent to 38 percent. Both polls had results within their
margins of error, amounting to a statistical tie, and showed
McCain's lead narrowing from earlier polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has turned up the heat after his scathing nonconcession
speech Saturday night, accusing Bush on the stump in Michigan of
``trash'' campaigning and ``character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McCain picked up the endorsement of a former Bush
supporter, U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York. King criticized the
Texas governor for speaking at Bob Jones University, a South
Carolina fundamentalist school that King accused of ``anti-Catholic
bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has appealed to independents and Democrats, McCain
has to hope he picks up the support ofrank-and-file Michigan
Republicans as well.
</P>
<P>
   In both contested primaries so far, McCain has done well among
independents and Democrats. The key difference is that in New
Hampshire, he also won a narrow majority of Republicans, while Bush
led heavily among GOP voters in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   What the two results suggest is that while outside votes can add
to the margin in a GOP primary, the most dependable, and essential,
votes are those cast by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That factor favors Bush in Michigan if Gov. John Engler can
deliver the party faithful like former Gov. Carroll Campbell did
for Bush in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Michigan campaign has taken the unusual step of mailing
cards to independents and Democrats assuring them they have the
right to vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain disavowed Sunday a call by the Rev. E.L. Branch,
minister at Detroit's Third New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, to
vote for McCain as a means to send a message to Engler. The
governor has angered black leaders in Detroit by moving to
eliminate independent school boards, end public assistance for
single adults and end the requirement that municipal workers live
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his drive for the GOP nomination alive, McCain has to
win the votes of Republicans who do not automatically reject him
over abortion or taxes and who are willing to listen to a message
that challenges the orthodoxy of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's voters have a reputation for boosting maverick
candidates throughout the political spectrum _ from McCain's hero,
Teddy Roosevelt, in 1912, to Ross Perot in 1992. George Wallace,
Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson have all run strong races in
Michigan. McCain has to hope the tradition holds for him.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials in Michigan and Arizona were predicting heavy
turnouts, indicating the interest level in this struggle remains
high. After a record turnout resulted in a big Bush victory in
South Carolina, there aren't many confident predictions about who
that will help.

<P>
   Q. Many amateur musicians may know of the French town of
Mirecourt, which is noted for cello-making and is also near the
Alsatian Wine Road. We wanted guidance on visiting both the Wine
Road and a maker of string instruments as well as on seeing the
sights, attending festivals and finding a place to stay. _Betty and
Tom Cox, Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   A. Over the years, Mirecourt attracted not only artisans who
made string instruments but lace makers as well. The town, in the
departement of Vosges, is 25 miles south of Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Mirecourt began developing as a center for the makers of
stringed instruments (not just cellos) in the late 18th century.
With the founding of conservatories at that time, there grew a need
for more and cheaper ``factory fiddles,'' in the words of The New
Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments. The best known of the
violin makers from Mirecourt was probably Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume,
who went on to set up shop in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   String instruments are still being produced in Mirecourt. Of the
dozen makers, several can be visited by appointment. Among them are
Jean-Jacques Pages, 70, rue Chanzy, telephone (33-3) 29.37.11.33,
and Alain Carbonare, 22, rue Georges Clemenceau, (33-3)
29.37.41.78.
</P>
<P>
   A museum for string instruments, the Musee de la Lutherie, is
currently housed in the Town Hall and will be transferred on April
30 to the halles, where the market stood.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of women were engaged
in bobbin-lace making, a technique that requires plaiting, twisting
and interweaving the threads. Today, only two lace makers are left
in town; both are full-time employees of the Maison de la Dentelle,
1 bis, rue Chantaire; telephone and fax: (33-3) 29.37.3959. But
over 100 local residents who make lace as a hobby visit the maison
regularly and make small doilies. The maison is open daily from May
1 to Sept. 30 and closed Saturday during the rest of the year. More
information: Mirecourt Tourist Office, telephone (33-3)
29.37.01.01, fax (33-3) 29.37.52.24.
</P>
<P>
   There is no particularly noteworthy hotel in Mirecourt. The
closest town of some importance is Epinal, 21 miles to the
southeast. The nicest hotel there is La Fayette, where the rate is
about $70 for a double room; (33-3) 29.81.15.15, fax (33-3)
29.31.07.08. Epinal also has a restaurant, with one star in the
Michelin guide, called Relais des Ducs de Lorraine; (33-3)
29.34.39.87, fax (33-3) 29.34.27.61.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the Wine Route (Route des Vins d'Alsace) from Epinal,
drive east 57 miles through St-Die, over the Vosges Mountains and
into Ribeauville or Riquewihr, two villages famed for their wines.
The villages have a Web site, www.ribeauville-riquewihr.com, that
includes a list of hotels. Officially, the 106-mile route _ which
actually comprises several roads _ runs from Marienheim south to
Thann. But the map shows it extends a bit farther north (to
Gimbrett) and south (to Leimbach). The Wine Route has a site, 
www.vinsalsace.com/rte(underscore)des(underscore)vins(underscore)uk.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia and the United States are in a drawn-out
dispute over a powerful American-made radar in Norway that can
track missile launchings in western Russia, according to American
and Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The radar began quietly operating last summer as a joint
U.S.-Norwegian intelligence project at Vardo, just 40 miles from
the Russian border. It has been the subject of talks between
Washington and Moscow ever since its assembly began a year and a
half ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from intelligence concerns, Russians have objected that
the radar, which was previously used in the United States for
research into anti-missile defenses, could be linked to a proposed
new system to defend American territory against limited nuclear
missiles attacks. The Clinton administration has insisted that it
wants the system to guard against countries like North Korea, not
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials discussed the installation of the new radar, which has
not been widely noted outside Norway, in response to questions
about articles that will be published on Tuesday in the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists. Articles by a Norwegian journalist and an
American scientist describe the radar's capacities and raise
questions about its purpose. The radar, known by the code name Have
Stare, was built in the United States and initially used in 1995 at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in several early tests of the
national missile defense system, according to Pentagon officials.
Eventually it was dismantled and shipped to Norway, where it was
renamed Globus II, the successor to an intelligence radar operated
during the Cold War by Norway and the United States to monitor
Soviet missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   While Norway and the United States say the primary purpose of
the new radar is to monitor space debris, Russia has raised
concerns that it will track and gather intelligence on missiles
launched from bases in western Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military believes that the Norwegian radar is
meant to monitor their ballistic missiles and that the radar was
developed as part of the national missile defense,'' said Anatoly
Diakov, director of the Center for Arms Control at the Moscow
Institute of Physics and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new radar at Vardo can collect detailed radar images of
Russian warheads and decoys, providing the United States with a
very precise ``radar fingerprint'' using the same radar frequencies
as the proposed national missile defense system, according to
Theodore Postol, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and author of one of the articles in the Bulletin, a
nonprofit publication that specializes in nuclear arms control and
has often been critical of missile defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vardo radar can provide critical information for a
national missile defense system aimed specifically at Russia,''
Postol writes.
</P>
<P>
   Since last January the Clinton administration has been pressing
the Russian government to modify the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile
Treaty signed between Moscow and Washington that prohibits either
country from building a system to protect their entire countries
from a missile attack. President Clinton has set a self-imposed
deadline to decide this summer whether to build a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   While early warning radar stations in Greenland and Britain
would be upgraded and used in such a system, administration
officials denied that the Norway radar was ever intended to be part
of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and the United States have discussed this Globus II
radar on a number of occasions over the last 18 months up to the
assistant secretary level,'' said Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon
spokesman, who refused to say whether the radar was collecting
intelligence on Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that the operation of the Vardo radar ``does not
violate either the letter or the spirit of the Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union built a radar in the 1980s at Krasnoyarsk,
Siberia, to fill a gap in its radar coverage, the United States
argued that it was a violation of the 1972 treaty and persuaded the
Russians to dismantle it.
</P>
<P>
   But during negotiations last October, the United States offered
to help Russia complete a large missile tracking radar if it agreed
to modify the ABM treaty, long considered the bedrock of all arms
control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   As currently envisioned, the missile defense system would
involve building a powerful new radar in Alaska and deploying up to
100 anti-missile interceptors there.
</P>
<P>
   The Vardo radar's initial use to track missiles in national
missile defense tests was first disclosed in the Norwegian
newspaper Bergens Tidende by Inge Sellevag, a journalist who is the
other author writing in the Bulletin this week.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Norwegian government had said the radar would
track space debris, an assertion questioned by Postol. He contended
that space debris is best monitored by radar built near the
equator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious to any technically informed person that this
claim is simply another misrepresentation,'' Postol wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian and Clinton administration officials have said that
the radar is ``under full Norwegian control'' and used for
Norwegian national security. But the radar is directly linked to
the U.S. Air Force's defense center at Cheyenne Mountain, Colo.,
which receives the data gathered and processed at Vardo, according
to Postol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radar appears to be doing things that makes it look as if
the defense system is aimed at Russia,'' said Postol, who admitted
that this ``is a very gray area.''

<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Ken Griffey Jr. desperately wants to fit in
with the Cincinnati Reds. He wants to amble into the clubhouse in
blue jeans, a blue T-Shirt, sneakers and gold earring, as he did
Monday, play center field for the team he cherished as a boy and be
as anonymous as a utility infielder. Good luck on that last one,
Junior.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey maneuvered his black Mercedes-Benz CLK-60 with the
license plate ``Wickid 1'' past 100 fans and into Ed Smith Stadium
at about 9 o'clock Monday morning. He tried to move inconspicuously
as dozens of reporters trailed every step as if it might be his
last. And when he entered a crowded clubhouse that was foreign to
him, the best player in baseball was fidgeting.
</P>
<P>
   As Griffey glanced at the names on the lockers, he looked like a
stranded commuter staring at an unkind airport flight schedule. He
stared, squinted and searched for a friendly face. But Griffey was
soon at home because he found the two corner lockers the Reds had
assigned to him, an obvious nod to his superstardom, and he found a
weighted bat that he swung to calm himself. Finally, he exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Griffey said later, describing a scene of 150 members
of the news media poised in front of him, ``is not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was normal for a relocation of this magnitude. As
Griffey sat in a folding chair on top of the first-base dugout, the
same dugout where Michael Jordan held a news conference six years
ago when he tried a crossover dribble from basketball to baseball,
the setting seemed normal. The dugout as makeshift stage seemed
liked the perfect place to reintroduce Griffey to the world as a
Red after the four-for-one trade with the Seattle Mariners on Feb.
10 and his signing of a nine-year, $116.5-million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unique, though, to be able to bring the Michael
Jordan of baseball home where he was raised in Cincinnati,'' said
Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, who tried to minimize how
the contract favors the Reds. ``I think he'll not only pay for
himself, I think we'll probably make more than that over the term
of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously and rightfully, the Reds, who had to set up 10 new
telephone lines in their busier ticket offices, are giddy about
Griffey, and vice versa. While Griffey reiterated how excited he
was, he also explained that it was not his personality to show much
excitement unless ``I'm sliding into home against the Yankees'' in
the 1995 division series.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey, who talked so softly that a club official asked him
to move the microphone closer to his mouth, was tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nervous? No, my leg's not shaking,'' said Griffey, who caused
everyone to laugh because, indeed, his right foot was shaking.
``Yeah, I'm nervous. I want to go out and play. There were some
things written and said about me that were not true. I just want to
go out there and make people forget about it by playing.''
</P>
<P>
   That has always been Griffey's strongest argument to anything.
He has been called petulant and he has been called moody, but
Griffey has always played hard and he has always been an incredible
joy to watch. Now Griffey _ 10-time All-Star, 10-time Gold Glove
winner, member of the All-Century team and the favorite to eclipse
Hank Aaron's career home run record _ is on the team his father
used to play for, currently coaches and will probably eventually
manage.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Griffey wore his Reds uniform for a photo shoot
for a baseball card company, the first time he had worn it since he
played in a father-son game as an 8-year old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairy tale ending,'' said Deion Sanders, a colorful
two-sport athlete who is trying to come back in baseball and who
was obscured by Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it might be a fairy tale. Griffey would not specify
which details of the trade saga bothered him, but he bristled when
asked about the perception that he held Seattle hostage by only
agreeing to be dealt to the Reds. Griffey's rights as a 10-year
veteran who had played the last five years with his current team
allowed him to veto any deal, which he did in a possible trade to
the Mets and which ruined the Mariners' chances of getting equal
value for him.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey claimed that Seattle didn't have to trade him, but even
Bowden said: ``We had the leverage. We had the cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden haughtily began Griffey's news conference by saying,
``Baseball is back in Cincinnati,'' which might not have sit well
with Jack McKeon, who managed the team to 96 victories last year
and who was sitting beside Bowden. Pokey Reese wondered if he
should bow to Griffey. Sean Casey recalled how he stole Griffey's
1989 rookie baseball card from a store as a 13-year old, was caught
and harshly scolded by his father. Barry Larkin, the Reds' captain
who said Griffey usually returns phone calls 72 hours late, knew
the deal was inching closer when Griffey constantly called him.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader in a harmonious clubhouse, Larkin will be an
important link for Junior and there is already a tight bond. Both
Larkin and Griffey played at Moeller High School in Cincinnati,
both now live in Orlando, Fla., and Larkin quickly started
Griffey's initiation Monday by shouting ``Hey, Junior, you're on
TV,'' when the well-known face flashed across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never had a situation where this clubhouse is
dysfunctional,'' Larkin said. ``We've had superstars with strong
personalities come in here before and it's worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but there is only one Junior and there is only one Senior
waiting for the manager's position. Griffey impressed his teammates
by deferring $57.5 of the $116.5 million and coming to Cincinnati
for roughly half of his market value. Other players will surpass
his total salary, but that did not matter to the newest Red who
will try in vain to be just another Red.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they pay a light bill at my house,'' said Griffey, about
the salaries of players in the future, ``then I'll worry about what
they make.''

CUSTODY CASE OF CUBAN BOY CHANGES HANDS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A hearing scheduled for Tuesday to determine whether a
federal court has jurisdiction in the Elian Gonzalez custody case
was expected to be postponed, because the judge handling it was
admitted to a hospital on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be temporarily turned over to Judge Edward B.
Burns of Federal District Court here and he will preside over the
hearing on Tuesday. Burns is likely to focus on reassigning the
case by a random computer selection and scheduling further
hearings, officials in his chambers said today.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William M. Hoeveler had planned to hear arguments on
Tuesday to decide whether the court could intervene in the case of
6-year-old Elian, who was found clinging to an inner tube in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The child is at the center of an international fight between his
father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and relatives in Miami. Last
month, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ordered the
return of the boy to his father, but relatives took the case to
court to block the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exactly sure what will happen tomorrow,'' said Roger
Bernstein, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, including Lazaro
Gonzalez, a great-uncle who is caring for Elian. ``But we've been
told that we should be prepared to argue tomorrow so we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development Monday, Manuel Gonzalez, another of
Elian's great-uncles, told reporters he was also seeking temporary
custody of the boy. His lawyer, Jeffery Leving, said Gonzalez had
filed a petition to intervene in federal court on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy's father is the only person who is allowed to speak
for Elian, and he has asked that Elian stay with Manuel until he
can be returned to Cuba,'' Leving said. ``I think the court should
honor and respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who has maintained a low profile throughout the
custody battle, is in disagreement with the other Miami relatives,
including his brother Lazaro.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly meeting with Lazaro Monday afternoon and speaking
to reporters, Manuel complained of chest pains and was taken to a
nearby hospital. A hospital spokesman said he was in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler, 77, was admitted to a hospital in a Miami suburb on
Sunday morning, after being unable to move his right arm and leg
and having slurred speech. He was in serious condition in the
intensive care unit on Sunday, a hospital official said, adding
that he was in stable condition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler's illness is likely to mean the case will be assigned
to a new judge for the third time. At first, a court computer had
assigned Judge James Lawrence King the case, but he recused himself
because of possible conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The case was then turned over to Hoeveler, who is well known
around the Miami community for presiding over the trial of
Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.

KNICKS TRIUMPH OVER CLIPPERS, 87-76

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One after another, the spindly stars of the league
came floating into town this past week with helium in their moves
and a first razor in their pockets. But as the exciting neophytes
rounded the corner on their dream paths to glory at the Madison
Square Garden, they found a crafty former All-Star clogging their
way like a Winnebago in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been able to get around Larry Johnson all week. Not
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, not Indiana's Jalen Rose, and on Monday
not the Los Angeles Clippers' Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Larry Johnson completed a trifecta.
</P>
<P>
   If the Queens-born Odom had envisioned a homecoming filled with
dramatic points and fancy passes, he found reality the moment
Johnson stuck his Popeye-sized chest on the rookie and nudged him
out of his comfort zone during the Knicks' 87-76 victory against
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   All Odom had for his effort was 14 points and a technical foul
for his frustration. He was not expecting this.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Odom scored 24 points against a Knicks team patched
together without an injured Johnson, Marcus Camby and Patrick
Ewing. In November, Odom's face was beaming from the 100 watts of
joy he had after the Clippers left the Knicks miserable in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Johnson was healthy. And everything was different
except for the Knicks' habit of turning blowouts into cliffhangers.
After building a 19-point, fourth-quarter lead with the omnipresent
Latrell Sprewell slipping into the tough-man role of Charlie Ward,
the Knicks relaxed on a few possessions.
</P>
<P>
   That was all it took. Three consecutive 3-pointers, and the
Clippers were on their way to a 14-2 run and had cut the Knicks'
lead to 4 points with 2 minutes 25 seconds left in the game. Fear
stricken, the Knicks tightened up their defense and ended the game
on a 7-0 run. Disaster avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting a lot of knocks about taking nights off,''
said Patrick Ewing (15 points, 12 rebounds), who came up with a key
block on Maurice Taylor in the final minute on a play that could
have cut the Knicks' lead to 3 points. ``They cut into our lead,
but we were able to keep our composure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was actually the calm hand that guided them. Thriving
in the big backcourt lineup with Allan Houston (24 points), he had
9 assists to go with 16 points and 7 rebounds. For a player who is
not usually awake for early games, Sprewell was alert enough to
jump in front of two oncoming Clippers in the first half and draw
two charging calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to catch Charlie,'' said Sprewell, who has taken 11
charges this season to Ward's 19. ``He's out with an injury right
now, so maybe I can catch him. He's our hustle player. I'm just
trying to help fill that void.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is pitching in for the injured Camby. He is not as tall
and lively or a shot-blocking threat, but Johnson stopped Odom his
way on Monday. Almost every time Odom tried to slip into position
for a pass, Johnson was there to deny him. Almost every time the
6-foot-10-inch, 220-pound Odom tried to work his way inside for a
layup, the 6-7, 235-pound Johnson was there to dare him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those younger guys have to put some muscle on them,''
Johnson said. ``But I like his skills. I really do. He can play a
lot of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has stopped three versatile forwards just like Odom over
the last week during the Knicks' three-game winning streak, a surge
that has the team tied with the Miami Heat for first place in the
Atlantic Division. Johnson held Garnett to 5-of-17 shooting and 23
points, and Rose to 5 of 13 and 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kevin, I tried to use my strengths to combat his
weaknesses because he's 6-foot-11 and he can definitely shoot over
me,'' Johnson said. ``I was trying to push him off the box. Rose
and Odom are definitely quicker than I am. I am trying to body them
up and get them out of position. Sometimes I win; sometimes I
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Just his transformation from go-to man with the Charlotte
Hornets during his All-Star days to defensive stopper for a team
already decorated with superstars is part of Johnson's unselfish
evolution, a metamorphosis that began the day he arrived in New
York in a trade for Anthony Mason almost four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was traded for Mase, it was: Can you play defense like
he does?'' Johnson said. ``Maybe I'm a little biased, but I thought
I could always play defense.''

CLINTON PARDONS PROFESSOR WHO WANTED TO BE CALLED `MISTER' 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton granted a pardon Monday to a
63-year-old political scientist who went into self-imposed exile
almost four decades ago after his draft board in Georgia, learning
that he was black, refused to address him as ``mister.''
</P>
<P>
   The pardon for Preston King, a professor at the University of
Lancaster in Britain, overturns his 1961 conviction for draft
evasion and allows him to return to the United States for the
funeral of his oldest brother later this week.
</P>
<P>
   King had said at the time of his conviction that he was willing
to report for an Army physical and serve in the military so long as
the draft board in Albany, Ga., referred to him as ``Mr. King''
instead of ``Preston.''
</P>
<P>
   The board, which had used ``mister'' in earlier correspondence
to King but stopped after its members learned of his skin color,
refused. King was convicted of draft evasion by an all-white jury
and sentenced to 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who had recently called for a pardon was the trial
judge in the case, William A. Bootle of federal District Court in
Macon, Ga. In a letter to President Clinton last year, Bottle, now
in his 90s, said that King had ``followed his conscience just as
Rosa Parks had followed hers.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said Clinton had
``considered the facts, the law and all the circumstances involved
here and decided that clemency was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said theHouse had a policy of not discussing the
details of the president's reasoning in clemency cases but that the
decision-making process was speeded up for King ``because of
humanitarian concern,'' given his brother's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preston King was one of the first people who stood up against
government discrimination,'' said one of his lawyers, Elizabeth
Holtzman, the former Democratic congresswoman and Brooklyn district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was denied an extension of his draft deferment because of
his race,'' she said in an interview. ``He was addressed in a
demeaning fashion because of his race. He was convicted by a
totally segregated jury. In a way, this case reflects not just
Preston King coming home, but this country coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that King, who was traveling Monday night to London
from his home in Lancaster and was not available for an interview,
would return to the United States on Wednesday, for the first time
in 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clennon L. King, a television journalist in Jacksonville, Fla.
who is a nephew of King, said that the family was ``thrilled'' by
news of the pardon ``although these are very sober circumstances
because of the death of his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   King's oldest brother, also named Clennon, a prominent civil
rights leader who was committed to an insane asylum for a time
because he had the temerity to try to enroll at the all-white
University of Mississippi in the 1950s, died last week at the age
of 79. He will be buried on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Preston King graduated magna cum laude from all-black Fisk
University in Nashville in 1956 and received a deferment from
military service that allowed him to study for a master's degree at
the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that the draft board refused additional deferments
and began to refer to him simply as ``Preston'' in letters,
dropping the ``mister,'' which was routine for white students, when
he appeared in person at their offices in 1958 and the board's
members realized for the first time that he was black.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the White House, Bootle said that King ``has
paid a big price'' and that ``to lock him up today would amount to
overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   While he insisted that the trial had been ``error-free,'' the
judge suggested that King was right, in fact, heroic, to stand up
to the draft board and insist that he be addressed as ``mister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. King was deeply sensitive to what he recognized as this
long-lasting, deeply rooted method of racial discrimination,'' the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Bootle noted that a new federal courthouse in Albany, Ga., is
being named for another of King's brothers C.B. King, a prominent
civil rights lawyer. ``If Mr. King can be allowed to attend the
dedication of this building,'' the letter said, ``many of us who
are familiar with the facts will be comfortable and happy that this
little tragedy has ended.''

OFFHAND AND FRESH, PRADA BREEZES IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CATHY HORYN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ So many Prada bags, so many fabulous pairs of
Prada shoes, still gleaming with tissue-paper goodness, bowling
ball-size bags, purple ostrich-skin bags, golden tan, deep magenta
and navy-piped-in-white bags were lined up at the feet of front-row
editors at the Versus show, and it was only Sunday. Six shopping
days left.
</P>
<P>
   What can it mean to any designer who isn't Miuccia Prada to look
down that big runway through a tiny peephole in the back and see _
drat! _ all those magazine editors and newspaper columnists waiting
with their latest Prada accessories like spiffed-up Iowa teen-agers
beaming over prize heifers? The video cameras will record them.
There will have to be judicious cropping if one is to avoid seeing
an editor's bubble-toe Prada shoe popping into a photo of a
candy-bright Versus dress.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote has been cast. Here in Milan, the personal
preferences of the international journalists and retailers
attending the Italian fall 2000 collections can go a long way in
influencing public tastes.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems that, for now, the object of their collective
desire is not a cozy, over-the-shoulder Fendi pouch or even the
mother of them all, a Hermes Kelly sac. It is a large,
half-moon-shape leather bag with clutch handles, which, if you
didn't know any better or catch the Prada label, looks as if you're
trampling off to the Bowl-a-Rama.
</P>
<P>
   This is a curious time in Milan, hilarious even, and hilarious
has never been a word anyone would use to describe the Milanese,
whose chic-to-a-fault tastes make them nothing if not predictable.
But whether because of the economy, a boom in Internet and wireless
ventures, or just boredom with the old status symbols, a new
attitude is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the streets were thronged with shoppers, much more
so than in recent years, and they were buying things like fuchsia
snakeskin shoes, rhinestone-covered belts, rimless rose-tinted
sunglasses _ bags of stuff that would have been too horribly gauche
to consider before. ``All of a sudden, you see Milanese wearing
things that only fashion people would have worn,'' said Angela
Missoni, who designs a family knitwear line. ``They want something
that looks rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Gabbana agreed, saying before the show of the D&AMP;G line,
on Sunday: ``This is a conservative city. It is really Armani,
Milano. But I am even surprised myself what's happening. We did
these wide, jeweled belts for spring, and if we had made them look
less expensive or crazy, they wouldn't be selling.''
</P>
<P>
   So, on the one hand you have this rich old city and on the other
an infusion of new taste. Added to this is the excitement created
by the success of the Italian boat Luna Rossa, owned by Prada, in
the America's Cup, which is being televised nightly between 2 and 4
a.m. ``Every morning, you see these Italian executives with bags
under their eyes,'' said Pierfilippo Pieri, a Milan fashion
publicist. ``Life here is camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the speed with which fashion changes also means that nobody
wants to get stuck with last year's prize heifer, so to speak. As
someone who understands camp, who is herself a kind of camp queen,
Donatella Versace might naturally be expected to have some fun with
Versus, her secondary line.
</P>
<P>
   But the collection she sent out Sunday evening was almost
demure, in the ladylike groove she started last season, with fitted
blazers over creased trousers, slinky dresses and silk tops in
patterns that suggested an oil spill, and those flashes of
baby-doll violet and green that signal to all Versace ladies, ``You
can be bad, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Versace called the effect of mixing a lavender leather coat, its
seams raised in a grid pattern, with a lace-cut velvet dress over
grass-green tights ``the chic twist look.'' She might have gone for
more twist than chic _ chic being the theme of the week _ but the
show had some good pieces, particularly laminated shearling and
pleated leather coats.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing wrong with John Bartlett's collection Monday
for Byblos, with its sleek tweed trousers, sequined dappled skirts
and prints based on Kasimir Malevich's abstract paintings. But
neither was there anything special about the idea, expressed in the
idiotic program notes, of ``sexy school girls cutting class to
flirt'' with the avant-garde at ``the Cafi Flora.'' He's too smart
to write such drivel, and he's too good a designer to be spinning
his wheels with a company that obviously doesn't have a vision.
Maybe that's why he bolted down the runway at the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Ferretti's Philosophy collection on Sunday was trapped
in some late 1960s pubescent time warp. If it's true that young
women are growing up faster, they're not going to see the allure of
wearing flats with heavy tights and plaids of the Villager mode.
</P>
<P>
   The D&AMP;G show, by Gabbana and Domenico Dolce, had plenty of wit.
Laminated floral-print raincoats and red, tartan-lined capes
flashed over graffiti-print jeans, mini-kilts and souvenir T-shirts
with rolled-up sleeves. There was lots of gold, fake fur and a kind
of home-grown outrageousness, The cue was a set of drums and
guitars set up in the middle of the runway. This was garage
couture.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, though, the story is Prada. Prada's mesmerizing show
tonight, on a pale pink runway that resembled the translucent color
nail polish gets on a much-lacquered hand, advanced the ladylike
look she started last season. The clothes had a certain formality
offset with a sense of relaxed sophistication. That might mean a
chaste black coat tied just above the waist with a ribbon; a knit
polo shirt or cardigan with a broadtail front over a trim pair of
wide striped trousers in black and brown tweed; or a
salt-and-pepper tweed coat, with a loose fur collar tied at the
neck and worn over an abstract-print organdy dress.
</P>
<P>
   The show had a 1940s feel, mostly because open-toe platform
shoes, the casually pinned up, bed-slept hair and tweeds and
slightly out-of-kilter fur collars that will recall for anyone who
lives in New York countless dowagers steaming up Park Avenue in
their white gloves and good Delman shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Prada and her team of assistants have a knack for stepping
back and deciding what looks modern _ bare, wind-chafed legs, the
unexpected coyness of a lavender pansy print on a creamy chiffon or
organdy dress, slightly jarring proportions and uneven hemlines,
including some with a trace of chiffon hanging down, like a slip or
a loose lining. Karl Lagerfeld tried a similar effect last season
at Chanel, but Prada made it look somehow naive.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she is anything but naive at this point. One of her
new fall bags looks like a cross between an LP record jacket and a
cosmetics case. Anyway, it doesn't look like a bowling bag, and
that's the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage after the show, she looked exhausted. ``I was just
doing what is instinctive to me,'' she said. ``It's about the
pleasure of being feminine and just relaxing.'' She added that her
husband, Patrizio Bertelli, who is with the Prada racing team in
New Zealand, wondered if she was thinking of the '40s, ``but that's
just the way the clothes worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to watch the race again tonight. ``Absolutely,'' she
said with a drowsy laugh. ``In fact, I'm dead from staying up all
night and working in the day.''

RESIGNATIONS AT SOTHEBY'S SHAKE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As it deals with a federal anti-trust investigation,
Sotheby's, the leading worldwide auction house, announced Monday
the resignations of its major shareholder, A. Alfred Taubman, as
chairman and Diana D. Brooks, arguably the most powerful woman in
the art world, as president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sovern, the former president of Columbia University,
will replace Taubman as the company's chairman, and William
Ruprecht, managing director of Sotheby's North and South America
since 1994, will take over Brooks' job. The resignations, which
came after a board meeting conducted by telephone Monday afternoon,
rocked an art world already shaken by the criminal investigation.
They left open questions about the future direction of the company,
including the possible sale of Taubman's interests, and the
high-end auction business in general.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks the art world and Wall Street have been waiting for
Sotheby's to respond to allegations that it conspired with
archrival Christie's to fix the commissions the auction houses
charge buyers and sellers. The criminal anti-trust investigation
into the matter, which began in 1997, heated up three weeks ago
when Christie's announced that it was cooperating with federal
investigators regarding ``possible conduct'' relevant to the
investigation. A month before, Christopher M. Davidge, its chief
executive officer, abruptly resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Any illegal collusion could involve tens, if not hundreds, of
millions of dollars. Sotheby's and Christie's control about 95
percent of the $4 billion worldwide auction business. Christie's,
which was bought by the French investor Francois Pinault in 1998,
is now held privately. Sotheby's, which trades on the New York
Stock Exchange, is in a far more vulnerable position. Not only does
it not have conditional promises of leniency, which Christie's won
by coming to prosecutors first with information, but it also has
shareholders to answer to.
</P>
<P>
   Its share price has plunged from a high of 47 last spring to 17
3/4 on Friday. In Monday's announcement, Sotheby's said it had
``recently met with the Department of Justice in order to discuss a
prompt and appropriate resolution of this investigation.'' Neither
it nor Christie's has denied wrongdoing in their public statements.
</P>
<P>
   In a staff e-mail sent Monday afternoon, Ruprecht said ``these
decisions have been very difficult ones for Alfred and Dede and
they have made them in the best interests of Sotheby's.''
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, 75, the Detroit shopping-center magnate credited with
transforming plain suburban shopping centers, known as strip malls,
into playgrounds for the rich with designer shops like Yves St.
Laurent, Ralph Lauren and Louis Vuitton, bought Sotheby's in 1983.
Taubman owns 22.5 percent of the outstanding shares of the company
and has 63 percent of the company's voting power on the board. He
used his flair for retailing to turn Sotheby's from a sleepy
auction house into a one-stop shopping center offering customers
everything from financing and insurance to storage and art
education.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks became president of Sotheby's in America in 1987 and its
chief executive worldwide seven years later. Last year, Brooks, 49,
decided to invest $40 million in Internet business, joining forces
with Amazon.Com and starting Sotheby's own Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Sovern, 69, has coupled his lifelong involvement with Columbia
with several high-profile assignments that have called on his
expertise as a lawyer. He was chairman of the New York State-New
York City Commission on Integrity in Government, which became known
as the Sovern Commission, after municipal scandals shook the city
in 1986. He also served as head of the New York City Charter
Commission and as a trustee of the fund established to raise money
to help pay President Clinton's anticipated legal bills in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment is evidence of the desire of Sotheby's board to
bring in a respected figure who can help the company preserve its
image and deal with whatever integrity problems arise from the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It may also signal the fact that the auction house is
positioning itself for a sale. Financial analysts involved in the
art world said that Taubman had been studying whether to sell his
shares even before the current turn in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Taubman nor Brooks could be reached for comment. Dealers
and art buyers were reluctant to respond publicly to the news of
the resignations. ``No one's rejoicing,'' said an art lawyer who
would speak only on condition of anonymity. ``We're waiting for the
other shoe to drop. At this point we don't know how seriously these
disclosures will affect confidence in the art market.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene V. Thaw, a prominent retired dealer, said, ``It's not
going to change much except that a very aggressive firm has fallen
on difficult times. People will still buy great works of art. Maybe
the dealers will feel these staunch competitors are not riding so
high anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, investigations have also been launched by the European
Union and the Australian Competition Commission.

ANOTHER INVESTOR FILES SUIT OVER AZERBAIJAN OIL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LeVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ In the second such complaint by a Wall
Street investment fund, a Czech promoter has been accused of fraud
by his biggest client in a $450 million Azerbaijan privatization
venture dominated by prominent Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Leon G. Cooperman, chairman of Omega Advisers, contended in a
civil lawsuit filed Friday in London that Viktor Kozeny defrauded
the hedge fund of $126 million. Cooperman joined a suit filed in
December by another investor in the venture, Marlwood Commercial
Inc. Marlwood, a subsidiary of the diversified insurance company
American International Group, has sued Kozeny for $15 million, the
sum it says it invested.
</P>
<P>
   Kozeny, 36, is seen as a cautionary example of the Klondike
atmosphere on the Caspian in the mid-1990s. The suits contend that
he promised investors profits of up to 100 times their money
through the purchase of undervalued state properties, chiefly a
stake in Azerbaijan's state oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Azerbaijani government said it never intended to
sell the extremely valuable oil company, and Cooperman has said
that Omega's investment is almost worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman asserts that Kozeny wrongly enriched himself by
grossly inflating the price of privatization ``options'' necessary
for bidding on properties, charging investors $25 apiece for them
when he paid an average of 40 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   The Azerbaijani privatization program is still stalled. And
though the government has repeatedly vowed to extend the expiration
date, the investors' vouchers and options are scheduled to lapse in
August.
</P>
<P>
   The London High Court has sealed the lawsuit and has forbidden
any of the parties to discuss it. By telephone Monday, Cooperman
declined to comment, as did Kozeny's lawyer, Jacqueline S. Miller,
contacted at her Palm Beach, Fla., office. Calls placed to Kozeny's
estate in Lyford Cay, Bahamas, repeatedly received busy signals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Cooperman has described the background of the
investment, and some of the suit's details were contained in a
routine notification filed with the clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other investors, none of them a party to the lawsuit,
were George J. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader; the
real estate mogul Richard Friedman, who owns a Martha's Vineyard,
Mass., estate where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
have vacationed, and Frederick Bourke, chairman of Dooney &AMP; Bourke,
the handbag company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kozeny moved to the United States at 16, went on to earn an
undergraduate degree at Harvard, and then earned a fortune in the
early 1990s in questionable stock dealings in his native Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   From that fortune, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions
of dollars, Kozeny bought his Lyford Cay estate; a private Bahamas
island; a London mansion once owned by the playwright Andrew Lloyd
Webber, and an Aspen, Colo., ski chalet said to be worth $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas properties have been frozen under a court order
granted in the Marlwood suit, according to Bahamas press reports.
There is no public record of the order, nor is there a record of
whether the London or Aspen properties have also been frozen. It
was not possible to confirm the press reports independently.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have met Kozeny describe him as charming, willful and
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Kozeny returned to his native republic as it embarked
on economic reform, including privatization of its state-owned
enterprises. Displaying expertise in American-style marketing,
Kozeny went on television and promised enormous returns for Czech
citizens who turned over their privatization coupons _ every adult
was entitled to them _ to the company he had formed, Harvard
Capital &AMP; Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Some 800,000 Czechs did so. But while he became rich, his
clients' investment plummeted to a fraction of its original value.
</P>
<P>
   A Czech government investigation resulted in a finding of
wrongdoing by Kozeny's company, which was fined and ordered to
reimburse $6.8 million of investors' money that had been improperly
spent on advertising and consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman has said that he learned of Kozeny's past and
therefore took the precaution of demanding contractual clauses that
ostensibly prevented Kozeny from marking up the price of vouchers
and options.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and other foreign analysts had long expressed doubt
that the oil company, which possesses some 8 billion barrels of oil
reserves and is the chief source of income for Azerbaijan's corrupt
officials, would be privatized in any meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the value of the vouchers has plummeted from a high of
about $100 in 1997 to approximately $5 each.

<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ While Gov. George W. Bush tried Monday to
rally Michigan voters for Tuesday's primary here with a sunny
message of tax cutting and political reform, a second, shadow
campaign by his allies sought to sow suspicions of Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCain reported receiving automated telephone
calls in which the recorded voice of the televangelist Pat
Robertson urged them to ``protect unborn babies and restore
religious freedom'' by opposing McCain.
</P>
<P>
   As he has on his cable television program, Robertson, a
supporter of Bush, accuses McCain of having chosen as his national
chairman ``a vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians
in politics are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be
censors.'' That is a reference to Warren Rudman, the former New
Hampshire senator, who expressed concerns about Christian
conservatives in his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain continued to openly assail Bush on Monday
as a character assassin and a pretender to the mantle of Republican
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Robertson said Monday night that he had made the
recording for the Michigan Christian Coalition, without the
knowledge of the Bush campaign. Bush aides said they knew nothing
of the calls and that the direct calls they were making to voters
were all positive. ``All of our scripts are positive
get-out-the-vote scripts,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel campaigns here against McCain, one above the fray
and the other slashing, recalled the pattern in South Carolina,
where third parties spread damaging, exaggerated, and sometimes
false information about McCain. Other third-party groups are also
coming to Bush's aid in Michigan with radio commercials that
inflame doubts about McCain's commitment to ending abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As the McCain campaign revealed late Monday that it had a
recorded instance of Robertson's calls, the Bush campaign accused
McCain of ``attack phone calls.'' The campaign released transcripts
of two such calls, in which an automated voice repeated many of the
same criticisms that McCain has made publicly. One call accused
Bush of increasing public spending by a greater percentage in Texas
than Bill Clinton has in Washington. ``Both McCain and Bush are
good men,'' the caller continued, ``but John McCain has a much more
conservative record on fighting spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The second call accused Bush of a ``negative smear campaign''
and urged a vote against ``negative smear politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That was largely McCain's message Monday. ``I'm just like Luke
Skywalker trying to get out of the Death Star,'' declared the
senator, delighting in his new Star Wars imagery before a rowdy
crowd at Heritage High School in Saginaw, north of here. In an
appeal to Michigan's independent-minded voters, he held Bush's
establishment support, including from Gov. John Engler, against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, they're shooting at me from everywhere.
Everybody's against me. Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the
governors, all the senators. And we're going to kill them, right?''
</P>
<P>
   As some in the crowd chanted ``No more Bush,'' McCain replied,
``I thank you. There's our secret weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to ignore his Republican rival Monday, explaining to
reporters that ``this is the time to rally the vote.'' He preferred
to direct his barbs at Vice President Al Gore, who he accused of
``politics that's so stale and so negative.''
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed, Bush once again questioned McCain's commitment
to cleaning up the political system. ``He talks about the iron
triangle in Washington, D.C,'' Bush said, referring to the
senator's complaints about the links between lobbyists, campaign
donations and legislation. ``He's been ringing that iron triangle
like a dinner bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Bush's simile, McCain responded, ``He's the one taking
all the money from them. Seems to me he's had a Pavlovian
reaction.'' With a laugh, he essayed a metaphor, accusing Bush of
having ``both feet in the trough.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of boutique politicking in New Hampshire and South
Carolina, the candidates, short of time to impress voters and short
of patience with each other, were counting on their national images
and a burst of appearances to make and correct impressions in what
Bush on Monday called an abbreviated ``two-day primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, Bush was buoyant as he moved from east to west,
from the company of workers at a Detroit factory to a rally among
Grand Rapids' more conservative voters Monday evening. McCain
traveled from north to south before flying home in the evening to
Arizona, which also votes Tuesday.

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``A'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE) The
author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the direct
 &UR; ion of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT WEEK: Democratic positions on U.S. foreign policy. &QL;
</P>

   NIGERIA: VIOLENCE OVER MUSLIM LAW
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 people were killed as mosques and churches were set
on fire in clashes between Christians and Muslims in the northern
city of Kaduna after thousands of Christians marched to protest
plans to carry out Islamic law in Kaduna state. Another state,
Zamfara, formally adopted Shariah last month, and other northern
states have announced plans to do the same.

   Nelson Mandela opened a new round of peace talks on Burundi,
combining diplomacy and showmanship in an effort to end six years
of ethnic civil war. To increase international pressure on the
combatants, Presidents Clinton and Jacques Chirac of France were
scheduled to address the talks via closed circuit television. But
any immediate breakthrough seemed remote because the two main armed

   The sexual misconduct trial of the former deputy prime minister,
Anwar Ibrahim, was adjourned for at least two weeks Monday to allow

   President Abdurrahman Wahid said in an interview with the Voice

president or military chief who is convicted of a crime. Former
President Suharto is currently being investigated for corruption,
and a former armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, is being
investigated for human rights abuses in East Timor. The president
said pardons were appropriate because any such crimes were
``political acts.''

   Responding to a wave of kidnappings and sabotage, the government
has said it is willing to create a safe haven for the National
Liberation Army, the country's second largest Marxist-Leninist

   Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering told military

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``K'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE) The
author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the direct
 &UR; ion of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain has become more emphatic in
his attacks on the Republican establishment and its big-business
and conservative allies.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus, while talking to a call-in radio show,
McCain did not mince words about Bob Jones University, the center
of Christian conservatism in South Carolina that prohibits
interracial dating. He described the university as a ``place where
I would have told them they are a bunch of idiots for having those
racial policies.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the National Smokers Alliance, a group affiliated with
the tobacco companies running advertisements against him in
Michigan, as it did in South Carolina, he said on Sunday night that
he welcomed the opposition and would fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on down, you jerks,'' he said. ``Come on down. You're the

MICHIGAN CONSERVATIVES RALLY AROUND BUSH

  (Eds.: This was budgeted earlier as BUSH-RIGHT; see also

(sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ Gov. George W. Bush's weak showing in the New
Hampshire primary on Feb. 1 prompted conservative Christian and
antiaboriton groups in Michigan to begin what has become a
strenuous effort in recent days to get out the vote for Bush,
leaders of those organizations said.
</P>
<P>
   Right to Life of Michigan, one of the most powerful lobbying
groups in Michigan's Republican politics, endorsed Bush on Feb. 7,
six days after Sen. John McCain beat Bush in New Hampshire. Since
then, the group has sent a mailing endorsing Bush to 400,000
Michigan households and, in the last four days, placed a
pre-recorded phone call to each of these households as well, urging
them to vote for Bush on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a recorded telephone message from the evangelical
leader Pat Robertson went out to conservative Christians in
Michigan harshly criticizing McCain for having a top adviser who
had attacked the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to repeat a strategy that proved successful in the South
Carolina primary on Saturday, the Bush campaign has been actively
pursuing Christian voters here, including conservative Catholics as
well as evangelical Protestants. The campaign's strategy has relied
on advertisements on Christian radio stations, appearances by
Bush's allies on Christian talk shows and appeals to home-schooling
organizations, as well as mailings and phone calls to families
belonging to Christian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians, particularly those active in
anti-abortion causes, have long been important in Republican
primaries in Michigan. Robertson attracted considerable support in
Michigan in 1988, when he ran in the Republican primary against
George Bush, the governor's father. When Ronna Romney, an
anti-abortion candidate, competed in the 1996 primary for the
Republican Senate nomination against Jim Nicholson, a businessman
supported by much of the state's Republican business establishment,
she won easily, only to be defeated in the general elections by
Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   James Muffett, the president of Citizens for Traditional Values,
a lobbying group that leans toward Governor Bush, said that while
some pastors had initially favored McCain, sentiment has shifted as
Bush has increasingly been perceived as more conservative. Muffett
said that he had met with three groups of conservative pastors on
Monday and found that almost all of them supported Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But pastors in Michigan seldom make political statements from
the pulpit, particularly in favor of one Republican candidate over
another. Also, he said,m ``The campaign didn't get competitive
until New Hamshire. `There wasn't a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Listing, president of the Michigan Right to Life group,
said that in the recording her group made she had highlighted
Bush's anti-abortion record, while criticizing McCain for not being
sufficiently committed to opposing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But Listing said that before most elections, the group sends
three mailings to each household, followed by a phone call from a
volunteer prepared to discuss the upcoming vote. Because Right to
Life of Michigan was slow to become active in this race, it might
be less effective, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are limited in this campaign, and we're always best when
there's a clear difference for the voters,'' Listing said. ``McCain
is indicating he's pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has responded to the moves from the right by
emphasizing the endorsement of Gary Bauer, a conservative Christian
who recently dropped his own bid for the presidency and has spent
the last two days criss-crossing Michigan to speak in favor of
McCain. The Arizona senator firmly opposes abortion, said Michael
Hudome, his top adviser in Michigan, who added that criticisms by
Right to Life were ``completely unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the voters in Tuesday's primary are likely to
be conservative Christians and they are likely to support Bush,
said Edward V. Sarpolus, a politically independent pollster here.
But unlike in South Carolina, the number of conservative Christians
voting on Tuesday might be little changed from previous Republican
primaries, because conservative Christians have long had the
highest percentage turnout so there is little room for further
increases in their numbers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such predictions have not slowed the Bush campaign's energetic
efforts. Alan Cropsey, a born-again Christian and former Republican
member of the Michigan House and Senate, said that he had switched
his loyalties to the Bush after Steve Forbes pulled out of the
race, and was making phone calls on Bush's behalf to many
conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very concerned about John McCain because of his
softness on the right-to-life issue and the support he's getting
from the Log Cabin Republicans, the gay rights groups,'' Cropsey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative political analysts here think that support
from the Christian right could be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right to Life is very active on behalf of Bush,'' said Mickey
G. Craig, the Ross Alexander professor of political science at
Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school in Hillsdale,
Mich. ``They seem to be really pushing their people to get out the
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of anti-abortion activists and Gov. John Engler
of Michigan, a long-time backer of Bush, could prove a formidable
obstacle for McCain, he said, adding, ``When you have Right to Life
for Bush and you have Engler's party machine for Bush, you would
think you're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Political opinions were mixed at Detroit-area churches on
Sunday, but some were decidedly for Bush. ``I'm going to vote
pro-life, and that's George Bush,'' said Linda DeClark, 47, a
teacher's aide, as she headed for Sunday services at St. Malachy
Catholic Church in Sterling Heights, Mich. ``I think he has good
pull with the people that are into religion.''

FOX DECIDES TO END `WHO WANTS TO MARRY A MULTIMILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fox Network decided Monday to kill the potentially lucrative
franchise called ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire,'' ending
an episode almost as bizarre as the so-called reality-based
programs for which the television network has become known, like
``The World's Most Shocking Moments Caught on Tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Entertainment
Television, came after Fox learned that Rick Rockwell, the
bridegroom in last week's widely watched special, had been the
subject of a restraining order because of charges that he had
physically threatened a girlfriend nine years ago. Fox executives
said Rockwell had failed to disclose the information during
background checks leading up to the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the network canceled a repeat of last week's show
scheduled for Tuesday night, but left open the possibility that it
would broadcast new versions of the program in the future. Flush
with the ratings success, Darnell had announced last week his
intention to mount a special with the genders reversed, and a
female millionaire selecting a husband.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the special, which had stirred a national debate
about modern relationships and the pressures on women to marry,
raises new questions about the risks in a growing trend among the
broadcast networks to rely on programs that put real people into
challenging and life-changing situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months networks have plans to put people on a
desert island swarming with cameras, to lock people together into a
house filled with cameras, and even, in the case of one syndicated
show, to marry strangers off to each other every week.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darnell, the executive vice president of Fox who invented
the marry-a-millionaire concept, said the network had decided not
to go forward with any other specials in that format because,
``It's just not worth the risk.'' He said: ``This is the end for
this show. We are not doing another one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show broadcast a week ago, Rockwell, who billed himself
as a real estate developer and motivational speaker, selected among
50 prospective brides in a beauty-pageantlike contest. He chose
Darva Conger, an emergency room nurse.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, however, information emerged that
revealed that Rockwell was a longtime comedian with a history of
engaging in stunts like telling jokes for 30 straight hours to get
into the Guinness Book of World Records. While Fox and Next
Entertainment, the company that produced the special, continued to
vouch for his financial claim of assets exceeding $2 million,
numerous questions arose about the truthfulness of some of his
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fox claimed that it had conducted a thorough check of
Rockwell, it became clear that the research was less than
exhaustive. Among Rockwell's claims called into question were that
he had not performed as a comedian in about 10 years (a comedy club
owner said he had hired him only two years ago) and that he had
opened for the ``Tonight'' show star, Jay Leno, in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
A representative for Leno said that Rockwell had never opened
anywhere for him).
</P>
<P>
   Several companies for whom Rockwell said he worked as a
motivational speaker said that they had never hired him. Nancy
Buchholz, a spokeswoman for Maritz Travel, a national travel-agency
business based in St. Louis, said that Rockwell had never performed
at a Maritz travel agency. Mary Elizabeth Gifford, a spokeswoman
for The Golden Door, a high-end California health spa, said that
Rockwell had never been a guest speaker there. Don Stanziano, the
spokesman for the Scripps Hospital system in San Diego, which
includes six hospitals, said that the company had no record of
Rockwell ever performing at any of the hospitals or corporate
retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, who returned to his San Diego home from a honeymoon
trip to the Caribbean with Conger on Sunday, told a local
television station, KFMB, in San Diego: ``As you know, this journey
began with my desire to find love on a television show. I had no
idea there would be so much interest and so much scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   About the restraining order, he said: ``Nearly ten years ago, I
was involved in a relationship that ended poorly. But I am here to
tell you tonight that at no time have I ever struck any of my
girlfriends for any reason.'' Rockwell went on to say that he
``never informed the producers of the show about this issue because
I considered it a closed chapter in my life and any contentious
feelings that existed ten years ago are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Darnell of Fox said, `'The latest information came as a shock to
me and the production company. I don't know why he didn't say
anything to us about it.`
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell had been extensively questioned about his background,
Darnell said. ``The production company did a security check and he
came up clean. It was a criminal check, a civil check and a credit
check. He was actually specifically asked if there was anything
else we should know about his past. He signed an affidavit that
everything he told us was true.''
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the special began in the fall when Darnell came up
with the idea to marry off a millionaire on a show, in an effort to
play off the mania surrounding ABC's hit game show ``Who Wants To
be A Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell has gained a reputation in television for creating some
of the most outrageous and highly rated specials of recent years,
including some with the memorable titles of ``When Animals Attack''
and `When Good Pets Go Bad,'' as well as ``Alien Autopsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The specials, which almost always generated high ratings, have
been extremely effective during the special rating periods knows as
sweep months, when advertising rates are set, helping Fox post
impressive overall ratings by replacing many of the network's least
popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the storm over ``MultiMillionaire'' came as Fox
was beginning to distance itself from the violent specials.
Grushow, who recently took over the job running Fox's entertainment
division, called them ``ratings crack,'' and said the network
needed to break its addiction to them. Grushow argued that Fox got
only a short-term benefit from the specials, that they did not
provide any ancillary profits _ like those from syndication _ and
that they occupied time periods where Fox needed to develop
comedies and dramas that could be long-term assets.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell also developed other, entertainment-oriented specials
like ``Secrets of Magic Revealed,'' which showed how many famous
magic tricks are done. That program, which outraged many magicians,
was the highest-rated special ever on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent fiasco, Darnell said he would continue to
develop specials ``that get under people's skin and are
fascinating.'' But he added that ``there will be a level of
responsibility that goes with them.'' He called the magic special
``a perfect example of the kind of show we want to keep doing.''
Specifically, he said, ``I'll be back in May with something
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Other networks are expected to continue their plans to broadcast
reality-based shows, he said, because the audience response to them
has been so strong. CBS will have two such programs this summer _
one, ``Survivor,'' will take a group of people to an island off
Borneo and put them through various tests with the ultimate winner
taking home $1 million. The other CBS show is ``Big Brother,''
which has a similar format, set in a house with cameras.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Infinity Productions has plans for a weekly
syndicated show called ``Wed at First Sight,'' a ``Dating
Game''-type program except that the couple, strangers at the start
of the show, will be married at the end.

LAKERS THINK DEFENSE DURING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A road trip that began with hopes of a
5-1 record is now within two wins of a clean sweep, and the Lakers
have their defense to thank for it.
</P>
<P>
   They have faced fourth-quarter deficits in their first four
games of the trip but have locked down each time for the win _
holding opponents to an average of 19 points in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing in Orlando, they tied the game on Shaquille O'Neal's
steal and dunk in the final seconds, then held the Magic to 11
points in overtime. In Philadelphia, they sealed the game with two
blocked shots in the final 2.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that we're growing as a basketball team,'' said
veteran Ron Harper. ``We just don't rely on our offense, because we
haven't scored a lot (averaging 93.5 points in four games), but
anytime that we needed a defensive stop here and there, Shaq and
guys make plays. And I think that's good to see.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no big secret to the Lakers' defensive mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the concentration,'' said coach Phil Jackson. ``They're
more concerned with defense right now than scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is the Lakers have held opponents on this trip to an
average of 86.0 points and 41 percent shooting in their own arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offense is always unpredictable,'' Jackson said. ``Defense is
the predictable part of your game. And for us, if we get on the
road and get a couple 30-point quarters in any game, we're plenty
satisfied that will carry us through to a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, winners of seven straight, are a league-best 18-7 on
the road, 8-1 in Eastern Conference arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play a great deal of our games in the second half of the
season on the road (20 out of 34 games),'' said Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can go with you or that can go against you. Right now, it
looks like it's going with us, because in the playoffs you have to
win games on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Lakers need for a 6-0 road trip is victories over a pair
of struggling teams _ New Jersey (21-31) tonight and Cleveland
(21-31) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking that all along,'' said Bryant, ``but we just
have to take it one game at a time. You can't even talk about (6-0)
right now, really. New Jersey had a big win (Sunday at Minnesota),
so they're going to be at home with a lot of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Homecoming week: Going home has been a rousing success for
the Lakers _ Jackson won in his return to Chicago, Glen Rice won in
his return to Charlotte, O'Neal won in his return to Orlando and
Bryant won in his return to hometown Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a game for everybody so far,'' Jackson said. ``I'll
have to manufacture something in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jackson finished his playing career with the Nets more
than 20 years ago, then served as an assistant coach here for three
seasons. And O'Neal's roots include New Jersey as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cleveland, well, Harper did play the first three-plus
seasons of his career there.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pushing it: Jackson responded playfully when asked if
O'Neal's recent hot foul shooting (45 for his last 62) would change
the Lakers' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at it as an offensive weapon now. If they go foul
Shaq at the end of a game, we've got ourselves a real strategic
victory right there,'' he quipped. ``I already asked him to shoot a
technical. He turned me down. He's not quite ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, O'Neal's done it before, in this city. Two years ago,
he had 49 points against the Nets when coach Del Harris sent O'Neal
to the line to shoot a technical late in the fourth quarter. O'Neal
swished it for his 50th point, his high as a Laker.

 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Web
site, which was shut down last week over concerns about hackers,
was partially restored Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement on the site's home page said the agency was
working to restore public access to the information as quickly and
securely as possible. It added that several other systems
supporting the Web site are not yet ready to be reattached to the
Internet server.
</P>
<P>
   The shut-down was the result of a General Accounting Office
report, made public by Rep. Thomas Bliley (R-W. Va.) that said the
system was ``riddled with security weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The site contains information on air pollution, water pollution,
toxic chemical releases, scientific studies and records of
enforcement. It is widely used by researchers, public interest
groups and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. EPA greatly expanded the amount of information on the
site and its accessibility during the Clinton administration.
Information about pollution in any area of the country can be
obtained by entering a postal ZIP code in a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. EPA said that the remaining systems will be put online
as soon as their security is upgraded

   FCC DEBATES WHO PAYS FOR CALLING CELLULAR PHONES
</P>
<P>
   A debate is raging at the Federal Communications Commission
about whether cellular telephone customers must continue to pay to
receive calls as well as to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular companies, hoping to make wireless phones a viable
alternative to the desk phone, have pressed for a rule change that
would allow them to bring wireless calls under the same ``calling
party pays'' system used with the traditional telephone network.
Traditional phone companies and some consumer groups oppose such a
change.

 &HT;    NCAA's punishments could bring change
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The problem, Mike Krzyzewski said, is illustrated
through this analogy:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a kid working in your yard who you know comes from a
disadvantaged background,'' the Duke basketball coach said. ``Turns
out the kid has all A's in school and is really bright. You decide
to help the kid get into a private school and give him a leg up on
life.''
</P>
<P>
   If the young man got a scholarship to play the tuba, fine. But
if he earned a basketball scholarship, Krzyzewski said, you have
committed an NCAA violation that could cost the young athlete all
of his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   That apparent double standard is at the heart of a major
philosophical fight going on quietly behind the scenes in the NCAA.
The conflict could result in legislation to redefine the concept of
amateurism in college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of cases, high-profile players have been suspended
for violation of the NCAA's ``extra benefit'' rule: ``There must be
no preferential treatment, benefits or services because of the
individual's athletics reputation or skill or pay-back potential as
a professional athlete, unless such treatment benefits or services
are specifically permitted under the NCAA.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest rulings, the NCAA has looked at relationships that
existed before the athlete became a college student:
</P>
<P>
   _ St. John's guard Erick Barkley was suspended for three games
after he swapped cars with the brother of his former coach in the
Riverside Church basketball program. The NCAA still is checking
into the possibility that a benefactor connected to the Riverside
Church program paid Barkley's tuition to a Maine prep school.
</P>
<P>
   _ With the permission of his mother, Jamal Crawford went to live
with local telecommunications executive Barry Henthon in another
part of his hometown of Seattle. Crawford lived with Henthon for
three years and later signed with Michigan. Henton has no ties to
Michigan, but the NCAA suspended Crawford and said he must repay
$15,000 that Henthon spent while Crawford was in his care. Crawford
does not have the money and might have to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brothers Kareem Rush of Missouri and JaRon Rush of UCLA both
served suspensions for taking money and other benefits while in
high school. Kareem Rush originally was suspended for half the
season, but the suspension was reduced on appeal to one-third of
the season. JaRon Rush will not be eligible until the 18th game of
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches are complaining that the NCAA is too quick to suspend
players when there might not be any wrongdoing involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to get into the modern ages in regard to college
basketball,'' Krzyzewski said. ``As a result, the kids are
sacrificed at times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray I see the day when there is no NCAA,'' said
St. John's coach Mike Jarvis, who referred to the NCAA as a
``Gestapo'' for the punishment of Barkley. ``This is about America.
This is about human rights, the right of each individual.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA points out that it is composed of its member
institutions and that their representatives put the rules in place
in response to cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the fault of the NCAA office trying to enforce
wherever the membership draws the line,'' David Berst, former
director of enforcement, recently told CBS Sportsline. ``In a way,
it's testimony that the NCAA is pretty good at what the membership
says. If they say enforce it, we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes might be on the way. Among proposed NCAA legislation is
a rule that would allow an athlete to play professionally for one
year and return to college if he thinks he has made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a basketball player can return to school if he does not
like his position in the draft. But his eligibility is over if he
receives money from a pro team or hires an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is gaining some momentum. ``I can have some empathy
for a young man if he leaves for a year, thinks he's made a mistake
and wants to come back,'' Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley
said. ``But anything more than a year would be going too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Other legislation would make it permissible for high school
athletes, until they enroll in college, to receive financial
benefits, such as prize money and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The current situation involves several factors:
</P>
<P>
   _ The NCAA knows it can't control the influence of agents and
foreign players on the sport. Trying to determine whether foreign
players have received benefits is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   _ The NCAA realizes it would lose any legal battle over its
ability to control the lives of athletes before they sign college
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   _ After the NCAA and CBS reached agreement on the new $6.2
billion contract to televise the men's basketball tournament, talk
has increased about athletes getting their share of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to squelch such talk is to loosen the rules that
prohibit athletes from making a living. But some athletics
officials are opposed to such changes, because they see college
athletics as the last bastion of amateurism. Others say that
amateurism changed long ago and that college athletics must adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Even the basketball coaches are opposed to the specific changes,
which they fear would damage the integrity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what the problems are and what this legislation
proposes, and frankly we don't connect the dots,'' said Jim Haney,
executive director of the National Association of Basketball
Coaches. `We believe in getting more money to the players, but
this is not the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has to do something or run the risk of breaking up into
smaller, sport-specific organizations. Krzyzewski, for one, thinks
college basketball should have its own governing body. The earliest
that any legislation could pass would be for the 2001-2002 school
year. Until something changes, the NCAA will continue enforcing the
letter of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The result, coaches say, is that more kids will be hurt
undeservedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have helped poor people forever, but when a poor
basketball player is helped, it's a crime,'' Krzy- zewski said. ``I
don't understand that.''

  HOTELS HARBOR PRESIDENTIAL LORE    By HARRY SHATTUCK  c. 2000
Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the intense campaigning of an election year, we pause to
reflect not on White House wannabes but on Ike and the wayward
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The setting: Denver's Brown Palace Hotel, a favorite overnight
respite for Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to please the president, who loved to fish, the
hotel staff created an ice carving of a mountain complete with pine
trees and a miniature lake at the mountain's base. Three small,
live trout swam in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Eisenhower was so enchanted by the lake and
its tiny inhabitants that he was among the first to notice one
trout flipping out of the pool and onto the hotel carpet. The
president leaped to the rescue, nearly upsetting a table in his
eagerness to save the fish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;  MEMORABLE MOMENTS &QL;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ike's adventure is among many memorable moments relived by
guests at Historic Hotels of America, operated by the National
Trust for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Peabody, still a Memphis, Tenn., institution, future
president Harry Truman wrote a letter to his wife, dated Nov. 16,
1941, that reads: ``I got up at 7:15 a.m. and had breakfast in the
coffee shop downstairs, and they charged me 55 cents for tomato
juice, a little dab of oatmeal and milk with toast. I don't mind
losing $100 on a horse race or in a poker game with friends, but I
do hate to pay 55 cents for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Truman was escorted to his room at the Boston Park
Plaza by Leo Montgomery, who spent 40 years as a bell captain at
the hotel. According to legend, Truman poured a shot of whiskey
from his flask and offered it to Montgomery. The bell captain,
aware that drinking was prohibited while on duty, hesitated.
``You're not saying no to the president, are you?'' Truman asked.
So Montgomery had what he said was his first and only drink on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   The Menger Hotel bar in San Antonio is renowned as the location
where Theodore Roosevelt recruited many of his Rough Riders in 1898
in preparation for the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   The employee cafeteria at the Renaissance Vinoy in St.
Petersburg, Fla., lays claim to feeding Calvin Coolidge. Seems this
president found the fare in the Vinoy's celebrated dining room too
rich for his simple Yankee tastes; a bellman led Coolidge to the
cafeteria, where the food suited him well.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cranwell Resort &AMP; Golf Club in Lenox, Mass., folks still
talk about a July 4 celebration for President William McKinley and
his wife, Ida Saxton McKinley, conducted more than a century ago,
when the hotel was a private residence.
</P>
<P>
   As a festive meal began, the butler removed the U.S. flag from
the table's centerpiece to reveal an enormous replica of a bald
eagle. Backed by the sound of clockwork, the eagle began to nod and
wink persistently in the direction of the first lady. With each
nod, its wings ascended and came down with a jerk, creating the
impression that the eagle was about to take off in flight. A
startled Mrs. McKinley had to be escorted from the room.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;  OTHER HISTORICAL SITES &QL;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A traveler's pursuit of presidential lore isn't restricted to
grand hotels, of course. Museums and libraries all across the
country honor chief executives. And then there are these
attractions uncovered by William Clotworthy in his book
``Presidential Sites'' (McDonald &AMP; Woodward, $18.95):
</P>
<P>
   In Charlestown, Mass., the Warren Tavern is touted as the Boston
area's oldest working inn. Early customers included George
Washington and Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, Vt., the American Museum of Fly Fishing features
equipment that belonged to Presidents Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter,
Grover Cleveland and Herbert Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   A marker beside South Carolina State Highway 5, about 14 miles
southeast of Rock Hill, commemorates the birthplace of Andrew
Jackson. But wait! Just across the state line in Union County,
N.C., another marker testifies to Jackson's birth site. No one is
certain which claim is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the Gold Coast Railroad Museum's collection of vintage
cars includes Railroad Car 1, the Ferdinand Magellan, which served
as traveling office and home to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Truman, Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   On a more sobering note, the Southeastern Railway Museum in
Duluth, Ga., displays the Superb, a 1911 Pullman car used by Warren
Harding on his ill-fated 1923 ``Voyage of Understanding.'' The car
carried Harding from Washington, D.C., to Tacoma, Wash., where he
embarked for Alaska. It then took him down the coast to San
Francisco, where Harding died, and carried the president's body
back to the nation's capital and to Marion, Ohio, for his burial.
</P>
<P>
   Still on display, too, at the Union Pacific Historical Museum in
Omaha, Neb., is the rail car that carried Abraham Lincoln's body
from Washington, D.C., to Springfield, Ill., after his
assassination in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Clotworthy's book describes more than 1,000 places associated
with U.S. presidents from Washington to Bill Clinton. Bookstores
stock or can order the publication.

   The Reds' hot glow
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Junior went to camp Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If only life were so simple.
</P>
<P>
   It took 150 media members and nine television trucks to verify
it. Photographers flocked to document the license plate _ WICKID 1
_ on his jet-black Mercedes-Benz CLK 60. Grown men harbored
nitwitted thoughts. When asked if he would be cheated toward the
line this summer, left fielder Dmitri Young winced and said, ``Oh,
hell, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Donning a Cincinnati uniform for the first time since he was an
8-year-old playing in a father-son game, Ken Griffey Jr. appeared
on a second-story porch at the club's City of Sarasota training
facility, like Sinatra posing on a Las Vegas balcony. Thirty
shutters snapped. The new Reds are born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Griffey surmised, ``this is not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the next day in the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon, beginning his 51st year in baseball,
declared, ``This is the best group I've ever had.'' At the club's
main ticket office, the Reds have installed 10 new phone lines to
handle new orders. The office is open on weekends. It wasn't open
on weekends even when the Big Red Machine lived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' general manager Jim Bowden said, ``I think our
young players learned they could play with the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   And this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay healthy and our starting pitching can give us six
or seven innings a game,'' Bowden said, ``we've got a chance to win
every night.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``every night'' mantra used to be the exclusive domain of
the Braves and Yankees. Even though the Reds' pitching remains a
wobbly vessel, no one disputes how Griffey in one swoop has tilted
the National League. This club won 96 games without him in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's hoping we can increase it to 106, hopefully,'' pitcher
Denny Neagle said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 57 years, only three National League teams have won
as much _ the 1998 Braves (106), 1975 Reds (108) and 1986 New York
Mets (108). But that's what Monday was like.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no extra pressure,'' Griffey said. ``I just go out
there and do what I do and play hard. As far as all the excitement
in (Cincinnati), I've got family there and they've been calling me
and saying they're flying my name on planes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `Here we go again.' But I'm happy. I grew up
there, and it's every childhood dream to play for your hometown
team. And I'm doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even almost two weeks after the deal that sent Brett Tomko, Mike
Cameron and minor-leaguers Antonio Perez and Jake Meyer to Seattle
for the player of the decade, the Reds continue to pinch
themselves. Second baseman Pokey Reese, who said he considered it
an honor to be mentioned in a trade for Griffey even if he was for
months the stumbling block to the deal, can't wait to get in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just two Gold Glove winners up the middle, now
we'll have three,`` Reese said. ``It's going to be a whole lot of
fun during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin, who has stolen more bases than any player in team
history, was asked if he had any assurances that Griffey would take
a pitch to let him run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he'd take one,'' Larkin said. ``One strike. That's
what he told me. That's cool. I want him to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That will all come. But on the first day, Griffey talked up the
club, met some new teammates, modeled his new No. 30 _ Ken Griffey
Sr.'s old number _ and strolled the grounds, appearing almost
weary.
</P>
<P>
   Not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably as excited as I get,'' he said, looking off,
``other than sliding into home against the Yankees.''

CHICAGO'S LATEST ANTI-LOITERING MEASURE TARGETS HIGH-CRIME AREAS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Changes `law' to ordinance or measure throughout, including
overline for accuracy.) 
 (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Trying to thwart gangs without running afoul of
constitutional rights, the Chicago City Council has passed an
anti-loitering ordinance that allows police to order suspicious
crowds to scatter.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which limits enforcement to high-crime areas, drew
criticism from some council members, who said it singled out racial
minorities. But a majority of black council members approved the
bill as a tool to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure passed in 1992 was struck down last June in a
6-3 vote of the U.S. Supreme Court, which said it was too vague.
But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a concurring opinion, wrote
that the Chicago measure could be rewritten in ways to make it
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure, backed by Mayor Richard M. Daley and passed by
the Council in a 44-to-5 vote last Wednesday, addressed the
concerns about the earlier measure's vagueness by specifically
citing ``gang and narcotics loitering.'' It allows the police to
order loiterers to disband within five minutes, and to ``remove
themselves from within sight and hearing'' of a designated spot for
at least three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, the city would limit enforcement to
designated ``hot spots'' in neighborhoods with high rates of crime.
Under the earlier anti-loitering ordinance, which was lifted in
1995 after lower courts ruled against it, the police made more than
40,000 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago ordinance is one of dozens of anti-loitering
measures passed around the nation in recent years by cities trying
to deal with crime and, in some cases, homeless people. The City
Council in Annapolis, Md., approved a measure last week that bars
convicted drug dealers from loitering in designated areas and
allows the police to scatter crowds suspected of dealing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council in Grand Prairie, Texas, passed an ordinance
last November that allows the police to scatter loiterers if
officers suspect drug dealing. Officials in Cleveland are
considering rewriting an anti-loitering measure intended for
prostitution after a federal court struck down an earlier version.
And many cities, including San Francisco and New York, have
conducted sweeps designed to remove homeless people from the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The action in Chicago drew criticism from the American Civil
Liberties Union here, which released a statement saying it was
``disheartened'' by the measure. ``This ensures that thousands of
innocent persons of color will be arrested for no good reason,''
the ACLU statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure won approval from 15 blacks on the city council,
including Michael Chandler, who said the issue was not civil
liberties, but rather ``people selling heroin to our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Several council members said people were being made prisoners in
their homes because they feared gang members on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   But Councilwoman Leslie Hairston, who is black, said the
ordinance ``legalizes racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Another black councilwoman, Dorothy Tillman, called the measure
``anti-black'' and ``inhumane.''
</P>
<P>
   Hairston also said that neighborhoods designated as high-crime
areas would see property values fall.
</P>
<P>
   Moves intended to make poor neighborhoods safer have been
central to Daley's popularity. He has steadily built support among
blacks since first winning office in 1989 with only about 10
percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion last year, O'Connor said the ordinance would be
permissible if its language would take aim at loiterers ``with no
apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable
areas, to intimidate others from those areas or to conceal illegal
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley said the new measure was written to follow O'Connor's
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they will begin enforcement of the measure in
a month, after working with community leaders to select areas that
qualify under the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Police Superintendent Terry Hillard, who is black and supports
the measure, said his officers would be trained to enforce it
without overstepping its scope. Critics of the earlier version say
the police made indiscriminate sweeps in some neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping to do is give them a warning: `You don't
need to be on this corner,''' Hillard said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, a city of about 2.7 million, is about 40 percent white,
40 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic.

MAINLAND CHINA ISSUES BLUNT WARNING ON TAIWAN'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for complete rewrite; expands by about 200 words)  
 (HLW)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Less than one month before presidential elections in
Taiwan, the Chinese government released the bluntest warning yet
that it will not wait indefinitely for the island to reunite with
the mainland. A prolonged lack of negotiations, in itself, China
warned, could provoke a military attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have long made it clear that any moves by Taiwan
toward formal independence would lead to war. But Monday's
government report on Taiwan adds _ for the first time in such a
definitive policy statement _ that if Taiwan refuses indefinitely
to pursue ``the peaceful settlement of cross-straits reunification
through negotiations, then the Chinese government will only be
forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of
force, to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The report does not provide a timetable or deadline for
negotiating progress. Still, ``This is a signal that Beijing is
getting impatient with the delays in the process of
reunification,'' said Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the China
Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a private group in Taipei.
``This is a warning to the people of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials said they would not comment until they had
studied the document. As of Monday night, the candidates in the
March 18 presidential elections had not responded. The top
contenders have favored talks of some sort, but not Beijing's
vision of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000-word report, entitled ``The One-China Principle and
the Taiwan Issue,'' was released by the Taiwan affairs office and
the information office of the state council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It elaborates on China's longstanding proposal for a negotiated
return of Taiwan under a version of the ``one country, two
systems'' formula, with even greater autonomy than was given to
Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. ``Provided that
it is within the framework of one China, any question can be
discussed,'' the report says, including ``Taiwan's international
space for economic, cultural and social activities compatible with
its status, the political status of the Taiwan authorities and
other questions.''
</P>
<P>
   That formula has been rejected as too confining by Taiwan's
leaders and the three leading presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The dire warnings in the document were a reminder of what an
emotional issue the reunification of Taiwan with the ``motherland''
is for Beijing, especially now that Hong Kong and Macao have
returned to the fold. While there was no ultimatum or threat of
immediate attack, they also underscore how explosive the
confrontation across the Taiwan Strait is, potentially drawing the
United States into war with China.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report lambastes the United States for providing
advanced weapons to Taiwan, which China says violates promises, and
for proposals in Congress for a closer military relationship with
the island, which it calls a ``gross interference in China's
internal affairs and a grave threat to China's security.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States officially supports the concept of ``one
China,'' but is also committed to providing Taiwan with the means
to defend itself against attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said there would be no
official response until the report was studied ``very carefully.''
But the harder line on Taiwan was likely to cause political
problems for the Clinton administration as it faces a battle for
congressional approval of to get China's membership in the World
Trade Organization approved in Congress. And the report's
denunciation of the congressional bill to upgrade military ties
with Taiwan, which passed the House this month, could enhance
support for the bill in the Senate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new Chinese report bitterly condemns Taiwan's president, Lee
Tung-hui, accusing him of destroying previous talks with his
assertion last summer that Taiwan would negotiate with China only
on a ``state-to-state'' basis and his refusal to repeat the
traditional homage to the concept of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lee's statement last summer, China broke off planned
high-level meetings, charging that Lee was secretly scheming for
independence even though he professes to support reunion at some
distant point _ after the mainland, too, has become a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The report condemns Lee's suggestion of waiting for democracy as
``an excuse for postponing and resisting reunification,'' since
China has offered to allow different political systems to coexist
under the banner of one China.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell what effect China's sharp words might
have on Taiwan's election campaign. In 1996, before Taiwan's first
direct elections for president, China was angered by Lee's defiant
statements and fired missiles near Taiwan as a warning. The United
States sent two aircraft carriers to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Lee won election handily and seemed to gain popular appeal
though his brinkmanship, but since then many Taiwanese who had
toyed with the idea of declaring independence have had second
thoughts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   China lacks the military power to invade Taiwan, experts say,
and is no match for American forces should they be drawn into a
confrontation. But China is steadily improving its navy; it
recently received the first of two Russian-built guided-missile
destroyers designed to penetrate American carrier group defenses.
And it is building up forces of ballistic and cruise missiles. Both
could be used to cripple Taiwan's economy by disrupting sea lanes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this year's election campaign has involved fewer
military tensions, and in Taiwan the candidates have gone out of
their way to avoid sounding provocative. Surveys show that a large
majority of the Taiwan public, after enjoying years of prosperity
and democracy, does not want a military confrontation with China.
</P>
<P>
   All three major candidates _ Vice President Lien Chan of the
governing Nationalist Party; James Soong, a former Nationalist
leader who is running as an independent; and Chen Shui-bian, of the
Democratic Progressive Party _ have made vague pledges to resume
negotiations of some sort with China and to encourage more trade
and business links. But none endorses China's formula for
reunification, and it is unclear what the two sides might say in
future to talks to give China a sense of progress toward unity.
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts think that Monday's Chinese warning may
be intended, in part, to scare voters away from Chen, whose party
has long been associated with Taiwan independence. The founding
charter of his party calls for a referendum on whether the island,
still formally called the Republic of China, should be renamed the
Republic of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, seeking to broaden his electoral appeal, has declared that
since Taiwan is already independent in practice, it does not need a
formal declaration and that if elected, he would not pursue a
referendum on the issue unless Taiwan came under attack. He has
offered to discuss improving communications and economic ties,
something the mainland badly wants.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Monday unequivocally rejects the legitimacy
of any referendum in Taiwan on independence, warning: ``Any attempt
to separate Taiwan from China through so-called referendum would
only lead the Taiwan people to disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Monday's warning puts the Taiwan candidates on notice
that China does not intend to allow a repeat of Lee's performance,
which it believes brought a halt to even the pretense of
negotiations toward symbolic unification.

BRADLEY, COURTING HISPANICS, CALLS FOR NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf of optional trim, Last April ..., to add Puerto
Rico's agreement last month on Vieques.) 
 (nk) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Courting the Hispanic vote, former Sen. Bill Bradley
stopped at a Brooklyn elementary school Monday morning and spoke
about the need for universal health insurance, noting the
disproportionate numbers of Latinos among the uninsured and
questioning Vice President Al Gore's commitment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore's attacks against his plan ``have cast doubt
on his commitment to a basic plank of the Democratic platform,
which is national health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley quoted figures from a recent Census Bureau study that
found that despite a strong economy, the numbers of uninsured
Americans grew to 44 million in 1998, including 11 million
children. Hispanics, the study found, were least likely to have
health coverage. More than a third of Hispanics were uninsured,
compared with 22.2 percent of blacks, 21.1 percent of
Asian-Americans and 11.9 percent of non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work, sometimes two jobs,'' Bradley said of the
uninsured. ``Their employers just don't provide health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a small audience at Public School 24, a new
dual-language (Spanish and English) elementary school in the
working-class neighborhood of Sunset Park, Bradley also outlined
his proposals to double federal Title I financing for schools in
poor neighborhoods, require teachers to prove their expertise and
offer incentives to recruit teachers to needy rural and urban
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, he called for the need to spread the benefits of a
booming economy to the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be fixing our roof when the sun is shining,'' he
said, ``and the sun is shining now. There's a difference between
economic growth and broad-based prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions, Bradley expressed his support for
bilingual education programs and pledged to double a federal block
grant for affordable child care.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would end weapons testing by the U.S. Navy on
the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico. Gore has adopted the same
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing in Vieques should end,'' Bradley said. ``We should not
use it for live fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, President Clinton ordered a moratorium on all
training on Vieques after a Puerto Rican was killed in a bombing
accident. In an agreement last month, Puerto Rico agreed to allow
limited training, with nonexploding bombs, until the people of
Vieques vote on the future of the training range.
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo Quinones, 53, a social worker from Sunset Park who asked
Bradley about Vieques, said he was gladdened by the vehemence of
the candidate's reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he follows through,'' Quinones said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley picked up the endorsement of Angel Rodriguez, a city
councilman from the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn who described
Bradley's priorities on health care, education and economic
development as the priorities of the Latino community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our issues are the nation's issues,'' Rodriguez said.

  CONFIDENT BUSH ATTACKS GORE IN MICHIGAN    By R.G. RATCLIFFE  and
CLAY ROBISON  c. 2000 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ George W. Bush, showing renewed confidence that
he could be the Republican presidential nominee, told Michigan
voters Monday that Vice President Al Gore's environmental views
threaten jobs in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hardly mentioned his primary rival, John McCain, whom he
beat by 11 points in Saturday's South Carolina primary. Polls in
Michigan show the two men in a tie leading into Tuesday's primaries
in Arizona and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, standing on stage in a packed gym at Heritage High
School in Saginaw, portrayed himself as the outsider and underdog
to several hundred cheering students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like Luke Skywalker trying to get out of the Death
Star,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shooting at me from everywhere. Everybody's against
me. (Michigan) Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the governors,
all the senators. But we're going to kill them, right? We're going
to get them. I'm getting out of the Death Star, and we're going to
win this election.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a senator from Arizona, continued to preach
campaign-finance reform, which he has made the cornerstone of his
campaign. As he did Sunday, he attacked Bush's claim to be a
reformer, a mantle Bush adopted after McCain beat him in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, guess what? There is a new reformer on the scene. His
name is Governor Bush,'' McCain told the Traverse City crowd,
poking fun at his rival from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He called Bush's campaign-finance proposal, unveiled in South
Carolina, a ``joke and a fraud.'' He also said Texas had the ``most
liberal'' campaign-finance laws of any state because they didn't
limit donations to most political races.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his speech to The Economic Club of Detroit, said McCain
should support his call to ban contributions from federal lobbyists
when Congress is in session.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about the iron triangle in Washington, D.C. He's been
ringing that iron triangle like a dinner bell, raising the money
from lobbyists,'' Bush said. ``It's one thing to talk the talk,
it's another thing to walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Bush raised
$5.2 million or about 7 percent of his money from lawyers and
lobbyists in 1999. McCain raised $627,926, or about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been critical of McCain almost every day in South
Carolina, but he acknowledged that he was intentionally avoiding
mention of McCain in the two-day Michigan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a two-day primary here, this is the time to rally
the vote,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts are uncertain what, if any, effect several
local ballot propositions could have on the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Because the primary is open to all 6.7 registered Michigan
voters, regardless of party registration, Bush supporters were
concerned about a call from a Detroit minister to back McCain as a
way of showing no confidence in Engler, Bush's state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign released the text of a recorded message left
on a voter's telephone answering machine. The caller, who claims to
be the Rev. Pat Robertson, exhorts voters to participate Tuesday
and criticizes McCain's campaign-finance proposal and his attitude
toward the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign released a McCain mailing telling Democrats
that they could vote Tuesday and still be permitted to participate
in ``future Democratic Party political activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign sounded similar warnings about Democratic
crossover votes in South Carolina, where conservatives ended up
outnumbering Democrats and independents and costing McCain
significant support.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the presidential candidates, Detroiters will vote
on two library tax propositions.
</P>
<P>
   Other local governments will vote on additional fiscal measures.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Ferndale, a Detroit suburb, will act on a measure that
would repeal a gay civil rights ordinance passed last year by the
city council but referred to the electorate by opponents. A
Detroit-area gay newspaper carried a story this week in which gay
activists urged a vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush launched his assault on Gore, the Democratic presidential
front-runner, while speaking to the elite business group, a
traditional stop for presidents and presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that Gore has called the environmental impact of the
internal combustion engine in cars a ``mortal threat to the
security of every nation,'' and has called for a ban on such
engines in less than 25 years, Bush said: ``I look forward to Vice
President Gore coming into your city to explain to the workers
about why his statements about the automobile engine made sense,''
Bush said. ``I look forward to him standing up there and saying,
`My vision for America is: You won't be working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes clean air can be achieved through
leadership instead of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sue our way to clean air. We can't regulate our way
to clean air. We can have a president who works with stake-holders
to lead our way to clean air,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the economic club that his administration will reflect
the diversity of America.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his lead foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice,
Bush said: ``Who is she? She's a brilliant lady who happens to be
African-American. But I want to emphasize brilliant lady first,''
Bush said. ``I want to reflect America in my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked on a Detroit radio show Monday about the
controversy that surrounded Bush's first campaign appearance in
South Carolina at Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist religious
institution that bans interracial dating among its students. McCain
didn't visit the school.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been invited, McCain said, ``I would have gone and
told them they were a bunch of idiots for their racial policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that, Geoffrey Fieger, a lawyer who once represented
assisted-suicide Dr. Jack Kevorkian, is running radio commercials
in Detroit attacking him and his state chairman, Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to remind Republicans we can't allow the Kevorkian
lawyers of the world to decide who the Republican nominee is going
to be,'' Bush said.

   MIAMI _ A hearing scheduled for Tuesday to determine whether a
federal court has jurisdiction in the Elian Gonzalez custody case
was expected to be postponed, because the judge handling it was
admitted to a hospital on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be temporarily turned over to Judge Edward B.

Tuesday he is likely to focus on reassigning the case by a random
computer selection and scheduling further hearings, officials in
his chambers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William M. Hoeveler had planned to hear arguments on
Tuesday to decide whether the court could intervene in the case of
6-year-old Elian, who was found clinging to an inner tube in the
Atlantic in November.
</P>
<P>
   The child is at the center of an international fight between his
father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and relatives in Miami. Last
month, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ordered the
return of the boy to his father, but relatives took the case to
court to block the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exactly sure what will happen tomorrow,'' said Roger
Bernstein, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, including Lazaro
Gonzalez, a great-uncle who is caring for Elian. ``But we've been
told that we should be prepared to argue tomorrow so we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development Monday, Manuel Gonzalez, another of
Elian's great-uncles, told reporters that he was also seeking
temporary custody of the boy. His lawyer, Jeffery Leving, said
Gonzalez had filed a petition to intervene in federal court on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy's father is the only person who is allowed to speak
for Elian, and he has asked that Elian stay with Manuel until he
can be returned to Cuba,'' Leving said. ``I think the court should
honor and respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who has maintained a low profile throughout the
custody battle, is in disagreement with the other Miami relatives,
including his brother Lazaro.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly meeting with Lazaro Monday afternoon and speaking
to reporters, Manuel Gonzalez complained of chest pains and was
taken to a hospital. A hospital spokesman said he was in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler, 77, was admitted to a hospital in a Miami suburb on
Sunday morning, after being unable to move his right arm and leg
and having slurred speech. He was reported in stable condition
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler's illness is likely to mean that the case will be
assigned for the third time. At first, a court computer had
assigned Judge James Lawrence King the case, but King recused
himself because of possible conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The case was then turned over to Hoeveler, who is well known
around the Miami community for presiding over the trial of the
Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.

 &HT;    Seanez healthy, and grown up
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The Braves' new minor-league pitching
coordinator, Rick Adair, probably has the clearest persective on
how far Rudy Seanez has come.
</P>
<P>
   Adair was a pitching coach in the Indians organization in
Seanez's first year in professional baseball. The 17-year-old had a
thick neck, arms busting out of his jersey and a 100 mph fastball
as he set off on his professional baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez threw nothing but hard and wild. Adair watched him throw
a no-hitter that year in which he walked eight batters. The manager
was ready to take Seanez out after the eighth inning, not even
aware of the no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   And while that kind of intimidation could work against
minor-league hitters, it took another dozen years before Seanez
figured out how to get major-league hitters out on a consistent
basis. And much of what he learned, he says, came when he signed
with the Braves in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really opened my eyes to what you can do as far as
changing speeds and getting control of the strike zone,'' Seanez
said. ``When I got here, I realized I didn't have to throw
everything 100 percent. I could back it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been the best two years of his career. His 56
appearances last year were a career high. He has kept his ERA close
to 3.00 _ 2.75 in 1998 and 3.35 in 1999 _ in consecutive seasons
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   He has been healthier too, compared with what he had been
through before he came to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez went on the disabled list each of the past two
Septembers, and last year it cost him the postseason. But since
then, the stress fracture in his elbow has had time to heal, his
bone spurs have been removed surgically, and Seanez says he is
feeling stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Adair, who has been watching Seanez up close in camp for the
first time since 1986, likes what he sees. ``He's a whole lot
smaller, but he has a lot more control,'' he said. ``He's just
grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Seanez is still strong, but he doesn't look like
a body-builder. He has a much simpler delivery, with a side step
instead of a giant leg kick.
</P>
<P>
   His fastball usually hovers in the low- to mid-90s. But he
throws both a slider and a change-up for strikes. Instead of giving
hitters the fastballs they would expect, Seanez can throw his
offspeed pitches in a fastball count.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez said he learned it from watching not just Greg Maddux,
Tom Glavine and John Smoltz but such younger pitchers as Derrin
Ebert, Damian Moss, Bruce Chen, Kerry Ligtenberg and Mike Cather,
when he first signed with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing they didn't overexert themselves on every single
pitch,'' Seanez said, ``I was thinking, `What am I doing here? No
way I can do what those kids are doing.' Young kids, so polished.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the really tough part,'' he said, ``having faith and
belief in yourself that you can change.''

BLUE WALL OF SOLIDARITY AT DIALLO TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Shoulder to shoulder, they crowd the courtroom's back pews. They
are almost all white, almost all male. Many of them wear the
blue-and-white button that makes plain their purpose: ``Free the
Bronx 4.''
</P>
<P>
   They are New York City police officers who have come north to
Albany to express solemn support for the four officers charged with
shooting to death Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black immigrant, in the
Bronx last February. And their solidarity hovers over the murder
case, the way their cigarette smoke permeates the court from a back
room long after breaks in the trial have ended.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are scheduled to begin Tuesday in the case,
which has riveted the rank and file more than any police trial in
recent memory _ including last year's Abner Louima case, in which
an officer admitted torturing a Haitian immigrant with a broom
handle in a Brooklyn precinct station house. That was a disgraceful
aberration, many officers say. This, however, ``could have happened
to any one of us,'' said Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   And because the four officers took the stand in their own
defense, the nationally televised trial has also given civilians a
rare glimpse into authentic police culture. It was there in the
constant concern for the safety of one's partner, there in the
lingo: ``no man's land,'' ``funhouse,'' ``field inspection.'' It
was there in the implication that few know the feeling of venturing
into the night with a gun and memories of a bible known as the
patrol guide.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have portrayed the four defendants _ Officers Sean
Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy _ as
reckless, even callous. They present a disturbing case: Four burly
men in street clothes, all wearing bulletproof vests, all armed and
all white, confront a slim, unassuming and unarmed black man
outside his apartment building one night. In a few moments he is
dead, hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired.
</P>
<P>
   But in well-rehearsed testimony last week, the four officers
described a rapid succession of events that they said led to a
tragic mistake, not a crime. They said Diallo peered up and down
the street, did not respond to the commands of approaching
officers, turned away, frantically reached into his pocket and
pulled out a black object.
</P>
<P>
   They said that Carroll yelled ``Gun!'' and that McMellon tripped
backward, as though he had been shot. All four officers fired their
weapons, with Carroll and McMellon emptying their 9mm handguns by
shooting 16 bullets each. Next to Diallo's outstretched hand was a
black wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has also tried to portray the four defendants as
normal citizens who happen to serve in a paramilitary operation.
For all the cockiness of the Street Crime Unit (its motto is ``We
own the night''), each officer admitted to fearing death that
night. All four said they believed they had been caught in what
officers call ``no man's land'' _ without cover, in front of a man
they thought had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' Boss recalled thinking, ``I'm going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James J. Fyfe, a nationally recognized criminologist, former
New York City police officer and frequent critic of the police,
interviewed the officers and chose to testify in their defense. He
said that from the moment two officers approached Diallo to the
moment that one of them wept over his bullet-riddled body, the
police followed proper procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-officer turned to the jury to reveal a semi-secret of
police work: ``Their whole job is dealing with uncertainty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The potential danger of the unknown is drilled into the officers
at the Police Academy. Two of the defendants recalled training at
the ``funhouse,'' an apartment building rife with gunmen and other
faux dangers. When a prosecutor asked whether the training included
learning to distinguish between guns and innocuous objects, Carroll
said: ``The only objects they ever pulled on us were firearms. In
every incident we were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty is especially prevalent in the Street Crime Unit, a
police division whose tactics seem to be on trial as much as four
of its members. The unit has become particularly aggressive under
the Giuliani administration in trying to anticipate crime with
constant patrols and ``field inspections,'' the stopping and
frisking of people suspected of carrying guns.
</P>
<P>
   Given the unit's mission, its defenders say, Diallo's mere
action of looking up and down a street was enough for Carroll to
tell his partner to back up the car _ to say, ``I have something on
my right.''
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors argued that the police had no real reason to
approach Diallo, Carroll and McMellon looked puzzled, as if to say:
This is what we do. ``I took an oath to protect and serve,''
Carroll explained, ``not to sit and watch, not to pass by.''
</P>
<P>
   That oath includes protecting fellow officers, the defendants
said, an interpretation that figures in their explanation that
McMellon's fall prompted their fusillade. ``I had to seek cover and
defend my fallen brother,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternal bond among the police has often led to the
so-called blue wall of silence, the intense pressure among officers
not to testify against their own. In the Diallo case, the four
officers have sidestepped questions about who among them fired
first. But prosecutors have generally encountered a blue wall of a
different kind, one in which officers used almost identical
language to defend their actions that night.
</P>
<P>
   The best example centers on the lighting in the vestibule where
Diallo was killed. Several witnesses for the prosecution, including
a couple of officers, have said that overhead lights illuminated
the vestibule _ enough, the prosecutors suggest, for the four
officers to discern a wallet from a gun. But the defense cleaved to
another description.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dimly lit area,'' McMellon said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said, ``In my observation it was dimly lit.'' When asked
by a prosecutor whether there was a light in the vestibule, he said
he did not know. ``It was dimly lit,'' he repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to that language, however, seemed to trip up Sgt.
Robert Patelli, a Street Crime Unit colleague of the defendants who
arrived on the scene after the shooting. ``It was dimly lit,'' he
said. ``The lighting was poor, to the best of my recollection.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to vividly describe a distraught Carroll, hunched
over Diallo's body in the vestibule. The officer's face was red, he
said, and his eyes were welling with tears. But when a prosecutor
questioned how he could see such detail in a dimly lighted
vestibule, Patelli backpedaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I remember seeing it in the vestibule,'' he
said. It must have been in the street, he added, after Carroll was
led away from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution
had no choice but to reluctantly comply _ and come perilously close
to treading traitorous ground.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Kevin Cantwell, a prosecution witness and the first officer
to arrive after the shooting, managed to fulfill both his legal
obligations and fraternal expectations by painting an emotional and
sympathetic picture of four traumatized officers. Watchful officers
in the back of the room later praised his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Bell, a prosecution witness and a young cadet in the
Police Academy, found himself under the fraternity's intense
scrutiny even before he could join it.
</P>
<P>
   Bell testified that shortly before the shooting, he walked down
Wheeler Avenue toward his home and spotted Diallo standing in front
of an apartment building. At some point, he said, he crossed to the
opposite side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers tried to get Bell to say he crossed the street
because he feared the stranger, Diallo. But Bell insisted that
another fear of urban life altered his course: he wanted to avoid
the rats that scurry through the garbage outside a particular
building.
</P>
<P>
   The police cadet also testified that he later heard a pause of
three to five seconds in the gunfire _ the longest that any witness
remembered, and a time lapse that prosecutors suggest should have
allowed the officers to determine that Diallo posed no threat.
Finally, Bell disputed the way that Detective Peter Schumacher, an
internal affairs investigator, had transcribed an interview with
him the night after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The officers in the back of the courtroom did not appreciate
Bell's testimony. ``Arrogant,'' one of them muttered.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days after Bell's appearance, Schumacher took the
stand as a defense witness. A defense lawyer sardonically asked him
whether, during his investigation into the shooting, he had seen
any rats on Wheeler Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   No, the detective said stoically. He had not.

FCC DEBATES WHO SHOULD PAY FOR CELL-PHONE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes 2nd graf. Inserts new 3rd graf. Changes 2 grafs
beginning ``The wireless carriers ...'') 
(lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A debate is raging at the Federal Communications Commission
about whether cellular telephone customers should pay to receive
calls as well as to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular companies, hoping to make wireless phones a viable,
everyday alternative to the desk phone, have pressed for new rules
that would allow them to bring wireless calls under the same
``calling party pays'' system used with the traditional telephone
network.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional local phone companies, which benefit from the
current system, see far less need to change the rules. And some
consumer groups argue that a change would mean higher rates for
regular phone customers.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC had been scheduled to vote on final rules for such a
system last Thursday, giving cellular companies the option of
adopting caller-pays billing systems. But the vote was canceled
amid continued wrangling among commissioners, lobbyists and staff
members. The commission could still reach a decision over the next
few weeks, but with heavy lobbying from all sides, the process
could well stretch into the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the wireless industry's ability to become a true
competitor in the $100 billion local communications business. More
than 80 million American consumers now use wireless phones, but
only for very few of them has wireless become a true replacement
for the standard home telephone.
</P>
<P>
   When the telephone rings at home, people in the United States
generally answer without worrying about fees. Unless the call is
made ``collect,'' any charges will be the responsibility of the
person who placed the call.
</P>
<P>
   But as anyone with a cellular phone knows, wireless subscribers
almost invariably pay for incoming as well as outgoing calls. That
is a big reason that many wireless users do not give their numbers
to others and generally leave their phones off.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the rise of so-called ``one rate'' plans, pioneered by
AT&AMP;T, which eliminate roaming fees and long-distance charges,
subscribers still pay for incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residential local phone markets remain generally de
facto monopolies, dominated by the regional Bell companies and a
handful of independent operators including GTE Corp., which has
agreed to merge with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and wireless executives believe that eliminating
wireless fees for incoming calls _ as most other countries have
done _ could go a long way toward making wireless carriers viable
long-term competitors to local phone monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a level playing field with the local phone
companies,'' Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of Sprint Corp.'s
wireless unit, Sprint PCS, said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at almost every other country in the world, they
all have calling-party pays as a standard. In those countries where
you have calling-party pays, you have a much higher percentage of
people giving out their number and using it for inbound calls. In
this country there is a lot more hesitancy to give out the
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless carriers are not prohibited from offering calling-party
pays. But with the FCC having spent the last few years studying the
issue, few carriers have been willing to bring such plans broadly
into the market until they know what the commission's national
rules will be.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's wireless unit, for instance, began a trial
program in Delaware last November called ``Call Me,'' but has not
expanded the plan past a ``couple of thousand'' subscribers,
according to a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   As a general proposition, many of the communications
commissioners appear to agree that fostering calling-party pays
could increase overall competition between wired and wireless phone
operators, according to people close to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But there are big hurdles concerning consumer protection and the
internal financial structure of a caller-pays system that must be
cleared before any consensus can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding consumers, the most important issue is to make sure
that people who dial a wireless subscriber who uses a caller-pays
plan are made aware that they will be charged, and how much.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who makes a conventional telephone call from the United
States to, say, Kazakhstan, is not told the charges. But the caller
presumably has a reasonable expectation that the fee will be
substantial, if only because of making an international call to a
place so far away.
</P>
<P>
   The complication posed by a caller-pays system in the wireless
sector is that a call to what appears to be a local number could in
fact incur big per-minute ``roaming'' fees because the user is
traveling on the other side of the continent. Without some sort of
notification, the caller would have no way of knowing about those
fees until a bill arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless carriers appear to be in favor of less notification
rather than more. For example, Sukawaty said consumers could
eventually be informed by a simple tone that the call they were
placing was to a wireless number that would incur a charge.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where the caller-pays system is generally the rule,
wireless phone numbers often include one or two digits more than do
traditional lines. So while European callers do not generally hear
a notification message, the additional digit indicates that
additional fees may apply.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, many communications experts say it would
not be feasible to add another digit to wireless numbers, if only
because the cost of modifying communications switches across the
nation could be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   It is also somewhat simpler for European carriers to implement
caller-pays systems, because most wireless companies in Europe own
nationwide licenses, reducing the prevalence of roaming fees. In
the United States, few wireless carriers own licenses for the
entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is thought to be leaning toward a substantial
notification system _ one that would require that a caller hear a
message indicating what the charge will be and that would give the
caller an opportunity to disconnect before incurring any fees at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the conventional local phone companies appear to hope
that extensive notification messages would discourage people from
calling wireless subscribers who use a calling-party-pays plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other major issue that stands in the way of consensus on a
caller-pays system is one that would not be obvious to most
consumers but which is vitally important for the carriers: billing.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, local phone companies are no longer obliged to
include the services of other companies on their bills. That is why
some consumers now receive separate bills from their local and
long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Extending that logic, some local phone giants are arguing before
the commission that they should not be obliged to include charges
on their bills for calls their customers make to wireless phones
under a caller-pays system.
</P>
<P>
   If that argument succeeded, it could mean that consumers might
receive separate bills from various wireless carriers. Or,
alternatively, they could be forced to use a credit card to make
such calls in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   All of the complications strike some consumer advocates as
ridiculous. They argue that people who choose wireless phones
should pay for their use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is one of the silliest ideas to hit the policy
arena,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office
of Consumers Union, a consumer-advocacy group. ``The notion that
people who don't use wireless phones should pay extra to reach
people who are using the new technology is just absurd.''

EDITORIAL: PRIVACY ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet matures, preserving user privacy and anonymity
is becoming a significant problem. Technology now makes it possible
for online businesses and advertisers to turn the Internet into a
realm where activities and habits are monitored and recorded,
largely without consumer knowledge or consent. Unless businesses
can protect privacy, the erosion of trust could seriously harm
e-commerce as well as cause the public to become wary about using
the Internet for education, research and other important
non-commercial functions.
</P>
<P>
   In the offline world, a big part of personal privacy is simply
the freedom to remain a face in the crowd. No one tracks a shopper
as he visits various stores in a mall or keeps notes on what
products he looks at. But in cyberspace, that shopper's behavior _
which Web sites he visits, and which ads he clicks on _ can all be
instantly recorded and compiled, albeit through computer-based
identifiers rather than by name. Most consumers have little idea
that unseen advertising networks on the Internet track their
movements across multiple Web sites. Most do not know that Web
sites can collect and sell data about them. But consumer concerns
are rising, and businesses are getting worried about a privacy
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an
advocacy group, filed a complaint against DoubleClick with the
Federal Trade Commission, alleging unfair trade practices in its
tracking of the online activities of millions of Internet users.
DoubleClick, the leading Internet advertising company, places ads
for its clients on about 1,500 Web sites _ including many of the
most heavily used sites such as AltaVista _ that are part of the
DoubleClick network. When a computer user views an ad on a network
site, DoubleClick places a ``cookie'' file on the user's computer
hard drive that carries a unique identifying number. The cookie
allows DoubleClick to monitor the user's computer _ though without
being able to identify the user by name or address _ whenever he
visits a network site, and note the content he is viewing to
deliver a targeted ad that is customized to a user's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Last year DoubleClick acquired Abacus Direct, a company that has
a vast database of millions of names, addresses and other personal
information collected by the nation's largest direct-mail
catalogues. Now DoubleClick is building a new online version of
Abacus, and will be able to match personally identifiable
information on purchasers collected by the online Abacus with
DoubleClicks' data on those individuals' subsequent Web activities.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick says it will give users the opportunity to opt out
of this matching. But privacy advocates fear that this kind of data
collection will become widespread in cyberspace, and that personal
information _ from browsing habits to the research one might do on
the Web _ could potentially be released to employers, insurers and
others. Industry's answer to these worries is self-regulation and
the creation of privacy policies. Unfortunately, even good policies
are largely unenforceable. A new study by the California HealthCare
Foundation of 21 major health-related Web sites found that many
violated their own stated privacy policies, and shared personal
information collected from visitors without their permission.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to give users easier ways to block the
collection of information. DoubleClick, responding to public
criticism, has begun a campaign to tell users how to opt out of
tracking. The World Wide Web Consortium, the group that designs
standards for the Web, is creating a new way for Web sites to
transmit the site's privacy policy automatically, and allow users
to signal only the information they are willing to share.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several Internet privacy bills have been introduced in
Congress. Businesses are concerned that government regulations
could hinder the Internet's dynamism. Many users may want to
receive ads aimed at their interests. But all users should get a
meaningful choice about how personal data are collected and used.
Maintaining privacy will be integral to the Internet's future, if
only because consumers need to feel safe enough to participate.

TRADING IN THE NCAA STRAITJACKET
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those still counting, Monday's loss to the Knicks made 20
defeats for Lamar Odom and the Los Angeles Clippers in their last
21 games. At least Odom got paid, and no one cared what mode of
transportation he used to get himself home.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Odom never did get his driver's license, so he didn't
have the problem that provoked the National College Athletic
Association to tow Erick Barkley in for an interview and to start
checking under the hood of the St. John's basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick it out, finish the year and go from there,'' Odom said,
offering advice for Barkley, one New York City prodigy to another.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley would be following Odom's sad excuse for a pro team into
Madison Square Garden, St. John's coming out of what it hopes is a
sanction-proof bunker Monday night to blast defending national
champion Connecticut, 79-64. Odom, the 20-year-old pro from St.
John's territory, the Jamaica section of Queens, didn't want to
sound as if he was lecturing Barkley, two years his senior. He did
sound confident that Barkley will have had enough of an education
when this process is over, and will realize it is high time to ``go
from there'' to the National Basketball Association draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, this is the reason why kids are going
to the NBA,'' he said. ``The situation with the high school coaches
and the AAU coaches and the college coaches _ a lot of it gets out
of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   When Odom was trying to dribble his way through the hypocrisy of
amateurism in academia, a national magazine suggested that some of
his test scores might have involved sleight of hand, resulting in
an NCAA inquiry. ``The best time of my life,'' the rookie
nonetheless said of his time-share at Rhode Island, before the
Clippers fell to the Knicks, 87-76, in front of a decaffeinated
holiday crowd that didn't wake up until the last six minutes, when
the Knicks fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to having these romantic notions mostly because his
college team didn't lose 20 out of 21, he got to experience March
Madness and navigating the campus without a set of wheels was
almost as doable as it was in New York. But the reality of
amateurism was that he attended three schools as a high school
senior and had an ill-fated courtship with the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas that produced only a citation for soliciting a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   At Rhode Island, he worked his way to eligibility only to have
his one-season college career screech to a halt when he hired an
agent before he was certain he wanted to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   This climactic development ended three years of headlines that
flashed across the college basketball sky, with all the
stereotypical rumblings. But Odom was here to tell Barkley not to
despair, not to worry, because it can all go away with the first
no-look pro pass for an uncontested dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Odom scored 30 points and had a bundle of assists in his first
game for the Clippers, and was immediately heralded as the next
Magic Johnson, a good kid after all. It helped that he is 6 foot
10, with a point guard's handle and eye for the game and a knack
for getting right to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't judge a person and everything they're going through
at 17 or 18,'' he said. ``If you do, you have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   While right-minded adults would have to agree, Mike Jarvis,
Barkley's suddenly crusading mentor, has been on a mission to
vilify the NCAA for trampling the young man's reputation. What
Jarvis should understand is that most people are way past judging
individual players who break the arcane governing rules of a sport
that is philosophically corrupt. Removed from the cesspool, no one
will care, or much recall, that Erick Barkley swapped a car, any
more than they remember Marcus Camby's collegiate missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis should be more concerned about what a sport like college
basketball is doing for the collective reputation of young
African-American men, too often cast as academic losers who would
trade their future for trinkets. Would the legion of white hockey
jocks hold up under such scrutiny? Doubtful, but their
developmental system for the pros does not require a minimum
College Board score.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone profits in college basketball except the kids who don't
belong in college or can only pretend to live the life of a student
even if they wish to. In the case of Lamar Odom, his coach at Rhode
Island (Jim Harrick) used the player's talent to land a bigger job
at Georgia. And his third coach during his senior year of high
school (Jerry DeGregorio) somehow wound up as the coach at Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story, in a nutshell.

TICKET DEMAND SURGES FOR FINAL SHOWS OF `CATS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 7,251 performances _ and more lives than even
the hardiest feline could reasonably expect _ New York has still
not had its fill of ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the show's producers confirmed that the musical,
which opened at the Winter Garden Theater in 1982 and has been
there ever since, will have its final performance on June 25. The
announcement has sparked a surge in ticket sales, theater spokesmen
said, surprising even the people who helped turn Broadway's
longest-running production into one of the city's most enduring and
lucrative attractions.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 tickets were sold on Sunday and Monday, for a
sales total of $380,000, said Bill Evans, the show's publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's way, way more than many, many Sundays and Mondays in
the last several months,'' Evans said exultantly, adding that sales
total $20,000 on a typical Sunday, and $50,000 to $75,000 on a
typical Monday. ``There's been a huge response.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the show's producers have been concerned that
the pool of people who had not yet seen ``Cats'' was slowly drying
up. Indeed, it would have seemed impossible to round up 500 _ let
alone 5,000 _ human beings who had either never witnessed the
musical or wanted to witness it again. ``Cats'' has been produced
in 30 countries and seen by an estimated 50 million people
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But as a testament to the idea that you can never get enough of
a good thing, a veritable stampede of tourists, returnees and the
uninitiated swamped the Winter Garden's box office Sunday
afternoon, waiting in lines that stretched out the door and down
the block. ``It was a madhouse,'' one ticket agent said. ``I saw
it. It was absolutely nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were only scattered clumps of ticket buyers at the
Broadway theater Monday, Evans, the publicist, said the phone lines
were busy all day. And there were enough people waiting in line to
suggest that if the producers had decided to continue their run of
``Cats,'' the show's motto _ ``Now and Forever'' _ could eventually
prove true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the headline a few days ago about the closing,'' said
Ted Conway of New Canaan, Conn., who drove to Manhattan Monday
morning with his wife and three daughters, ``and said, `We've got
to go see this thing before it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Conway, his wife, Erin, and his daughters Emily, 5, and Julia,
4, got seats for a performance on April 1. Abigail, 15 months old,
was not invited. ``I guess in her lifetime, she's not going to see
the show,'' Conway said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lourdes Estrella, a tourist from the Philippines, saw ``Cats''
several years ago but bought two tickets Monday, one for herself
and one for her 13-year-old son, Andrew, who was not even born when
the show made its debut. She said she wanted Andrew to be able to
say that he, too, had seen the musical, a melodic gloss on T.S.
Eliot's ``Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' composed by Andrew
Lloyd Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't want to miss it,'' said Estrella, 42. ``We
listen to it all the time at home. We're never tired of the
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Shara Walker, 9, of Upper Marlboro, Md., was sitting in her
hotel room in Manhattan on Sunday night when she heard the news on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``So she said, `Mommy, I want to see it before it goes away,'''
said her mother, Denise Walker. ``We spent $225 on three tickets
for her, myself and her father. But it's worth it. We want our
daughter to be into the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Karchuk, a self-described procrastinator and chemist
vacationing in the city from Ukraine, said Monday that he had
waited four days after arriving to visit the Statue of Liberty, but
wanted to act fast when he heard that ``Cats'' was closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything else my thought was, `What's the rush? New
York is not going away,''' Karchuk said. ``But I have no idea when
I will be back. I had to get my tickets today.''

CHECHEN REFUGEES TELL OF CIVILIAN MASSACRE BY RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to identify Bouckaert in 3rd-to-last graf of 2nd take.)  
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia _ Refugees trickling out of Chechnya into the
makeshift camps that pock the Caucasus foothills near Nazran are
bringing stories of what could be one of the worst civilian
massacres to date in the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   They charge that ``kontraktniki'' _ Russian men hired by the
army to fight in Chechnya _ staged a drunken rampage of looting and
gunfire through the tiny, bombed-out, straw-brick homes of a
neighborhood in the Chechen capital of Grozny called Aldi. They say
the mercenaries executed women and elderly men and burned houses
and animal pens to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Russians left, carting away furniture, jewelry
and money on loaded-down armored personnel carriers, dozens if not
scores of residents had perished, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors also tell the story of how Zina Labazaneva died,
and of how a woman she never met, a 40-ish mother of teenagers
named Sapiyat, helped give her peace in death, because that first
Saturday in February there was no relative to wash Labazaneva, wrap
her in a white shroud and lay her in her grave.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen witnesses of what happened in Aldi that day _
though not Sapiyat _ have been interviewed by the New York-based
organization Human Rights Watch, which has compiled what it calls a
credible list of 30 victims in Aldi. Other survivors have
circulated a list of 82 dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after all this is finished, and we are out, we know that
115 were killed,'' Sapiyat, a tall, hollow-eyed woman in a long
print dress and owlish glasses, said between sobs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way yet to verify any of these figures, much less
the circumstances of the deaths. The Russian government has denied
that its troops have engaged in atrocities, and has called such
reports malicious propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   While refugees seem to have been generally safe from retribution
for their statements, virtually all have refused to give their full
names in interviews with reporters. One refugee was reported
arrested this week after complaining in an interview about abuses
in a Russian-run detention camp near Grozny. Neither Sapiyat's full
name nor her precise location are used in this article.
</P>
<P>
   In a long interview in one of Nazran's many refugee huddles,
where she arrived not long ago, Sapiyat said she is alive today
because of where she lived _ on Almaznaya Street, the very last in
a warren of curving, interlocking lanes that make up the Aldi
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of January, Russian troops pressing their final
assault on Grozny began bombarding Aldi almost around the clock
with artillery and airstrikes. The Islamic guerrillas who
controlled the area left on Jan. 29, but the bombing continued for
three more days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, suddenly, it became calm,'' Sapiyat said. ``And the
troops started mopping up. We thought they would just check
everyone's passports. But it was a cleansing of everything alive.
They killed cattle, dogs, people _ children and old people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Saturday, Feb. 5. Sapiyat said she did not witness what
occurred, because she was hiding in her two-room house, listening
to the shouts and gunfire outside, watching the flames and smoke of
homes burning nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But survivors and other witnesses who gathered afterwards told
the story: A convoy of soldiers, in tanks and armored personnel
carriers, began moving up and down the streets of Aldi, tossing
grenades in cellars where families were hiding, forcing residents
onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   At various stops, they demanded money, gold and other valuables.
Those who resisted were shot. Sometimes those who gave were shot as
well.
</P>
<P>
   On Voronezhskaya Street, three members of the Musayev family,
from 27 to 76 years old, were said to have been shot dead. At least
three more _ a father and two sons _ died on Bryansky Street. At 88
Zemlyansky St., two sons died, only two days after burying their
mother in their yard.
</P>
<P>
   On Second Zemlyansky Pereulok, Yan Sultanovich, onetime
administrator of Aldi, was shot in his yard. On Third Zemlyansky,
Adurahman Tasuyev, 51, and Ziyardi Akhmerzuyev, about 44, were shot
in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   On Mesayev Street, said one survivor interviewed by Human Rights
Watch _ a woman too frightened to be publicly named _ 75-year-old
Akhmed Abulkhonov rushed from his home to volunteer 300 rubles in
tribute. The soldiers threw it in his face, the witness said.
</P>
<P>
   He ran into his house and returned with $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have dollars and you only wanted to give us rubles,'' the
survivor quoted one soldier as saying. By her account, they beat
Abulkhonov and shot him, set his cattle shed afire, then roped his
hysterical daughter, Lucia, to a personnel carrier and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Zina Labazaneva, single and in her early 50s, lived on Mesayev
Street, too, with her brother Husein. Exactly what befell them is
unclear. Sapiyat, several streets away, knows only this much:
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and were standing with our passports outside,''
she said. ``I saw a soldier come; he wasn't a regular, but a
kontraktnik. And then a whole herd came. The soldier shot his gun
around the street'' _ she made a side to side motion _ ``and said,
`Everyone go into your houses.'''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, she said, were very drunk. ``They didn't come into
the houses on the last street. They were probably tired of looting
and killing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midafternoon silence, as survivors collected to exchange
rumors, a woman approached Sapiyat and begged her to come to
Mesayev Street. Her neighbors were dead, she said, and she needed
help in washing a woman's body for burial.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cardinal rule of Islam that no one should go to his
grave unclean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I can't; I'm too afraid,'' Sapiyat said. Two months
earlier, as she helped wash the bodies of two other victims of an
artillery attack, a shell landed nearby, sending shrapnel into the
room and killing another woman. But the woman insisted. Sapiyat
agreed, and her 16-year-old daughter demanded to accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I went to Mesayev Street, and I saw corpses outside,''
she said. ``There was a man whose brains could be seen. There were
a brother and sister killed, and he was an invalid. It was
definitely gunfire. The bullets had gone through them.''
</P>
<P>
   And inside the little brick house where the neighbor took them
lay Labazaneva and her brother. Sapiyat said the woman looked
perhaps five years younger than her age. Her hair was dyed dark,
though tinges of gray showed through. Two rows of automatic rifle
bullets marched across her body, one at her chest, another at the
abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Sapiyat, her daughter and the neighbor undressed the dead woman,
bathed her and wrapped her in a white cloth from the neighbor's
house. Then, she said, Zina Labazaneva and her brother were buried
in their front yard, side by side with Abulkhonov and another man.hey worked two hours. And then Sapiyat and her daughter began
the walk home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the neighbor to run home very quickly, that it was
still dangerous,'' she said. ``We had to go across Voronezhskaya
Street. We saw two armored vehicles on one side, and two tanks on
the other, and so we ran back, looking for places to hide. All the
gates were locked. We found a hole in a wooden fence, and so we got
in and waited in a bathroom for everyone to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, she said, Russian military commanders
rounded up the men in the area, gave them their confiscated
passports and told them to forget that they had ever seen each
other.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Sapiyat left Grozny for good. ``I couldn't bear it
anymore. I had to leave for my children and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bouckaert, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the
organization has not yet published its investigation of the Aldi
events or notified the Russian government of its findings. It was
not possible to reach Russian officials for comment Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir V. Putin named a senior official last week to
investigate complaints of atrocities like the ones alleged at Aldi.
Bouckaert indicated that he is likely to be busy for some time to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are returning to their homes to find their relatives
shot to death all over the city,'' he said. ``What happened in the
last two weeks are the most severe abuses we've seen in the war.
It's as if a sledgehammer was slammed into Grozny after soldiers
took the place.''

   KEYES MAKES MICHIGAN ROUNDS: Alan Keyes campaigned Monday in
Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo, both strongholds of Michigan's
religious right, in advance of the state's Republican primary
Tuesday. He has been making television appearances and radio
appeals and held a rally at Western Michigan University in
Kalamazoo, where about 700 supporters turned up, said a
spokeswoman, Connie Hair. Tuesday, Keyes plans to appear in
Detroit, where he started his Michigan campaign swing on Saturday,
appearing at a Christian school there. He has done no campaigning
in Arizona, the home state of Sen. John McCain, which also holds
its primary on Tuesday. After taking two days off, Keyes plans to
resume his campaign in Virginia, which holds a primary on Feb. 29.

48 percent to 31 percent in Missouri, according to a poll published
on Sunday by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The outlook was even
worse across the Mississippi River in Illinois, where Gore was
holding a lead of 59 percent to 24 percent. Among Republican voters

   STICKING WITH THE HOUSE: After meeting with his fellow

announced on Sunday that he would not seek to unseat Sen. Bill
Frist and become the state's first black senator. For almost a
year, Ford, 29, the second generation of a powerful political
family in Memphis, has traveled the state talking up the idea of
running against Frist, a Republican. His decision not to run was
based in part on the fact that he had not raised enough money for a
campaign against the wealthy incumbent. ``I hope one day to have
the opportunity to serve the entire state of Tennessee,'' he said.
Ford said he would seek re-election to the House and would travel
around the country reaching out to voters under 30 on behalf of
Gore.

EDITORIAL: GERMANY'S TROUBLED CONSERVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Shock waves from Helmut Kohl's illegal fund-raising activities
continue to buffet Germany's main opposition party, the Christian
Democrats. Last week the party was hit with a stiff, $21 million
fine for illegal campaign reporting, and Kohl's hand-picked
successor as party leader, Wolfgang Schauble, announced his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to Europe and America that Germany have a
healthy center-right party to represent conservative voters and
challenge the ruling Social Democrats. A thorough housecleaning
will be required for the Christian Democrats to recover public
trust. But the party should not be so weakened in the process that
the extremist far right has a chance to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats have been a guiding force in postwar
Germany, helping to make the country a stable democracy and
providing the Federal Republic's chancellors for 37 of the past 50
years. But Kohl, who led the Christian Democrats for 25 of those
years and the country for 16, treated the party as his private fief
and helped turn it into a corrupt fund-raising machine.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months prosecutors have discovered that Kohl illegally
raised at least $1 million in the mid-90s, and it now appears that
the party collected tens of millions of dollars in illegal
contributions during the 1980s and 1990s under his leadership. Even
now, Kohl ignores his legal responsibility to identify these
illegal donors. It is clear that for all his impressive
achievements in office, Kohl did his party and country a disservice
by abusing his legal trust and stunting the normal development of
new party leaders not dependent on his favors.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Christian Democrats are paying the price. Last Tuesday
the speaker of Parliament announced the $21 million fine, applying
a formula that assesses the party three times the value of its
illegal contributions. While sending an admirably strong message
about legal accountability, the fine and others that may follow
could seriously crimp the party's ability to campaign. Then came
the resignation of Schauble, who was one of the party's most
experienced leaders but was implicated in the fund-raising
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   His departure leaves no obvious successor. Among the possible
choices when the party convention meets in April are Angela Merkel,
the party general secretary who has pushed for a clean break with
the past, and Volker Ruhe, the former defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats' discomfort will be welcomed by
Germany's small and splintered far-right parties, which have
generally failed to attract more than 5 percent of the national
vote. The example of neighboring Austria demonstrates the
possibility of a breakthrough for xenophobic nationalism if
mainstream conservatism falters. To compete effectively in German
politics, the Christian Democrats need to transform their campaign
practices under credible new leadership.

GORE, BRADLEY BELITTLE EACH OTHER'S COMMITMENT TO BLACKS' ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clashing bitterly over the depth of their commitment
to racial justice, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey
senator Bill Bradley accused each other Monday &UR;  &LR; night of earlier
betraying a bedrock principle they claim to embrace: affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate at the historic Apollo Theatre in Harlem, Bradley
cited a former White House aide's published account that portrayed
Gore, while vice president, advocating ending affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fired back that Bradley had voted against a measure that
would have expanded opportunities for blacks to own radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the showdown, Bradley also thrust before Gore a
list of votes he cast in Congress to protect the tax-exempt status
of Bob Jones University, a school in South Carolina that bans
interracial dating, and called on Gore to explain the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to face up to this if you are going to be a strong
leader,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sounding a little desperate because you're trying to
build yourself up by knocking somebody else down,'' Gore replied,
refusing to accept the document from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The debate unfolded with Bradley desperate for a breakthrough as
he trailed Gore by double digits in polls in all 15 states that
hold primaries on March 7, a day that could effectively end
Bradley's candidacy if he fails to post some significant victories.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere were the stakes higher than in New York, which Bradley
has long considered home turf because of his 10-year career with
the New York Knicks. Bradley, who has made racial unity a
centerpiece of his platform, also badly needed to break Gore's
strong bond with black voters, one of New York's most powerful
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth, and the most contentious, debate between the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore stood about 3 feet apart on the red-carpeted
stage of the Apollo, answering questions from the audience,
viewers, and a panel of three journalists from CNN and Time
magazine. The forum was sponsored by the United Missionary Baptist
Association and an array of community groups and individuals in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was conceived two weeks ago when Bradley attended
services at the Allen AME Church in Queens. The pastor, the Rev.
Floyd Flake, a former congressman, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who
was also there, jointly proposed a debate in the black community,
to which Bradley readily agreed and Gore later signed on to.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore attended a service at his church last week, Flake
endorsed the vice president. Sharpton, who wields considerable
influence among black voters in New York, continues to say he is
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate began, Sharpton said had he endorsed either
candidate, the debate would not have taken place in Harlem because
there would have been no incentive for them to appear there. Asked
if he would make an endorsement after the debate, he said, ``If
somebody knocks me off my feet, but I doubt if that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has seen a steady rise in his poll numbers as coverage
of Republican presidential hopeful John McCain has taken attention
away from his Democratic challenger, was not eager to give Bradley
any free publicity, let alone a platform to peel off black
Democratic primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   Polls say the vice president holds a 2-to-1 advantage over the
former New Jersey senator among black voters in New York. Those
voters constitute nearly a quarter of registered Democratic voters
statewide, and almost half of the party's vote in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley pursued the attack strategy Monday &UR;  &LR; night that he used
to his advantage in their last debate, on Jan. 26 in New Hampshire.
After weeks of absorbing Gore's attacks without retaliating,
Bradley took the offensive in New Hampshire, challenging Gore's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The attack last month thrust Gore onto the defensive and helped
Bradley surge back from a double-digit deficit in the polls to
finish four points behind the vice president in the state's primary
on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley has yet to recover from the defeat, as his campaign
has been all but smothered by the massive media attention given
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Bradley has been relegated to hoping that Bush
will knock out McCain Tuesday in the Michigan primary, clearing the
stage for Bradley to emerge as the last ``reform'' candidate for
the White House. To that end, Bradley hammered Gore Monday &UR;  &LR; night
on his role in the 1996 campaign fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been widely criticized for appearing at a Buddhist
Temple outside Los Angeles in 1996 at which contributions were
allegedly funneled illegally to the Democratic Party. Gore also was
hit for making fund-raising calls from the White House. He drew
even more criticism for arguing that ``no controlling legal
authority'' prohibited the fund-raising activity.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said his attacks on Gore were a prelude to a
speech at Adelphi University Tuesday in which Bradley is expected
to lambaste the vice president over his record as a member of the
House and Senate from Tennessee. Gore's voting record was generally
more conservative than the views he espouses now on issues such as
tobacco regulation, gun control, and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will argue that Gore's congressional record is stronger
evidence of his core convictions than his loyalty to President
Clinton's positions. ``We're going to make the case strongly that
convictions are important, and it's hard to know where Al Gore's
are, if he has any,'' said Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, desperate for momentum before March 7, plans to spend
most of the next week in Washington to try to win that state's
nonbinding primary on Feb. 29. Washington officially picks its
delegates in caucuses on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy will dilute his effort in the 14 other states that
are up for grabs on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have been squabbling for weeks over expanding
their debate schedule before March 7. Bradley had agreed to four
more debates, but Gore has said he would agree to additional forums
only if Bradley would join him in shutting down their television
advertising campaigns, a condition Bradley has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the only remaining debate before the March 7
primaries is scheduled on March 1 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At the Apollo, both candidates tapped allies from the realms of
politics, sports, and entertainment to showcase the depth of their
black support. Bradley brought along Harvard University professor
Cornel West, film director Spike Lee, and former New York Knicks
star Willis Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore brought along some of New York City's black political
elite, including Congressman Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, former
New York Mayor David Dinkins, and New York Comptroller H. Carl
McCall.
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo is famous for, among other things, its amateur night
called Showtime at the Apollo. Some of world's greatest performers
have passed through its doors, and over the years many singers,
musicians, and comedians have walked on its stage, rubbed their
hands against the carved tree bark for good luck, and watched their
fortunes rise or fall with the applause of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo debate was the second that turned the focus of the
Democratic contest on minority issues. As they did several times
Monday &UR;  &LR; night, Gore and Bradley all but tripped over each other
last month in a forum in Iowa to demonstrate their concern for race
relations and civil rights.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's hosting a Middle East television seminar at
Columbia University, but his Upper West Side apartment is
off-limits, hostage to a sub-let until March. Face it, when you've
gone and married your accountant, you no longer get to pour money
into an abode you rarely inhabit. Prudence dictates otherwise, even
if you happen to be Richard Dreyfuss, a movie star with four
decades of celluloid service, and a history of imprudence, under
your belt.
</P>
<P>
   So Dreyfuss _ fresh from shooting the 37th film of his checkered
career, in the jungles of French Guyana with an iffy jaguar and an
anaconda capable of wreaking far more havoc than mere
scene-stealing _ is making do in an under-lit hotel suite just
north of Lincoln Center, in his favorite neighborhood in the city.
</P>
<P>
   No matter if the bathroom is the only room bright enough to
remind him what color his prematurely gray hair _ ``I think that
was just God saying I'm going to give you, at 20, a little clue to
the rest of your life, bing!'' he shrilled, deploying his signature
rat-a-tat sequence of machine gun laughter _ has turned now.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying out a new strawberry blond hue for his upcoming
role as the president (Henry Fonda was the original) in the
live-for-television remake of Fail-Safe, produced by George
Clooney, who will also co-star. As an involved citizen who harbors
``senatorial fantasies''(no need to worry, Hillary, this
celebrity's target is California), Dreyfuss is piqued by the chance
to play president.
</P>
<P>
   And doing live TV is a career first for Dreyfuss (as was working
in a jungle populated ``by bugs as big as your face'' in a country
that will never invite him to promote tourism).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it starts, nothing will stop it, including when you say,
`I forgot my lines,''' he said of the live television project. ``I
think a lot of people are going to tune in like they tune into a
car wreck and say, `Hey, let's see how far out of control HE can
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty far. After spending the '60s and '70s high on one drug or
another, then spoiling his entry to the 90s with what he calls a
``common as dirt mid-life crisis'' and divorce, he is serious about
making up for lost time. And mad at himself for wasting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really understood until recently how my one life that
I will ever have was so desperately damaged by my own behavior,''
he said, one knee clasped for ballast. ``I never shot up, but I
took your garden variety things far too much; I was losing friends
left and right, had a car accident, was arrested, and I publicly
humiliated myself, but I thought I was having a fine time.'' Yes,
he won an Oscar. ``But I should have won two. I was less than I
should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fail-Safe telecast is one of a handful of challenges
Dreyfuss is juggling now that he's sober enough to enjoy juggling
again _ others include two recently wrapped films, a lecture tour
and Tuesday's seminar melding his interest in Israeli politics and
wariness of television as a social policy tool. Here is his take on
television, domestic or not: ``If you don't exercise thought and
scrutiny over television, it will become ever more terrible and
ever more crass and affect us in ever more terrible ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's West Side is where he said he flees from Los Angeles
when he gets the urge to conduct an intelligent conversation about
something besides the movie business. According to him, you can get
arrested for violating L.A.'s one-note conversational code, but
here in New York, where he was born into a left-of-center Jewish
household in Brooklyn 52 years back, anything goes. Including
forgiveness. No sooner does he hit the (``dirty, filthy, crowded'')
sidewalk in his gray suede sneakers and airport-issue Statue of
Liberty baseball cap than ``some 220 pound aesthetically
challenged'' male lumbers up to announce, with authority, ``My wife
says I look just like you!'' Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his Oscar-nominated title role in Holland's Opus _ the
sleeper that exerted such feel-good magic behind the scenes that
its cast spent their evenings bonding in Portland, Oregon's karaoke
bars _ it's come to that: he's an approachable everyman.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dreyfuss, the host and underwriter of ``Opening The
Channels,'' a seminar that assembled TV types from six Mideast
nations Tuesday to discuss that medium's impact on everything from
pop culture to the peace process, is a changed man. Bliss with
Janelle, whom he married last May during a London run of ``The
Prisoner of Second Avenue,'' has helped.
</P>
<P>
   He has recovered from his kamikaze period, the one in which the
Best Actor Oscar for his Goodbye Girl performance at 29 faded like
an unkept promise. Obsessed with operating at peak efficiency,
Dreyfuss the actor-activist has a checklist of things left undone:
travel to the moon, win the Pulitzer Prize, the Nobel Prize, write
a novel and perhaps begin a real-life Senator Holland's Opus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never doubted that I would make it as an actor,'' said
Dreyfuss, who is ``85 percent proud'' of his film resume and 100
percent grateful he did not listen to the critic who said he would
make a better plumber than actor. ``My little rap about this is I
wanted to be an actor, then a movie star, then a senator from
California and then a history teacher. I don't know what's in
store, but I'm always glad I didn't become a plumber.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clifton Daniel, the courtly North Carolinian who
served as managing editor of The New York Times from 1964 to 1969
after a career as a correspondent in wartime London, war-torn
Europe and the Middle East, died Monday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 87 .
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a stroke and heart disease, said
his wife, Margaret Truman Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's long, adventuresome and many-sided professional life
was once summed up in a magazine profile with the headline ``Up
From Zebulon.'' Zebulon was the tiny lumber mill town in
northeastern North Carolina where he was born and reared and where
his parents saved the income from the family drugstore to put him
through college in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   A small-town Southern background was something that Daniel
shared with his predecessor as managing editor, Turner Catledge,
who was from Philadelphia, Miss. And when Daniel was married in
1956, after many footloose years in Europe and the Middle East, it
was to a down-to-earth young woman whose father, like Daniel's, had
worked as a shopkeeper far away from Times Square. The bride was
Margaret Truman, the only child of former President Truman, who had
run a haberdashery in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot in common,'' Daniel wrote in his volume of
reminiscences, ``Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,'' which appeared in
1984. ``We were the kind of people who wouldn't marry anybody our
mothers wouldn't approve of; a couple of citified small-towners,
puritans among the fleshpots.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel rose to be assistant to the managing editor, assistant
managing editor and then managing editor. In that post he was the
senior news executive of the daily Times, outranked only by
Catledge, the executive editor, who oversaw daily and Sunday
departments from a vantage outside the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   As managing editor, Daniel sought to brighten the newspaper with
pungent writing, eye-catching photography and an emphasis on what
many newspaper editors of the time disparaged as ``soft news.''
Daniel intensified the newspaper's treatment of society news, arts
coverage and obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   Society news, which had been mainly dry wedding and engagement
announcements, began to burst with spicy detail, human interest and
social insights. Cultural coverage studied the flaws as well as the
fame of important artists. Obituaries became less reverent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Daniel was succeeded as managing editor by A.M.
Rosenthal and became an associate editor, remaining in New York for
four more years and working in a different area of journalism, as a
commentator on The Times' radio station, WQXR. Then the Daniels
moved to Washington, where Daniel worked as chief of the
newspaper's bureau until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career Daniel had won respect as a foreign
correspondent on some grueling and unsettling assignments for The
Times. In Moscow in 1954 and 1955, for example, he was the only
permanent correspondent of a Western non-Communist newspaper in the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Among his colleagues, Daniel was known for an ability to imbue
his writing with a strong feeling for the places and people he had
seen. Of a drive through the Soviet Union, he wrote that he found
``a Russia that Tolstoy never knew,'' where ``factories seen across
the fields and mines with towering slag heaps are giving off steam
and smoke,'' where ``hitchhikers, creatures of the motor age, are
on the road with bundles and thumbs uplifted,'' while ``strung out
mile after mile along the highway is a convoy of new trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Daniel took his readers to the Bolshoi Theater, ``an
ornate and refurnished relic of 19th-century Russia'' with
``burnished gilt balconies and vivid red draperies,'' where
``Muscovites circled the foyer in pairs between the acts, seeing
and being seen, keeping in line and in step, as if arranging
themselves for a quadrille ... plain people, the women generally in
flowered print dresses, the men in uniforms or the sober garb of
civil servants.''
</P>
<P>
   From Cologne, West Germany, Daniel described carnival time:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the twisting narrow streets that run around the twin spires
of the city's famous cathedral, hundreds of thousands of spectators
swayed, rocked and sang and danced. They cheered the brilliant
costumes ((and)) scrambled for barrelfuls of candy that were thrown
at them. Any girl who could be caught could be kissed and several
policemen were tossed in the air by a gang of young men.''
</P>
<P>
   Breathing New Life Into News Pages
</P>
<P>
   When Daniel became managing editor, he gave a gifted reporter,
Charlotte Curtis, a mandate to write about society as news,
encouraging her to provide shrewd and sometimes impudent reporting
about high society and high life. Curtis continued that society
reporting after she was promoted in 1965 to be the editor of
women's news. Her title was changed in 1971 to family/style editor,
and she held the position until 1974. Curtis worked under Daniel
for nine years, until 1969, and strove to expand coverage of
fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect the
conviction she shared with Daniel that those topics should be
treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that
politics and sports received.
</P>
<P>
   It was Daniel who nurtured the career of The Times' food writer,
Craig Claiborne, and helped him become one of the best-known
restaurant critics in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel also set about improving obituaries in The Times. He
found them written in such a gray, lifeless way that he was said to
have remarked, ``It seemed as though the subjects had never been
alive.'' He sought to make them longer, more authoritative and more
vivid; to help bring that about, he chose Alden Whitman as chief
obituary writer.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman recalled that Daniel told him, ``We interview people
about everything else, why shouldn't we interview them for their
obituaries?'' Daniel encouraged Whitman to travel and talk to
accomplished people solely for their future obituaries, often with
their full knowledge of the purpose. That had rarely been done
before, and Daniel proposed that Whitman begin by interviewing
Daniel's father-in-law, the former president. Soon Whitman found
himself facing Truman, who told him, ``I know why you are here and
I want to help you all I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, Whitman interviewed figures like
Earl Warren, Charles Chaplin, Charles A. Lindbergh, Graham Greene
and Anthony Eden. His method resulted in comprehensive obituaries
that would be written in advance to be ready for publication at
short notice when the subjects died. It also resulted in the
presentation of a special Polk Memorial Award to Whitman in 1980
for ``setting new standards of excellence at what had been a
routine assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Daniel relished his role in expanding The Times' coverage of
arts news. ``Any newspaper that didn't cover a major industry in
its community would be judged derelict,'' he said. ``I thought the
coverage should be conscientious, thoughtful and thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thought that critics working for The Times should not
express their views so vehemently that they seemed to be carrying
on vendettas. And in 1968, when The Times retained a long-haired
culture writer as a rock critic, Daniel enjoyed breaking the news
gently to the well-groomed former Marine who was then the paper's
publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger. ``His name is Mike Jahn,''
Daniel wrote in a note to Sulzberger, ``and he is going to write
pieces on folk/rock music.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel went on to report that another editor had reassured him:
`` Jahn wears his hair in a somewhat bizarre style _ in fact he
looks like a werewolf. But since his work will not require him to
be in the office very much, I don't think he'll bite any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik of Fleet Street and a Wastrel King
</P>
<P>
   Much of Daniel's interest in society and the arts took root
while he was reporting in World War II from London, where he was
remembered not only for his professionalism but also for his
savoir-faire. Indeed, during Daniel's London years, he became known
as the Sheik of Fleet Street. And London tailors made the
fur-lined, karakul-collared greatcoat that he later wore on cold
days in the Soviet Union, where his reporting won him an Overseas
Press Club award.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Daniel's worldliness, his table manners failed to
satisfy the dissolute King Farouk of Egypt. ``Daniel,'' the King
said at a luncheon in Cairo in 1946, ``would you mind not clicking
your fork against your teeth?'' Daniel answered politely enough:
``I'm sorry, sir. I shall try to eat more quietly.'' But two
decades later, in his volume of reminiscences, he observed,
``Farouk's was a wasted life.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing that book in The New York Times, John Brooks said of
Daniel, ``Like a modern Scarlet Pimpernel, he enjoys wearing the
masque of a dandy'' and ``seems intent on playing down the fact
that, dinner parties aside, his has been a life of serious hard
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 book, ``Growing Up With My Grandfather,'' Daniel's
eldest son, Clifton Truman Daniel, wrote, ``Dad is so impeccable
that even in his undershirt he looks almost formal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel did not hesitate to telephone The Times' society news
desk to set the chaps there straight on esoteric details of British
fox-hunting garb.
</P>
<P>
   In two memos long famous within The Times, he listed the exact
gradations of men's formal wear and all their proper accessories.
In one, he distinguished between ``a black silk hat called a top
hat,'' worn at formal daytime occasions with a morning coat or
cutaway, and the kind worn to a formal evening affair with a
tailcoat: ``The hat properly worn with this suit is an opera hat _
a folding silk hat of grosgrain material _ but almost nobody owns
one these day.'' In the other memo, he concluded, ``Finally, it
used to be that formal evening dress along the Persian Gulf or the
Red Sea consisted of black trousers, a cummerbund and a
short-sleeved white shirt with an open collar. It was too hot to
wear a jacket and tie.''
</P>
<P>
   He was aghast when a young reporter confused the names of two
former Saudi monarchs, Ibn Saud and just plain Saud. But veteran
journalists remember Daniel's perceptive coverage of the lives of
ordinary people in the Soviet Union while he was a correspondent.
Admirers say he led the way in presenting American readers, who
were conditioned by Cold War tensions and fears, with a humanized
portrayal of Russian daily life in the period after Stalin's death
in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Elbert Clifton Daniel Jr. was born on Sept. 19, 1912, the son of
Elbert Clifton Daniel and Elvah Jones Daniel and a great-grandson
of Zachariah G. Daniel, an illiterate farmer who came to the United
States from England.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Zebulon had a population of 500. As a teen-ager,
young E.C., as he was known, worked part time for his father, an
enterprising druggist who was mayor of Zebulon, the first person in
town to own a telephone, and later the head of the North Carolina
Pharmaceutical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, in a speech at the University of North Carolina,
Daniel gave this account of how he first became a reporter: ``I
read one of those articles in a boys' magazine on `Choosing a
Career.' It said that if you wanted to be a newspaperman, if you
wanted to write, the best thing to do was to start writing. It
didn't say anything about going to journalism school. It just said,
`Send in something to the local paper.' So I did. As I remember, it
was an account of a basketball game. It got printed. Having one
item published was enough to convince me that I was God's gift to
journalism. I was pretty soon writing all the local news in The
Record during summer vacations from school.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalism School Was a Drugstore
</P>
<P>
   Working in the drugstore, Daniel told his audience, ``was a
lucky coincidence, because there was no better place in the town to
gather news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief of police and the deputy sheriff used to hang around
there all the time,'' Daniel continued. ``We took calls for the
doctors. Visiting politicians dropped in to shake hands. Farmers
talked about the price of tobacco and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, nearly everybody in town went down to the drugstore
for one reason or another during the week. I can still remember one
night when a fellow walked in, apparently holding his head on with
his hands. His throat was cut from ear to ear. I got a doctor for
him _ and a story for The Record.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Wakelon High School in Zebulon, Daniel
entered the University of North Carolina. He became editor of the
campus literary magazine and vice president of the student body,
and received his B.A. degree in 1933. Then he put in a year as
associate editor of The Dunn (N.C.) Daily Bulletin before spending
four years as a reporter, political writer and columnist for The
News and Observer in Raleigh, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, after trying unsuccessfully to be hired by The Times,
Daniel went to work for The Associated Press in New York. One of
his friends in the city was the writer Thomas Wolfe, a fellow North
Carolinian, whose turbulent second novel, ``Of Time and the
River,'' had come out in 1935. The two men would sometimes meet for
a late supper in the theater district, then stroll the streets for
hours, talking about literature and life.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel spent seven years as a reporter and editor with The AP
and was transferred from New York to Washington, and then to Bern
and London.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he was hired by The Times and stayed on in London,
covering the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary
Force. Later, he followed the advance of the First Army into
Belgium and Germany. Early in 1945 he was in Paris, and one of his
dispatches included these lines: ``The big dirty green trucks speed
along the Rue La Fayette, their heavy tires singing on the
cobblestones and their canvas tops snapping in the winter wind. The
men in the back are tired and cramped after 11 hours on the road.
The last wisecrack was made a hundred miles back. But one of them
peers out, sees the name of the street and says, `La Fayette, we're
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Daniel recalled in an interview: ``I had what the
British used to call `a good war.' I enjoyed my war and I survived
without a scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   After the guns fell silent, he became The Times' chief
correspondent in the Middle East and traveled widely, reporting on
Arab nationalism, on tension and violence in Egypt and what is now
Israel and in late 1946 on the collapse of a Soviet-backed rebel
regime in northern Iran, where he found himself ahead of the story
he had come to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Driving in a borrowed jeep, he and two other correspondents
arrived in Tabriz, the main north Iranian city, hours ahead of the
Iranian Government force that was to take over. The newsmen got a
tumultuous greeting from excited throngs along their route, and
sheep were sacrificed in their honor.
</P>
<P>
   But they soon saw there was no conventional way of sending their
dispatches from Tabriz to the outside world. And so they gently
commandeered the local radio station and broadcast the news to the
world _ and to their editors.
</P>
<P>
   Later Daniel returned to London and covered the death of King
George VI and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coronation was the greatest spectacle I've ever seen,'' he
said afterward. ``It was probably the last time that the British
would be able to mount such a production; they were losing their
place as an imperialist power.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pivotal Struggle and a New Path
</P>
<P>
   After his assignments overseas, Daniel returned to New York and
began the editing apprenticeship that led to the managing editor's
chair. He had occupied it for four years when a climactic event
occurred in The Times' newsroom management, one that ultimately
chilled his relationship with the publisher, Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger. Daniel and the two other highest-ranking editors,
Catledge and Rosenthal, had become dissatisfied with the leadership
of the newspaper's Washington bureau, staffed by award-winning
proteges of James Reston, the columnist and former bureau chief.
The three New York editors decided that they wanted James L.
Greenfield, an editor recently hired in the home office, to replace
Tom Wicker as the bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield had previous experience in Washington, as a
correspondent and a government official. Sulzberger endorsed his
appointment, but it was strongly opposed by Wicker, by members of
the bureau and above all by Reston. They appealed, and Sulzberger
changed his mind, keeping Wicker as bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel complained to Sulzberger so angrily about the change of
plan that the publisher was offended. Late in 1968, Wicker stepped
aside to write his column full time. He was succeeded by Max
Frankel, a bureau member who went on to become executive editor of
The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield, meanwhile, quit the paper. But he was rehired in
1969 as foreign editor and rose to be an assistant managing editor.
Daniel, though, never regained his standing with the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   After yielding the managing editor's post in 1969, Daniel worked
in television as well as radio. His assignments included
supervising The Times News Service, the direction of special
projects and the continuation of his service as moderator of a
twice-monthly program called ``News in Perspective'' produced by
National Educational Television in association with The Times.
Daniel also presided over two radio programs, ``Insight'' and ``One
Man's Opinion,'' for WQXR.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the news staff as head of the Washington bureau, he
wrote analytical articles and oversaw the coverage of President
Richard M. Nixon's resignation and the outset of Gerald R. Ford's
presidency. He concentrated much of his effort on developing a
staff for investigative reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Of Murder Mysteries and Truman's Ghost
</P>
<P>
   He also watched his wife's literary career with pride. Margaret
Truman Daniel wrote or edited a score of books under the Truman
name. After her first mystery novel, ``Murder in the White House,''
became a best seller in 1980, she said in an interview, ``My
husband tells me to stick to what I know.'' Her later books have
included ``Murder on Capitol Hill'' and ``Murder in the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Their son Clifton Truman Daniel asserted in his memoir: ``My
mother seems to have a strong opinion, often bad, of almost
everyone in Washington. That's why she writes those murder
mysteries; so she can kill them all off, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daniels had three other sons _ William Wallace, Harrison
Gates and Thomas Washington. Late in life the couple saw their home
life laid open publicly in a way that was unsettling. In his book,
young Clifton, who was a writer for a North Carolina newspaper
before becoming an official of Harry S. Truman Community College in
Chicago, gave this summary of the problem he said stemmed from
having President Truman for a grandfather: ``Grandpa Truman died
when I was 15 and I spent my next 11 years wondering how to live up
to him. Only I didn't realize that's what I was doing. The only
thing I had to show for it was a string of failed academic courses,
lost jobs, and hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 years,'' he added, ``I found that though I
had let my grandfather's fame bring me down, I could look to him to
lift me up again. All he would have wanted for me was my
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Truman Daniel also wrote that his parents were strict
with him and his brothers in other ways because Truman had been
President. ``They didn't want us to get the idea that, just because
of our grandfather, we could go through life getting something for
nothing,'' he observed. ``Looking back, I can see what they were
worried about. But keeping us from getting swelled heads often
meant bruising our egos.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, having reached 65, Daniel ended his newspaper career
and told an interviewer, ``There's no profession that offers you
more variety in life or more excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and sons, he is survived by five
grandchildren. In retirement, Daniel enjoyed the conviviality of
his club, the Century Association, near the Times Building on West
43rd Street. He did not stop writing and went on to be the editor
in chief of the book ``Chronicle of the 20th Century.'' Its first
edition, a best seller, was published in 1987. The book was a
weighty collection of two million words and 3,700 illustrations
that listed a news event for almost every day of the 20th century
to the end of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the headlines in the book, and a few of the articles,
were written by Daniel. In an interview in 1987, he said of those
articles: ``When something came along where I had some knowledge, I
pitched in. I wrote the Hall-Mills murder case because none of the
editors had ever heard of it. I also was the only one who seemed to
know the details about the Earl of Rosebery, who achieved the three
things he wanted in life _ to win the English Derby, marry
England's richest heiress and become prime minister.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clifton Daniel, the courtly North Carolinian who
served as managing editor of The New York Times from 1964 to 1969
after a career as a correspondent in wartime London, war-torn
Europe and the Middle East, died Monday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a stroke and heart disease, said
his wife, Margaret Truman Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's long, adventuresome and many-sided professional life
was once summed up in a magazine profile with the headline ``Up
From Zebulon.'' Zebulon was the tiny lumber mill town near Raleigh,
N.C. where he was born and reared and where his parents saved the
income from the family drugstore to put him through college in the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   A small-town Southern background was something that Daniel
shared with his predecessor as managing editor, Turner Catledge,
who was from Philadelphia, Miss. And when Daniel was married in
1956, after many footloose years in Europe and the Middle East, it
was to a down-to-earth young woman whose father, like Daniel's, had
worked as a shopkeeper far away from Times Square. The bride was
Margaret Truman, the only child of former President Truman, who had
run a haberdashery in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel rose to be assistant to the managing editor, assistant
managing editor and then managing editor. In that post he was the
senior news executive of the daily Times, outranked only by
Catledge, the executive editor, who oversaw daily and Sunday
departments from a vantage outside the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   As managing editor, Daniel sought to brighten the newspaper with
pungent writing, eye-catching photography and an emphasis on what
many newspaper editors of the time disparaged as ``soft news.''
Daniel intensified the newspaper's treatment of society news, arts
coverage and obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   Society news, which had been mainly dry wedding and engagement
announcements, began to burst with spicy detail, human interest and
social insights. Cultural coverage studied the flaws as well as the
fame of important artists. Obituaries became less reverent.
</P>
<P>
   Elbert Clifton Daniel Jr. was born on Sept. 19, 1912, the son of
Elbert Clifton Daniel and Elvah Jones Daniel and a great-grandson
of Zachariah G. Daniel, an illiterate farmer who came to the United
States from England.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Zebulon had a population of 500. As a teen-ager,
young E.C., as he was known, worked part time for his father, an
enterprising druggist who was mayor of Zebulon, the first person in
town to own a telephone, and later the head of the North Carolina
Pharmaceutical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, in a speech at the University of North Carolina,
Daniel gave this account of how he first became a reporter: ``I
read one of those articles in a boys' magazine on `Choosing a
Career.' It said that if you wanted to be a newspaperman, if you
wanted to write, the best thing to do was to start writing. It
didn't say anything about going to journalism school. It just said,
`Send in something to the local paper.' So I did. As I remember, it
was an account of a basketball game. It got printed. Having one
item published was enough to convince me that I was God's gift to
journalism. I was pretty soon writing all the local news in The

TAKING THE LONG ROUTE TO MARATHON QUALIFYING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Libbie Hickman, the top qualifier for the Olympic marathon
trials on Saturday, eased into her running career. The daughter of
an oil company executive, she finished high school in Cairo. Track
and field season usually consisted of one meet, against other
Americans attending international schools in places like London or
Germany. Mostly, she played basketball. Egyptian women and girls
would approach her in the gym and touch her blond hair and tell her
it felt like silk.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much distance running to be had in Cairo's searing
heat. And while it was OK to train in shorts inside the high school
compound, to do so on the streets sometimes clashed with Muslim
custom. Once, Hickman said, she was jogging on the roads in a Cairo
suburb when a car drove past and one of the passengers reached out
and slapped a friend of hers on the behind. Hickman said she picked
up a rock and hit the back windshield of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took off sprinting the other way,'' she recalled. ``I think
they had a bad image of what America was. They watched `Dallas.' I
think they thought Americans were quite sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock, not cultural custom, will present the main barrier at
the marathon trials in Columbia, S.C. The entry standard for the
2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, is 2 hours 33 minutes.
Among American women, only Hickman, who ran 2:28:34 in finishing
sixth at the 1999 Chicago Marathon, and Kristy Johnson, who
finished 10th in Chicago in 2:32:34, have met the qualifying
standard. This created the possibility that someone could win the
Olympic trials in a slow time and not be eligible to compete in
Sydney, such is the deteriorated state of American marathoning.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to make the trials meaningful and to appease corporate
sponsors, the U.S. track and field federation decided that the
winner would qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics, no matter the
finishing time. (The Americans are guaranteed at least one spot in
Sydney.) Beyond that, things are complicated. A maximum of three
American runners can qualify for the Sydney Marathon. If Saturday's
winner runs slower than 2:33, only she will compete in Sydney. If
the winner runs faster than 2:33, the Americans will get up to
three Olympic berths. Those berths would be filled by sub-2:33
finishes in Columbia, or by qualifying times achieved elsewhere.
Theoretically, Hickman could still qualify for Sydney by finishing
last in the trials because she has an eligible qualifying time. But
she believes this will be a moot point. At the 1996 trials, run on
the same course, the top three finishers ran below 2:33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone looks at 2:33 and knows it's not that fast a
time,'' Hickman said. ``I think it's not going to play a factor
with the women's field unless it is a freak day, with a heat wave
or an ice storm. I kind of think it will take 2:30, maybe a little
under, to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there will be a pressing cultural issue at the
marathon trials: the flying of the Confederate flag over the South
Carolina Statehouse. USA Track and Field has called for its
removal. ``I don't know why it's there in the first place, but some
people think it's part of their history,'' Hickman said. ``I think
I better stay out of it. It's good to use your voice, but you don't
want to destroy the essence of athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to risk a winter of snow and ice interfering with
her training, Hickman and her husband, Walter, left their home in
Fort Collins, Colo., and set up camp among the rolling hills of
Solana Beach, Calif., north of San Diego. She has been running 100
to 110 miles a week on undulating terrain, preparing for the hills
between Miles 21 and 23 on the 26.2-mile Columbia course that could
separate the contenders from the pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   Her relocation has been a tradeoff. Altitude training increases
oxygen-carrying capacity, but sea-level training allows for faster
workouts. She has been running 15 miles at 5:50 pace on a loop
course, and her longer runs have been for two and a half hours at a
7:30 pace.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman, 35, is still a relative newcomer to marathoning after a
career on the track and the roads. She plans to start
conservatively and not to run alone, which she did in getting
caught in a no-man's land during the 1998 New York City Marathon.
She is the reigning national track champion and road champion at 10
kilometers (6.2 miles). That should give her an advantage if
someone begins making moves with a faster mile pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone throws in a 4:50, that kind of surge wouldn't
affect me,'' Hickman said. ``Someone else might not be as
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if she wins the marathon trials, Hickman may opt to run the
10,000 meters instead in Sydney. She said she would make a decision
based on her chances for the best finish. The Olympic marathon
field is expected to include Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, the world
record-holder (2:20:43), and Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, the defending
Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
   If she chooses the marathon, Hickman said, she believes she can
be a contender. Only Joan Benoit Samuelson, who won the 1984
Olympic marathon in Los Angeles, has won a medal in the event for
the United States. Anne Marie Lauck was the top American finisher
at the 1996 Atlanta Games with a 10th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to jinx myself, but I think I'm a real smart
racer,'' Hickman said. ``I can compete in large events. I'd
definitely be looking for a top 10 finish. It's going to be a
strong field, but I wouldn't count myself out of medal contention.
That's what I would be gearing for.''

   A Burmese Cruise Far Beyond Mandalay &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   East is east and west is west, but for four years they have met
on the Road to Mandalay, a luxury ship sailing the Irrawaddy River
in Myanmar. It has allowed Westerners to explore the exotic land
that many still call Burma, mainly between Mandalay and Bagan to
the south. This August they can sail north to and beyond Bhamo in a
special sailing through the rarely visited Three Narrows area of
the Irrawaddy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Nick Varian, chief executive of Venice
Simplon-Orient Express, operators of the ship, there are about six
weeks after the rainy season when the water is high enough for the
Road to Mandalay to sail north of Bhamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a completely different part of Burma,'' he said,
``untouched for thousands of years.'' During a test sailing last
August he visited villages whose residents had never seen
Westerners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In these northern areas, the Irrawaddy twists and turns through
three sets of narrows less than 100 yards wide between cliffs and
forests. The current gets fast and whirlpools are common. The Road
to Mandalay will not be able to navigate the last set of narrows to
Sinbo, 55 miles north of Bhamo, and passengers will take an
excursion through them on Zodiacs and, perhaps, small local boats,
Varian said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-board amenities include a pool and air-conditioning.
Passengers can choose from a variety of excursions each day _
including one to a camp that trains elephants for logging _ or
explore villages on their own. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This cruise, from Aug. 15 to 26, is limited to 90 passengers
(with a crew of 70) and is close to a sellout, Varian said; if it
sells out, Orient Express may add a second cruise. The cost is
$3,340 to $6,230 a person, double occupancy, plus air fare.
Reservations: (800) 524-2420. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Cape Town Scenic Road Closed by Falling Rocks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chapman's Peak Drive, one of the Cape Town area's most
breathtaking routes, will be closed until the end of May. The road
was closed after a motorist was killed by a falling boulder last
month. The coastal road, about six miles long, has become a popular
route for sightseers traveling between Cape Town and Cape Point,
the tip of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But with lots of loose rock, the hills that overlook the drive
have made it risky, forcing frequent closings during heavy rain or
strong winds. This time rock climbers have been sent up to remove
or secure the boulders thought most likely to fall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 80-year-old road was not heavily used until about a
decade ago, when travel on it increased from as few as 800 vehicles
a day to as many as 8,000 now, according to Chris Atkins, the chief
roads engineer for the Cape Metropolitan Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until 1989, there had been no deaths recorded on the road; since
then there have been four involving rocks, including this latest
one, Atkins said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The traditional routes of two of the season's biggest events,
the Cape Argus Pick 'n Pay Cycling Race in March and the Two Oceans
Marathon in April, both include Chapman's Peak Drive, and
organizers of the events have been forced to map out new, more
grueling routes for the thousands of people planning to
participate. &QL;

   Branson Opens a String of Fancy Hotels &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Branson, who is almost as well known for piloting a
hot-air balloon as he is for founding Virgin Atlantic Airways, is a
man who readily mixes pleasure with business. And when he recently
announced his new hotel collection, Limited Edition by Virgin,
Branson said that it was more about good times than good strategy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It might be shrewd marketing to have hotels in cities served by
the airline, Branson conceded, but ``it's not a lot of fun.''
Instead, the group's five hotels are in places Branson likes and
expects his friends to like: Necker Island, his home in the British
Virgin Islands; Ulusaba Private Game Reserve _ the only new
property in the collection _ near Kruger National Park in South
Africa, with 20 rooms in two lodges; La Residencia, set on 30 acres
in Mallorca, with 63 rooms plus a beach house; the 12th-century
Palazzo Sasso, with 43 rooms in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast in
Italy, and Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, which has 32 rooms on 27
acres in Oxfordshire outside London.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Palazzo Sasso, Branson owns all or part of the
hotels. Several were part of an earlier venture, Virgin Hotels,
largely in Britain and Ireland, most of which were sold last year.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Necker Island rents for $14,000 to $27,000 a day, depending on
the number of guests (up to 26), except for two weeks during the
year when couples can reserve rooms for $12,000 a week without
reserving the whole island. Those prices include meals, drinks and
activities such as sailing.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest rates are at La Residencia, beginning at $150 a day
and ranging up to $750, including Continental breakfast. The other
properties fall somewhere in between: Ulusaba is $720 to $1,600 a
day per couple, with meals and activities such as game drives and
tennis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information and reservations: Resorts Management at (800)
557-4255 for Necker and Ulusaba, (800) 225-4255 for the other
hotels.

WHERE ALL TRAILS LEAD TO THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Feb. 27) 
(jt) 
 By NANCY SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the lead horse, the guide raised his hand to signal a halt.
He tilted his head. So did the horse. They had heard a noise
somewhere in the still redwood forest. All we could hear was
horses' breathing and the wind through the tops of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truck,'' said our guide, Noel Daniels. ``Out on Route 20. Hear
it?''
</P>
<P>
   No. And that was the point. We were in deep woods, far away from
Interstates and airplane traffic. Here, the low drone of a truck
along a distant two-lane state road was an intrusion that only a
native was likely to notice.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet was only one remarkable aspect of this May riding trek
through hilly forest and along craggy Pacific beaches about 150
miles north of San Francisco. Riding athletic endurance horses, my
husband, Joe, and I were exploring the Northern California coast in
a different way, spending little time along the congested Pacific
Coast Highway, (Highway 1), which coils, climbs and plunges along
the jagged rim of the continent. Its vantage points are
spectacular: cliffs fringed with green pines sheer down to the
roiling gray Pacific. But its heavy traffic meant our views were
more like snatched glances from behind a Winnebago.
</P>
<P>
   Horses afford a view of a different world on this coast, where
both nature and society are constantly buffeted by shifting,
sometimes colliding, forces. Our riding trip, five days in all,
took us into the forests and the hills, along old logging roads
where Noel pointed out hand-hewn notches on giant redwood stumps
and deep earthen furrows where monster logs began their long slide
down to swollen streams that floated them to sawmills. We trotted
for miles on well-maintained public horse trails on bluffs
overlooking the ocean. We galloped up mountains to clearings where
we were stunned by sudden majestic views of the Pacific. We
cantered along the foaming cold surf and crossed pastures where
cattle grazed.
</P>
<P>
   Our trek was part of a package called the Redwood Coast Ride,
which is offered by Lari Shea, a well-known figure on the
international endurance-riding circuit. In endurance riding, which
has its roots in tests performed by cavalries all over the world,
seasoned riders follow timed courses for 50 miles or more over
rugged terrain. Crossing the finish line first is one of the goals;
getting your horse there in top-notch physical condition is the
other. Veterinarians at checkpoints before, after and during the
race disqualify horses with too high a heartbeat, dehydration or
other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shea operates cross-country and coastal rides from her stable at
Ricochet Ridge Ranch in Fort Bragg, about 10 miles north of the
town of Mendocino and a four-hour drive from San Francisco. We
chose Ricochet Ranch because Shea offers a choice of tack,
including English, which we prefer to bulkier Western saddles.
English-style trekking is hard to find in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good trekking operators, Shea and her guides, like
Noel, have the intuition and knowledge to match horse with rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can usually tell whether you can ride just by the way you
get out of a car,'' said Noel, 44, who started out cowboy-shy on
our trip and by the second day was regaling us with stories of
growing up in this lonely part of California. In registering riders
for the trip, Shea also has guests briefly describe their skill
levels; she can accommodate riders from beginner to advanced.
</P>
<P>
   We timed our trip to coincide with the height of spring, and day
after day we were surrounded by flowers _ huge stands of
rhododendrons under the redwoods, hot-orange California poppies,
pink foxglove and wild blue iris.
</P>
<P>
   Ricochet Ridge Ranch offers a weeklong trek for groups of riders
every month during warm weather, but it offers custom trips year
round. We had to be in San Francisco for a couple of days, and she
arranged a five-day trek for us. Each day's route was different,
though the routine was similar. We'd arrive at the ranch at 9:30
a.m. and meet Noel, a wiry man with the build of a jockey. We'd
watch as the day visitors left for the popular one-and-a-half-hour
beach rides. Then we'd load our three horses into a trailer and
take them to a trailhead in the forest or along the beach. We'd
ride three hours before stopping for a picnic lunch prepared by
Noel. After another few hours of riding and a return in the
trailer, we'd be back at the ranch by 5 or 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at local inns, so there was plenty of time for a
shower and rest, then dinner at a restaurant in Fort Bragg or down
the coast in Mendocino.
</P>
<P>
   The day we arrived, Noel sauntered over to greet us by name. He
took us into the barn, where Shea had left us detailed biographies
of our horses. Joe was assigned to Sungari, an 8-year-old bay
gelding, who had recently outtrotted nearly a hundred horses to win
first place in a 50-mile endurance race in California. I was on
Nikita, also 8, a bay gelding. Both Sungari and Nikita, I read with
some alarm, were to be Brazil's entries in the Pan American
Championships in endurance racing in Canada later in the summer.
Though we are both experienced riders, I wondered whether the
horses would be too much for us.
</P>
<P>
   Noel sensed the apprehension. ``Come on and meet your horses,''
he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   We went to one of the corrals where the pair were basking in the
sun. Nikita wore a turquoise fabric bridle and breastplate and
matching blanket with saddlebags. Sungari was outfitted in red.
They looked as if they were going to an aerobics class, which, in a
way, they were.
</P>
<P>
   Noel warned me that we'd be going to the beach, which he said
Nikita regarded as his personal sandbox, for our hourlong shakedown
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Nikita gleefully regarded it more like his personal
racetrack. It was hard to hold him back once we turned onto the
open beach, which stretched ahead empty and, for a horse that likes
to run, enticingly into the faraway ocean mists. When we returned
from our brisk ride up the beach, part fast trot and part
thundering gallop, I looked Noel in the eye and asked if I had too
much horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said simply. The next morning, when we set out on our
first full-day ride, I realized he was exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   Noel loaded up the horses, hitched the trailer to the ranch's
red Ford pickup and drove to Jackson Demonstration State Forest, a
big tract of woodland just north of Mendocino. We unloaded the
horses, then followed soft paths through second-growth redwood.
Noel pointed out a ``fairy circle'' of sequoias that ringed a huge
stump. Deep pink rhododendrons were in bloom, with scatterings of
wild iris underneath. In shadier spots, ferns rose four feet high.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour or so of this forest reverie, Nikita was
aggressively eager to get on with some action; Joe's horse was
quieter. Both animals had Russian connections _ crosses of Arabian
and Russian Orlov, a breed developed by the Czars about 200 years
ago for trotting and endurance. As we rode, Noel talked about
horses and local concerns: the logging industry and the newcomers _
the affluent second-home owners from the Bay Area, Silicon Valley
and even Southern California who have discovered this part of the
coast. Big, expensive new homes now claim whole hillsides and their
sweeping views of the sea. In tiny town halls, in coffee shops and
in the columns of the local weekly paper, titanic battles rage over
the minutiae of California coastal and woodlands development
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With a rueful chuckle, Noel said, ``You'd think it was New York
City they're fighting over instead of an old logging town.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a simmering cultural standoff. On two-lane Highway
1, logging trucks share the road with fancily attired long-distance
bicyclists, with tourists, impatient local commuters and even
in-line skaters in summer. This being California, each constituency
believes in its inalienable right to the road, and it is not
unusual to see a logging truck tailgating a stubborn bicyclist on a
plunging downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Horses, of course, are the ultimate off-road vehicle. On our
second full day, we set off on the beach, mostly galloping the
three-mile stretch that ends where the foot of a coastal mountain
range juts into the sea. Shea met us at the finish, and we loaded
the horses into the trailer and drove a few miles inland to her new
property, a hilly 300-acre spread with spectacular ocean views. In
one of the pastures, Nikita's mother and her new filly grazed
lazily in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   When we mounted again, we took an old logging road that climbed
into the woods. Noel was riding a stable rookie, a little Arabian
palomino that was decidedly skittish. We marveled at his patience
and sweet talk, which transformed the horse into a leader by the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   During a clear stretch, we cantered about two miles to the top
of a hill. Then we walked slowly down a steep, rocky trail into a
hollow of old-growth redwood. Again, we climbed. At the crest of
the mountain, the woods cleared to provide us with a sudden view of
sunlight flooding across the Pacific under a blue sky that still
had an icing of fog far out to sea. We stopped there for lunch, in
a grassy field where the horses could graze and rest.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, taking it easy after two long days, we rode for
two hours along the bluffs over the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, we changed hotels, moving from a cottage with
a deck opening onto a lush garden in Fort Bragg to a reconstructed
historic hotel in Mendocino. Loggers from New England built
Mendocino, now a seaside tourist town of 1,100 that bills itself as
an artists' colony, coming West with clapboard architectural
tastes, but without the starchiness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, well-heeled former hippies run fancy shops that sell
handicrafts and clothing. In front of our hotel, I encountered the
proprietor of the horse-carriage concession, who was standing
beside a fine-looking dapple-gray horse. I had a couple of lumps of
sugar in my jacket pocket and asked if I could give them to the
draft horse, a hulking Belgian.
</P>
<P>
   This elicited a lecture on organic feed. The driver doffed his
bowler and said that while he appreciated the offer and understood
that some people, especially Easterners, will indulge a horse's
sweet tooth, he would never do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beets and carrots, oh, yes. Garlic, also. Of course, you
should shred and steam about half of the beets first, then
recombine them, to release all of the nutrients.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, my husband came out of a nearby bookstore and rescued
me by insisting that it was time for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, we were glad to escape from granolafied
Mendocino back up to the relative isolation of Fort Bragg, where we
set off on the last and most demanding day of riding, a mock
endurance ride, covering about 20 miles. We started by hauling the
horses to a cattle ranch whose owner allows Shea use of the trails.
Then we galloped up a slope. We had to descend.
</P>
<P>
   After the downhill, which required giving our horses a few
encouraging words, we had to cross a logging road that had been
recently oiled to keep the dust down. It was slippery. Sungari was
wary of the surface. In the middle of the road, he stopped after a
foot slid a little. His front feet splayed and his head down,
looking at the shiny surface, he was distressed, but Joe quietly
edged him to the gravel shoulder, and Sungari literally sighed in
what sounded like relief.
</P>
<P>
   We then crossed a pretty meadow and waded up Ten Mile River,
about three miles from where it empties into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly deep part of the river, with water nearly up
to our boots, both Nikita and Sungari began pawing the water
vigorously, which was something neither of us had encountered
before. Noel heard the splashing and turned, alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make him walk on!  &UR; Now! &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   We did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to take a swim under a horse, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   After several days on the trail, he explained, both horses were
ready to take a nice icy bath, rider or no rider.
</P>
<P>
   We emerged splashed, not drenched, and loaded the horses again
for a short drive to what Noel described as a special piece of
land. We walked the horses through a field of wild oats, rye and
barley, then tied them under pine trees, a quarter mile from an
abandoned barn. We ate lunch at picnic tables in a redwood grove.
Noel said that on another ride, one rider surprised the group by
bringing a flute and playing during lunch under the tall redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   For the last leg, we trailered to Ten Mile Beach to head back to
the ranch. The horses perked up, as always when they know they are
going home. The sky was gray; the sea tumbled in furiously. The
beach stretched out forever in the chilly mist. We gathered our
reins and ran with the wind.(BBOX)

<P>
   Ricochet Ridge Ranch, 24201 North Highway 1, Fort Bragg, Calif.
95437, (707) 964-7669, fax (707) 964-9669, www.horse-vacation.com,
offers weeklong rides from May to October at $1,795 a person,
including hotels, with breakfast, lunch on the trail and dinner in
a local restaurant. The owner, Lari Shea, also creates custom
packages year round for those who, like us, could not schedule a
weeklong ride. Our package of five nights and four days' riding,
all meals and lodging cost $1,295 a person. Trail rides are offered
year round.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Lodging and Dining &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We stayed for three nights at the Cleone Lodge Inn (since
renamed Cleone Gardens Inn), 24600 North Highway 1 in Fort Bragg;
(707) 964-2788. Our Meadow View suite overlooked roses and foxglove
and a carefully tended lawn. Its wide deck was a welcome staging
area for boots and helmets. Rates are $77 to $104 a night (suites
$120); breakfast is available for an additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   The other two nights were at the Mendocino Hotel and Garden
Suites, 45080 Main Street in Mendocino; (707) 937-0511 or (800)
548-0513, fax (707) 937 0513. Rates range from $85 for a double
with shared bath to $275 for a suite. The hotel itself has the
historic facade of old Mendocino, with a reconstructed interior.
The garden suites, where we stayed, are modern units with antique
furnishings set among colorful formal gardens. Our room had a
fireplace with cured redwood and fatwood sticks to use as starters.
</P>
<P>
   Our package included meals, and Shea reserved dinner for us at
various local restaurants. Arrangements differed at each place. The
first, called simply The Restaurant, on Main in Fort Bragg,
(707) 964-9800, offered a three-course pasta meal with wine or a
$50 credit for a la carte. We opted for salad and fresh salmon.
Closed Wednesday; dinner Thursday through Tuesday, lunch Thursday
and Friday, brunch Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The second, a Mexican restaurant called The Purple Rose, 24300
North Highway 1, in Fort Bragg, (707) 964-6507, didn't know about
an arrangement, so we paid our $25 bill for burritos and tacos;
Noel reimbursed us the next day. Open for dinner only; closed
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lari gave us a $50 voucher for the third, Wharf Restaurant and
Lounge, 32260 North Harbor Drive, in Fort Bragg, (707) 964-4283, a
seafood restaurant overlooking the small harbor. It was a culinary
throwback: we were served a relish tray of carrot sticks, radishes
and scallions, a combination I remember from the Kennedy
administration. Open daily for lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth restaurant, Hill House Inn, 10701 Palette Drive, in
Mendocino, (707) 937-0554, which serves New England-style fare, was
used as the exterior for ``Murder, She Wrote,'' which helps explain
why Angela Lansbury appeared capable of growing lush roses in
Maine. Open for breakfast daily, dinner Thursday through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And on our last night, we enjoyed steaks with Noel at the dining
room of the landmark Mendocino Hotel.

`MIRACLE ON ICE' OF 1980 LOOKS DIFFERENT TODAY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Tuesday night, the result of the ``Miracle on
Ice'' was well known before ABC showed it in prime time. The live
Lake Placid scene behind host Jim McKay might have been a giveaway
that the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team had defeated the heavily
favored Soviet Union, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Joyous, smiling fans raised a banner saying, ``Go for Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC had tried, unsuccessfully, to shift the start from 5 p.m. to
8 p.m. What some have called the greatest sports moment of the
century wound up on tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   But McKay was not a spoilsport, saying: ``The events you're
going to be seeing tonight have been completed. It may be that many
millions of you know the results. However, we said at the beginning
we would not tip the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking thing about the game, to be replayed Tuesday
night at 9 o'clock Eastern time on ESPN Classic, is how
refreshingly clean it looks. No on-ice or dasherboard ads, no
continuous score and clock, few graphics, no behind-the-goal
cameras, no rinkside reporters and few crowd shots (among them, one
of Jamie Farr).
</P>
<P>
   The game's one unnatural additive: blue dye to make the ice more
telegenic.
</P>
<P>
   The director Ron Harrison, a veteran of 15 years at ``Hockey
Night in Canada,'' used three cameras to tell the evolving drama.
It was enough. ``It was basically `Hockey Night,''' he said.
``Stick with the story.''
</P>
<P>
   He received only one instruction from Roone Arledge, then the
president of ABC Sports. ``He wanted to see the puck, that's all,''
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast is also remarkable for the deftness of its
announcers, Al Michaels and Ken Dryden, who was especially valuable
in describing the American team's defensive lapses. Michaels had
called one hockey game before the '80 Winter Games _ at the '72
Winter Olympics in Sapporo _ and Dryden had called none.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't grown up as a hockey fan, I'd have been worried,''
Michaels said. ``But I knew the game, understood it and loved the
game, and by the time we called the U.S.-Soviet game, we'd done 14
or 15 games that week.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels and Dryden practiced more by playing a tabletop hockey
game in their hotel room. Without much else to do, they
familiarized themselves with the foreign names playing for coming
opponents of the American team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played it every night,'' said Arthur Kaminsky, Dryden's
lawyer and hotel roommate. ``Michaels is saying, `Kasatonov to
Krutov to Kharlamov.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels recalled: ``Dryden was the most book-smart athlete I've
ever worked with, yet he played this muck-muck style of tabletop
hockey. I'm trying to play Soviet-style offense and he's just
whamming the rod of his defenseman to knock my goalie off his
hinge.''
</P>
<P>
   What viewers may notice this time around is that ABC did not
carry the entire game. To fit it into prime time _ and show men's
slalom _ chunks were cut. Dennis Lewin, then coordinating producer
of ABC's ``Wide World of Sports,'' edited out segments as the game
was played.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Krutov put the Soviets ahead, 1-0, at 9 minutes 12
seconds of the first period, but less than five minutes of action
had been shown by then. After Aleksandr Maltsev gave the Soviets a
3-2 lead at 2:18 of the second, ABC cut out an 8:27 chunk. About
3:30 more was excised from the start of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say afterwards, `Why did we do that?''' said
Lewin, now the senior vice president for broadcasting for the
National Football League. ``But going in, we didn't expect to carry
it virtually in its entirety. Your fondest hope was that the U.S.
team would keep it close, not that they would win. If I cut out too
much, we'd be dead meat.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing he added was an inset of the clock showing that Mark
Johnson's tying goal in the second period came with only one second
left.
</P>
<P>
   Had Lewin left more in, viewers might have seen more of the
pummeling taken by Jim Craig, the American goalie. But little else.
</P>
<P>
   The final 10 minutes whipped by, sped along by some of Lewin's
cuts. With barely a minute left, Dryden speculated on whether the
Soviets had practiced pulling their goalie. (They hadn't.) On ABC's
platform, Michaels recalled thinking: ``Stay calm and collected.
The hotter it gets, the cooler I have to be. The feeling was so
intense. It was so loud, you could feel the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said, ``The mobile truck was shaking.'' It was 40 feet
outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the final seconds came Michaels' coda: ``Do you believe in
miracles? Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember that he said anything else. What led in to
it? ``Bilyaletdinov checked by Ramsey. McClanahan is there. The
puck is still there. Eleven seconds. You've got 10 seconds. The
countdown going on right now. Morrow up to Silk. Five seconds left
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels had little time to wonder if he had said something
indelible. Right after the American victory, he and Dryden called
the Sweden-Finland contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 11:30,'' Michaels said, ``I got back to my hotel and
somebody in the lobby said, `It was great what you said at the end
of the game.' I had to think for a second. I couldn't remember
exactly what I'd said. And he said: `Do you believe in miracles?
Yes!'''

   SHARONVILLE, Ohio _ Former presidential candidate Steve Forbes
said he did not regret his failed run for the White House and that
only by sticking to their conservative issues would Republicans win
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the publisher of Forbes magazine, made one of his first
speeches Monday to the Butler County Republican Party's Lincoln Day
dinner since dropping out of the Republican race Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 people showed up for the $60-a-plate dinner at the
Sharonville Convention Center, northwest of Cincinnati, raising
more than $100,000 for the Butler County Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he was disappointed the GOP primaries between
Arizona Sen. John McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush have turned
acrimonious in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a real discussion and I don't think they much care
who threw what at whom,'' Forbes said. ``It's like kids fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes withdrew from the presidential race after finishing third
in the New Hampshire and Delaware primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes banked his White House bid on a call to restructure the
nation's tax system, and Monday he again stressed the need to dump
the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kill it, drive a stake through its heart and bury it in hopes
it never rises again to terrorize the American people,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has not ruled out another run for the presidency, and has not
endorsed McCain or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he expected Bush to win today in the Michigan
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way Senator McCain can make a comeback is to go hard
on the issues and contrast what he stands for against what his
opponent stands for,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent $66 million of his own money in his two bids for
the White House this year and in 1996.

EDITORIAL: HASTY CALL FOR AMNESTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's call for the government to grant amnesty to an
estimated six million illegal immigrants currently living in the
United States and to eliminate most sanctions on employers who hire
them in the future was a surprising turnabout. Until now, organized
labor has fought hard to keep illegal workers from taking jobs from
higher-paid union workers.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's proposal is attractive to many groups. Unions
welcome the chance to go after a huge new pool of unorganized
workers. Employers welcome the chance to hire cheap labor without
fear of criminal liability. And illegal immigrants who have worked
hard for years and raised families under harrowing circumstances
would welcome access to medical care and other services denied to
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   But the AFL-CIO's proposal should be rejected. Amnesty would
undermine the integrity of the country's immigration laws and would
depress the wages of its lowest-paid native-born workers.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1986, Congress granted amnesty to an estimated three
million illegal immigrants as part of a law that also promised to
crack down on further illegal immigration by imposing sanctions on
employers who knowingly violated the law. At that time, this page
endorsed amnesty because it was tied to measures that promised to
keep further rounds of illegal immigration in check. But 14 years
later there are now twice as many illegal workers, and the
institution of employer sanctions is widely deemed a joke. Workers
pretend to show employers proof of citizenship or work visas and
employers pretend they do not know the proof is fake.
</P>
<P>
   The primary problem with amnesties is that they beget more
illegal immigration. Demographers trace the doubling of the number
of Mexican immigrants since 1990 in part to the amnesty of the
1980s. Amnesties signal foreign workers that American citizenship
can be had by sneaking across the border, or staying beyond the
term of one's visa, and hiding out until Congress passes the next
amnesty. The 1980s amnesty also attracted a large flow of illegal
relatives of those workers who became newly legal. All that is
unfair to those who play by the immigration rules and wait years to
gain legal admission.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unfair to unskilled workers already in the United
States. Between about 1980 and 1995, the gap between the wages of
high school dropouts and all other workers widened substantially.
Prof. George Borjas of Harvard estimates that almost half of this
trend can be traced to immigration of unskilled workers. Illegal
immigration of unskilled workers induced by another amnesty would
make matters worse. The better course of action is to honor
America's proud tradition by continuing to welcome legal immigrants
and find ways to punish employers who refuse to obey the law.

SAFETY A WORRY AS COMPANIES SHOP FOR NUCLEAR REACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As nuclear families go, the Indian Point 2
reactor's is about as small as they get. It has suffered its
teething problems, growing pains, setbacks and crises pretty much
as an only child, under the tutelage of a corporate parent,
Consolidated Edison, that has little experience in the care and
feeding of a nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The adjacent Indian Point 3, with its checkered operational
history, is also pretty lonely, in the corporate sense. It is run
by the New York Power Authority, which has only one other reactor,
of a different design, on the shores of Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   But both may be sold soon. Would the plants operate better, or
more safely, if adopted into a company with a bigger brood?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's benefit to aggregating expertise,'' said Stephen E.
Quinn, a vice president of Con Edison. ``There's a lot of
professional things you gain there.'' His company once set out to
have three reactors, but Indian Point 1, which resembles a modern
reactor the way a Commodore 64 resembles an iMac,was shut down
before Indian Point 2 opened in 1974. Con Ed built Indian Point 3
but sold it to the Power Authority before opening it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Con Ed and the Power Authority run what experts sometimes
refer to as mom and pop reactors. Like many other utilities, Con Ed
is seeking to sell Indian Point 2 mostly because of utility
deregulation, which has sent a handful of other groups shopping for
reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, including advocates and critics of nuclear power, are
ambivalent about what the effect could be. It could be management
with more experience, or it could be management with a stronger
drive to make money, which some people think may not be consistent
with safety.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances seem likely to provide a test. Power Authority
directors are scheduled to meet this month to vote on the sale of
Indian Point 3 and the James A. FitzPatrick reactor, in Oswego,
N.Y., to Entergy Nuclear, a company based in Jackson, Miss. The
company has negotiated a deal to operate Nine Mile Point 1 and 2,
in Scriba, N.Y., for Rochester Gas and Electric, although ownership
of those reactors is confused at the moment. Indian Point 3 could
go to another entity that is trying to buy reactors: Amergen, a
partnership of British Energy and the parent company of
Philadelphia Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy officials would not say if they were negotiating for
Indian Point 2, but Carl Crawford, a spokesman, said: ``We are
interested in any plant that's available in the U.S. We're building
a new fleet of reactors in the northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amergen partnership, which is interested in Indian Point 2,
would like to buy as many as 20 reactors, a spokesman, J. William
Jones, said. The group has already bought Three Mile Island 1, near
Harrisburg, Pa., and Clinton, near the southern Illinois city of
the same name, and has struck a deal to buy Oyster Creek, in Toms
River, N.J., and Vermont Yankee, near Brattleboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   There are factors that make it positive for safety, said David
Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer based here at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, which is generally critical of the utilities and of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ``The new owner of a nuclear power
plant clearly has a commitment to a nuclear future,'' said
Lochbaum, who worked as a consultant for both Philadelphia Electric
and Entergy before moving to the Union of Concerned Scientists.
``They've made a business decision they can make money at nuclear
power. They will do whatever it takes to make that investment
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The sellers, on the other hand, ``may not have made the choice
to go nuclear,'' Lochbaum said. ``It may just be the legacy they've
inherited.'' Of course, he added, ``you can also make the
counterargument that the new owner is only trying to make a quick
buck, to recoup their investment and make some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Anne Jackson, a physicist who retired last year as
chairwoman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to become president
of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, N.Y., also expressed
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a strong company taking over a number of plants,
then you'd have the potential for quite a salutary effect in how
those plants are operated, in overall safety performance as well as
economic performance,'' she said. ``It's more difficult for a
single-plant utility to amass the kind of critical mass to be able
to have the kind of expertise and resources to bring to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``you can't argue that size in and of itself
gives you good performance.'' Two of the biggest operators, she
said, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Commonwealth Edison, also
had some of the worst operating experiences.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some people concerned about nuclear safety say that a buyer is
under more pressure to keep a plant running, even if it needs
maintenance, than an old-style monopoly utility with a captive
customer population. But other experts say that high reliability
and safety are likely to come hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   At Entergy Nuclear, Jerry W. Yelverton, the president and chief
executive, said that the old theory was that plants that shut down
only briefly for refueling must be skipping something important and
reducing safety. But he said that capacity factor _ the amount of
electricity produced, compared with what would have occurred if the
plant ran at full power 365 days a year _ tended to be highest when
other statistics were also favorable, like low radiation exposure
to workers, low number of hours when crucial systems were not
working, and small number of problems that had to be reported to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy, he said, had changed its strategy, undertaking
aggressive maintenance on various systems while the plant was
running to keep them in top shape. One example is emergency diesel
generators, needed in case of a blackout in the region. Entergy
used to take the generators, which are trouble-prone, off-line for
service while the plant was shut, which lengthened refueling
shut-downs and also made them unavailable at a time when, analysis
shows, they were more likely to be needed. Now it takes them
off-line in rotation while the plant is running, keeping them in
top shape and raising their availability at important times.
</P>
<P>
   Others see a less glowing picture. The Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, a nonprofit group here that favors shutting down
reactors, is trying to block Amergen's purchase of Oyster Creek.
The partnership is expanding into too many plants, according to
Michael Mariotte, the executive director, and may be stretched too
thin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, operators are supposed to have enough cash
on hand to weather a six-month shutdown, which can amount to $75
million or more, and to help pay for a nuclear accident anywhere in
the country, which can come to $10 million a year for 7 years. It
is not clear if Amergen can do that for more than one reactor,
Mariotte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a company with essentially no assets,'' he said. ``It
didn't exist two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the Amergen spokesman, said he could not say if such
liabilities would rest with the partnership or the parent
companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Robert S. Wood, the senior
financial policy adviser, said that Amergen was financially
qualified to handle its completed purchases.
</P>
<P>
   When companies make an agreement to buy a plant and apply to
have the operating license transferred to them, they tend to have
far more experience than the original licensee had. Between
acquisitions and mergers, another trend in the utility industry,
the agency foresees getting about 20 applications in the next few
months, representing one-fifth of the operating reactors.
</P>
<P>
   But Mariotte of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service
said it was a case-by-case problem. Recalling Northeast Utilities,
among others, he said, ``the largest utilities have often gotten
into the most trouble.''

ADVERTISING: 20 QUESTIONS ON MARKETING AND MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing
and the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Isn't it fortunate for the ABC Television Network unit of Walt
Disney Co. that virtually no one remembers an advertisement from
the 1997-98 season, promoting its lineup of Tuesday night comedies,
that asserted: ``Families need money and laughter. And we're not
about to hand out money''?
</P>
<P>
   _ What will consumers looking for contemporary attitudes from
American automakers think about a decision by the Chevrolet
division of General Motors to sign a two-year agreement to sponsor
the musical organization known since the mid-1960s as Up With
People?
</P>
<P>
   _ What did music lovers in Missouri make of postcards promoting
a ``special Valentine's concert,'' proclaiming that ``Krispy Kreme
is the official doughnut of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is a spot for Panasonic high-definition television sets
featuring a dreadful imitation of the voice of Jimmy Durante the
worst celebrity impression ever in a commercial?
</P>
<P>
   _ How much more would shares of the Omnicom Group be worth if
that agency company were to be renamed Omni.com?
</P>
<P>
   _ How did executives at Wong Doody feel when they read the Jan.
1 issue of Time magazine and learned that a mock ad the agency
created was selected to be part of a humorous article _ and the
creation was credited to ``Wang Doody''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of the WPP Group
has created a newspaper ad for Maxwell House coffee, sold by a
division of Philip Morris, in which a woman promises ``I will watch
less TV,'' will there be a complementary TV spot in which she
promises ``I will read fewer newspapers''?
</P>
<P>
   _ How embarrassed were executives at Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and
their agency, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of
Omnicom, when a commercial featuring the football player Cris
Carter ran briefly with his given name misspelled on screen as
``Chris''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Jeff Bezos, the chairman and chief executive at
Amazon.com, be flattered or annoyed by an ad for a company called
Addashop.com that declares ``Go from Bozo to Bezos in just five
minutes''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why was it that when DaimlerChrysler decided to discontinue
its Plymouth brand, almost no one noted that the death came four
decades after the end of a sibling automobile line, DeSoto?
</P>
<P>
   _ Are members of Generation Y puzzled when they listen to ``(I
Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' and hear Mick Jagger sing about a
television commercial for cigarettes?
</P>
<P>
   _ Does anyone reading TV Guide Celebrity Dish, a new magazine
published by TV Guide Inc., recall a similar publication named Good
Food that corporate predecessors, Triangle Publications and Murdoch
Magazines, introduced, closed, reintroduced and closed again in the
1970s and 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will those who consider Procter &AMP; Gamble hopelessly staid and
old-fashioned take heart from a Go Card postcard ad that recommends
Scope mouthwash ``when your date on Friday lasts till Saturday''?
</P>
<P>
   _ When Qwest Communications International merges with U S West,
wouldn't it be delightful if the merged company were to be named
West Qwest or Qwest West?
</P>
<P>
   _ When coupon ads for the Whitehall-Robins Health Care division
of American Home Products extend invitations to consumers to ``Join
the Advil family,'' how many reply with that venerable riposte
``Not tonight, I have a headache''?
</P>
<P>
   _ When executives at the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo
introduced a ``honey BBQ'' version of Fritos Racerz, a line of
car-shaped corn snacks, did they consider that consumers might
perceive a barbecued race car to be morbid rather than delectable?
</P>
<P>
   _ Have readers of Fortune magazine, published by the Time Inc.
division of Time Warner, really become accustomed to reviews of
compact discs by bands like Hole, Pulp, Air and R.E.M.?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it a coincidence that on the same Sunday, the comic strips
``For Better or For Worse'' and ``One Big Happy'' both showed their
fictitious families playing Monopoly?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did all the descriptions of Monica Lewinsky as ``the portly
pepperpot'' in The New York Post stimulate sales of Campbell's
Pepper Pot Soup?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will a purposely cheesy performing monkey, dancing to a
cha-cha tune in a garage, invite an advertising columnist to invest
online and then declare ``You ask a lot of questions for someone
from Brooklyn''?

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Leona Samish, the unhappily single heroine of
Arthur Laurents' ``Time of the Cuckoo,'' Debra Monk throws out her
smile as if it were a baited fishhook. Shiny and sharp, it seems to
precede her onto the stage, an invitation cast with energy but only
slim expectations of getting a nibble.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hardness in that smile, a desperation, that makes it
more than friendly. You get a strong feeling that this gregarious
American tourist in Venice could turn nasty. When she does, you can
only wonder why the people around her didn't see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   If you are familiar with Laurents' drama, which opened Monday
night in a generally lukewarm revival at the Mitzi E. Newhouse
Theater at Lincoln Center, this description probably doesn't tally
with your idea of Leona, the very American executive secretary who
falls for a very Italian married man.
</P>
<P>
   When the play was first seen in 1952, Shirley Booth had the
role, and according to Brooks Atkinson's review in The New York
Times, ``everybody was in love with her when the final curtain
descended.'' Katharine Hepburn played the part with starched
sentimentality in a screen version that emphasized the work's
weepier side.
</P>
<P>
   Leona's latest avatar is more likely to make you cringe than
sniffle. That Monk, who gave comparable brashness to a similar role
in the 1994 revival of William Inge's ``Picnic,'' doesn't ask for
easy sympathy is the most provocative element in this latest
production of ``Cuckoo,'' which is directed by Nicholas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Laurents, best known today for his superb book for the musical
``Gypsy'' and the screenplays for ``The Way We Were'' and ``The
Turning Point,'' has already gone on record as saying that Monk is
providing a dimension that was always meant to be. Booth, he writes
in his forthcoming ``Original Story By: A Memoir of Broadway and
Hollywood,'' worried too much about the audience's not liking her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet presented with clearer, harder eyes, in lieu of misty ones,
``The Time of the Cucardly looks timeless. In tracing
Leona's short-lived affair with a Renato Di Rossi (Olek Krupa), the
play turns on the familiar opposition of European sophistication,
especially in matters sexual, and those classic American ``isms,''
Puritanism and materialism.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of cold Anglo-Saxons melting in the Mediterranean sun
had of course already been explored extensively by novelists like
Henry James and E.M. Forster. Laurents, boldly for the early 1950s,
translates the idea into more openly sexual terms, suggesting that
monogamy and celibacy are not necessarily virtues. As Signora
Fioria (Cigdem Onat), the worldly landlady of the pensione where
Leona is staying, says of Americans, ``You have such impractical
morality.''
</P>
<P>
   This impracticality is part of a larger tendency to delay
immediate pleasures in the name of unrealistic ideals. This is
reflected not only in the main, aborted love story of ``Cuckoo,''
but also in the portraits of the other Americans at the pensione.
</P>
<P>
   There are the McIlhennys (Polly Holliday and Tom Aldredge), an
elderly couple who are finding Europe a bit of a bore, and Eddie
and June Yaeger (Adam Trese and Ana Reeder), a pair of newlyweds
with conflicting notions of romantic love.
</P>
<P>
   Laurents brings these separate lives into head-on collision with
dexterity. And occasionally, as in a speculative, teasing
conversation between June and Eddie on marital infidelity, he gives
truly organic and particular life to the play's basic arguments.
</P>
<P>
   He also, however, lends his characters, especially the Italians,
the epigrammatic eloquence of teachers in the school of life.
Renato, for example, in courting Leona, says, ``The noise in your
head is so loud, Miss Samish. Be quiet. Let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One might offer the same advice to Martin and his ensemble. The
production never overcomes a self-consciousness that starts with
James Noone's picturesque but artificial-looking set, in which a
carved Venetian landscape looms in monochromatic relief, and
extends to the Tennessee Williams-esque siren calls of the
gondoliers.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are too often pitched high in the name of
thematic clarity and instant laughs. Monk, in particular, has been
given some ungainly comic business, including an overextended
pantomime scene in which she tries to conduct a conversation with a
non-English-speaking servant (Chiara Mangiameli). And having Leona
walk with a trembling, stiff-legged gait after first being kissed
by Renato seems cheap.
</P>
<P>
   In his revised script for ``Cuckoo,'' Laurents makes it clear
that Leona is no virgin. And he has scaled up her big moment of
drunken humiliation _ something, Laurents has written, he felt
Booth never took far enough _ by having the shockable McIlhennys in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Monk, who looks smart and crisp in Theoni V.
Aldredge's New Look-style dresses, pursues her character's harsher
side with a vengeance, a tendency that reaches its climax when
Leona flashes the McIlhennys with a view of her panties in the
party scene. Even in less demonstrative moments, Leona gives off a
strident, manic quality, and you are always aware of her
uncomfortable reliance on alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   There is a brave intelligence in Monk's performance. But as it
is, her shrillness keeps us at a wary distance. Though the other
characters keep saying how likable Leona is, you get the feeling
that underneath they're thinking of organizing an intervention to
get her on a plane to the Betty Ford Center, or whatever the 1950s
equivalent was.
</P>
<P>
   Krupa's Renato begins promisingly, all animal amorality and
bedroom eyes, but once he starts the speechifying, he turns into a
bore. More crucially, it is a cold chemistry that he and Monk
produce together.
</P>
<P>
   Trese and Reeder look appropriately young and healthy, although
they are also more wooden than their elders. A canny child actor
named Sebastian Uriarte is terrific as a tough Venetian urchin. And
the ravishing and ravaged-looking Onat, though Turkish, expertly
conveys Italian-style sensuality as Americans came to think of it
through the films of Anna Magnani.
</P>
<P>
   Aldredge and Holliday, estimable veterans both, don't have much
to do, but they make a definite impression. They could easily come
across as corn-pone innocents abroad, but there's a sobering,
understated air of disappointment about the McIlhennys.
</P>
<P>
   When Holliday murmurs, of the couple's experience of Europe, ``I
don't know what we expected, really,'' she makes the evening's most
affecting case for the dangers of inflated expectations. It's a
quiet moment, but it sets off widening ripples. This production
could use more of the same.

 &HT;    Media swarm meets Junior
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ A black Mercedes CLK60 with Florida license
WICKID-1 rolled into the parking lot of the city of Sarasota Sports
Complex at 9:06 Monday morning and the Messiah of Cincinnati
baseball stepped out.
</P>
<P>
   The Messiah of Cincinnati baseball didn't look like a messiah in
his dark blue Nike T-shirt (what else but Nike?), his white Nike
shoes (what else but Nike?) and his blue jeans (what, Nike doesn't
make blue jeans?).
</P>
<P>
   The Ken Griffey Jr. era officially commenced as the Messiah of
Cincinnati baseball walked a gauntlet of cameras from his car to
the clubhouse before meeting 150 members of the media representing
65 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the arrival of Greg Vaughn last year ushered in a
new area of facial hair in Cincinnati, Junior's arrival ushers in a
new era of diamond earrings.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden said it had nothing to do with
Junior's ear-lobe preference, that the club was adjusting to the
times, but as some folks already are saying, ``Whatever Junior
wants?'' Yes, look for players to wear their hats turned backward
during practice, something else Griffey does. In the past, Bowden
has been known to walk up to a player and turn his hat bill forward
if he catches one wearing it backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Allen (club CEO) and I discussed it over the winter and
decided some of our rules are archaic as far as society goes and
needed changing,'' Bowden said. ``Stud earrings are OK, but nothing
dangling over the lobes. If 29 other clubs can wear them, why not
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   As Bowden said, ``Cincinnati is back on the map. We were able to
trade for the best player in the game and we're very proud again to
wear Reds uniforms,'' complete with earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's clubhouse entrance was without extraordinary fanfare _
Sean Casey, his locker neighbor, stuck out his hand and said,
``What's up, Junior?'' Mostly the players sat in their chairs in
stunned awe.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Barry Larkin broke the ice by shouting, ``Hey, come
over here and clean my locker, Junior.'' Griffey ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey spent three hours at the complex, dressing in his
home-game uniform to pose for Upper Deck baseball cards, unpacking
gear and schmoozing with his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I have to do is remember names,'' he said.
``I'm glad the names are on the backs of the (spring) uniforms
until I can learn first names. The big thing is that everybody's
childhood dream is to play in your hometown and now I get to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, 30, is forever low-key and soft-spoken, a difficult
read.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as excited as I get,'' he said softly as he sat
atop the first-base dugout with a microphone in his hand, facing
the media seated in the Ed Smith Stadium stands. ``It's as excited
as I get other than sliding into home against the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't get that chance this year unless he helps the Reds work
their way into the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this attention is a surprise,'' he said. ``I just want to
be on the field. I feel no extra pressure, I just want to do what I
do, play hard and have fun and help the team win. Money is not
important. Winning a championship is what is important. A lot of
things have been said and written about me that aren't true. I just
want to forget all that and go play.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about landing in the same division as Chicago's Sammy Sosa
and St. Louis' Mark McGwire, Junior said, ``I'm not facing those
guys. And as far as catching Hank Aaron's home run record, I'm
still 350 away (357), a lot. I got to the the majors a lot sooner
than most guys, when I was 19. Of course, if you break a record,
you'd like to do it in front of the home crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin did the most talking about his friend and new teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke all my baseball records at Moeller (a high school in
Cincinnati), but he is not going to break my stolen base records
here . . . he doesn't have time,'' Larkin said. ``I'm going to bat
in front of him (second to Griffey's third) and he told me he would
take one strike, just one, to let me steal. That's cool. I want him
to hit. He is here to hit. With him in our lineup, there is not a
weak link. It's a very sound, strong lineup. All we need is one guy
to step up for the fifth spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected us to win last year, but we expected to win
and almost did,'' Larkin added. ``We expect it even more this year
with the people we have.''

 &HT;    Junior's trade to Reds boosts teams' ticket sales
 &HT;    By Marc Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Normally at this time of the year, the Cincinnati
Reds sell tickets during the week and take off weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Not with Ken Griffey Jr. on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Even opposing National League teams are getting a boost from
Griffey, who was traded to the Reds in a 4-for-1 deal Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have been in the last two weekends,'' a Reds
spokesperson said Monday. ``They normally don't do that. Sales have
been brisk _ with the biggest request for season tickets _ but we
don't have a good gauge on where we are on sales.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Opening Day is sold out, and the team is close to
selling out the three-game Cleveland series, July 7-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, whose per-game attendance averaged 24,774 last year,
19th best in baseball, say tickets for other games in all areas are
still available. The affect of the Griffey trade last week also has
been felt where baseball's other two most notable sluggers are
located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are noticeably up for our two series' with the Reds,''
said Chicago Cubs (home of Sammy Sosa) director of ticket
operations Frank Maloney. ``I think all six games will be sellouts.
Four are close now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Wrigley Field, which seats 38,902, has already sold
out the outfield bleacher section for 23 games, including four of
the six games with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis (Mark McGwire's home), where the Cards' attendance
averaged 40,960 last season _ fourth best in baseball _ 10,000
tickets for games against the Reds were sold in the two days
following the trade. ``We've had sales like that for McGwire late
in the season, but not for another team,'' a Cards spokesperson
said. ``Griffey is a huge draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are in St. Louis for two three-game series', July 4-6
and Sept. 29-Oct. 1 to end the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's standing room only for the last game, but that would
normally be the case anyway,'' the spokesperson said. ``But the
July 4 weekend is usually not big for us. Griffey made a big impact
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton, where the Class A Dayton Dragons will begin play this
summer as a Reds' affiliate, team president Bob Murphy said
Griffey's arrival did not impact local sales, although the Dragons
already had sold about 94 percent of their available tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Seattle, where Griffey's trade was rumored for
months, sales were not affected prior to the trade. When individual
tickets went on sale Feb. 5 _ five days before the trade _ the
Mariners sold a near team record of about 42,000.

NO SOLACE FOR WIDOW OF ATTICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 28 years have passed, and still Ann Valone chokes up
when she talks about what happened at the Attica state prison.
Twenty-eight years is not such a long time when the subject is the
day your life was turned upside down forever.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1971, Valone was a hospital nurse in Batavia, N.Y.,
east of Buffalo. She lived there then, as she does now, in a house
10 miles up the road from Attica. Her husband, Carl Valone, was a
prison guard, making about $9,000 a year. Even back then, it wasn't
much money, not with four children and the grocery and dentist
bills that go with them.
</P>
<P>
   That fateful day, Attica inmates rioted. They clubbed a guard to
death, then took several dozen prison employees hostage, beginning
a four-day siege that would become the bloodiest prison uprising in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hostages was Carl Valone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody called and said she heard on the radio that there was
a riot,'' Valone, now 70, said in a phone interview. ``It wasn't
till later that day that I learned my husband was a hostage. It's a
shocking thing. It's like you get almost into a shell or something.
You go into a fog.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a catch in her voice as she recalled how the fog
thickened when state troopers were ordered four days later to
retake the prison. They went in with guns blazing, firing at
convicts and hostages alike. When the Attica dust settled, 43 were
dead. All but 4 were killed in that trooper fusillade _ 29 inmates
and 10 hostages, including Carl Valone, 43.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who say the authorities had no choice but to end the
siege have acknowledged that the trooper assault was poorly
conceived and executed. A state investigating commission said as
much a year later. One disillusioned state prosecutor called it ``a
turkey shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' Valone said, ``you get real angry at the inmates.
Then you find out they acted more humane than the officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Attica's aftermath only deepened her bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, officials visited her and other families of
slain guards. ``New York state suits,'' her oldest daughter,
Maryann, calls them. The suits persuaded Valone to accept a
settlement no different from what she could have expected if her
husband had died in an accident in the prison machine shop.
</P>
<P>
   She got a one-shot payment of about $27,000, three times Carl
Valone's yearly pay. From then on, she has also been paid $120 in
workers' compensation every two weeks. Nearly all the families
agreed to this arrangement _ not realizing, Valone said, that they
were also signing away their right to bring wrongful-death suits
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take her long to feel she'd been had.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the things they did wrong, they just kind of said,
`Oops,' and closed the books,'' she said. ``It was an insulting
amount for a man's life, for what my children suffered. They grew
up without a father. I can't explain to you how put down we felt
over the years by the treatment we got.''
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing _ if anything about Attica can be called funny _
is that nothing prevented surviving inmates from bringing lawsuits.
They did just that, for wounds suffered in the assault and for
brutal reprisals later endured. For years, the cases dragged on.
Finally, they reached some resolution last week when a federal
judge in Rochester approved a settlement in which the state agreed,
while admitting no wrongdoing, to pay $12 million to inmates and
their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And the families of the dead guards? As ever, they are out of
it. To Daniel Burling, that's unfair. Burling is a Republican
assemblyman from Wyoming County, which encompasses Attica. ``Most
people feel the families were taken advantage of,'' he said. ``They
placed their faith in the state, and the state was more concerned
about protecting its interests than taking care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash is a time-honored way to acknowledge someone's pain. The
assemblyman intends to introduce a bill to give an extra $90,000 in
death benefits to each family of a slain Attica employee. There is
nothing magical about the figure. It equals 10 times the guards'
rough average salary in 1971, and was chosen, Burling said, only
because it seemed ``realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether his fellow lawmakers agree remains to be seen. For
Valone, no amount of money can buy peace of mind. She'd rather that
the state unseal all records relating to the sorry Attica affair.
But she also does not bank on ever seeing that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like some kind of justice,'' she said. ``We've never been
able to heal.''

DE LA HOYA AND TRINIDAD IN NEW YORK  
 CHAVEZ ON UNDERCARD  
 SCREAMING MATCH AFTER BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oscar De La Hoya plans to make the most of his visit
to New York this week, with television appearances on ``The View''
and ``Late Show With David Letterman.'' But Felix Trinidad, who
took away De La Hoya's World Boxing Council welterweight title in a
controversial decision last September, will try to steal some of
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is in town for his welterweight bout against Derrell
Coley on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. The 12-round
match will be televised on HBO's ``Championship Boxing'' series.
Trinidad will hold a workout at the Church Street Gym in lower
Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon in preparation for his bout with
David Reid, the World Boxing Association superwelterweight
champion, on March 3 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Trinidad-Reid bout came as a result of the failure to make a
rematch between De La Hoya and Trinidad. The door is still open for
the rematch, and De La Hoya believes it will be made once Trinidad
realizes he can't make as much money fighting anyone other than De
La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Trinidad-Reid bout is less than two weeks away,
De La Hoya said he doubted it would take place. De La Hoya said the
fight, which is to be broadcast on pay-per-view by Showtime Event
Television, won't generate enough money to pay the purses of
Trinidad and Reid. Trinidad is scheduled to earn $4 million and
Reid $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make financial sense for Trinidad,'' De La Hoya
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to buy the pay-per-view for that fight. And if
he wins, so what? But if he loses, then he has nowhere to go. If he
comes back for the rematch, then everything is different.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya last fought in New York in 1995 when he stopped Jesse
James Leija in the second round of a lightweight championship bout.
The Garden has sold 11,000 of the 18,000 tickets for his fight
against Coley.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez on Undercard
</P>
<P>
   When David Reid defends his World Boxing Association title
against Felix Trinidad on March 3 at Caesars Palace, Julio Cesar
Chavez of Mexico, a former world champion in three weight classes,
will box on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Chavez (103-4-2, 86 knockouts) will meet Bobby
Elkins (28--8, 22 knockouts) of Nashville, Tenn., according to an
announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming Match After Bout
</P>
<P>
   The 122-pound world championship bout this past Saturday night
in Las Vegas between Erik Morales, the World Boxing Organization
title-holder, and Marco Antonio Barrera, who holds the WBC version
of the title, was explosive for all 12 rounds. But the real
fireworks started after Morales (36-0), the WBC superbantamweight
champion, won a controversial split decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum of Top Rank, Morales' promoter, got into a screaming
match with Frank Warren, the promoter for Barrera. And Barrera's
camp began screaming about a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Duane Ford scored the bout 114-113 for Barrera. Judge
Carol Castellano scored it 114-113 for Morales. Judge Dalby Shirley
scored the bout 115-112 for Morales. On Shirley's scorecard,
Morales won rounds five through 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel and know I'm the champion,'' Barrera said. ``You
can't fight two rivals, the judges and Erik Morales. The judges
know who won the fight. I'm going to ask the president of the WBO
to let me keep my title, because I didn't lose it. I'd rather have
had the guy knock me out than to have him rob me of my title like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to CompuBox punch statistics, Barrera threw 511 power
punches and connected on 272, while Morales threw 723 power punches
and landed 290. But Morales seemed worse from the wear of the fight
than Barrera did.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' face was black and blue and his body was covered with
red welts. Barrera's face was puffy and he had a small cut on his
left cheek. Morales said he felt he won the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult fight, but I feel I won most minutes of the
rounds,'' Morales said. ``Barrera was trying to steal the last
minute of the rounds. I think the judges recognized that.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales said he doubted that there would be a rematch. He said
he would abandon the 122-pound division and move up to 126 pounds.
He said he expected to face the winner of the Luisito Espinosa-Guty
Espanda bout for the vacant WBC featherweight championship.

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS SPAR IN LIVELY DEBATE ON RACIAL ISSUES
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley
squared off on the stage of the legendary Apollo Theatre on Monday
night in the most spirited debate yet of their contest for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous audience that filled the 86-year-old black
entertainment landmark contributed to the lively nature of the
debate. The audience alternated between applause and jeers as the
Democratic rivals skewered each other over their records in the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a community activist in Harlem, helped set
the tone of the debate with the first question to the candidates
about what they would do to end racial profiling, the police
practice of identifying crime suspects on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   In posing the question, Sharpton noted that ``many in our
community have to live in fear of both the cops and the robbers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, who is trailing Gore in the polls, the debate on
racial and urban issues presented one of his last opportunities to
gain ground on the vice president before the important ``Super
Tuesday'' primaries and caucuses in 16 states March 7.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley came out swinging from the opening moments of the
90-minute nationally televised debate, which was sponsored by CNN
and Time magazine and moderated by CNN's Bernard Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger repeatedly cited votes taken by Gore as a member
of Congress from Tennessee in the 1970s and 1980s that Bradley said
revealed the vice president's ``conservative Democrat'' nature.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that Gore's support for anti-gun-control
measures in Congress had made him the ``poster boy'' for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Bradley tried to present Gore with the record
of votes he said were in favor of tax exemptions for private
schools that discriminate on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a copy of all five of those votes, my statement in
opposition and the Congressional Black Caucus's, saying this would
got to Bob Jones University,'' he told Gore. ``You have to face up
to this if you're going to be a strong leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president refused to accept the documents Bradley
held out to him. And he pointed out that nearly all the members of
the Congressional Black Caucus had endorsed his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded with a challenge to Bradley to explain one of his
committee votes against legislation providing affirmative action
for minority broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley was growing ``desperate'' and was trying to
``build yourself up'' with the attacks on votes the vice president
took more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the two generally agreed with each
other on substantive policy matters. Both vowed to end racial
profiling, to support increased funding for urban schools, to
continue affirmative action programs, to review abuses in the
criminal justice system, to fight AIDS in the minority community
and to expand health care coverage for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   They also repeated their opposition to the Confederate battle
flag flying over the state capitol in South Carolina and criticized
the Republicans, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, for not speaking out against the flag.
</P>
<P>
   They repeated their differences over the scope of health
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was willing to express support for economic reparations
to African Americans for centuries of slavery, though both
indicated support for greater recognition of African American
contributions to American culture.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley was the aggressor throughout, Gore took every
opening Bradley gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bradley's acknowledgement Sunday that a special
prosecutor should investigate the Democratic Party's role in the
1996 campaign finance scandal, Gore said, ``Senator Bradley, you
must be the only Democrat in America who misses Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was the former independent counsel who investigated
President Clinton on a variety of matters, including the White
House sex scandal that led to his impeachment.

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS SPAR IN LIVELY DEBATE ON RACIAL ISSUES
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley
squared off on the stage of the legendary Apollo Theatre on Monday
night in the most spirited debate yet of their contest for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous audience that filled the 86-year-old black
entertainment landmark contributed to the lively nature of the
debate. The audience alternated between applause and jeers as the
Democratic rivals skewered each other over their records in the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a community activist in Harlem, helped set
the tone of the debate with the first question to the candidates
about what they would do to end racial profiling, the police
practice of identifying crime suspects on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   In posing the question, Sharpton noted that ``many in our
community have to live in fear of both the cops and the robbers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, who is trailing Gore in the polls, the debate on
racial and urban issues presented one of his last opportunities to
gain ground on the vice president before the important ``Super
Tuesday'' primaries and caucuses in 16 states March 7.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley came out swinging from the opening moments of the
90-minute nationally televised debate, which was sponsored by CNN
and Time magazine and moderated by CNN's Bernard Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger repeatedly cited votes taken by Gore as a member
of Congress from Tennessee in the 1970s and 1980s that Bradley said
revealed the vice president's ``conservative Democrat'' nature.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that Gore's support for anti-gun-control
measures in Congress had made him the ``poster boy'' for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Bradley tried to present Gore with the record
of votes he said were in favor of tax exemptions for private
schools that discriminate on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a copy of all five of those votes, my statement in
opposition and the Congressional Black Caucus's, saying this would
got to Bob Jones University,'' he told Gore. ``You have to face up
to this if you're going to be a strong leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president refused to accept the documents Bradley
held out to him. And he pointed out that nearly all the members of
the Congressional Black Caucus had endorsed his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded with a challenge to Bradley to explain one of his
committee votes against legislation providing affirmative action
for minority broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley was growing ``desperate'' and was trying to
``build yourself up'' with the attacks on votes the vice president
took more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the two generally agreed with each
other on substantive policy matters. Both vowed to end racial
profiling, to support increased funding for urban schools, to
continue affirmative action programs, to review abuses in the
criminal justice system, to fight AIDS in the minority community
and to expand health care coverage for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   They also repeated their opposition to the Confederate battle
flag flying over the state capitol in South Carolina and criticized
the Republicans, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, for not speaking out against the flag.
</P>
<P>
   They repeated their differences over the scope of health
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was willing to express support for economic reparations
to African Americans for centuries of slavery, though both
indicated support for greater recognition of African American
contributions to American culture.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley was the aggressor throughout, Gore took every
opening Bradley gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bradley's acknowledgement Sunday that a special
prosecutor should investigate the Democratic Party's role in the
1996 campaign finance scandal, Gore said, ``Senator Bradley, you
must be the only Democrat in America who misses Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was the former independent counsel who investigated
President Clinton on a variety of matters, including the White
House sex scandal that led to his impeachment.

 &HT;    Preston King pardoned after 39 years
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A black man from southwest Georgia who spent four
decades in exile after a legal battle with a draft board he claimed
was racist received a full pardon Monday from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The grant of executive clemency allows Preston King, 63, who
last touched American soil in 1961, when ``white'' and ``colored''
water fountains were still the norm in his native Albany and
throughout the South, to return home for his brother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   King was a graduate student when he was convicted of draft
evasion after refusing to respond to an all-white draft board that
began referring to him as ``Preston'' rather than ``Mr. King''
after his race became known.
</P>
<P>
   King's protest of what was a common form of disrespect in the
segregated South resulted in his conviction by an all-white jury
and an 18-month prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Then 23, King jumped bail and has been a federal fugitive ever
since. He has lived most of that time in England, where he is a
political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   During that nearly 40 years, as his family appealed to
Washington, King has mourned from overseas as his mother, father
and three brothers have been buried in the family plot in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest brother, Clennon W. King, died Feb. 12. With the
funeral scheduled Thursday in Albany, the family once again
appealed to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton signed a ``full and unconditional'' pardon
for King to be able to return freely to the United States, said
White House deputy press secretary Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the president has been considering a pardon for
several months, but the death of King's 79-year-old brother sped up
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was certainly expedited out of humanitarian concern for
Mr. King and his family,'' Kennedy said. ``He is pardoned for the
offense for which he was convicted and also indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the pardon was met with jubilation and relief by King's
family in Albany, who had been central to the civil rights movement
in southwest Georgia. Carol King, his sister-in-law and widow of
civil rights attorney C.B. King, said the family is eagerly
awaiting his return Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful thing,'' she said from her Albany home. ``It
transcends 40 years of looking for him to come home. We're just
ecstatic over it. We feel it's an answer to our prayers.
Regrettably, it comes at the time of losing one brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter E. Massey, president of Morehouse College, has explored
the possibility of Preston King accepting an academic position with
the school. But Carol King said she expects her brother-in-law to
return to his home in England after the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, he's planning to visit,'' she said. ``He'll
be leaving Saturday or Sunday. He's a professor and he has his
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Judge William A. Bootle, now 97 and retired in Macon,
presided over King's trial in 1961. Bootle said he never forgot
King's case because it was unusual. King was willing to report for
duty if the draft board referred to him with respect, Bootle said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, when King's family renewed their efforts to bring
him home, Bootle has been among the most outspoken figures to ask
for a pardon. He wrote a formal letter to the president. On Monday,
Bootle applauded Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted,'' Bootle said. ``I think justice has been done.
I think it's great that the president of the United States would
take time to consider a matter like that. It's democracy at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he deserved the sentence (in 1961). It's the water
that's gone under the bridge since then that's changed the
situation. He's lived a good life for 39 or 40 years. He's
established himself as a good citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drew attention to the fact that he wanted respect. He
wanted to go in the service as a man and not a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   King was a graduate student in England in 1961 and has lived
abroad ever since. He married, had two children and later divorced.
His daughter, Oona, 31, is a member of the British Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   King could not be reached for comment Monday. Chevene King Jr.,
who helped lead the effort to have his uncle return home without
the threat of prosecution, said he spoke with him over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased the president has granted my uncle a
pardon,'' Chevene King said. ``I can't express to you how elated
the family is that this matter will be brought to an end after 39
years. I'm sure to a large degree it won't actually sink in until
we see him home.''

 &HT;    2 death row inmates take guard hostage in Texas prison
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ Two convicted killers who were part of the
Thanksgiving Day 1998 escape attempt from death row fled their
cells and took a guard hostage Monday evening in a new bid for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued late into the night as prison system
director Wayne Scott personally directed attempts to get Ponchai
Wilkerson, 28, and Howard Guidry, 23, to surrender peacefully as
the tense standoff played itself out inside the Terrell Unit just
south of Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reported that the guard _ a 57-year-old woman who has
worked for the prison system 39 months _ appeared unhurt. They
would not identify her.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the episode marked the first hostage situation on
Texas' death row in years, possibly ever. Several years ago, a
guard was held hostage at an Abilene prison and, more recently, a
convict held a correctional worker hostage for a time at a prison
mental unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope this could end peacefully, but we are not
optimistic at this point,'' said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``The most dangerous inmates
are on death row, and we consider both (Wilkerson and Guidry) to be
extremely dangerous. They have nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   While Todd refused to discuss the convicts' demands, other
officials said freedom was sought at least at one point _ and
quickly ruled out. ``No way. That's not negotiable,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials at the scene said the ordeal began just after 4
p.m. Monday as guards were preparing to serve the evening meal, or
had just finished serving it to convicts on death row, a section of
the maximum-security prison. Convicts there remain in their
solitary-confinement cells for 23 hours a day, allowed out only to
exercise or shower _ one by one and under heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``How they got out of their cells, we don't know yet for sure,''
said an official at the scene who asked not to be quoted by name.
``But they probably jimmied their cell doors open.''
</P>
<P>
   Once out of their cells, authorities said Wilkerson and Guidry
grabbed the unarmed guard, handcuffed her with her own handcuffs
and forced her against a wall as other guards called for help.
Officials confirmed that Wilkerson and Guidry were armed with a
sharpened steel rod 12 to 18 inches in length and a steel tool that
resembles a wrench, usually used to open food slots in the steel
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson and Guidry were both sentenced to die by lethal
injection for Houston slayings. Officials said Wilkerson was
scheduled for execution March 15, but Guidry had no date.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the hostage was grabbed, the other 2,800
convicts at the prison were locked in their cells. The prison's
880-plus staff includes more than 632 guards.
</P>
<P>
   After the Thanksgiving Day 1998 escape attempt by eight death
row convicts, prison officials decided to relocate death row to the
much-newer Terrell Unit. Of the 460 convicts under a death
sentence, 112 had been moved to Terrell by Monday and 339 remained
at the Ellis Unit. Eight women under death sentence are housed at
the Mountain View Unit outside Gatesville.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Scott was wounded in an escape attempt from the
historic Walls Unit in Huntsville in which two prison workers who
were taken hostage died.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To a chorus of boos, shouts and cheers at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem, Bill Bradley and Al Gore engaged in the most
brutal presidential debate of the year, with Bradley attacking the
vice president as a ``conservative Democrat'' and Gore caustically
describing his opponent as a ``desperate'' candidate intent on
``tearing down'' his fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The two men drew their swords almost as soon as the session
began, and from there on in, turned almost every question into an
attack. It was politics as spectacle, produced in an 87-year-old
theater that is better known for the music of Charlie Parker and
James Brown than debates between men seeking to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is an elaborate, what I call Gore-dance,''
Bradley said, mocking his opponent when the subject turned to the
two men's position on registering hand guns. ``It's a dance to
avoid facing up your conservative record on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By all means, Bill, get the negativity off your chest, but
when you return, let's face the real problems facing this
country,'' Gore responded. Turning to the crowd, Gore acidly
described his opponent as someone who ``questions the character of
people who disagree with him'' and ``confuses disagreement with not
being a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley, a couple of days ago, your campaign said that
you wanted to get some things off your chest. Well, since then
you've made personal attack after personal attack,'' Gore said.
``The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems. They do
divide us as Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sponsored by Time magazine and CNN, repeatedly
seemed on the verge of running out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time, time, time,'' the moderator, CNN's Bernard Shaw, said
repeatedly as Gore, in particular, tried to respond to Bradley, who
was far more aggressive than he has ever been. At another point,
shouts from an audience member, followed by the shouts of other
members of the audience trying to quiet him, left the two
candidates standing there speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley repeatedly challenged Gore for voting, as a member of
Congress in 1981, to overturn an Internal Revenue Service ruling
that would have denied tax-exempt status to private schools whose
racial make-up did not reflect the community where they were
located. As Gore tried to brush off the challenge, Bradley
responded by attempting to hand Gore a sheaf of papers that he said
included the bills themselves. Gore ignored his opponent, leaving
Bradley standing holding the stack of papers in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was reminiscent of Gore's challenge to Bradley in a
previous television encounter to shake hands on a pledge to take
all TV advertisements off the air. Bradley refused, leaving Gore
with his hand out.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gore responded by attacking Bradley for voting in 1995
against legislation to provide more broadcast franchises to
minority owners of television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the first the two have had in a month, and came
at a particularly critical time for Bradley, whose campaign
nationally _ and in New York, a state where he had once been seen
as posing a powerful challenge to Gore _ has seemed increasingly
adrift. Bradley's supporters viewed Monday night's session as a
chance, arguably one of his last, to effectively put his campaign
back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go in burning with confidence,'' said Jacques DeGraff,
Bradley's deputy national campaign manager. ``This is going to be a
turning point in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is scheduled to deliver what his aides described as two
major speeches in New York over the next two days before heading
out to Washington state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate had barely begun when the two candidates began to
snipe at each other with unusual ferocity. The first question,
posed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, focused on what each candidate would
do to ban racial profiling and prevent police brutality while
keeping crime low.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley repeated his earlier exhortations of why Gore did not
simply stroll down the hall to ask President Clinton to issue an
executive order, immediately, banning racial profiling. Gore said
that work, indeed, had begun to move in that direction. But he
issued the first of numerous one-line zingers by firing back: ``You
know, racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, senator.''
</P>
<P>
   The nastiness permeated the next few minutes, on issues ranging
from possible reparations for slavery, to health care, to
technology and education for African-Americans. Several times, Gore
criticized Bradley for failing to support legislation that would
have expanded the number of black and minority-owned broadcasting
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But on issues of particular importance to minority voters, the
two candidates clashed even more bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley accused Gore of seeking to end federal affirmative
action, and he was sharply critical of Gore's vote to preserve the
tax-exempt status of schools like Bob Jones University, pulling out
copies of bills and testimonials demonstrating the two candidates'
differing positions. Bradley even tried to offer the papers to
Gore, thrusting them like a frustrated student.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to face up to this if you're going to be a strong
leader,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 minutes of the debate, Bradley also began to attack
Gore as having a conservative record as a congressman, on issues
over everything from tobacco to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks made up 16 percent of the electorate in the 1992
Democratic primary in New York. Clinton won 52 percent of the black
vote, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls at the
time; that was considered the key to his winning the three-way race
with 41 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains hugely popular with blacks in New York, as in
the rest of the country, and Gore has closely linked himself to the
president, particularly when appearing before black audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He did so again Monday night. Gore has the support of most of
the major black figures in the state, including Rep. Charles Rangel
of Harlem, H. Carl McCall, the state's controller and highest
elected black official, David Dinkins, the former mayor, and Floyd
B. Flake, the former congressman and Queens minister who endorsed
Gore from his pulpit at Sunday services a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley enjoys far less support among black elected
officials in New York. He has tried to compensate for that with a
show of support from black basketball players and other
celebrities, among them Spike Lee, the film director, who showed up
at the press filing center across the street from the Apollo before
the debate to tell reporters how well he thought Bradley would do.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has made race one of the touchstone issues of his
campaign; his first major campaign speech, delivered in Manhattan
last April, was devoted to the subject of racial discord.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time that Gore and Bradley had appeared at a
debate devoted to black issues . The audience Monday night was
almost entirely black, and had been invited by community and church
organizations. The first question was posed by Sharpton, who, with
Flake, suggested two weeks ago that the two Democratic candidates
hold a debate on racial issues in a black community.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations for Monday's debate turned out to be more than
a little complicated, with prolonged negotiations among the various
parties over who should be given tickets, the make-up of the debate
sponsors and the format. The result was a long-list of sponsors,
and an unusually free-form kind of debate, including an unscreened
array of questioners.

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Thousands of ethnic Albanians from
throughout Kosovo marched on this divided city Monday and clashed
with a phalanx of NATO-led troops who used tear gas and fists to
keep them from reaching the Serbian district.
</P>
<P>
   An throng of protesters _ some estimates put their number at
25,000, others at twice that _ tried to cross the main bridge that
divides the Serb and Albanian sections of this mining town. But the
crowd was turned back as thousands of Serbs stood watching from the
other side. The Albanians repeatedly pushed against the lines of
British and Canadian soldiers and French gendarmes as fights broke
out and demonstrators were hauled away.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's showdown came as tensions continued to build in this
ethnically divided city of 90,000 people. The violence of the past
two weeks has left 11 people dead and dozens wounded, including two
French soldiers who were shot in gun battles.
</P>
<P>
   Wave after wave of protesters arrived Monday on foot from
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province, 25 miles away, and from
the western towns of Pec and Srbica among others. Young men strode
up the main street waving red Albanian flags and banners as they
tried to breach the military lines.
</P>
<P>
   Across the River Ibar, Serbs held the Serbian tricolor aloft and
played Serbian nationalist songs on loudspeakers. For several hours
peacekeepers struggled to contain the crowd and French police
resorted to volley after volley of tear gas over the heads of the
British and Canadians, often leaving the soldiers choking and
retching along with the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall the protesters, some of whom had walked for 10
hours, grew tired and drifted away. The commander of the
peacekeeping force, German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, climbed atop a
British tank to talk to the crowd. He praised his troops for their
restraint and said they had prevented any serious injuries or
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he understood the demonstrators. ``They have shown
the way they want to live and are demonstrating for a better
future. They want a united city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his words underlined the intractable problem this city
presents for the peacekeepers and the U.N. administration. The
Albanians all speak of liberating the city, by which they mean
moving back into the Serb district en masse, which in turn would
force the Serbs to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to liberate the other side,'' said Shyrete Gela, a
35-year-old optician who lives in Mitrovica, as she took shelter in
a shop from the clouds of tear gas. ``I have cousins who live over
there. My friend has her flat there too but Serbs are living there
now. Serbs killed my brother, you know. And now people came from
Pristina to help us liberate the city, so we must run with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Mecinaj, 21, who had walked five hours, said: ``We want
the north side to be the same as the south. I want to see my
friends on the other side and for them to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica still bears terrible scars from the Kosovo war when
Serb forces bulldozed dozens of Albanian shops and houses and
destroyed an ancient mosque on the riverbank. Thousands of
Albanians have been unable to return to their homes on the north
side of the city as the Serb community has determinedly defended a
safe area for itself. The few hundred Serbs who lived on the south
side have long since fled.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers' efforts are now focused exclusively on trying
to contain the immediate violence, with little time or energy left
for developing a long-term solution. The British commander on the
bridge, Lt. Col. Nick Carter, spoke throughout the afternoon to the
crowd through a bullhorn, telling the Albanians that he wanted what
they did, a united Mitrovica. That brought loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Later he said he knew that the Albanian vision was quite
different from that envisioned by the international community.
``Don't think that we don't realize we are only buying a little bit
of time here. All I'm doing is holding this ring,'' he said. ``Of
course this is not tenable.''
</P>
<P>
   After the protesters dispersed, Reinhardt, the German general,
told the press: ``There is no switch that you can switch and
everything is better.'' He said his response to the last two weeks
of violence had been to launch a massive security operation
throughout the city during the past five days.
</P>
<P>
   He has ordered more than 2,000 soldiers and police to conduct
house searches for weapons and criminals. Troops, including
American paratroopers, were out again Monday conducting searches,
but the haul of illegal weapons has been small, with fewer than a
dozen Russian Kalashnikov rifles found.
</P>
<P>
   American troops, who were stoned by Serbs in northern Mitrovica
on Sunday, confined their activities to a predominantly Albanian
quarter and encountered no resistance Monday. But they found no
weapons because the area had recently been swept by the French,
raising questions about the value of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally these operations are of a more political value than
anything,'' Mario Morcone, the U.N. administrator in Mitrovica,
said of the general search operation. He maintained that security
in the city had improved nevertheless, with a curfew and numerous
checkpoints set up at night.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he hoped that in the next few days some of the
hundreds of Albanian families who fled their homes in the past two
weeks would be able to return to the Serb side. Apart from that, he
acknowledged, he had few ideas left on how to deal with the
problems.

<P>
   Bob Hite Sr., whose commanding voice made countless fans of
``The Lone Ranger'' pull their chairs closer to the family radio,
died on Friday in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 86 and lived in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Hite began his radio career in the 1930s, when he worked for
station WXYZ in Detroit. His voice was soon being heard on several
shows, including ``The Green Hornet'' serial, but it was his
delivery of the introduction to ``The Lone Ranger'' that regularly
carried listeners back to ``those thrilling days of yesteryear''
when the Western hero rode out of the past on his great steed
Silver, ``a fiery horse with the speed of light.''
</P>
<P>
   Hite worked for CBS in New York during World War II, reading
news reports from correspondents overseas. There he met Walter
Cronkite, who became a close friend. And when Frank Sinatra
appeared with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra for the first time, Hite
introduced him to the audience. He retired from CBS in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nancy Boyle Hite, of Sarasota, Fla.;
a son, Bob Jr., of Florida; and three daughters, Nancy Speck of New
Jersey, Cindy Hite Content of Palm Beach, Fla., and Kimberly Schad
of Australia.

DESPITE HIS DENIALS, FIZER IS CYCLONES' KEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iowa State junior forward Marcus Fizer insists that he would not
be a leading candidate for Big 12 Player of the Year if not for a
supporting cast of multi-talented guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be the player I am today if not for Michael Nurse,
Jamaal Tinsley, Kantrail Horton and all the guys,'' Fizer insists.
``One player can't win it all. The ball begins in their hands. They
give it to me. They deserve all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer might pass on credit for the Cyclones' surprising run at
the Big 12 championship, but few would argue that the power forward
is the prime reason for Iowa State's success. The Cyclones (22-4,
10-2) go into tonight's battle in Ames, Iowa, with Texas (19-6,
10-2) knotted with the Longhorns and Oklahoma State atop the
conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about any of their kids you want, and there have
been some great additions,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said.
``But it all started with Marcus Fizer and his mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents point to a marked improvement in Fizer's game from his
sophomore season. A more mature Fizer has displayed newfound
leadership and the dogged determination to become a dominant
player. But Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy points to the bottom
line as the area where Fizer has had the most visible effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``His impact on winning is his biggest improvement,'' Eustachy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer led the Big 12 in scoring (18.0 points per game) a season
ago and was eighth in rebounding (7.6). But he was mildly surprised
last summer when he was not one of the 12 players selected for the
USA Basketball team that won the gold medal at the World University
Games in Spain. He made the top 16, but did not survive the final
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way it was a shock,'' Fizer said. ``But among the final
16 players, everyone had been to postseason \Rplay\S except me.
Some had been to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had worked hard to get to that point and considered
it a great blessing that I had gotten that far. But I became more
mentally focused after not making the team. Actually, that
experience gave me a lot of extra confidence and made me want to
work harder to get my school recognized, gave me more drive to work
as hard as I could to be the best I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer again leads the conference in scoring (21.2) and ranks
seventh in rebounding (7.8), but teammates say he's much more
valuable than the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about what Marcus does for this team
because he does a little bit of everything,'' Iowa State senior
forward Stevie Johnson said. ``He's matured so much in every phase
of his game. He's gotten so much better, bigger and stronger. It's
so evident, everyone can see it. Not only his teammates, but people
watching in on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also evident to opponents watching game tapes. Texas
forward Gabe Muoneke, who along with Chris Owens and sometimes
Chris Mihm will be asked to take turns guarding Fizer tonight, said
no one has improved more in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as physical as he's ever been, but he's much more mobile
than he ever was,'' Muoneke said. ``He does things all over the
court that make everyone else on his team better. But this year,
he's got more help, which allows him to be a better player, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in Fizer has been most evident to Eustachy, who built
this year's team around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus is a different guy, more mature,'' Eustachy said. ``He
lets the game come to him. He dictates the game. It dictated him
last year. If things went well early, fine. If it didn't, it
affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also changed his body this summer. Fat turned to muscle. He
now benches close to 400 pounds, and there's more pop to him
because he lost some weight. He's playing above the rim a lot more.
And he's taking fewer shots, yet scoring more because he's taking
better shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the Big 12 race, Fizer said this season
has erased the memories of the past two, when the Cyclones were a
combined 17-33 and 11-21 in conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the best year of my life in basketball,'' Fizer
said. ``It's almost nullified those first two seasons. I wouldn't
trade this season or this group of guys for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer shies away from personal adulation, but accepts his role
as the team's leading player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Superman,'' he said. ``I have flaws just like anyone
else. I just try to be a leader and do the right things. I want to
help carry this team as far as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, that's been right to the top of the Big 12.

BARNEY CHILDS, 73, COMPOSER AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash., Ariz., Wis., Texas, Nev.)  (lb) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barney Childs, a composer and teacher, died on Jan. 11 at his
home in Redlands, Calif. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was Parkinson's disease, said his friend and colleague
Phillip Rehfeldt.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Spokane, Wash., Childs grew up there and in Palo Alto,
Calif. He studied at the University of Nevada and at Oxford and
Stanford universities, taking courses in English as well as music.
Later he taught in both fields. In composition, though, he was
self-taught until he was in his late 20s, when he studied with
Aaron Copland and Carlos Chavez at Tanglewood and Elliott Carter in
New York. By the late 1950s his music was gaining national
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he had begun teaching at the University of Arizona,
where he worked from 1956 to 1965. He became the dean of Deep
Springs College in California, and composer in residence at the
Wisconsin College Conservatory before taking a post at Redlands
University in California. In 1989 he was a visiting lecturer at
Goldsmiths College at the University of London.
</P>
<P>
   His musical enthusiasms were broad, and they all left a mark on
his compositions, which embraced the mainstream masters of his
early years, like Hindemith, along with Ives, Cage and jazz. Cage's
influence was a particular liberation, leading Childs to engage the
performer in more or less free music making. Among Childs' many
works are two symphonies, concertos for clarinet and timpani,
quintets for wind and brass, string quartets and other chamber
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote numerous articles and was a co-editor, with the
composer Elliott Schwartz, of one of the central sourcebooks for
music of the late 20th century, ``Contemporary Composers on
Contemporary Music.'' Between 1964 and 1982 he also ran Advance
Recordings, which provided an outlet to experimental composers like
Richard Maxfield, Harold Budd and Robert Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Dirje Smith of Flint, Texas,
and Margaret Childs of Las Vegas.

MISSOURI LAWMAKERS CONSIDER REVAMPING THE WAY STATE SOCIAL WORKERS
HANDLE CHILD ABUSE REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ A far-reaching
proposal to revamp the way state social workers handle reports of
child abuse is gaining momentum among state lawmakers, supporters
say.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plan, inspired in part by last year's torture and starvation
deaths of Kansas City brothers Larry and Gary Bass, would require
social workers to contact police any time they open an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It would require each county to designate a chief investigator
who is a specialist in child abuse. It would require social service
agencies to enlist the help of schools, police, child care
providers and other resources when investigating reports of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And it would set up a state Social Services SWAT team that would
have police powers, including the authority to seek search warrants
when adults are suspected of trying to cover up abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Democratic Sen. Joe Maxwell of Mexico, said
the measure was an effort to harness all the resources already
available to combat child abuse. The current approach is so
fragmented among multiple agencies that serious omissions can
occur, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how badly the system can fail, he pointed to
the case of 8-year-olds Larry and Gary Bass, who died from
starvation in October. Court records say that their mother, Mary
Bass, admitted punishing them by withholding food and lowering
their legs into scalding water.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1995, neighbors, ministers and teachers notified
the Division of Family Services that the boys, who were part of a
set of triplets, appeared abused. Yet there is no record that the
boys were ever seen by a social worker, officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Three social workers were suspended for 20 days without pay for
failing to notice the pattern of abuse reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask, how can this kind of thing go on so long that
a child can be starved to death?'' Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's plan would centralize responsibility for such cases in
the chief investigator. That person would be required to oversee
the investigation every time social workers received more than one
complaint about the same child or the same abuser.
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigator would have to verify that social workers
actually saw the suspected victim of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said the change could keep reports from teachers and
tips to child abuse hot lines from being ignored or lost in the
shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill requires an affirmative response in connection with
any report to the Division of Family Services,'' Maxwell said.
``They can decide to investigate or not, but I want them to make a
conscious decision in writing to determine whether a criminal
investigation is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said he was confident the plan would pass the Senate.
The House, he said, had also made child abuse a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the death of the Bass children,'' he said, ``everyone in
the Capitol is aware of the importance of child protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reform the way child abuse cases are handled began
last year when Gov. Mel Carnahan appointed a Child Fatality Task
Force to examine patterns of enforcement at the county level.
</P>
<P>
   The effort became a priority after the Bass boys' deaths and the
case of a St. Louis girl who was beaten to death with a broom
handle because she didn't do her homework, Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which could go to the Senate floor as early as this
week, is supported by the Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   Social Services Director Gary Stangler said he especially liked
the cross-agency approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a good job of working with police, but we won't
routinely reach out to groups like teachers, nurses and child care
providers who could provide you with good information on what's
happening with that child,'' Stangler said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gulino, the Jackson County deputy medical examiner who was
co-chairman of the Child Fatality Task Force, was enthusiastic
about most of the bill's reforms. He said making a chief
investigator responsible for an investigation was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way cases are assigned is almost ridiculously variable,''
Gulino said. ``Other times, you hear of cases that are reported to
DFS, but an individual worker just didn't get it. We need a
consistent mechanism for identifying cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's plan also incorporates some of the ideas championed by
Democratic Sen. Harry Wiggins of Kansas City to open the system to
public scrutiny. Wiggins wanted to open investigation records to
temporary guardians of abuse victims and news reporters so that the
public would know when the system went awry.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas went too far for many senators. But Maxwell said the
current law, which keeps the records secret, is too stringent. So
Maxwell's bill would allow the state Social Services director to
open investigative records when disclosure would not harm other
children in the family.
</P>
<P>
   It also would make public the final report issued by each
county's Child Fatality Review Panel. The panels examine how the
system worked and whether the child's death could have been
prevented.
</P>
<P>
   And it would make investigative records produced by the new
state Social Services SWAT team open to the public after an
investigation is completed. The team, known as the State Technical
Assistance Team, would train and aid local agencies in child abuse,
neglect and exploitation cases.
</P>
<P>
   Stangler said making the agencies' records more open would
strengthen accountability, which is important to restoring public
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's damning to the whole system when we can't disclose what
services were provided and what happened in some of these cases,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gulino, however, opposes making the reports of each county's
Child Fatality Review Panel public. The panels could become a forum
for finger-pointing instead of an objective analysis of how the
system could be improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would require the Division of Family Services
to keep most records on unsubstantiated complaints on file for 10
years instead of two. Stangler said a 10-year retention schedule
would help case workers detect patterns of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if a complaint is unsubstantiated, if you see six of them
in four years, that's a signal that something is wrong,'' he said.
``Often, that is important in helping us protect a younger
sibling.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is SB0757 and SB602.

LIBERTY, MO., COLLEGE MOVING SWORD THAT BELONGED TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Question: Where is a
good place to keep George Washington's sword?
<TEXT>
<P>
   That is what William Jewell College in Liberty had to consider
in 1996, when the school took possession of a sword that once
belonged to the first president, whose birthday is being observed
today.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: in a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   The sword was given to the school by a descendant of John Gano,
a Baptist minister in the Revolutionary War era for whom the
college's chapel is named. Recently it has been kept in a glass
case mounted on a wall in the office of the school's president.
</P>
<P>
   That will change soon, however. In October the KC150 Legacy Fund
granted $9,475 to a Liberty-area chapter of the Sons of the
American Revolution to build a new display case.
</P>
<P>
   In the autumn, when the ongoing renovation of the college's Gano
Chapel is complete, the sword will be installed there, where it can
be seen by more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sword needs to have secure display,'' said Calvin W.
Hawkins, secretary of the Corum chapter of the Sons of the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chapel will be a very appropriate place.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Gano Redpath, who donated the sword to William Jewell,
chose the college because it apparently is home to the only
building in America named for Gano, who served as chaplain in the
Continental Army.
</P>
<P>
   Washington presented the sword to Gano in appreciation after the
chaplain baptized the first president. Washington had received the
sword from the Marquis de Lafayette of France.
</P>
<P>
   When the sword finally is installed at the chapel, it will join
another Washington artifact held by William Jewell: a 1908 painting
depicting the baptism.
</P>
<P>
   The painting had hung in an Asbury Park, N.J,. Baptist church
before being presented in 1926 to Jewell by another descendant.
Currently in storage, it, too, will be placed in the renovated Gano
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, for security reasons, the items had to be put where
most people weren't even aware of them,'' said Raymond Jones,
executive director of college relations at William Jewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the public display will kindle some historical awareness
that wasn't previously there.''

BIRCH-TELECOM  BIRCH TELECOM GETS $125 MILLION IN LOANS TO EXPAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANAS CITY, Mo. _ Birch Telecom of
Kansas City, which had only a handful of employees two years ago,
has received $125 million in loans to continue its expansion in
Kansas, Missouri and Texas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The financing, arranged by Lehman Brothers Inc., comes from a
coalition that includes eight banks and institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The loans will give the local telephone service company working
cash and capital to expand its Internet facilities and launch
service in additional cities in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With the loans announced Monday, Birch has raised about $350
million since it was formed in January 1997. The company has more
than 1,000 employees in Kansas, Missouri and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The involvement of these new financial partners coincides with
the many opportunities we will pursue during 2000,'' said David E.
Scott, Birch president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are launching additional markets in Texas, expanding to 17
by year-end. To support the increase in customers, lines and
products offered, we continue to invest heavily in our back-office
capabilities, both in information systems and through a significant
expansion of our provisioning and customer care work force.''
</P>
<P>
   The loans were made in a combination of a $25 revolving credit
line for working capital and a $100 million term loan that can be
drawn on as needed to pay for telecommunications systems and
back-office systems.

   DEARBORN, Mich. _ While Gov. George W. Bush tried Monday to
rally Michigan voters for Tuesday's primary here with a sunny
message of tax cutting and political reform, a second, shadow
campaign by his allies sought to sow suspicions of Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCain reported receiving automated telephone
calls in which the recorded voice of the televangelist Pat
Robertson urged them to ``protect unborn babies and restore
religious freedom'' by opposing McCain.
</P>
<P>
   As he has on his cable television program, Robertson, a
supporter of Bush, accuses McCain of having chosen as his national
chairman ``a vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians
in politics are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be
censors.''  &UR;  &LR;  The reference is to Warren Rudman, the former New
Hampshire senator, who used those phrases in his autobiography to
describe some in the Christian right, although he also said there
were ``some fine, sincere people in its ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, as he crossed the state on the final day of campaigning
before the primary, continued to attack Bush as a character
assassin and pretender to the mantle of Republican reformer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Robertson said Monday night that he had made the
recording for the Michigan Christian Coalition, without the
knowledge of the Bush campaign. Bush aides said they knew nothing
of the calls and that the direct calls they were making to voters
were all positive. ``All of our scripts are positive
get-out-the-vote scripts,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel campaigns here against McCain, one above the fray
and the other slashing, recalled the pattern in South Carolina,
where third parties spread damaging, exaggerated, and sometimes
false information about McCain. The votes of conservative
Christians, who were and are the focus of those messages, were
crucial to Bush's victory in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, other third-party groups were also coming to Bush's
aid with radio commercials that inflamed doubts about McCain's
commitment to ending abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As the McCain campaign revealed late Monday that it had a
recorded instance of Robertson's calls, the Bush campaign accused
McCain of ``attack phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign released transcripts of two such calls, in which an
automated voice repeated many of the same criticisms that McCain
has made publicly. One call accused Bush of increasing public
spending by a greater percentage in Texas than Bill Clinton has in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both McCain and Bush are good men,'' the caller continued,
``but John McCain has a much more conservative record on fighting
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The second call accused Bush of a ``negative smear campaign''
and urged a vote against ``negative smear politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hudome, McCain's top aide in Michigan, said that the two
calls transcribed by the Bush campaign were consistent with calls
the McCain forces were making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to make advocacy calls,'' Hudome said. ``It's
another thing to make push-style negative calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter, he said, was the approach of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's message Monday was largely consistent with those calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like Luke Skywalker trying to get out of the Death
Star,'' declared the senator, delighting in his new Star Wars
imagery before a rowdy crowd at Heritage High School in Saginaw,
north of here.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to Michigan's independent-minded voters, he held
Bush's establishment support, including from Gov. John Engler,
against him. ``I'm telling you, they're shooting at me from
everywhere. Everybody's against me. Governor Engler, Governor Bush,
all the governors, all the senators. And we're going to kill them,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   As some in the crowd chanted ``No more Bush,'' McCain replied,
``I thank you. There's our secret weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to ignore his Republican rival Monday, explaining to
reporters that ``this is the time to rally the vote.'' He preferred
to direct his barbs at Vice President Al Gore, who he accused of
``politics that's so stale and so negative.''
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed, Bush once again questioned McCain's commitment
to cleaning up the political system. ``He talks about the iron
triangle in Washington, D.C,'' Bush said, referring to the
senator's complaints about the links between lobbyists, campaign
donations and legislation. ``He's been ringing that iron triangle
like a dinner bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Bush's simile, McCain responded, ``He's the one taking
all the money from them. Seems to me he's had a Pavlovian
reaction.'' With a laugh, he essayed a metaphor, accusing Bush of
having ``both feet in the trough.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of boutique politicking in New Hampshire and South
Carolina, the candidates, short of time to impress voters and short
of patience with each other, were counting on their national images
and a burst of appearances to make and correct impressions in what
Bush on Monday called an abbreviated ``two-day primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, Bush was buoyant as he moved from east to west,
from the company of workers at a Detroit factory to a rally among
Grand Rapids' more conservative voters Monday evening. McCain
traveled from north to south before flying home in the evening to
Arizona, which also votes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening Monday, the Bush and McCain campaigns
traded accusations of sinister telephone calls. Bush aides supplied
the telephone numbers of women who said they had received calls
accusing Bush of being anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Karns, who lives in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham,
said that she received a call at 5:30 p.m. that issued a ``Catholic
voters alert.'' Then, she said, the anonymous voice told her ``that
George Bush had gone to Bob Jones University, and Bob Jones
University was anti-Catholic, and George Bush was anti-Catholic.''
Then, she continued, ``It said John McCain was pro-Catholic and I
should vote for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
the caller ``accused Bush of calling the pope the anti-Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign denied any knowledge of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign supplied the telephone number of Sue Eaton,
a homemaker in Ypsilanti who said she had received an automated
telephone call Monday afternoon attacking McCain and ``more or less
insinuating to the fact of being a POW made him have a bad
temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said the call suggested that McCain would have a
hair-trigger temper in dealing with an obstreperous foreign power
like Iraq, and urged her to make a ``wise choice.'' She said she
did not know the origin of the call, and the Bush campaign denied
any knowledge of it.
</P>
<P>
   Any of Michigan's 6.7 million registered voters is free to cast
a ballot Tuesday, regardless of party affiliation. Pollsters have
pronounced the race too close to call, and they say it is highly
dependent on the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Candice Miller, Michigan's secretary of state and state
elections officer, has been predicting that 950,000 voters will
turn out on Tuesday, when the weather is expected to be
unseasonably mild. Just over half a million people voted in the
primary of March 1996.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the bigger voice that the primary's earlier date
has given them in selecting the nominee, Michigan voters are likely
to be drawn to the polls by a variety of local ballot issues, like
whether to add filters to the Internet for Holland's library or to
raise $12 million to overhaul Birmingham's sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by historical patterns, as much as 20 percent of the
potential vote may already have been cast by absentee ballot.
Michigan automatically mails such ballots to its elderly citizens.
</P>
<P>
   John Schwarz, the only Republican state senator to endorse
McCain, said that he was hoping that 1.1 million voters turn out,
because he felt that that would benefit the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Higher turnout, he said, ``indicates more independents are
voting, and you know, Michigan is independent heaven.'' In 1996, 10
percent of the voters in the Republican primary were Democrats, and
28 percent were independents.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina had a record turnout in its primary Saturday,
and Bush won handily.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have indicated that Bush has strong support among
Republicans in Michigan. So given his hopes of rallying
independents, McCain's itinerary Monday was odd, since he did not
campaign in suburban Detroit where independents are concentrated.
``Would I have gone to Oakland county?'' asked Schwarz, speaking by
telephone before climbing back on the candidate's bus in Saginaw.
``Yeah, I would have. But I'm not making those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in two days McCain had hit ``probably six of the
nine media markets in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain began his day in the thinly populated northern reaches of
the state, campaigning in Traverse City. There, at one of his
trademark town meetings, he once again made the quality of the
campaign itself an issue, urging a crowd of more than 1,000 to
``reject this negative campaigning, reject this character
assassination, reject the low road to the presidency and support
the high road.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Detroit, Bush made stops at a Bob's Big restaurant
and an elementary school in Brighton, before giving a midday speech
in East Lansing. There, Bush portrayed himself as the true reformer
in the race. ``If you're sick and tired of the politics of
Washington, D.C., of the gridlock, there's a home for you in this
campaign,'' he said.

NO STOPPING ROME'S EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the first in an annual four-part series on the best and
worst of sports media in Los Angeles. Today: Sports-talk radio
hosts:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jim Rome's ever-expanding glossary doesn't even
have a phrase to accurately describe what's happened to him and his
career over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But just how wack is this:
</P>
<P>
   One day, he's doing a sports-talk show out of a tiny glass
studio above Hot Dog on a Stick at the Fallbrook Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The next, he's nationally syndicated to 138 affiliates, reaching
more than 2 million listeners a day, available on Southern
California radio six hours a day (three live on AM-1150, and
repeated on XTRA-AM 690) and doing a TV version of the show for Fox
Sports Net shown twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a few short years, the San Fernando Valley native has gone
from a local force to a national battledrome.
</P>
<P>
   That little incident with Rams quarterback Jim Everett? Ancient
Rome history.
</P>
<P>
   His empire hasn't just spread, it's trouncing new territory each
day and he doesn't even have radio affiliates yet in major markets
like New York, Philadelphia or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So consider in the last calendar year Rome has:
</P>
<P>
   __ Cracked The Sporting News' list of the 100 most powerful
people in sport meaning, according to the magazine's criteria, he
creates change, not just influences opinions. He's slotted at No.
78, ahead of people such as . . . Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   __ Been named the California Sportscaster of the Year by the
National Sportscasters and Sports Writers Association. He'll be
honored at a banquet in North Carolina in early May.
</P>
<P>
   __ Appeared in a music video for Blink-182, when the three
members of the group ran nude through the TV studio of ``The Last
Word.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Had a character based on him (named Jerry Rose) in Oliver
Stone's movie ``Any Given Sunday.'' Although not a real flattering
representation, still . . .
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the national commercial for a fast-food chain, a
Web site (jimrome.com) with officially licensed apparel that
includes anything from a $8.95 mouse pad to a $275 leather jacket,
and his CD called ``Welcome to the Jungle'' that clones continue to
bring forth to have him autograph at personal appearances that draw
as many as 15,000
</P>
<P>
   such as the one Saturday in Sacramento, the 20th such ``tour
stop'' on Rome's radio odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when L.A. sports talk as a whole lacks any ounce of
personality, any thread of intelligent conversation or any hope of
escaping the sloppy ``guy talk'' format that program directors
think is needed to keep whatever minuscule ratings out there, Rome
has come from that and risen above the sprawling mess, continuing
to be the Tiger Woods of his genre.
</P>
<P>
   Those who try to imitate him usually can't keep up the pace or
are exposed for their lack of depth and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one Van Smack, the pimp in the box, the Huge One .
. . whatever you want to call him. And he's not slowing down for
yellow traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was all some sort of schtick, I wouldn't still be
here,'' Rome said after a recent ``Last Word'' taping at the Fox
studios in Century City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show regenerates itself every day with new subject matter
and new relationships. I stick with issues, I interview athletes, I
get good callers. . . . It's a simple process as long as I don't
screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rome says his and the show's celebrity continues to floor him. A
recent dinner he was having at Morton's in Beverly Hills brought
comedian Adam Sandler over to his table to meet him. Jay Mohr,
another comic who's had several movie and prime-time TV roles,
continues to be known more for his appearances in Rome's Jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just crazy,'' said Rome, who has also made appearances
himself on ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' and ``Politically
Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense pressure to continue quality show after show is
something Rome puts on himself. The unsung hero of his radio show
now in its fifth year of syndication is producer Travis Rodgers,
who acts as a second set of eyes and ears for Rome and lines up
most of the top-notch interview subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have great support behind the scenes because after
doing his show, it's definitely tough,'' says Newy Scruggs, the
AM-1150 afternoon host who has been Rome's vacation fill-in the
last few years. ``But in a way, I enjoy doing his show instead of
mine. You've got to bone up on everything, not just local.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the national exposure, the L.A. market in which Rome
originally made a name for himself continues to serve as the
foundation for his national show, Scruggs says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always going back to L.A. people whether Tom Tolbert or
Mike Piazza, Eric Karros to Jeff Cirillo, Don MacLean, or Derek
Martin. When you try to service so many listeners, from Miami to
Cleveland and everywhere else, you can't. He still uses L.A. to his
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rome's every waking hour is seemingly spent on his work.
</P>
<P>
   He gets up at 5:30 a.m. to get to his Sherman Oaks studio by 6.
After his 9-to-noon show runs (it was recently sliced from four
hours to three to save him on wear and tear), he has an hour to get
to the Fox TV studio. Taping ``The Last Word'' can last until 4
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive back home to the Valley, he catches up on phone
calls. After dinner with his wife and a workout, he's back in his
office at home from 7:30 p.m., up until midnight writing an online
column for FoxSports.com, the opening for his TV and radio shows
and prepping for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold myself on this mission to go as hard and as long as
I can,'' said the 35-year-old Calabasas High grad who had a pretty
nice prep career as a tennis player. ``I'm sure a lot want me to
burn out, hit the wall. I'm very disciplined. This is my time to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say how much longer I'll do this. I will say I don't
plan to be doing this when I'm 50. No one wants to hear a
50-year-old running smack on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate the audience just yet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE TOP 10 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 1. Penthouse for rent. Seeking respected, educated man/woman
who can carry normal conversation of current sports locally and
nationally but also is aware of the societal issues as well. No
loudmouths apply. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 2. Newy Scruggs, KXTA 1150 weekday afternoons: ``New Dawg''
comes the closest in this market to the above requirements and is
fast gaining respect from those in the community who see him
constantly at events, generating sources. He doesn't have TV
obligations (for now), so his total focus has been radio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 3. Where have you gone, Joe McDonnell? The city turns its
lonely ears to you. Ooo, ooo, ooo. What's that you say, Mr.
Thompson? Joltin' Joe has left for 'FWB? Hee, hee, hee . . . hee,
hee, hee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 4. Ross Porter, KXTA 1150 Dodger talk: Um-hmm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 5. Steve Hartman, XTRA 690 weekdays: The only thing on the
Baja station worth making time for provided the signal arrives in
one piece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 6. And Fred Wallin still doesn't have a presence in this city
(outside a Saturday-afternoon show for the Business News Network,
heard on Lancaster's 1520-AM)? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 7. (tie) Dave Smith and Ben Maller, KXTA 1150 weeknights: The
two are a much better fit for a late-night audience, whether it's
stuff like ``Sports Jeopardy'' and ``The Dating Game'' segments or
generally commenting about events as they happen. That includes
UCLA basketball postgame talk, after the station has apparently
scrapped the official title of the show when the school became
upset with Smith's honest criticism of the team and coach Steve
Lavin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 9. What would it take for Steve Edwards to get back together
with Eric Tracy . . . somewhere? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 10. Steve Carbone, 1150 Clippers postgame: Talk about taking
one for the station. A job no one in his right mind should want,
this is also a great experiment in social behavior
</P>
<P>
   anytime Carbone is giving out free Clippers tickets to callers
who have a take on the just-completed rout, the phones lines light
up like the Staples Center heat lamps. Amazing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Honorable mention: Peter Vent, KRLA 1110 weekend late night;
Irv Kaze, KIEV weekends (a favorite of the Southern California
Sportscaster Association fraternity); Larry Kahn, KLAC 570 Angels
talk; Chris Ello, XTRA weekends; Sean Salisbury, XTRA mornings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL CITATION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Terry Bradshaw: After the Karl Malone fiasco, hiring another
high-profile person like Bradshaw could have perpetuated the
perception (true as it is) of the station's apparent need to self
promote. Except Bradshaw's ``Lunch with Terry'' (whenever he
decided to work) charmed its way into our daily schedule because he
spent less time talking sports and more just talkin'. Yee haw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Brian Golden: His very early-morning show was chased off the
KAVL-AM (610) airwaves as an XTRA affiliate to make room for the
syndicated stench of the Bob &AMP; Tom show. Now there's genius
programming. If Golden had a regular high-profile spot, such as
when he was at KMPC, he'd make the top three easily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Derrick Hall: Showed he's always got a radio career to fall
back on if this lark-of-a-job with the Dodgers doesn't pan out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM FIVE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 1. Arnie Spanier, KXTA 1150 weekday drive-time: Give the
``Stinkin' Genius'' some credit for knowing how to manipulate the
audience. His East Coast jargon often whips the L.A. listeners into
a ball of frustration. Lately, he's targeted Lakers fans, but
here's a secret: That'll blow over when the people are tired of the
agitation and simply stop listening. One can only stomach so much
of: ``If (blah, blah, blah), than I don't know what is . . . and
I'll tell you that right now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 2. Lee Klein, KXTA 1150 weeknights: We respectfully decline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 3. Dave Denholm, KXTA weekday afternoons: You can take the
kid out of Cleveland, but you can't inject L.A. into a nasally
transplant who hasn't grasped a few simple things about this city.
Such as: Rant all you want, but we don't care about the Clippers,
except that they provide affordable prices for NBA viewing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 4. Bill Werndl, XTRA weekday afternoons: Responsible for the
installation of optional dashboard spitguards available now on most
new cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ 5. Tommy Lasorda, any station, any day: His unsolicited calls
to whomever happens to be on the air just to hear himself talk has
become a show screener's worst nightmare. You want the big-name
guest, but does it have to be him again? The epitome of Talkin'
Tommy's ego-gratifying time-not-well-spent was a recent appearance
on Klein's show to give his cent-and-a-half about the Clippers
There's talk of 1150 putting him in the noon-to-1 p.m. slot during
baseball season. May the Big Dodgers in the Sky help us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Horrible mention: John Kentera, XTRA; Rick Monday, KXTA
Dodger talk; Vic ``The Brick'' Jacobs, KXTA (no longer has a
regular show, but the news updates are enough), and . . . that guy
. . .whatever his name is . . . drive time on XTRA . . . aw, forget
it.

EXCERPTS FROM DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES' DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DEMS-DEBATE) 
(lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the debate Monday night between Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey at the
Apollo Theater in New York, as recorded by The New York Times. The
first question was asked by the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tonight we know on March 7 that there will be a primary in
New York and California. With the case of police scandal in
California, the Diallo case and Louima case in New York, and many
cases all between, many in our community have to live in fear of
both the cops and the robbers. We are asking you, what concrete
steps would you make if you were elected president to deal with
police brutality and racial profiling without increasing crime. How
would you keep crime down, but at the same time confront the
problem of police brutality and racial profiling? ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY When I think of Amadou Diallo, I think of an unarmed man
who was fired at 41 times by the police, who was killed. I think it
was an outrage. I feel it. Everybody in this room feels it. I think
it was also a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But I also think it reflects racial profiling in the sense of
racial profiling that seeps into the mind of someone so that he
sees a wallet in the hand of a white man as a wallet, but a wallet
in the hand of a black man as a gun. And we _ we have to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   I would issue an executive order that would eliminate racial
profiling at the federal level. I would try to pass a law to get
information gathered at local levels so that we can see how the
police departments are acting. I would make sure that the Justice
Department was involved and would say quite clearly that white
Americans can no longer deny the plight of black Americans. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE I don't disagree with anything that Senator Bradley just
said. But let me sharpen it a little bit for my part by saying that
if you entrust me with the presidency, the first civil rights act
of the 21st century will be a national law outlawing racial
profiling. We have to recognize that racial profiling is a problem
not only in law enforcement but also in insurance, in banking,
inside schoolrooms, inside people's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   And we have to _ we have to confront it. The Diallo case and the
Louima case and the other cases are just heartbreaking. And they
have awakened the conscience of many Americans who had not looked
at this problem squarely. I think that we have to do a lot to get
at police misconduct, to measure performance according to the
attitudes toward the community. Also I think that we have to make
certain that in this country not only will driving while black
never be allowed to be a crime but we just _ we have to say that we
are going to become one people and prevent these incidents partly
by putting as much energy into education as we do into
incarceration. ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY Last month, at the debate in Iowa, when Al said the same
thing, that he would issue an executive order, I said, why doesn't
he walk down the hall now and have President Clinton issue the
executive order. Now, Al _ Al said that I shouldn't give President
Clinton lectures. I am not giving President Clinton lectures. I am
questioning why you haven't done that or why you haven't made this
happen in the last seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   GORE First of all, President Clinton has issued a presidential
directive under which the information is now being gathered that is
necessary for an executive order. Look, we have taken action.
</P>
<P>
   But, you know, racial profiling practically began in New Jersey,
Senator Bradley. Now, the mayor _ the mayor _ the African-American
mayor of the largest city in New Jersey said that he came with a
group of African-American elected officials or _ or contacted you
to see if you would help on this, and that you did not. Did you
ever call or write or visit with respect to racial profiling when
they brought it to your attention? ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. My name is William Allen. I'm a Democratic district leader
here in Harlem where African-Americans own less than 6 percent of
the real estate. In spite of Michael Jordan, Spike Lee and Usher,
African-Americans since American slavery still remains at the
bottom of economic opportunity. Do you think that reparations
should be considered? If yes, what would you do to implement such a
policy?
</P>
<P>
   GORE I believe the best reparations is a good education and
affirmative action to make available resources, to make available
the kind of direct assistance that has brought an empowerment zone
here to Harlem that has created new opportunities. I think that we
still need affirmative action in this country. I don't think that
it's time for anybody to say, Look, we have made so much progress.
I think that's a ridiculous conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The average African-American family wealth and also the average
Latino family wealth is less than one-tenth that of the average
white family wealth. To me that justifies making available capital
for young entrepreneurs, it justifies making available
opportunities for advancement and affirmative action in every
sphere. Now, I personally have supported these measures and here,
we have created in the last seven years, 20 million new jobs in
America and the lowest African-American unemployment rate and
poverty rate in history. We need to keep on going and make sure
nobody is left behind. ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY The issue of reparations is what you really raised. And
it seems to me that what the issue raises is not just the issue of
money, but the issue of acknowledging the contributions of
African-Americans to this country's history over its entire
history. I think it is very important to do that. There are
varieties of ways to do that: you could establish a commission,
which I think has already been proposed in the Congress by Mr.
Conyers, that would look at the possibility of finding a way to
acknowledge those contributions that have been made from the days
of slavery to the days today. And also not denying anymore those
contributions. American _ white Americans are in denial of black
Americans' contributions through slavery, denial of Jim Crow and
continue to deny today the indignities that African-Americans
suffer. I believe that we can change that with a major new
investment in education, in economic development and beginning to
see things a little deeper than skin color. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE Well the question is still about reparations if I'm not
mistaken. And I do believe that what you're getting at is best
approached then answered not by an effort to try to have a cash
payment. I do not believe that that's going to get through the
United States Congress or is the way to go. In certain cases such
as in Oklahoma where they are debating the specific tragedy there,
then that may be definitely a realistic possibility. There may be
other such examples where that can be triggered. But for the nation
as a whole, we should approach it in the form of yes, recognition
of the special contributions and special suffering and special role
with massive investments in education and economic empowerment of
what we need. ...
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. The United States is currently experiencing an unprecedented
economic boom, in a large part due to technology. What specific
social, educational, legislative and economic policies will you
implement that will ensure historically marginalized communities,
such as Harlem where we are at, will gain access to technology and
resources essential to survival in this new information age?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY One of the first things I would do is I would give
10,000 scholarships a year a $7,500 a year scholarship to people
who after four years would agree to teach in an urban or _ or rural
school district in the areas of computer science, math, science or
foreign languages. We need teachers in our communities who
understand these subjects and who have the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing I would do is something I call infostamps, which
empowers those who don't have to be able to get the equipment and
the software that they need in order to be a part of the digital
revolution. We have food stamps. We need infostamps to be able to
accomplish this objective.
</P>
<P>
   And in terms of education, I think _ and you mentioned race in
education _ I think it is important to note that in 1980, '81, in
1979, there was an issue before the Congress that related to
whether the _ whether the government would provide tax-exempt
status to schools that racially discriminate. Al Gore supported
those measures and I'd like to know today why. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE Well, I made a speech last week on how to close the digital
divide. I'll deal with this briefly and then respond to Bill's
false charge. I believe that we need to get computing centers in
the community for children and for adults. And we need to finish
connecting every classroom and library to the Internet. We need to
get computers in the schools and we need to train the teachers. We
cannot allow a digital divide to exacerbate the gap between rich
and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as for this false charge, two in a row. First of all, on
government procurement, there was no change there. That's a false
charge. Secondly, look you have misrepresented that vote entirely,
Senator Bradley. That was not about affirmative action. That was
about quotas. It was 337 members of the Congress voted against
that, you voted the same way on final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me talk about a more recent vote, not 20 years ago. In
1995, you were the only Democratic senator to vote against
affirmative action to help expand the number of
African-American-owned broadcasting outlets, radio stations and TV
stations. Why did you _ why were you the only Democratic senator on
the Finance Committee to vote against that? ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY Given Al's answer, I kind of expected his answer on his
vote to preserve tax-exempt status for schools like Bob Jones that
racially discriminate. So I brought today a copy of all five of
those votes. I've also brought today my _ I've also brought today
my statement in opposition, the Congressional Black Caucus's
statement in opposition and Trent Lott's statement in support
saying that this would go to Bob Jones University. I'd like to give
it to each member of the panel and Bernie at the break, but I'd
like you to have it now Al. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE First of all, this was a vote on quotas. I take it you're
not in favor of quotas. Bob Jones University lost its tax exemption
under the law that I supported. They still do not have a tax
exemption. So that is a phony and scurrilous charge. Now, let me
ask you again: I think this country is better off for having ``The
Tom Joyner Show'' and for having April Ryan and for having WLIB.
None of those might be available except for the extra affirmation
for black-owned radio stations. Why did you vote against them? ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. This is a question from America On Line for Vice President
Gore: What will you do to re-define affirmative action's goals as
an assurance against present and future discrimination?
</P>
<P>
   GORE Well, I think that the policy of mend it, don't end it is
the right approach. In order to make certain that we keep
affirmative action, we have to reject the idea of strict numerical
quotas. And in the instance that Bill was talking about, that is
exactly what was involved: strict numerical quotas. Affirmative
action that opens up new opportunities and makes available the
resources, the spots in universities, the loans, the investment
capital, that is the direction that we should go in.
</P>
<P>
   But we should also understand the importance of communications
media; television stations, radio stations. One of the changes that
I would seek is to repeal the measure that Senator Bradley
supported _ the only Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee to
support this number one goal of the Newt Gingrich Republicans when
they came in to end affirmative action in broadcasting for
broadcasters and I would hope that Senator Bradley would change his
position and support a change in that law and add back that
affirmative action. ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY Ah, well, let me briefly respond to this. The _ I think
that we need more minority media. That's the importance of the
Madison Avenue Initiative. That is why I've met with the Madison
Avenue Initiative at the Black Caucus last fall. We talked. There
are important ways that advertising dollars should go to
African-American media. I voted against that amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know why there is not? You know why that there's now
not the affirmative action you're talking about for
African-Americans in the media? Because Bill Clinton signed the law
that made it happen. It was a law that was signed and that's why it
happened.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm still going to offer you the opportunity to explain a
little more carefully why you voted to preserve tax-exempt status
for schools _ not just Bob Jones, so all of the schools in
Mississippi, you know, where those white schools that started to be
built whenever we had integration _ to preserve tax-exempt status
for those schools. You have to face up to this if you're going to
be a strong leader.
</P>
<P>
   GORE You know, I think it's pretty clear what's going on, Bill.
You're sounding a little desperate because you're trying to build
yourself up by tearing everybody else down. Very clear. Very clear.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I still haven't gotten the answer to why you voted against
WLIB and _ and ``The Tom Joyner Show'' and all of the
African-American owned stations and outlets that are there because
we had that affirmative action. Now, that _ the amendment that you
were the only Democrat on the committee to support was made a part
of the Republican effort to shut down the government. ...
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY I think the question was about the future of affirmative
action. And I believe that we need a strong president who's not
going to back away from leading on affirmative action. I believe
affirmative action is common sense. I believe it's reaching out to
the broadest possible community in this country in order to bring
all talent into our country's best performance. That's what I
believe. And you know, I think that the things that have happened
in California, the Proposition 209, the things that happened in
Texas ... are the wrong direction. And the only way you're going to
change that is if a president is willing to lead with the bully
pulpit on this issue and not follow. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Senator if you're elected, what would you do to help combat
to AIDS epidemic in the minority communities?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY I think that it's a very important question. I would
fully fund the Ryan White Act, because I think that is of special
importance. In the health care program that I have outlined I have
allocated a very large sum of money to community health clinics and
community health centers, which is where a lot of the minority
population could get treated. I also have passed, suggested a
health care bill that would allow H.I.V.-positive people to be able
to get access to health care because now they are denied access to
health care. I think making those investments in infrastructure,
meaning the clinics in the neighborhood and the funds to reach out,
the Ryan White Act, and in making sure that they can see a doctor
before they get AIDS when they have H.I.V. is a way that I would go
and think it would be an important way to deal with this issue. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE I think we have to, I think we have to attack this problem
not only here at home, but around the world. I went before the
United Nations Security Council to ask them to redefine security,
to take on the challenge of H.I.V./AIDS in Africa and in other
parts of the world where this is such a crisis. And here at home, I
_ I have worked very hard to have Medicaid eligibility when someone
tests H.I.V. positive, and we're moving very aggressively on that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here is the problem that you would face if the country ever
had Senator Bradley's health care proposal: 50 percent of all of
the Americans who have H.I.V./AIDS now get Medicaid; 90 percent of
all the children with H.I.V./AIDS get Medicaid. His proposal would
eliminate the Medicaid program and replace it with a $150-a-month
voucher with which you cannot purchase anything like the health
care benefits that are now available under Medicaid. And a lot of
the AIDS organizations have come out and criticized it as a result.
...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY We've talked a lot about my health care proposal in this
campaign. In these terms _ it's a disability. The disability under
Medicaid, it saves the same amount of money, it's the same
services, it's the same benefits. The only difference is that now
if you have H.I.V., you can qualify for insurance. And if you are
in a neighborhood, you get a health _ you get a community health
benefit. That's the only difference.
</P>
<P>
   And tonight I pledge that any health care bill that I would sign
would have every Medicaid patient a better health plan than
Medicaid is today. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE Well, that's not a plan, that's a magic wand. And it
doesn't work that way, because the problem that _ that people with
AIDS and cancer and muscular dystrophy and other diseases have in
the private health insurance market is that the insurance companies
don't want to take them. They want to get rid of them. You give
them a $150-a-month voucher, they can't buy it.

FOX DECIDES TO END `WHO WANTS TO MARRY A MULTIMILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to delete `Nev.' after Lake Tahoe reference in 9th graf.)   
(mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fox Network decided Monday to kill the potentially lucrative
franchise called ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire,'' ending
an episode almost as bizarre as the so-called reality-based
programs for which the television network has become known, like
``The World's Most Shocking Moments Caught on Tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Entertainment
Television, came after Fox learned that Rick Rockwell, the
bridegroom in last week's widely watched special, had been the
subject of a restraining order because of charges that he had
physically threatened a girlfriend nine years ago. Fox executives
said Rockwell had failed to disclose the information during
background checks leading up to the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the network canceled a repeat of last week's show
scheduled for Tuesday night, but left open the possibility that it
would broadcast new versions of the program in the future. Flush
with the ratings success, Darnell had announced last week his
intention to mount a special with the genders reversed, and a
female millionaire selecting a husband.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the special, which had stirred a national debate
about modern relationships and the pressures on women to marry,
raises new questions about the risks in a growing trend among the
broadcast networks to rely on programs that put real people into
challenging and life-changing situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months networks have plans to put people on a
desert island swarming with cameras, to lock people together into a
house filled with cameras, and even, in the case of one syndicated
show, to marry strangers off to each other every week.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darnell, the executive vice president of Fox who invented
the marry-a-millionaire concept, said the network had decided not
to go forward with any other specials in that format because,
``It's just not worth the risk.'' He said: ``This is the end for
this show. We are not doing another one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show broadcast a week ago, Rockwell, who billed himself
as a real estate developer and motivational speaker, selected among
50 prospective brides in a beauty-pageantlike contest. He chose
Darva Conger, an emergency room nurse.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, however, information emerged that
revealed that Rockwell was a longtime comedian with a history of
engaging in stunts like telling jokes for 30 straight hours to get
into the Guinness Book of World Records. While Fox and Next
Entertainment, the company that produced the special, continued to
vouch for his financial claim of assets exceeding $2 million,
numerous questions arose about the truthfulness of some of his
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fox claimed that it had conducted a thorough check of
Rockwell, it became clear that the research was less than
exhaustive. Among Rockwell's claims called into question were that
he had not performed as a comedian in about 10 years (a comedy club
owner said he had hired him only two years ago) and that he had
opened for the ``Tonight'' show star, Jay Leno, in Lake Tahoe. A
representative for Leno said that Rockwell had never opened
anywhere for him).
</P>
<P>
   Several companies for whom Rockwell said he worked as a
motivational speaker said that they had never hired him. Nancy
Buchholz, a spokeswoman for Maritz Travel, a national travel-agency
business based in St. Louis, said that Rockwell had never performed
at a Maritz travel agency. Mary Elizabeth Gifford, a spokeswoman
for The Golden Door, a high-end California health spa, said that
Rockwell had never been a guest speaker there. Don Stanziano, the
spokesman for the Scripps Hospital system in San Diego, which
includes six hospitals, said that the company had no record of
Rockwell ever performing at any of the hospitals or corporate
retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, who returned to his San Diego home from a honeymoon
trip to the Caribbean with Conger on Sunday, told a local
television station, KFMB, in San Diego: ``As you know, this journey
began with my desire to find love on a television show. I had no
idea there would be so much interest and so much scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   About the restraining order, he said: ``Nearly ten years ago, I
was involved in a relationship that ended poorly. But I am here to
tell you tonight that at no time have I ever struck any of my
girlfriends for any reason.'' Rockwell went on to say that he
``never informed the producers of the show about this issue because
I considered it a closed chapter in my life and any contentious
feelings that existed ten years ago are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Darnell of Fox said, `'The latest information came as a shock to
me and the production company. I don't know why he didn't say
anything to us about it.`
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell had been extensively questioned about his background,
Darnell said. ``The production company did a security check and he
came up clean. It was a criminal check, a civil check and a credit
check. He was actually specifically asked if there was anything
else we should know about his past. He signed an affidavit that
everything he told us was true.''
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the special began in the fall when Darnell came up
with the idea to marry off a millionaire on a show, in an effort to
play off the mania surrounding ABC's hit game show ``Who Wants To
be A Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell has gained a reputation in television for creating some
of the most outrageous and highly rated specials of recent years,
including some with the memorable titles of ``When Animals Attack''
and `When Good Pets Go Bad,'' as well as ``Alien Autopsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The specials, which almost always generated high ratings, have
been extremely effective during the special rating periods knows as
sweep months, when advertising rates are set, helping Fox post
impressive overall ratings by replacing many of the network's least
popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the storm over ``MultiMillionaire'' came as Fox
was beginning to distance itself from the violent specials.
Grushow, who recently took over the job running Fox's entertainment
division, called them ``ratings crack,'' and said the network
needed to break its addiction to them. Grushow argued that Fox got
only a short-term benefit from the specials, that they did not
provide any ancillary profits _ like those from syndication _ and
that they occupied time periods where Fox needed to develop
comedies and dramas that could be long-term assets.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell also developed other, entertainment-oriented specials
like ``Secrets of Magic Revealed,'' which showed how many famous
magic tricks are done. That program, which outraged many magicians,
was the highest-rated special ever on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent fiasco, Darnell said he would continue to
develop specials ``that get under people's skin and are
fascinating.'' But he added that ``there will be a level of
responsibility that goes with them.'' He called the magic special
``a perfect example of the kind of show we want to keep doing.''
Specifically, he said, ``I'll be back in May with something
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Other networks are expected to continue their plans to broadcast
reality-based shows, he said, because the audience response to them
has been so strong. CBS will have two such programs this summer _
one, ``Survivor,'' will take a group of people to an island off
Borneo and put them through various tests with the ultimate winner
taking home $1 million. The other CBS show is ``Big Brother,''
which has a similar format, set in a house with cameras.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Infinity Productions has plans for a weekly
syndicated show called ``Wed at First Sight,'' a ``Dating
Game''-type program except that the couple, strangers at the start
of the show, will be married at the end.

H&AMP;R BLOCK AGREES TO STOP DISPUTED ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. has
agreed to stop what a competitor alleges is misleading advertising
about a refund loan program. Block, however, said it planned to
continue offering the loans until the matter was resolved in court.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Liberty Tax Service, a Virginia Beach, Va., tax-preparation
chain founded by longtime Block rival John Hewitt, sued last month
in federal court in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty alleged that Block misled consumers in certain test
markets when it offered what are known as refund-anticipation loans
without telling taxpayers about loan fees that would be deducted
from the refund.
</P>
<P>
   Block says that the advertising properly discloses the costs and
features of the loans to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Refund-anticipation loans are loans that Block, Liberty and
other tax preparers make available to clients who want refunds
faster than the Internal Revenue Service normally can provide them.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, once the preparer receives federal confirmation that
a claimed refund is likely to be paid, the preparer will arrange
for a loan to the taxpayer, within about 48 hours, of an amount of
money equal to the refund, minus a fee for the service. The
preparer then collects the full refund about a week later when the
IRS finishes processing the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Block this year is testing a plan in California and parts of
Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Iowa and Ohio in which the
company incorporates the refund-anticipation loan fees into what
customers pay for preparation and filing. The company then arranges
a loan equal to the full refund.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Virginia markets where the new plan is being tested
include cities served by Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who once worked for Block, previously founded and headed
Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, the nation's second-largest tax
preparation network after Block. Jackson Hewitt is now a subsidiary
of Cendant Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Norfolk
alleging that Block was unfairly advertising in the test markets
that taxpayers were getting full refunds without disclosing the
true nature of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Block disputes those allegations but signed a consent agreement
Friday in that court to end the disputed advertising ``until a
trial can be held on the merits of the claims,'' said Neil Getzlow,
a company spokesman in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Block intends to continue offering the refund loans and
collecting the fees up front because the consent agreement does not
bar those activities, Getzlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt disputed Block's contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the judge is going to be mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side could estimate when the dispute might come to
trial.

ROBERT LAMB JR., 74, LIAISON AT JUSTICE DEPT. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Lamb Jr., the Justice Department's top community liaison
for the Pacific Northwest, died on Feb. 9 at a hospital in Seattle.
He was 74 and lived in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb had been in poor health for some time, said the Community
Relations Service at the department.
</P>
<P>
   He had been the Northwest regional director since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He was a police captain in Atlantic City, N.J., before he went
to work for the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department
agency established under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb, who was black, gained recognition in the United States and
Europe for his work to improve relations between the police and
African-Americans. In 1966 he became the first commanding officer
of the Atlantic City Police-Community Relation's Unit.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled across the country to advise other police
departments, and in doing so became an expert on minority police
officers and their sometimes troubled relations with their white
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb was a consultant on police-community relations to the
Metropolitan Police in London, the Community Psychiatry Program at
Harvard, and the World Council of Churches' Institute on Penology
in Geneva. In Sweden, he advised Gunnar Myrdal, the sociologist and
economist, on conflict management and race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb was born in Norfolk, Va., and reared in Atlantic City. He
learned about African-American history from books in his family's
home, and later amassed a collection of books and papers on the
black experience in America.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II he served with the Third Army in Europe under
Gen. George S. Patton, and received four combat decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb is survived by his wife, Mildred; three daughters, a son
and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement
Officials established a Robert Lamb Jr. Humanitarian Award,
honoring efforts to restrain the use of deadly force in the line of
duty. It did so in recognition of Lamb's 30 years of work in that

ISAAC RUBIN, 86, APPEALS COURT JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Justice Isaac Rubin, a former New York state appeals
court judge from Westchester County, died Saturday in a hospice in
the Bronx. He was 86 and lived in Rye.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the bench in 1990 after 20 years, Rubin
continued to work in the court system as a judicial hearing officer
for the state Supreme Court and its Appellate Division in
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   Until mid-January, when pancreatic cancer incapacitated him,
Rubin drove to work in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   When Rubin stepped down as an appeals judge at age 77, it was
only after having unsuccessfully challenged a provision of the New
York State Constitution that requires state judges to retire at 76.
At the time, he said, ``A judge should be judged based on his own
physical condition and his competence, not solely on his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin began his judicial career in 1970 as a City Court judge in
Rye. He was appointed to the County Court of Westchester in 1973
and was elected to a full term as a County Court judge in 1974 and
then to the New York State Supreme Court in Westchester in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 to 1981, he acted as the supervising judge for the
criminal division of the 9th District, which includes Westchester,
Dutchess, Orange, Rockland and Putnam counties. He developed
procedures that helped reduce court backlogs in the five counties.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to the Appellate Division in 1982 by Gov. Hugh
Carey and reappointed by Mario Cuomo in 1984. He was president of
the Westchester County Bar Association from 1971 to 1973. Rubin was
also a member of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Mount Vernon, he served in the Army Air Corps
in World War II. Before becoming a judge, he was a partner in his
own law firm in Mount Vernon for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from New York University, where he also earned his
law degree. He also had a doctorate in law from St. John's
University Law School. Rubin is survived by his wife, Lucille; his
son, Charlie, of New York City; his daughter, Carol Rubin Kahn of
Chappaqua; and one granddaughter.

JEANNE SIMON, 77, LAWMAKER AND LITERACY ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Md.)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne Simon, the wife of former Sen. Paul Simon, who forged her
own public career as a prosecutor, lawmaker and lobbyist for
literacy and libraries, died on Sunday at their home in Makanda,
Ill. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Simon had undergone surgery for the removal of a malignant brain
tumor in September. At the time, her surgeons said the operation
had succeeded, but they left open the long-term prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, an Illinois Democrat, left the Senate in 1997,
Simon joined him on the faculty of Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale as an adjunct professor of library affairs. She helped
him found and shape the agenda of the Public Policy Institute at
the university.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Simon was named chairwoman of the U.S. National
Commission on Libraries and Information Science, a post to which
President Clinton reappointed her in 1997. In that position she
promoted literacy programs and financing for libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago, Jeanne Hurley graduated from Barat College in
Lake Forest, Ill., and from Northwestern University Law School. She
served as an assistant state's attorney for Cook County and was one
of a few women in the Illinois Legislature when she met her
husband, then a fellow lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1960 and teamed for several of his
political campaigns, including the senator's 1988 stab at the
Democratic presidential nomination. She chronicled her experiences
on the stump in a well-received memoir, ``Codename Scarlett _ Life
on the Campaign Trail by the Wife of a Presidential Candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband, Simon is survived by a daughter, Sheila
Simon of Carbondale; a son, Martin, of Crofton, Md., and four
grandchildren.

ITALY TRAILS, 2-0, AFTER A DISASTROUS DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ On a day when blood and hope were lost
aboard the Italian yacht Luna Rossa, Team New Zealand's NZL 60
sailed to its second straight commanding victory on Tuesday and
took a 2-0 lead over the Prada Challenge in defense of the
America's Cup. The margin was two minutes 43 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After a lay day on Wednesday, Race 3 of the five-of-nine-race
series is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the Italians, the day started badly and then deteriorated
into utter, unchecked, complete disaster. At the five-minute gun
before the start, Luna Rossa approached from starboard, the
advantaged end, an edge it had used with stunning effectiveness in
Race 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Zealand helmsman Russell Coutts, coming in to the
starting area from port, almost immediately took matters into his
own hands. With remarkable maneuverability accentuated by crisp,
perfect crew work that made NZL 60 look like an Olympic sprinter in
full glide and Prada like a weekend jogger trudging through sand
dunes, Coutts cut behind Prada, gained an overlap, and took full
control of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian tactician Torben Grael had but one option: bail for
the spectator fleet in a frantic attempt to evade the Kiwi's
shadow. Coutts, on his tail, was ready for his dash, answering each
of Prada's evasive moves tit for tat.
</P>
<P>
   NZL 60 led back across the starting line, which they crossed at
full speed with Luna Rossa 18 seconds in arrears. Like a wide
receiver trying to shake a cornerback off the line of scrimmage,
Prada threw two quick tacks at the Kiwis, but they kept the clamps
on and would not be shaken.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief glimmer of hope for the Italians as they
tacked away to port and finally gasped a breath of clear air
unhindered by the exhaust off the trailing edge of the Kiwis'
sails. The day's first shift in the oscillating, 12-to 15-knot
breeze was a lefty, and for a brief moment Luna Rossa closed to
within a boat length of the New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're faster,'' said one Prada crewman, and for a moment it
appeared he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly blood was flowing aboard Luna Rossa and the race,
for all intents and purposes, was over.
</P>
<P>
   The call came from Prada that a plastic bag or tarp was caught
on its keel wings, sapping speed as well as the boat's ability to
point at an optimal angle high into the wind. A long carbon-fiber
pole was sent topsides to execute the task, but somehow the stick
caught bowman Max Sirena along the side of his head, opening a wide
gash.
</P>
<P>
   With a towel pressed to his skull in an attempt to contain the
wound, Sirena hung limply over the side as a deep red stain spread
over the aft quarter of Prada's silver hull. A launch went
alongside and Sirena was whisked aboard, where a doctor closed the
cut with stitches.
</P>
<P>
   But the Italians' problems were far from over, for the offending
plastic was still dangling from the underbody. The Italians spilled
wind from their sails, slowed down, and lowered a crewman over the
side on a halyard to swipe at the material with the pole, but to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   Luna Rossa had no choice but to stop almost completely and lower
another sailor, mainsail trimmer Piero Romeo. Adding insult to
injury, NZL 60 was flying away at around 10 knots on the wings of a
new right-hand shift. Romeo could not dive down and free the mess,
but putting on the brakes allowed the plastic to finally drift
away.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians' chances to tie the series had already drifted
away, for the Kiwis rounded the top mark two minutes 19 seconds
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians made some gains at the next two marks, but on leg
4, when they found themselves unable to tack for about 10 minutes
because of a broken sail track, the New Zealanders put it away. It
was the punctuation mark on a horror story.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can go wrong?'' said the Prada helmsman, Francesco
de Angelis, as the Kiwis pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight race, the score had been settled in the
first 20 minutes. But as in Race 1, the Kiwis won not because of a
decided edge in boat speed, but by error-free, efficient sailing
and faultless tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians have a day to heal and regroup. After another
brilliant piece of sailing by their hometown opponents on the
Hauraki Gulf, whether it will be time enough to make any difference
is suddenly very much in doubt.

H&AMP;R BLOCK AGREES TO STOP DISPUTED ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. has
agreed to stop what a competitor alleges is misleading advertising
about a refund loan program. Block, however, said it planned to
continue offering the loans until the matter was resolved in court.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Liberty Tax Service, a Virginia Beach, Va., tax-preparation
chain founded by longtime Block rival John Hewitt, sued last month
in federal court in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty alleged that Block misled consumers in certain test
markets when it offered what are known as refund-anticipation loans
without telling taxpayers about loan fees that would be deducted
from the refund.
</P>
<P>
   Block says that the advertising properly discloses the costs and
features of the loans to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Refund-anticipation loans are loans that Block, Liberty and
other tax preparers make available to clients who want refunds
faster than the Internal Revenue Service normally can provide them.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, once the preparer receives federal confirmation that
a claimed refund is likely to be paid, the preparer will arrange
for a loan to the taxpayer, within about 48 hours, of an amount of
money equal to the refund, minus a fee for the service. The
preparer then collects the full refund about a week later when the
IRS finishes processing the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Block this year is testing a plan in California and parts of
Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Iowa and Ohio in which the
company incorporates the refund-anticipation loan fees into what
customers pay for preparation and filing. The company then arranges
a loan equal to the full refund.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Virginia markets where the new plan is being tested
include cities served by Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who once worked for Block, previously founded and headed
Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, the nation's second-largest tax
preparation network after Block. Jackson Hewitt is now a subsidiary
of Cendant Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Norfolk
alleging that Block was unfairly advertising in the test markets
that taxpayers were getting full refunds without disclosing the
true nature of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Block disputes those allegations but signed a consent agreement
Friday in that court to end the disputed advertising ``until a
trial can be held on the merits of the claims,'' said Neil Getzlow,
a company spokesman in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Block intends to continue offering the refund loans and
collecting the fees up front because the consent agreement does not
bar those activities, Getzlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt disputed Block's contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the judge is going to be mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side could estimate when the dispute might come to
trial.

RAUCOUS CROWD PUTS STAMP ON DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DEMS-DEBATE) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even before Monday night's Democratic debate began,
one got the feeling it would be different from the others. As the
moderator, CNN's Bernard Shaw, was laying out the ground rules forthe audience, a man who could not hear boomed out from the upper
tier, ``What about that mike, spike?''
</P>
<P>
   For the next five minutes Shaw fumbled about with his
microphone, and the feisty, vociferous, oh-so-New York role of the
audience had been firmly established for the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   As former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore jousted
from behind their lecterns, the packed house at the Apollo Theater
in Harlem hooted, howled and shouted their opinions with abandon,
prompting Shaw to ask for calm at one point and forcing a
several-minute delay at another.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is the historic home of Wednesday night amateur
talent nights that have launched the careers of more than a few
black stars, where the mettle of novice performers is tested by
raucous crowds quick with their hooks, stingy with their ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds here let you know how they feel immediately,'' said
Haja Worley, 53, a Wednesday night regular who attended Monday
night's debate. ``There was some of that going on tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous crowd in their red-velvet seats seemed perfectly
attuned to the combative mood of the candidates, who slugged it out
in their testiest meeting in five debates.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore challenged Bradley's commitment to ending racial
profiling by saying, ``Racial profiling practically began in New
Jersey'' _ a reference to Bradley's home state _ the crowd erupted
in both catcalls and cheers, making it impossible to hear Gore from
the upper tiers for a full minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to New York,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press
secretary. ``This sure isn't Iowa or New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   They were no less generous with the noise with Bradley. When the
insurgent tried to hand Gore a packet of letters purporting to
document his opposition to legislation barring tax-exempt status to
Bob Jones University and other private colleges known for
discriminatory practices, the jeers and cheers were deafening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please restrain your outbursts so we can proceed,'' Shaw
implored the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wearing a Million Man March sweatshirt played
cheerleader to the upper-deck crowd, pounding her fist into an open
palm when Gore got in a zinger, miming a foul shot when Bradley
blasted back.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was even brought to a standstill when a man in the
audience began shouting at the candidates, who stood watching him
mutely. As his tirade continued, aggravated audience members began
chanting, ``Respect Harlem! Respect Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, particularly Gore, seemed to sense the rowdiness
of the crowd, playing to it at times. Almost every time Bradley
ripped off an attack on Gore, the vice president would mug for the
crowd, theatrically mouthing ``Not true!'' at points, shaking his
head in mock dismay at others.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also played to the crowd with his entrance, shaking the
hands of each of the three journalists on the panel and then
crossing to center stage to shake Shaw's and Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   (It was emblematic of the two candidates' contrasting styles
that Bradley had simply walked onto the stage and gone straight to
his lectern. After Gore upstaged him, however, Bradley made a point
of showing the three panelists that he would like to come over and
shake their hands, but was tethered to his microphone.)
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the raucous mood of the debate hall seemed to move
across the street to the press room, where surrogates for the two
candidates were allowed to shout their analyses through a
microphone at the crowd of reporters who were struggling to file
stories on deadline. (In most previous debates, the surrogates have
either been kept out of the press room or required to offer their
opinions in private.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley fired the African Americans who were part of his
Senate staff, and I'll name them for you,'' screamed Mayor Sharpe
James of Newark, N.J., a one-time supporter turned bitter critic of
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had the potential to be even more freewheeling than
it was, as audience members were allowed to ask questions, just
like in the town meetings both candidates hold. And as the debate
got under way, the lines of people wanting to speak were 15 deep
before each of four microphones in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   But some impromptu screening by the CNN producers managed to
keep the questions respectful and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   And that left more than a few people unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disappointed they didn't let me ask my
question,'' said Barry Crumbley, who wanted to ask the candidates
about black farmers. ``That's not how it's supposed to be at the
Apollo.''

DESPITE HIS DENIALS, FIZER IS CYCLONES' KEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iowa State junior forward Marcus Fizer insists that he would not
be a leading candidate for Big 12 Player of the Year if not for a
supporting cast of multi-talented guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be the player I am today if not for Michael Nurse,
Jamaal Tinsley, Kantrail Horton and all the guys,'' Fizer insists.
``One player can't win it all. The ball begins in their hands. They
give it to me. They deserve all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer might pass on credit for the Cyclones' surprising run at
the Big 12 championship, but few would argue that the power forward
is the prime reason for Iowa State's success. The Cyclones (22-4,
10-2) go into tonight's battle in Ames, Iowa, with Texas (19-6,
10-2) knotted with the Longhorns and Oklahoma State atop the
conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about any of their kids you want, and there have
been some great additions,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said.
``But it all started with Marcus Fizer and his mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents point to a marked improvement in Fizer's game from his
sophomore season. A more mature Fizer has displayed newfound
leadership and the dogged determination to become a dominant
player. But Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy points to the bottom
line as the area where Fizer has had the most visible effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``His impact on winning is his biggest improvement,'' Eustachy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer led the Big 12 in scoring (18.0 points per game) a season
ago and was eighth in rebounding (7.6). But he was mildly surprised
last summer when he was not one of the 12 players selected for the
USA Basketball team that won the gold medal at the World University
Games in Spain. He made the top 16, but did not survive the final
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way it was a shock,'' Fizer said. ``But among the final
16 players, everyone had been to postseason \Rplay\S except me.
Some had been to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had worked hard to get to that point and considered
it a great blessing that I had gotten that far. But I became more
mentally focused after not making the team. Actually, that
experience gave me a lot of extra confidence and made me want to
work harder to get my school recognized, gave me more drive to work
as hard as I could to be the best I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer again leads the conference in scoring (21.2) and ranks
seventh in rebounding (7.8), but teammates say he's much more
valuable than the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about what Marcus does for this team
because he does a little bit of everything,'' Iowa State senior
forward Stevie Johnson said. ``He's matured so much in every phase
of his game. He's gotten so much better, bigger and stronger. It's
so evident, everyone can see it. Not only his teammates, but people
watching in on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also evident to opponents watching game tapes. Texas
forward Gabe Muoneke, who along with Chris Owens and sometimes
Chris Mihm will be asked to take turns guarding Fizer tonight, said
no one has improved more in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as physical as he's ever been, but he's much more mobile
than he ever was,'' Muoneke said. ``He does things all over the
court that make everyone else on his team better. But this year,
he's got more help, which allows him to be a better player, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in Fizer has been most evident to Eustachy, who built
this year's team around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus is a different guy, more mature,'' Eustachy said. ``He
lets the game come to him. He dictates the game. It dictated him
last year. If things went well early, fine. If it didn't, it
affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also changed his body this summer. Fat turned to muscle. He
now benches close to 400 pounds, and there's more pop to him
because he lost some weight. He's playing above the rim a lot more.
And he's taking fewer shots, yet scoring more because he's taking
better shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the Big 12 race, Fizer said this season
has erased the memories of the past two, when the Cyclones were a
combined 17-33 and 11-21 in conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the best year of my life in basketball,'' Fizer
said. ``It's almost nullified those first two seasons. I wouldn't
trade this season or this group of guys for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer shies away from personal adulation, but accepts his role
as the team's leading player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Superman,'' he said. ``I have flaws just like anyone
else. I just try to be a leader and do the right things. I want to
help carry this team as far as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, that's been right to the top of the Big 12.

 RANGERS HAVE PLAN FOR MATEO (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Ruben Mateo's spring-training agenda has
been set. The Rangers want their center-field prodigy to:
</P>
<P>
   Learn to go back on fly balls without smashing into the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Stop trying to hit home runs every time up.
</P>
<P>
   Stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Back up his cocky attitude by focusing on playing the game right
and playing it well.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates emphasized that last point during a chat he
had with Mateo and newly acquired right-fielder Gabe Kapler at the
start of spring training Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their future is so bright, I told them I don't want them to
let it pass them by,'' Oates said yesterday. ``The window can close
so fast. No. 1, they should enjoy it, and No. 2, they should take
advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the right fielder \RKapler\S. He's going
to be fine. I wanted to make sure the center fielder walks the
talk. He talks about his girlfriend being The Ballpark in
Arlington. I just want to make sure he doesn't lose his focus
because this opportunity doesn't come along often.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo is the latest in the Rangers' trinity of Latin American
outfielders expected to be All-Stars, following the path of Ruben
Sierra and Juan Gonzalez. But those two have moved on. Now, Mateo's
time has come.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is he the minor-league prospect everybody raves about.
He is the Rangers' starting center fielder, and they want to make
sure he's ready for the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good,'' left fielder Rusty Greer said. ``But he's got to
prove himself and prove he can play. Everybody knows he has the
talent, but he's got to use that talent on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo is not shy. He good-naturedly taunted hitting coach Rudy
Jaramillo, who was pitching to him in batting practice, during the
first workout Sunday. Mateo dared Jaramillo to pitch him inside.
When he did, Mateo hit the ball over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their own style,'' Jaramillo said. ``Some
players show more confidence verbally and physically than others.
But if you're going to be cocky, you've got to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mateo, ``I just want to do the best I can for this team.
The main thing is I want to stay healthy and play in as many games
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers want to see that as well. Mateo has a combined .325
batting average over his past three minor-league seasons, but he
has also missed nearly four months of playing time in that span
because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo was called up to the Rangers on June 12 last year but
missed two weeks with a strained groin muscle. He then had his
season come to an end Aug. 4 when he got hit in the left hand with
a pitch and broke his hamate bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard on me,'' Mateo said. ``The team was going to the
playoffs, and I missed that. I don't like to sit out any games,
especially the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were hoping Mateo would make up for lost time with a
strong winter-ball season in his native Dominican Republic. But
more problems came up. Mateo missed much of the regular winter
season with a stomach virus that caused him to lose 15 pounds. He
tried returning for the playoffs but was 7-for-46 (.152) before
being sidelined with a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin wasn't happy about what he was
hearing about Mateo and made it a point to meet with him during his
annual trip to the Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Were you really hurt or did you not want to play
winter ball?' '' Melvin said. ``I asked him, `Are you prepared for
the opportunity to play in the big leagues, or do I need to go out
and get another center fielder?' I told him about \Rbackup
outfielders\S Chad Curtis and Jason McDonald. I let him know it's
not automatic, there are no shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded with a smile and that inner confidence,'' Melvin
said. ``You do that with some players, and I see them scared. You
do it with him, it's a laugh. He said, `You don't have to worry
about center field.' ''

 GEORGIA TECH'S JOE HAMILTON BIG
ENOUGH FOR O'BRIEN AWARD (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
By WHIT CANNING c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Reflecting on the four years her son Joe
spent as the quarterback at Georgia Tech, Ginger Hamilton decided
it was almost as if he had fulfilled a destiny laid out long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing that runs through my mind now,'' she said, as
her son prepared to accept the 1999 Davey O'Brien National
Quarterback Award at the Fort Worth Club, ``is the way Joe has been
true to the principles his father (Joseph) spent all those years
instilling in him: that size doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what size you are, you can excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting an Atlantic Coast Conference career total offense record
(10,640 yards), Hamilton certainly excelled. And as the 23rd winner
of the annual award presented by the Davey O'Brien Foundation, the
5-foot-10 ``Little Joe'' was certainly one of the most fitting. It
was almost as if he played out a script written by the 5-7 ``Little
Davey'' long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my life listening to people tell me I'm too small
to do this,'' said Hamilton, accompanied by his parents, and his
sister, Megan. ``I've spent most of that time trying to prove them
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey O'Brien? I know he was a great quarterback who led the
nation in passing and led his team to a national championship, and
I am very proud to win the award named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew how to play the game. He was a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Hamilton, who led the Yellow Jackets to three consecutive
bowl games and set ACC career marks for touchdown passes and
passing efficiency. As a senior, he finished second in the nation
in total offense (344.9) and pass efficiency (175.0), throwing for
3,060 yards and 29 touchdowns and rushing for 734. Georgia Tech led
the nation in total offense (509.0) and was second in scoring
(40.7).
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton also became legendary for fourth-quarter comebacks,
pulling out seven victories in that fashion over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we worked on,'' Georgia Tech offensive
coordinator Ralph Friedgen said, ``but mainly it was Joe. He just
had that spirit. He never believes he's beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his dream of being a pro quarterback, Hamilton said,
``I just want to fit in somewhere. I hope someone will give me a
chance to prove myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Hamilton managed to get his hometown of
Alvin placed on the South Carolina state map for the first time in
memory. There is now a sign proclaiming it the ``Home of Joe
Hamilton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm glad about that,'' he said, laughing. ``I guess
there's about 800 people there, and I need to go back and see how
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton _ who was joined by runner-up Drew Brees of Purdue and
several past winners including Jim McMahon, Gino Torretta, Peyton
Manning, Danny Wuerffel, Michael Bishop and Don McPherson _
received a Rolex watch and became an honorary Fort Worth citizen.
Georgia Tech received a check for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Henkes of L.D. Bell was the high school scholarship
winner, receiving a four-year, $20,000 scholarship.

RESIGNATIONS AT SOTHEBY'S SHAKE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As it deals with a federal anti-trust investigation,
Sotheby's, the leading worldwide auction house, announced Monday
the resignations of its major shareholder, A. Alfred Taubman, as
chairman and Diana D. Brooks, arguably the most powerful woman in
the art world, as president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sovern, the former president of Columbia University,
will replace Taubman as the company's chairman, and William
Ruprecht, managing director of Sotheby's North and South America
since 1994, will take over Brooks' job. The resignations, which
came after a board meeting conducted by telephone Monday afternoon,
rocked an art world already shaken by the criminal investigation.
They left open questions about the future direction of the company,
including the possible sale of Taubman's interests, and the
high-end auction business in general.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks the art world and Wall Street have been waiting for
Sotheby's to respond to allegations that it conspired with
archrival Christie's to fix the commissions the auction houses
charge buyers and sellers. The criminal anti-trust investigation
into the matter, which began in 1997, heated up three weeks ago
when Christie's announced that it was cooperating with federal
investigators regarding ``possible conduct'' relevant to the
investigation. A month before, Christopher M. Davidge, its chief
executive officer, abruptly resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Any illegal collusion could involve tens, if not hundreds, of
millions of dollars. Sotheby's and Christie's control about 95
percent of the $4 billion worldwide auction business. Christie's,
which was bought by the French investor Francois Pinault in 1998,
is now held privately. Sotheby's, which trades on the New York
Stock Exchange, is in a far more vulnerable position. Not only does
it not have conditional promises of leniency, which Christie's won
by coming to prosecutors first with information, but it also has
shareholders to answer to.
</P>
<P>
   Its share price has plunged from a high of 47 last spring to 17
3/4 on Friday. In Monday's announcement, Sotheby's said it had
``recently met with the Department of Justice in order to discuss a
prompt and appropriate resolution of this investigation.'' Neither
it nor Christie's has denied wrongdoing in their public statements.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the investigation are two increases in
commission fee structures. In 1992, Sotheby's announced that it was
increasing the commissions buyers pay from a flat fee of 10 percent
to 15 percent on the first $50,000 of a purchase price, with a 10
percent fee on the rest. Seven weeks later Christie's followed
suit. Neither house altered its structure for buyers after that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Christie's came first, changing fees it charges sellers
from a flat commission of 10 percent to a more complex,
nonnegotiable sliding scale ranging from 2 to 20 percent, depending
on the size of the sale. Weeks later Sotheby's did the same. Before
the auction houses changed the commission for sellers they ran the
risk of cutting into their profits by agreeing to cut or eliminate
fees to get business from many of the world's most important
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In a staff e-mail sent Monday afternoon, Ruprecht said ``these
decisions have been very difficult ones for Alfred and Dede and
they have made them in the best interests of Sotheby's.''
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, 75, the Detroit shopping-center magnate credited with
transforming plain suburban shopping centers, known as strip malls,
into playgrounds for the rich with designer shops like Yves St.
Laurent, Ralph Lauren and Louis Vuitton, bought Sotheby's in 1983.
Taubman owns 22.5 percent of the outstanding shares of the company
and has 63 percent of the company's voting power on the board. He
used his flair for retailing to turn Sotheby's from a sleepy
auction house into a one-stop shopping center offering customers
everything from financing and insurance to storage and art
education.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he hired Ms. Brooks, an outgoing woman with a mind for
numbers, who started in the finance department and worked her way
up to president of Sotheby's in America in 1987 and its worldwide
chief executive seven years later. Brooks became president of
Sotheby's in America in 1987 and its chief executive worldwide
seven years later. Last year, Brooks, 49, decided to invest $40
million in Internet business, joining forces with Amazon.Com and
starting Sotheby's own Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Sovern, 69, has coupled his lifelong involvement with Columbia
with several high-profile assignments that have called on his
expertise as a lawyer. He was chairman of the New York State-New
York City Commission on Integrity in Government, which became known
as the Sovern Commission, after municipal scandals shook the city
in 1986. He also served as head of the New York City Charter
Commission and as a trustee of the fund established to raise money
to help pay President Clinton's anticipated legal bills in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment is evidence of the desire of Sotheby's board to
bring in a respected figure who can help the company preserve its
image and deal with whatever integrity problems arise from the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It may also signal the fact that the auction house is
positioning itself for a sale. Financial analysts involved in the
art world said that Taubman had been studying whether to sell his
shares even before the current turn in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Taubman nor Brooks could be reached for comment. Dealers
and art buyers were reluctant to respond publicly to the news of
the resignations. ``No one's rejoicing,'' said an art lawyer who
would speak only on condition of anonymity. ``We're waiting for the
other shoe to drop. At this point we don't know how seriously these
disclosures will affect confidence in the art market.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene V. Thaw, a prominent retired dealer, said, ``It's not
going to change much except that a very aggressive firm has fallen
on difficult times. People will still buy great works of art. Maybe
the dealers will feel these staunch competitors are not riding so
high anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, investigations have also been launched by the European
Union and the Australian Competition Commission.

 MAVS' MISTAKES LET WIN SLIP AWAY (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By DWAIN PRICE c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The pain was etched all over the faces of the
Mavericks after last night's gut-wrenching 94-93 loss to the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were seconds away from claiming a major victory
against the best team in the Eastern Conference _ and at Conseco
Fieldhouse, where the Pacers had strung a franchise-record 19
consecutive victories together.
</P>
<P>
   From the pedigree of these two squads, this would have been akin
to David slaying Goliath. But the Mavericks bungled too many plays
in the last 30 seconds that erased a four-point lead and led to
their demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one hurt,'' guard Erick Strickland said in the somber and
quiet locker room. ``It just hurts. We gave that one away.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss gave the Mavericks (22-30) a split on a two-game road
trip against Eastern teams. The Mavs' next game is Thursday, at
home against the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some questionable decisions and questionable officiating
calls down the stretch the Mavericks were still in position to win
the game. However, All-Star guard Michael Finley's 17-footer
chipped the front of the iron and bounced harmlessly away as time
expired.
</P>
<P>
   For Finley, who had about two dozen family members and friends
from Chicago in the stands, the ending was dramatically different
from when the Mavericks last played in Indianapolis. Two years ago
in this city, Finley drained a 3-pointer at the buzzer as the
Mavericks upset the Pacers, 85-82.
</P>
<P>
   But with Reggie Miller hounding him, Finley had no such good
fortune this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted was a make,'' said Finley, who finished with 22
points. ``That's the way Coach drew it up, but I didn't come
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Don Nelson admitted he didn't come through for
his team when he inexplicably decided to let second-year forward
Dirk Nowitzki throw the ball inbounds with 21.9 seconds left and
the Mavericks up, 93-92. Instead of using a timeout as he neared a
five-second violation, Nowitzki forced a lob pass near the
Mavericks' bench that went out of bounds off Finley's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was totally my fault; I had a young player taking the
ball out,'' Nelson said. ``I did it because he's 7-feet tall, and I
thought he could see over the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line is you need a veteran inbounding the ball
in that situation, and I made a cardinal error as a coach by
putting a young player in that spot, and it won't happen again. It
cost us the game, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   After Nowitzki's turnover, Miller drove past Steve Nash and into
the teeth of the Mavericks' defense. It appeared rookie Greg
Buckner had tied Miller up in a jump-ball situation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Buckner was whistled for a foul, and Miller proceeded
to bury two free throws with 14.4 seconds left to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Buckner said he's used to not getting that call in that
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a rookie, so I've been getting calls like that against me
since I've been here,'' Buckner said. ``You've just got to find a
way to fight through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't dwell on it. We still had 15 seconds to play. They
outsmarted us at the end, but that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks led for most of the game, including 93-89 after
Nowitzki (23 points) drilled a 3-point field goal with 30.3 seconds
left. But before the Mavericks could finish celebrating what looked
like a sure victory, Pacers guard Travis Best zipped downcourt and
knocked down a 3-pointer of his own in less than seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman grabbed a Mavericks season-high 18 rebounds and
was his usual colorful self, as he exchanged pleasantries with the
fans throughout the game. In addition, Rodman landed in the lap of
two photographers in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who won the rebound battle, 44-38, are now 6 1/2
games behind Minnesota in the battle for the final Western
Conference playoff spot. If they miss it by one game, they could
look to last night's game as the one that did them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a heck of a game,'' Nelson said. ``Too bad we didn't
get the win.''
