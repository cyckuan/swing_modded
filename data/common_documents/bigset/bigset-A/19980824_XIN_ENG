CHONGQING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A major flood peak of the
Yangtze River's upper reaches passed the Cuntan Measuring Point at
Chongqing Municipality in southwest China on Sunday at 16 pm.
</P>
<P>
The water level reached 183.21 meters and had a flow rate of
58,000 cubic meters, 1.1 meters higher and 3,100 cubic meters more
than the figures of the previous flood crest.
</P>
<P>
The new flood peak in the upper reaches of the Yangtze could
bring more difficulties to flood-fighting in downstream areas,
according to local officials.

<HEADLINE> China's Flooded Cities Dealing With Profiteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials have had to take
actions to protect markets in flood-stricken parts of China and
deal with people who have attempted to profit from price hikes or
other illegal actions.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang
Province, which is still dealing with a serious flood problem, the
manager of a local company, Liu Xiaoqiang, has been detained by
the police for making and selling lifebuoys that failed to meet
industrial standards for size, material, and strength.
</P>
<P>
Officials seized 115 of the buoys and 500 that were partly
finished, but 1,080 of the inferior products had already been sold
for 45 yuan each. It cost Liu only 8 yuan each to make them.
</P>
<P>
In another case, the city's price control department
investigated a local sausage company that was reported to have
raised its prices twice since August 11 and seized 117,000 yuan it
made from the price hikes, and has ordered the company to pay a
penalty that is twice the amount of its illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
The price control department issued announcements on August 13
and August 18 about the stablization of prices of food, including
the company's sausage.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, governments of the cities of Qiqihar
and Daqing in Heilongjiang put 200 tons of rice on the market at a
low price to put a halt to price hikes of some local vendors.
</P>
<P>
On August 12, the price of rice jumped from 2.8 yuan per
kilogram to 3.6 yuan because of rumors of a grain shortage in
local markets. The price returned to normal after the government
intervened.
</P>
<P>
The price of vegetables and meat, which had gone up along with
the rice, also came down gradually.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Chernomyrdin Interim Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
abruptly dismissed the entire Russian government on Sunday as
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his cabinet was unable to
solve the economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the Kremlin, Yeltsin said he had
signed a decree sacking the government and naming former prime
minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, 60, as interim prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree said "the government of the Russian
Federation has resigned."
</P>
<P>
The decree, which took immediate effect, said that "the interim
head of the government will be Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin."
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Yeltsin has sacked his entire government
this year. He dismissed Chernomyrdin, 60, and his cabinet on March
23.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin served as prime minister for more than five years
until March. He won a reputation as a solid but unspectacular
reformer, and announced plans to run in the next presidential
election shortly after he was dismissed in March.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency said Chernomyrdin was holding
consultations on creating a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
After the Kremlin announced the cabinet dismissal, State Duma
Speaker Gennady Seleznyov immediately welcomed Chernomyrdin's
appointment.

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Could Tour DPRK Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean can pay 1,000 U.S.
dollars for a five-day tour of Mountain Kumgang in the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), announced Hyundai Chairman Chung
Mong-hun here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Hyundai Group and the DPRK
Asia-Pacific Peace Committee on developing tourist resources of
Mountain Kumgang, Hyundai is scheduled to start its maiden voyage
to Mountain Kumgang next month, which is expected to take 1,000
South Koreans to the mountain resort.
</P>
<P>
"Hyundai will begin signing up with tourists to Mountain
Kumgang this weekend or early September," said Chung, at an
airport in Seoul after returning from a visit to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
South Korean tourists in the DPRK can speak to their relatives
in South Korea by phone via satellite lines, trunked radio system
or walkie-talkies.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai is to operate the cruise ships while the DPRK will be
responsible for issuing visas, charging fees of the tourist sites
and the running of tourist facilities according to the agreement,
said Chung.
</P>
<P>
The runing of souvenir shops, restaurants and buses in the
touring area will be operated by a joint venture enterprise to be
set up by Hyundai and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Chung said, South Korean tourists are to
board the ship at a port in Kangwon Province at 6 in the afternoon
and arrive at Jangjon Port near Mountain Kumgang around 7 the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we receive the approval from Pyongyang, Hyundai
will begin building a pier in the North's southern port of
Jangjon,'' said Chung.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai chairman added that Chung Ju-yung, his father and
the founder of the group, who entered the DPRK through Panmunjom
last June, will visit the DPRK next month at the request of the
DPRK government.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sacks Cabinet, Chernomyrdin Back as Interim Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Sunday sacked the entire cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko and named
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as interim Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
The move came one week after the government and the central
bank devaluated the ruble and imposed a 90-day moratorium on
repayments of foreign debts, sending stock markets plunging to
record lows.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Kiriyenko was picked by Yeltsin to head the government
after Chernomyrdin's cabinet was abruptly dismissed in March.
</P>
<P>
The Kiriyenko cabinet, over its brief life, had largely played
the role of fire-fighters as the country was rocked by railway
blockades staged by miners unpaid for months and waves of
financial crises, dashing Yeltsin's program of a "year of growth"
this year.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts to prop up the currency and boost the
stock markets, even with over 22 billion U.S. dollars of loans
pledged from international lending agencies, succumbed to waning
investor confidence and a chronic downturn of industrial
production and lower prices of its major exports.
</P>
<P>
The announcement last Monday to raise the ceiling of exchange
corridor of the ruble from 6.3 to 9.5 rubles was seen as a move
that erased one of the few economic achievements of Yeltsin's
presidency, a stable ruble exchange rate.

<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Shenhua grabbed their
first-ever away point against Beijing in the league history after
they managed a 1-1 draw with Beijing Guo'an in the Chinese first
division soccer league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, who came here without even managing a tie away
against Guo'an since the league began in 1994, opened the scoring
through Paraguyan Sando Valg Elvio.
</P>
<P>
Elvio beat several defenders and the goalie before chipping
the ball into the empty net just seconds before the break.
</P>
<P>
The home team stormed back in the second half and their
efforts were paid off when Olivas Rubio Andres of Spain headed in
the equalizer on Wang Shaolei's cross in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
The previous four encounters between the two sides here all
ended with Beijing winning, mostly with a large margin. Last
season Beijing won 9-1.
</P>
<P>
In Qingdao, Shandong Province, defending champions Dalian
Wanda proved the class of their own as they thrashed the Qingdao
Hainiu 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Hao Haidong scored twice and Sun Jihai added another to make
it 3-0 with 25 minutes left in the game before Cao Xiandong
scored a consoling goal for Hainiu in the remaining time.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Hongjinlong extended their home win streak to three
games as the team, under the guidance of the new head coach Qi
Wusheng, defeated Sichuan Quanxing 2-1.
</P>
<P>
But it was the visitors who found the net first as Liu Bin
scored a 25th-minute goal after Wei Qun's powerful shot hit the
post and landed into Liu's path.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan then scored twice in an expanse of just three minutes
from 85th to 87th minutes to grab the three points.
</P>
<P>
There is little change on the overall standings, with the top
six places remaining the same as those of last round.
</P>
<P>
In the other games Sunday, Chinese Army beat Guangzhou Apollo
2-1, Guangzhou Songri defeated Yanbian Aodong 2-1, Shenzhen edged
Shandong 4-3 while Vanguards drew with Shenyang 2-2.

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders Discuss Peace Plan for DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) ended an emergency
summit on the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting a South African-backed peace initiative for the
DRC was discussed.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not immediately known whether the peace plan
had been endorsed by all the parties present.
</P>
<P>
A key player in the DRC crisis, Zimbabwe, earlier Sunday
refused to go back on a decision to aid DRC President Laurent
Kabila militarily.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's spokesman said that
Mugabe would not attend the summit as regional defense ministers
had already decided in favor of military intervention.
</P>
<P>
"SADC met and took a decision through its defense ministers
and that decision is being implemented, so we cannot go back on
that decision," George Charamba told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Charamba was referring to a SADC defense ministers' meeting
last week in Harare, Zimbabwe. However, the meeting was poorly
represented and the decision of military intervention was
considered not authentic.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, Mugabe and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
who also supports military intervention were notably absent at
the SADC summit called by South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's peace plan calls for an immediate cease-fire
and the recognition of Kabila's government until a broad-based
transitional government can be formed to prepare for democratic
elections in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The plan was discussed separately in Pretoria on Saturday
evening and Sunday morning by the presidents of Rwanda and Uganda
and a delegation of ministers sent by Kabila,
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki Sunday expressed
confidence in his country's peace efforts, according to South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has been busy coordinating the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Pretoria peace talks are going well and a
cease-fire is on the cards.
</P>
<P>
However, with the absence of three key players in the crisis,
observers are highly skeptical about how far the peace talks and
the SADC summit could go.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu and Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni were also present at the opening session of the
summit, as well as Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and a
representative of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya are not members of the SADC. Kabila
has accused Rwanda and Uganda of being behind the revolt in his
country, but the two countries immediately denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sacks Cabinet, Chernomyrdin Back as Interim Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Sunday sacked the entire cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko and named
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as interim Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the Kremlin, Yeltsin said he had
signed a decree dismissing the government and naming former
premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, 60, as interim prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin declared in the decree that the government of the
Russian Federation has resigned.
</P>
<P>
The decree, which took immediate effect, stipulates that "the
interim head of the government will be Viktor Stepanovitch
Chernomyrdin."
</P>
<P>
The announcement marked an extraordinary comeback for
Chernomyrdin, who was unexpectedly sacked in March to make way for
the 35-year-old Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, lower house of parliament, welcomed
Chernomyrdin's return.
</P>
<P>
The president's decision came one week after the government and
the central bank devaluated the ruble and imposed a 90-day
moratorium on repayments of foreign debts, sending stock markets

<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Sunday sacked the entire cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko and named
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as interim Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
The move came one week after the government and the central
bank devalued the ruble and imposed a 90-day moratorium on
repayments of foreign debts, sending stock markets plunging to
record lows.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of the State Duma, or lower house
of parliament, welcomed news of Kiriyenko's demise.
</P>
<P>
He said he had expected this to happen since the Kiriyenko
cabinet "is not capable of working efficiently," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the Duma speaker was apprehensive about Yeltsin's
decision to call Chernomyrdin back as interim premier.
</P>
<P>
"This endeavor is unlikely to succeed since Kiriyenko's
government, which survived just over 100 days, continued what the
former Cabinet was doing," Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Duma council will tackle the issue at its Monday
session.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said Yeltsin should consult with the Duma and the
Federation Council, or upper house of parliament, on both the
candidacy of a new prime minister and the composition of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Shokhin, leader of the Our Home is Russia faction in
the Duma, hailed Chernomyrdin's comeback.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin sorted things out after returning from vacation
and took into consideration the Friday debate in the Duma over the
country's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
In the session, lawmakers passed a resolution to recommend
Yeltsin to step down voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
It also passed a motion expressing unsatisfaction over the
Kiriyenko cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Shokhin told Interfax that Kiriyenko, central bank governor
Sergei Dubinin and presidential envoy for negotiations with
international lending agencies Anatoly Chubais failed to reveal
the actual situation in full to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov criticized the move, saying
Yeltsin should have consulted with parliament in advance.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Kiriyenko was picked by Yeltsin to head the government
after Chernomyrdin's cabinet was abruptly dismissed in March.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> AL Stresses Egypt-France Idea on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) said Sunday
the Egyptian-French idea on holding an international conference to
save the Mideast peace process is a viable alternative in the
event the American proposal fizzles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Saudi Al Madina newspaper, the AL Assistant
Secretary General for Political Affairs Mohamad Zakaria said
Russia, China and Japan in addition to the European Union and some
Arab countries are expected to attend the conference, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference, Zakaria said, is aimed at "activating the
Madrid conference terms of reference and piling pressure on Israel
to honor such terms and implement the relevant agreements."
</P>
<P>
Egypt is working with France on a joint initiative on convening
such a conference. Parties concerned with the peace process will
be invited to the conference while countries directly involved in
it will not attend at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed at reigniting the peace-making spirit,
as frustrations run high over months of Israeli resistance to the
U.S. initiative calling for a further 13.1 percent Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank in return for Palestinian security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The AL official noted that the U.S. is "making a retreat" as
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright shies away from direct
mediation between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were frozen over Israel's
settlement expansions in Arab East Jerusalem and long delays in
military redeployment. Recent direct contacts between the two
sides fail to make a breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Says it Rejects All Forms of Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said Sunday it
rejects all forms of terrorism and calls on the international
community to take effective measures to combat terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government made the statement at a weekly cabinet
meeting, the official news agency KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been following up with great concern the recent
terrorist events that caused casualties and property damage, the
agency quoted government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the need to intensify all common efforts
to spare the international community from further losses, and
cement international stability and security for all nations.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the U.S. launched missile attacks
thursday evening on what it described as "terrorist-related"
targets in Sudan and Afghanistan following the twin bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than
260 people, including 12 Americans.

<HEADLINE> Iran's President Criticizes U.S. Missile Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami Sunday
criticized the U.S. for its recent missile attacks on alleged
terrorist-related facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan, stressing
that differences should be solved through common sense and logics.
</P>
<P>
Meeting visiting French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine,
Khatami said Washington's hasty move is a blatant violation of
international law, and its attack on a pharmaceutical plant in
Sudan is against the internationally-recognized norms.
</P>
<P>
What has been raised by the U.S. should have been raised at an
international tribunal, so that if someone is found guilty, the
whole world would deal with him, the official news agency IRNA
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He termed as human tragedies the August 7 bombings at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which caused last Thursday's
U.S. missile attacks, and said anti-terrorism campaign needs a
global will.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism, which means resorting to force to solve problems, is
the century's most ominous phenomenon, he said, adding that Iran
has been a target of terrorism for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Calling the current century an era of clashes, pressure,
colonialism, terror and hatred, Khatami expressed hopes that the
upcoming century would be an era of dialog, peace, cooperation and
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he hoped that Vedrine's visit to Iran would open a
new chapter in bilateral relations for the betterment of universal
peace.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the Palestinian issue, Khatami said that Paris'
stance towards the Mideast peace process is more rational than
that of other western countries.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived here Friday night and handed a message of
French President Jacques Chirac to Khatami, termed as positive the
talks he had with the Iranian officials during his stay here and
said that "all your remarks on dialog among civilizations are
eagerly followed up in France," IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: German Parties Kick Off Election Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Major German political parties
kicked off the so-call "hot phase" of their election campaigns
over the weekend to make the final efforts to woo public support
with only 35 days left to the country's general elections on
September 27.
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming elections will decide in which direction Germany
will go in the next century," German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a
mass rally of about 18,000 supporters in western German city of
Dortmund on Sunday, which marked the formal start of the election
campaigns of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
</P>
<P>
Having been German chancellor since 1982, Kohl, 68, is facing a
serious challenge this time from the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and its much younger and pragmatic-minded
chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by near post-war record high unemployment in the
country, Kohl's party has been trailing the SPD in opinion polls
over the past one year, though recent polls indicated that the
race has tightened with the election day approaching.
</P>
<P>
"We can win, we want to win and we will win!" Kohl told his
supporters at the Dortmund rally, apparently pinning his hope on
about a quarter of German voters who have not yet made up their
mind which party they will vote for.
</P>
<P>
A number of Kohl's allies, including his designated political
heir Wolfgang Schaeuble and German Finance Minister Theo Waigel,
who is also leader of CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union, also addressed the rally and spoke highly of Kohl's
historic contributions to the European integration and the German
reunification.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Kohl was the only German politician who
commands the international reputation and the political vision to
lead Germany to face challenges in an era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
One day ahead of the CDU, the SPD also launched its election
campaigns on Saturday with a tour through three major German
cities -- Berlin, Munich and Bonn.
</P>
<P>
"We can and will win on September 27 because we have the better
program and we have the better people," Schroeder told some 5,000
supporters in a speech in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, the 54-year-old premier of the western German Lower
Saxony state, has been viewed as a political new face who embodies
many Germans' desire for a change after 16 years of conservative
rule.
</P>
<P>
Copying the successful strategies of U.S. President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Schroeder is trying
to steer his traditionally leftist party towards the so-call
political "new center" by advocating free-market solutions to
Germany's social problems instead of SPD's traditional
big-spending and big-government ideologies.
</P>
<P>
So far, Schroeder's strategy appears to be working, with
opinion polls showing his party running up to 10 percentage points
ahead of Kohl's CDU earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
However, as Germany's economic recovery taking roots and
unemployment going down, many polls said that Kohl had managed to
narrow the gap to about three to five percent at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that a decisive factor would be the performance
of the smaller parties, namely the Free Democratic Party (FDP),
which is the junior partner in Kohl's center-right ruling
coalition, and the ecologist Greens party, which is hoping to form
a leftist alliance with the SPD in September.
</P>
<P>
But the FDP is still struggling to win over five percent of the
vote which is necessary under German election law to be seated in
the federal parliament. Without FDP's vote, Kohl would not have
won the four general elections over the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greens, which has emerged as the third largest
party in Germany in the past decade, has still to soften some of
their radical environmental and international policy demand in
order to make a possible the SPD-Greens coalition more workable,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Given the current circumstances, there is a growing speculation
that the two biggest parties, the CDU and SPD, might form a
so-called "grand coalition" after the September election.
</P>
<P>
While Schroeder has indicated he would be willing to lead such
a coalition, Kohl has repeatedly rejected the idea so far.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Attend Oslo Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat will fly to Oslo Monday to
attend the fifth anniversary celebrations of the Oslo agreements,
Voice of Palestine said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Abu Ala and
PNA Minister of State Hasan Asfour will accompany Arafat to the
celebrations, which will be held at the Nobel Institute for Peace
in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo agreements signed five years ago in Oslo laid down the
framework for a political solution of the Palestinian issue with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to
attend the ceremonies in Oslo, saying he does not have time
because of things he has to take care of in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said that he prefers to remain in Israel in
an effort to advance the peace process, and not to deal in
ceremonialism and nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
Parliament coalition chairman Meir Sheetrit and Netanyahu's
political advisor Uzi Arad were sent by Netanyahu to represent
the Israeli government at the event in Oslo. The two left for Oslo
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who will attend
the Oslo functions together with U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross, said last weekend that "it is a terrible mistake"
that Netanyahu refused to turn up.
</P>
<P>
"We owned our thanks to the people of Norway," Peres said.

<HEADLINE> PNC Denounces U.S. Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Council (PNC) issued a statement in Gaza Sunday, strongly
denouncing the U.S. air strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The PNC considered that these activities represented a
violation of the international legitimate resolutions represented
by the U.N. and its charter," the Voice of Palestinian quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Authorized by President Bill Clinton, the U.S. fired cruise
missiles Thursday evening at what is called terrorist-related
targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, in retaliation for the twin
bombings at U.S. embassies in east Africa early this month.
</P>
<P>
The PNC in the statement affirmed its rejection of all forms of
terrorism, and called on the U.S. to stop its double-standard with
respect to international issues.
</P>
<P>
The PNC is the highest governing body of the Palestinians. Its
members include important figures of various factions living in
the Palestinian self-rule territories and abroad.
</P>
<P>
On the same issue, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a political faction, said in its statement issued on
Sunday that the U.S. air strikes were also terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Washington can not appoint itself as policeman, judge and
executioner against the countries they bombed, the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Cases Reach 255,000 in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria recorded about 255,000
cases of epidemic tuberculosis in 1996, accounting for 3.5
percent of the global total, Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian newspaper quoted a report released recently by
the World Health Organization as saying that Nigeria is the number
five among 22 world countries with the growing epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Akinola Owokoniran of the Lagos General
Hospital as saying that the level of TB infection in the west
African country is estimated at a proportion of 1,000 male and
800 female per 100,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has instituted a National Tuberculosis and Leprosy
Control program and made the treatment of tuberculosis free last
November.
</P>
<P>
However,the program has been fraught with ignorance of
government officials on the dimensions and costs of the epidemic
and the urgency of controlling it, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization blamed in the report the growing
cases of tuberculosis in Nigeria and 21 other countries on the
lack of political will at the national level to develop and
sustain effective curative programs.
</P>
<P>
Owokoniran said in the interview that the rate of infection
has been on the increase because of poverty. Even with the
decision by the Federal government to provide all the drugs
virtually free, victims can still not affort to eat good food,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries including China, Japan and Germany are
assisting some of the 36 states in the country to combat the
spidemic disease of tuberculosis, said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Raps U.S. Strikes on Sudan, Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi parliament denounced
the U.S. air strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan, saying the
U.S. has been pursuing the policy of force.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the National Assembly said that such
raids indicated the aggressive approach of the U.S. and the policy
of force it has been pursuing in international relations, the
official INA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The action shows that the aggressor America no longer gives a
hoot for international law, and acts in a way ignoring the world
organization to which it resorts whenever it needs to influence
its resolutions, while putting the organization aside in other
cases," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military "aggression" on the two developing countries,
causing casualties of innocent people and property damage, is
unwarranted, it added.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the U.S. launched simultaneous missile attacks
on what it termed as "terrorist-related" targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan, in retaliation for the twin bombings at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Parliament Speaker Saadoun Hammadi stressed Saturday the
need for Arabs to stand by Arab rights anywhere and to confront
U.S. anti-Arab policy.
</P>
<P>
He was meeting with visiting Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail, who arrived Baghdad Friday on an official visit.

JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Sunday called for an immediate
cease-fire and troops standstill in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) after an emergency summit in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
SADC Secretary-General Kaire Mbuwende after the summit read to
reporters a joint communique, calling for the initiation of peace
talks between all parties involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said that while Zimbabwean
representatives attended the talks in the absence of President
Robert Mugabe, none from Angola were present.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila did not attend the summit, but he
sent his Justice Minister Mwenz Kongolo instead.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, who called and chaired
the summit, said that the communique was accepted unanimously by
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was confident that the rebels would also
support a cease-fire as they had indicated they wanted
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the rebels are speaking the same
language as we do," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The South African president said he would speak to
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim on Sunday night to put in place a framework to implement a
cease-fire in democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela said that no time frames for the troops standstill
had been set.

KUWAIT CITY, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) said it was deeply concerned over the
U.S. missile attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, which
left human casualties and material losses.
</P>
<P>
OIC Secretary General Ezzedine Laraki said on Sunday the
Jeddah-based organization reiterates its condemnation of all forms
of terrorism but rejects any unilateral action "apart from the
international legitimacy."

the United Nations Security Council and to its request that a
U.N. fact-finding team be sent to Khartoum to visit the destroyed
pharmaceutical factory.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insisted that the factory was producing chemical
weapons, an allegation flatly rejected by Sudan.

The OIC also called for intensified efforts to fight terrorism
through legitimate means and in accordance with the U.N. charter

<HEADLINE> Profile: Chernomyrdin Stages Comeback in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Viktor Chernomyrdin came back to
the Russian government Sunday, this time as interim prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old technocrat, seen as a survivor in Moscow's
volatile politics, staged his comeback about five months after his
cabinet was abruptly sacked by President Boris Yeltsin in March.
</P>
<P>
His hands will be full as the country struggles to stave off
its most serious financial crisis in the wake of an effective
devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The Kiriyenko government and the central bank last Monday
raised the ceiling of the ruble's exchange corridor from 6.3 to
9.5 rubles to the U.S. dollar and imposed a 90-day moratorium on
repayments of foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin returned to Moscow immediately after the
devaluation announcement, cutting short his vacation in the resort
of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
He held a flurry of meetings with political players of the
country, including State Duma leader Gennady Seleznyov, Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, former presidential security
advisor Alexander Lebed, prompting media speculations over his
return to government.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin held positions in the gas and oil industries in
the former Soviet Union and served as minister of the gas industry
from 1985 to 1989 under former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed prime minister by Yeltsin in 1992, a position
he held until March 27 this year when Yeltsin, saying a new team
was needed to ensure progress on economic reforms, fired him in a
surprise announcement that also ousted the majority of the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said then that there was "no need to panic," and
Yeltsin said he wanted Chernomyrdin to focus on preparations for
the 2000 presidential race, but stopped short of advocating him as
his preferred successor.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin graduated from the Kuibyshev Polytechnical
Institute in 1966 and the Economics Department of the All-Union
Polytechnical Institute of Postal Tuition in 1972 as an
engineer-technologist and an engineer-economist.
</P>
<P>
He has been leader of the Our Home is Russia political movement
since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Rises in Nigerian Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign portfolio investment in
the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has hit a record high of 9.5
million U.S. Dollars in the first half of 1998, a 64 percent up
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment was a mark of confidence of ratable
earnings in Nigeria's investment horizon, the official News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Sunday quoted Achibong Achibong, African
financial analyst of the Japan-based Sito Securities, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Achibong said that with the collapse of the Asian stock
market, foreign investors are focusing more on African emerging
markets, especially on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Contemporary statistics indicate that foreign investors have
gone beyond political logjam in accessing the investment
potential of Nigeria", he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Finance Corporation under the World Bank in
its recently-released 1997 rankings, rated the Nigerian market as
the second best in dividend yields out of 39 stock markets
assessed globally.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Razaq Oladejo, Assistant Director-General of the NSE,
said recently that many corporate concerns participated actively
in the Nigerian economy through rights issues acquired in local
companies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a strong inflow of foreign capital would help
moderate the effect of liquidity squeeze among domestic
investors, Oladejo regretted political uncertainties and slow
progress in privatization are preventing more foreign investment
in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Over 500 Congo (K) Refugees Flee Into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 refugees
from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have entered the
Kigoma Region in west Tanzania to escape the intensifying wars in
the country, a Tanzanian official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kigoma Regional Commissioner Ukiwaona Ditopile Mzuzuri told
local media that the number of the DRC refugees fleeing into the
region, on the shore of the Lake Tanganyika, has reached 557 by
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mzuzuri said the region received an influx of 180 refugees
from the DRC Friday and seven on the following day.
</P>
<P>
The displaced will be billeted at a new camp in Nyarugusu
Camp, Kasulu District in the region, officials said. The
refugees had mainly come from the eastern Congolese towns of
Uvira and Baraka.
</P>
<P>
The flow of Congolese refugees, however, had been slower than
that of Burundi, whose number had reached 1,058 by Saturday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Burundian refugees had fled fighting in the
southern provinces of Rutana, Bururi and Makamba in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 150,000 people, the majority civilians, have been
killed in Burundi since 1993, when the country's first popularly
elected president, a Hutu, was assassinated by Tutsi troops,
sparking a civil war between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated
army.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian refugees are kept at Nduta camp in the Kibondo
District of the region.
</P>
<P>
The regional chief said in collaboration with the UNHCR, the
region had the capacity of receiving up to 50,000 new refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a position to cater for up to 50,000 new refugees
in terms of food, tents and other important services," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ditopile said repatriation of refugees from the DRC was
suspended on August 6 in accordance with international laws, due
to the eruption of war in their country. The rebels troops led by
Prof. Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba want to topple the government of
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He said before the suspension of the repatriation exercise,
most of the DRC refugees were eager to go back home, and the
vessels ferrying them back across the Lake Tanganyika were always
full, he said.

the Iraqi people in their legitimate demands for lifting of the
sanctions, and India would work for this end.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed crippling sanctions against Iraq after its
invasion of neighboring Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions can only be
removed upon Iraq's elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Indian speaker, who arrived here Saturday, stressed that
India was ready to cooperate with Iraq through exchanging visits
by officials of the two countries and coordinating stand to serve
the interests of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters on Sunday, the Indian speaker
indicated that meetings of the Indo-Iraqi joint committee would

countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday met with
Balalogi and his delegation, and briefed them on the latest
developments in the relations between Iraq and the U.N. Special
Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed means of further developing bilateral
cooperation and bringing friendship relations back to
pre-sanctions levels in the interests of peoples of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, the Iraqi government suspended cooperation with
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency in weapons
inspections, complaining that UNSCOM is pro-U.S. and attempting to
prolong sanctions against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Vedrine: Iran, France Differ on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said here on Sunday that Iran and France have
different views over the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before concluding his first
visit to Tehran, Vedrine said the Iranians were opposed to the
Middle East peace process from the beginning, but France regarded
the peace process positive.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians claimed that they opposed the process because it
was wrongly founded, but they stressed that they had done nothing
to stop the peace process at the same time, said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that Iranian officials told him the latest events
proved that Iran's position toward the peace process was right.
</P>
<P>
"We told them that the reason they doubted the Middle East
peace process was something else, our position toward the peace
process is positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We prefer an incomplete peace process to ignoring peace
talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a Xinhua question about his talks with Iranian
officials over the latest development in Afghanistan, Vedrine said
that Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi expressed concern
about developments there and "we also voiced France's concern
about the country."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian officials are worried about the events in
Afghanistan and have decided to positively influence the process,
and they believe that the Afghan crisis can only be solved
politically rather than militarily, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many French citizens have been to Afghanistan to deliver
humanitarian assistance, and France believes peace would be
restored in Afghanistan when the neighboring states come to terms
even at the minimum, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Paris-Tehran relations, the foreign minister said
that he submitted the message of President Jacques Chirac to
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and invited him to visit France.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will make coordinations for the visit and
Kharrazi will visit France later this year or early next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure Sunday afternoon, Vedrine told reporters
that time has come to resume an important, wide-scale talks with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the outcome of his talks with
Iranian officials. The two sides are interested in holding
constructive talks with each other in all fields, Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
He said that more high-level political talks and contacts and
expansion of Tehran-Paris economic cooperation are among practical
ways to expand bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the French government would further encourage
its big and medium-sized companies to invest in Iran. He called on
Iran to offer more facilities to French companies in this field.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the U.N. Security Council and as an important
country in Europe, France is willing to exchange views with Iran
on international crises, Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived here Friday night on an official visit.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport Resumes Full Air Cargo Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's main air cargo
handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), Monday
resumed full operation of its facility at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
HACTL's Super Terminal One at Chek Lap Kok started from Monday
to handle all inbound and outbound air cargoes, estimated at
around 4,000 tons daily.
</P>
<P>
The Super Terminal One broke down shortly after the opening of
the new airport in early July, forcing the air cargo operator to
divert part of its cargoes to Terminal Two at the old Kai Tak
Airport for processing.
</P>
<P>
HACTL carried out a four-phase scheme over the past month to
resume its handling capacity step by step.
</P>
<P>
Now both passenger and air cargo services at Chek Lap Kok
returned to normal, according to the Airport Authority (AA), which
oversees the running of the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Sources from AA said that three quarters of flights were
leaving on time or within 15 minutes of schedule. Almost all
arriving passengers were clearing immigration within 15 minutes,
and the average waiting time for their baggage was 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the AA said: "The figures show that the new Hong
Kong International Airport is achieving levels of efficiency."

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Become Major Concern In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Zhou Fang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A common topic in city streets,
in offices, in dining halls or in villages of China these days is
where the flood crest is now, in Shashi, Wuhan, Jiujiang, or
Anqing?
</P>
<P>
While the Yangtze, Nen and Songhua rivers' floodwaters have
passed or about to pass, the government, the media, and ordinary
people are expressing concern about the tens of millions of people
left stranded, living out in the open or in make-shift huts, and
grieving over the loss of their homes and deaths of loved ones.
</P>
<P>
The central government has repeatedly asked local officials to
take greater care of these people, and the top leaders have made
donations themselves for the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
For the past few days, charity drives have been held in the
cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to raise money for the
flood victims. The Ministry of Civil Affairs and its outlets have
received donations worth more than 1.7 billion yuan, and
manufacturers of life jackets, bottled drinking water, medicines,
and fast food have been asked to work overtime to meet the needs
of flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have taken steps to guarantee
the distribution of relief goods and funds. In Hubei Province,
local authorities ordered the firing of some officials who
embezzled 2,000 yuan or more in relief money.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province, the local
government has said it will act as guarantor for flood victims in
borrowing rice from state-run grain mills or shops.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the out-break of epidemics, nearly 20,000 medical
teams with 130,000 people have been sent to provide check-ups,
distribute medicines, and oversee hygiene in flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are stiffening price controls on daily
necessities, and a number of people who have attempted to make an
illegal profit from price-hikes have been punished.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Ministry has issued orders to crack down on
criminal activities like theft, robbery and fraud in the flood
areas. According to official reports, some people have tried to
get honest people to make donations in false charity boxes that
these malefactors placed on streets.
</P>
<P>
Only civil affairs departments, official charitable
organizations, and Red Cross offices have the right to accept
donations, and police have been ordered to keep an eye open for
fake fund raisers.

<HEADLINE> hke082475 -Indonesian Special Force Chief Cleared out of Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto said Monday he had decided to terminate the
military career of Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, former president
Soeharto's son-in-law and a former commander of the Army's elite
special forces unit -- Kompassus.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also said two other senior Kompassus officers, Maj.
Gen. Muchdi and Col. Gen. Chariawan, would be relieved from their
structural positions and duties in the military.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said he had taken the decision after receiving and
considering the recommendations made by an Officers' Honor Council
(DKP) that had examined the three about their involvement in the
abductions of Indonesian students and political activists.
</P>
<P>
When asked what "terminating of Prabowo's military career
meant," Wiranto said it means he will become a civilian and no
longer hold any structural military position. In other words, he
is put on retirement, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI chief also said a military court trial for Prabowo and
the two others was possible if statements made by 10 lower-ranking
Kompassus officers currently also facing court trial in the same
cases produced clues that the three had committed criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo commanded Kompassus for more than two years before he
was appointed commander of the Army Strategic Reserves Command
(Kostrad) last March.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo was removed from his Kostrad post one day after
Soeharto announced his resignation from the presidency on May 21.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo had admitted his wrong doings in the abductions of more
than 20 political activists early this year and said he would be
responsible for the cases.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers reported that Prabowo may also involved
in other criminal cases such as rioting in May in Jakarta and
other cities during which about 1,200 people were killed and more
than 5,000 shops and buildings were damaged or burned.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The floodwater may not seem so
threatening, but it is too early to say it's been defeated.
</P>
<P>
The 7th flood crest on the upper reaches of the Yangtze has
passed, with the water level of Chongqing hitting a record high of
183.21 meters, and the flow rate 58,000 cubic meters per second at
4 p.m. on Sunday. Authorities say that water levels on the middle
and lower reaches will not hit historical highs.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at the Yichang-Shishou section on the middle and
lower reaches have risen while the water receded slowly on
sections downstream at Jianli and Dongting and Poyang lakes, the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters told Xinhua
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The water level will remain high for a period of time on the
middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze, a headquarters official
said, and when the water ebbs, more dike slides, leaks, or even
breaches will appear.
</P>
<P>
According to a CCTV evening report, the dikes at Jianli and
Honghu have the greatest number of problems.
</P>
<P>
The 6th flood crest on the Yangtze passed Nanjing in Jiangsu
Province today with a water level of 9.95 meters at the Xiaguan
measuring point, 0.27 meter below the record level.
</P>
<P>
The flood crest on the Songhua River passed Harbin, the capital
of Heilongjiang Province, at 7:00 p.m. Sunday, with a level of
120.89 meters and a flow rate of 17,400 cubic meters per
second. It dropped to 120.84 meters at 2:00 p.m. today.

Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
Koh Yong Guan told a press conference here that Singapore's
financial sector has been preparing for Year 2000 since early 1997
and the MAS is confident that the financial system as a whole will
be resilient in the transition to Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 problem is expected to cause many computers
worldwide to misread Year 2000 as 1900 because of their
incapability to read more than the two last digits of the year. As
this will lead to system failures, many Asian stock exchanges have
been upgrading their systems to make sure they are millennium
compliant.
</P>
<P>
Koh Yong Guan said one of the major concerns in the financial
area is to prepare the financial sector for Year 2000,
emphasizing that "getting ready for Year 2000 is the one of the
biggest immediate challenges facing the financial industry
throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
He said the MAS is taking decisive steps to co-ordinate
industry-wide Year 2000 compliance and has mapped out supervisory
measures to restrict the activities of those who can not meet
MAS's standards for Year 2000 readiness.
</P>
<P>
The Managing Director said a series of Year 2000 readiness test
has been scheduled for various industries, spelling out the tests
both under work and plans in financial sector.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) had
just successfully completed a test on its trading system for Year
2000 readiness on Sunday and the Singapore International Money
Exchange (SIMEX) and the electronic payment system (MEPS) has been
scheduled to undergo a test respectively in October and in the
fourth quarter of this year. The entire financial sector will be
undergoing a Year 2000 readiness test in the first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday SES conducted a test run of its trading system
simulating the first day of business in the New millennium.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the test, which involved the 33 member firms of
the SES, several authorized trading centers, approved foreign
brokers, participants of the Bond Quotation System, trading
computers were set to believe that January 3, 2000, -- the first
business day of the new millennium -- had arrived.
</P>
<P>
Closing data from last Friday, August 21, was used for the test
run which was completed successfully, the SES said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Flood Fight Still Mean Great Effort (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More relief materials are being sent to flooded areas. By
Saturday night, 2.7 billion yuan (325.3 million U.S. dollars)
worth of donations from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Red
Cross Society of China, and the All-China Charity Federation had
been sent.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji recently said he was greatly concerned about
relief supplies, especially clothing and shelter, for the
Northeast, after 13,450 tents, 20,000 life vests, and
cotton-padded clothing was delivered by the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council has demanded stricter
management of donations and the Ministry of Civil Affairs has
guaranteed that every penny of the relief funds will be used for
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The prevention of epidemic disease is becoming more important
in flood-stricken areas. Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang has said
that infectious diseases like snail fever are a threat and that
the incidence of intestinal diseases, dysentery, hepatitis, and
colds is greater than last year.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is a shortage of funds and medicine, Zhang
says, and the problem could become worse in the next three months,
which is usually the peak period for epidemics. There are now
three problems: access to drinking water, disposing of rubbish,
and removing human waste, according to one member of a medical
working team.

<HEADLINE> India Against Competitive Devaluation of Currencies: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said Monday that he has strongly disfavored any
competitive devaluation of currencies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview given to Thai newspaper "The Nation", which was
made public here Monday evening, Vajpayee said that the East Asian
crisis was a pointer to the harm it can do to the financial and
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the areas where India and the South East Asian
nations should be consulting continuously and looking at
strategies to prevent any crises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have neither triggered competitive devaluation in the past
nor indulged in it despite pressures to do so," he further said.
</P>
<P>
India had weathered the crisis quite well so far though the
second wave was beginning to impact on India's economy. India was
affected by market sentiments and there was a heightened risk
assessment about Asia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma to Discuss Nomination of PM in 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, the
lower house of the parliament, will discuss the nomination of
Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister in 10 days instead of the
seven days stipulated by legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov
as saying Monday that the Duma needed at least 10 days prepare a
meeting on confirmation of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
After holding a telephone conversation with President Boris
Yeltsin on Monday, Seleznyov said Yeltsin had agreed to postpone
the discussion of the candidacy of Chernomyrdin for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was nominated as acting prime minister by Yeltsin
following the sacking of the entire government headed by Sergei
Kiriyenko on Sunday. In a letter to the Duma later, Yeltsin
nominated Chernomyrdin as the prime minister and gave him a clear
mandate to reorganize the government and formulate its programs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the Duma Council called on Yeltsin to
withdraw his letter concerning the candidacy of Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said that Yeltsin was ready to put a different date
on his letter to the Duma on Chernomyrdin's nomination.
</P>
<P>
He said that he stood for creating a trilateral commission on
the formation of a new government and preparation of its programs.
</P>
<P>
Such a commission would include representatives of the
government, the Federation Council and the State Duma, he noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Cite Disaster Aid Needs for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- American military specialists
presented to Foreign Minister Abudus Samad Azad on Monday the
findings of a just-concluded assessment of humanitarian assistance
needs aimed at combating natural calamity in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
They demonstrated how the U.S. government could most
effectively provide assistance to Bangladesh during any future
disasters on request, a release from the External Publicity Wing
of the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A three-member team visited Dhaka, Rangpur, Bogra, Chittagong
and Cox's Bazar and after discussing with individuals and groups
of people in government departments and non-government
organizations (NGO), and recommended 11 types of projects for
capacity enhancement of the government to respond to natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
They presented an overview of their mission here and detailed
information concerning their activities, methods and
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"The cardinal objective is to assist the government of
Bangladesh in increasing its ability to respond to natural
disasters," the release quoted the U.S. experts as telling the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The team told the minister that it had assessed in different
parts of Bangladesh the possible responses of both the government
and the NGO community to various types of disasters, including
cyclones, floods and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
To help the Bangladeshi government improve its response to
disasters, the team offered a number of recommendations, including
U.S. donations of humanitarian equipment, exchange of experts on
humanitarian assistance, training of Bangladeshi officials in the
U.S., Bangladeshi-U.S. military exercises on humanitarian relief
and disaster-relief training simulations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. experts came here early this month under a memorandum
of understanding signed here late last month for a five-year
Humanitarian Assistance Needs Assessment project.

<HEADLINE> France Repeats Call for Great Lakes Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Monday repeated France's call for holding an
international peace conference on the strife-torn Great Lakes
region in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The problems of the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly
Zaire, were escalating, and several neighboring countries had
intervened to keep peace in the region, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crisis in former Zaire did not involve just
one country, but five, six or seven countries.
</P>
<P>
"One can not but wish that these countries come to meet, and
agree upon what is the most urgent," said him.
</P>
<P>
These countries should try to resolve their differences and
become normal neighbors again, he said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding an international conference on the Great
Lakes region was first proposed by Burundi in 1994 and afterwards
pushed by French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
These countries all have problems with refugees and a lack of
infrastructure which could only be solved by combining their
efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
France, along with other western countries like the United
States, Britain and Belgium, were ready, in one way or another, to
help these countries to get out of this vicious cycle.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Motor's Labor Dispute Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The labor and management of
Hyundai Motor Co. have reached an agreement on layoffs, ending a
prolonged labor dispute at the nation's largest auto maker.
</P>
<P>
The accord came after both sides agreed on the number and terms
of layoffs in talks mediated by the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Hyundai will lay off only 277 workers,
sharply down from the original proposal of 1,538, with the
remaining 1,261 workers to be sent on 18 months unpaid leave,
including six months of retraining.
</P>
<P>
The company will give the 277 workers severance payments amounting
to seven to nine months' wages and opportunities to be rehired by
Hyundai Motor or other Hyundai subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
The management also agreed to drop damage and violence charges it
filed against unionists after the company returns to normal operation.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the compromise, production at Hyundai's Ulsan
factories is expected to return to normal after a suspension of more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's 26,000 union workers began the strike on July 20
this year in protest against the company's plan to lay off 1,538
workers and operations of Hyundai's factories has virtually been
at a standstill since then.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Motor, which is capable of producing 1.65 million
vehicles per year and has 36,700 workers, has trimmed 6,100
workers through early retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai claimed that the strike had cost 690 million dollars in
production losses, while its parts suppliers have suffered losses
of 566 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai case has widely been considered as a litmus test
for the economic reforms of the Kim Dae-jung government.
</P>
<P>
Creation of a more flexible labor market is one goal of the
reforms that the economically plagued nation had promised the
International Monetary Fund in return for a rescue loan of 57
billion dollars last December.
</P>
<P>
"On the occasion of the compromise, the company will take the
lead in establishing new labor-management relations as well as try
to minimize the number of workers to be laid off in the future,"
Hyundai Motor chairman Chung Mong-kyu said,
</P>
<P>
Hyundai labour leader Kim Kwang-shik said the accord has paved
the way for both labor and management to survive together in
mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho hailed the compromise, saying, "It
marked a starting point in creating a new labor-management
culture."
</P>
<P>
However, some observers criticized the pact as too pro-labor,
arguing that the government has failed to show its will to
guarantee a flexible labor market, considered crucial to luring
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts cautioned that the labor-management standoff was
not over as the pact must be approved by union members.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai labor union plans to put the accord to a vote
soon. Some union workers were angered at union leaders for
accepting a minimum level of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Employers' Federation said it was regrettable that
the Hyundai case had been settled by political logic as it had set
a bad example, which would affect other businesses negatively.

<HEADLINE> Iran Displeased With Pakistan's Effort to Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Monday voiced Tehran's displeasure towards Islamabad's
"unsatisfactory" effort to release Iranian diplomats captured by
the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
"The work of Pakistan concerning the fate of kidnaped Iranian
diplomats were not worthy of being explained," Kharrazi told
visiting Pakistani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique
Khan Kanju, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian government and people expected the
immediate release of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA reporter
kidnaped by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that the Taliban forces kidnaped 11 Iranian
diplomats and an IRNA reporter earlier this month when the
fundamentalist group took control Mazari Sharif, the main
stronghold of the Iran-backed opposition.
</P>
<P>
Before the fall of Mazari Sharif to the Taliban's hands, he
said, Iran has asked Pakistan, a strong supporter of Taliban, to
get guarantee from the Taliban for the safety of the Iranian
consulate general in the city and its staff members.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister noted that the Taliban should
answer the question why they occupied the Iranian consulate by
force and kidnaped its staff members who have diplomatic
privileges.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban denied that they have captured any
Iranian diplomats from the city, saying that the Iranian
consulate was evacuated when their forces arrived there.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister stated that the telephone
contacts of the Iranian consulate were recorded, which proved the
existence of the Iranian diplomats in the consulate when the
Taliban fighters forced into it.
</P>
<P>
Any claim by the Taliban against the fact was a "mere lie," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that Iran's policy towards Afghanistan was
always based on non-interference in the Afghan internal affairs
and assistance to establish peace in that country.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a lasting peace could be established only
when a broad-based government comprising of all groups and
minorities is formed in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kanju briefed Kharrazi the efforts of his government to ensure
the release of the Iranians, saying that the Pakistani government
has made all-out efforts to help release the Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objective of his visit to Iran was to assure
the Iranian people and government that Pakistan would make all
efforts to ensure the release of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan also believes that the Afghan issue has no military
solution and a lasting peace could be possible only through the
establishment of broad-based government with participation of all
groups and minorities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani official arrived here Sunday night to submit a
message from Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Rehabilitation Conference Discusses Employment of Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the 11th
Rehabilitation International Asia and the Pacific Regional
Conference focused their discussions on a series of issues
including employment of the disabled here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conference cum Campaign'98 for the Asian and Pacific Decade
of Disabled Persons 1993-2002, which opened here Sunday, is
attended by 700 local delegates, 300 overseas delegates from about
50 countries and 350 delegates from the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Gabriele Stoikov, chief of the vocational Rehabilitation Branch
of the International Labor Office, delivered a speech on global
perspectives on employment of persons with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the environment in which employment opportunities
for people with disabilities have been developing and expanding
has undergone dramatic changes in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Not all the changes are happening in every country, and where
changes happen, the impact differs, depending on a range of
social, economic, cultural, political and historical factors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, he said that the issues including job retention,
return to work and employment creation policies are of prime
importance for persons with disabilities in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xincheng, representative from the Chinese Ministry of Labor
and Social Security, briefed the participants on employment of the
disabled in China which is regarded as a very important component
of the country's employment work.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, he said that local governments promulgated
regulations on proportionate employment of the disabled,
and the set proportion for the employment of the disabled was
between 1.5 and 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), a total of
680,000 disabled people were employed in urban areas and the
employment rate of the urban disabled increased from 51 percent to
67 percent.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, he said over 2 million handicapped persons are
taking part in different forms of production activities, 60,000
disabled are employed in township or village-run enterprises and
500,000 disabled have received practical skills training through
carrying out poverty-relief program.
</P>
<P>
The targets for the employment of the disabled during the Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000) are: the employment rate of the
disabled will reach about 80 percent, providing employment to
600,000 disabled in urban areas and further increasing the
employment level of the disabled in rural areas by 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Hong Kong and countries including India,
Britain also delivered speeches during Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Their topics ranged from early intervention in low income
communities, meeting the challenge of intellectual disabilities,
to methods of resourcing long-term care for senior citizens with a
disability.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Offers Reward on Information on Missing Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government
announced Monday a reward of 100,000 rupees (1,470 U.S. dollars)
for information on the whereabouts of the plane missing since
Friday morning as the search operation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Ananda Prasad Dhungana
told the Lower House of Parliament Monday that the government has
decided to cover the expenditure of the family members and
relatives of those on board the ill-fated twin Otter aircraft
moving to Pokhara and other places.
</P>
<P>
The plane with 18 people abroad including three crew members
and three Indians lost contact five minutes after it took off at
11:10 a.m. Friday in Jomsom, western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
It was scheduled to arrive in Pokhara, 80 kilometers away, at
11:30.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said that the family members and relatives
of those abroad became furious over the failure to track the plane
in the past few days, saying that the government was not taking
the issue seriously.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the search efforts by the four helicopters were
again interrupted by bad weather, as it rained and was foggy in
the targeted area, a duty officer at the Rescue and Coordination
Center of the capital's Tribhuvan International Airport told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that the area is where Mt. Dhaulagiri I (8,167m.) and
Mt. Annapurna I (8,091m.) lie, the steep mountains make it really
hard for the search efforts.
</P>
<P>
The army and police are joining in the search operation
together with the local people.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not Consulted by U.S. on Missile Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
Monday categorically rejected allegations in the local media
suggesting that Pakistan had been consulted by the United States
on its missile attacks against alleged terrorist targets in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
These reports are "completely unfounded," a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said in a press release issued Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Foreign Ministry has instructed its
permanent representative at the U.N. to take up the violation of
Pakistan's airspace in the U.S. missile attacks on August 20 with
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
On August 21, the U.S. charge d'affaires was summoned to the
Foreign Ministry and a protest was lodged on the presumption that
the missiles had overflown Pakistan's airspace in violation of the
international law, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest information, it was discovered that one
of the U.S. missiles landed in an uninhabited area near Shatinger
in Baluchistan, northwestern Pakistan, but it did not explode.
This confirms the basis on which the earlier presumptive protest
was lodged by Pakistan, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the missiles were fired from U.S. ships which
were 120 nautical miles from the Pakistan coast and well outside
the 12-mile limit of Pakistan's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Reports in local English newspapers said that an unexploded
cruise missile, fired by the U.S. marine from the Arabian Sea, was
found in the deserted area in Baluchistan on August 22.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Algeria Monday denied a report
that it is developing a nuclear program which will allow it to
produce military grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdelzziz Sebaa said that
the "allegations" by Spanish newspaper El Pais, which quoted
Spanish intelligence sources that Algiers was developing such a
nuclear program, were "unhealthy and sensational".
</P>
<P>
"Algeria is a signatory country of the Non-Proliferation Treaty
and has an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency
with which it maintains a cooperation of quality," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Algeria's nuclear program had only peaceful
purposes aimed at economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
El Pais quoted the Spanish Superior Center of Information of
Defense as saying, "The Algerian nuclear program continues to
provide itself with necessary installations for realizing all the
operations linked with the obtaining of plutonium of military
type, the key element for a nuclear program."

<HEADLINE> Angolan Army on Alert at Border with Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Angolan army has been on alert
at its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with
fighter planes in some airports on stand-by order to prevent the
flames of war from spreading to its own territory.
</P>
<P>
The country's military sources said Angolan army has made
reinforcement especially in the enclave province of Cabinda,
which is bordering the Congo Province in southwest DRC where the
fighting is extremely tense.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has reportedly sent a 1,000-strong army
to the DRC to join the battle in defending the capital Kinshasa.
However, there is no confirmation from the military side.
</P>
<P>
Angola firmly supports Laurent Kabila, president of the DRC,
in putting down the armed rebellion by Tutsi soldiers. It had
urged the meeting of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) defense ministers to adopt a resolution on providing DRC
with military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Angola's opposition, the National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), had taken advantage of the territory of former
Zaire as its military base, and the government is afraid of any
such recurrence.
</P>
<P>
President Eduardo dos Santos, who has cut short a holiday in
Brazil due to instability at home and in the region, noted that
his country is very worried over the situation in the neighboring
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the Great Lakes region should help each other to
promote peaceful co-existence, he said, adding no country is
allowed to use its own territory as a base to sabotage the
stability in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Angola and the DRC share over 1,000 kilometers of border. The
former Zaire under the late president Mobuto Sese Seko has
offered UNITA great help and allowed the former rebel movement to
set up military bases on its land.
</P>
<P>
During Kabila's armed struggle against Mobuto Sese Seko, the
Angolan government sent an army of about 5,000 men to help
Kabila. Angola and the DRC had signed an agreement on security
and defense.

1998, the government figures show.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading US Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed his new team of
economic reformers and reinstalled Victor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime
Minister, just five months after he derided Chernomyrdin as a
spent force and cast him out of the government. Yeltsin offered no
explanation for his decision, which raised fresh doubts about the
Kremlin's commitment to tough economic reforms and unsettling
questions about President Yeltsin's ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
-- On the day in January that the accusations about Monica
Lewinsky and U.S. President Bill Clinton became public, one set of
advisers -- the lawyers -- wanted Clinton to be vague in his
public responses and by no means say the word "sexual." The other
set -- the political team -- pressed for early candor. The fight
over strategy reflects the ongoing tension inside the White House
and inside the President.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday the House
likely will seek evidence from all of Kenneth W. Starr's
investigations -- not just the results of the inquiry into
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky -- before
determining whether to launch an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
-- After days of steady march toward Kinshasa, Rwandan-backed
Congolese rebels fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila have
bogged down southwest of the capital city, where government forces
backed by Angola and Zimbabwe reportedly recaptured a key rebel
supply base.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Global Markets face additional uncertainty, analysts say,
after Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed his government and
installed Victor Chernomyrdin, whom Yeltsin ousted in March, as
acting prime minister. Worries about spreading economic turmoil
hit Spanish and German stocks on Friday and affected currencies
from Mexico's peso to the Canadian dollar. Investors sought
perceived havens like U.S. Treasurys.

<HEADLINE> DRC Cease-Fire Urgent, Says Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- No time should be lost in
bringing about a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), South African President Nelson Mandela said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We should lose no time in ensuring that the cease-fire takes
place," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Mandela as
saying in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks after meeting Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar, who is in South Africa for a three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
Sunday called for a cease-fire and troop standstill in the DRC
after an emergency summit called by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he informed Organization of African Unity
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim earlier in the day about
SADC's stance.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo would brief Mandela
during the day on ways to bring about a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I get that briefing today, I will be in communication
with him (Salim)," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the role of Angolan forces in the DRC conflict, he
said Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had indicated that
he favored a cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"They (Angolan forces) have taken Kitona from the rebels, but
President dos Santos made a statement where he said they were not
going to advance from Kitona because they want a cease-fire and
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
This was a very healthy attitude, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Angola was the only SADC country absent from Sunday's summit.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reiterated there should be coordination between SADC's
search for peace in the DRC with initiatives headed by Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"The minister (Nzo) will work out modalities as to how that
coordination should take place."
</P>
<P>
Mandela added: "It was proposed yesterday (Sunday) that South
Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania, because of their experience in
negotiating settlements, should take the initiative in the
formation of a mechanism to ensure that we achieve an immediate
standstill in the DRC."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the conflict in the DRC would be discussed with
Abubakar in follow-up meetings during his visit.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Nigeria Should Renew Ties: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Nigeria
should renew bilateral relations and speak with one voice on
problems facing Africa, South African President Nelson Mandela
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us to renew our relationship because
those ties can only be in the interest of the continent of
Africa," Mandela was quoted by South African Press Association as
saying after meeting Nigerian leader Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected a strengthening of ties between the two
countries, also after the scheduled civilian takeover of the
Nigerian government in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said South Africa and Nigeria had a long-standing
history of relations marked by respect and understanding.
</P>
<P>
"We share some common values about how we see Africa being
developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The natural and human resources of both countries could
contribute much to the upliftment on the continent, Abubakar
said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar is on a three-day state visit to South Africa, the
first by a Nigerian head of state.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two most influential countries in Africa
had been strained since 1995 when Mandela led an international
call for sanctions against Nigeria following the execution of
several human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
Mandela described Abubakar as an old friend, saying South
Africa welcomed his coming to power on June 9 after the death of
his predecessor Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and other African countries were confident that
Abubakar was the right man to restore democracy in Nigeria, said
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident this is the leader who is going to help us
to achieve that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The steps Abubakar had announced to return his country to
civilian rule were in the interest of the whole continent as
Nigeria had the largest population in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela welcomed an independent electoral commission Abubakar
had set up, as well as moves to open the field for all political
parties in that country.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said he had consulted widely, also with world
leaders, on the best way to attain democracy in Nigeria. Ways to
boost the Nigerian economy were also under consideration.
</P>
<P>
"I hope, come May 29, 1999, we will hand over to an elected
government," Abubakar said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday gave Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin a clear
mandate to reorganize the government and formulate its programs.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin had "the full trust of the president" in selecting
members of his cabinet and making plans, the Itar-Tass news agency
cited Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government's line-up and programs were discussed by Yeltsin
and Chernomyrdin in the Kremlin earlier on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Yastrzhembsky, Chernomyrdin was open to
cooperation with all political and public groups.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was nominated as acting prime minister by Yeltsin
on Monday following the sacking of the entire government headed by
Sergei Kiriyenko on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister who was dismissed by
Yeltsin five months ago, agreed to his appointment as prime
minister again, but laid down certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
He insisted on having full personal control over the
appointment of all government ministers, including the heads of
"power ministries" and key economic agencies.
</P>
<P>
In a television address to the nation on Monday, Yeltsin said
that Chernomyrdin would be his preferred successor in the
presidential elections in the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Describing Chernomyrdin as a "heavyweight", Yeltsin said his
experience might improve the situation in the country, which had
been seriously affected by the world financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Never Sets Foot on Philippines: Military Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Chief of Staff of the
Armed Forces Joselin Nazareno denied here Monday a local news
report that international terrorist suspect Bin Laden was sighted
in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"This guy Bin Laden has never been in the Republic of the
Philippines," Nazareno said in a hastily called press conference
to quash the report that the multi-millionaire Saudi Arabian was
seen in Mindanao following the deadly bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden was suspected by the United States to have been
linked with the bombings.
</P>
<P>
The people might mistook Jamal Kalifa, the brother-in-law of
Bin Laden, because they look alike, Nazareno said, adding that
Kalifa married a Filipino and came to the Philippines before the
coming of the Pope about so many years back.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno was referring to the visit of the John Paul II in
Manila in January 1995 when authorities discovered a plot to
assassinate the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
But when the plot was exposed before the assassination attempt,
Kalifa went out of the country and never returned.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno said terrorism is an international crime and almost
all countries are against it, adding the Philippine military has
taken precautionary measures to protect the American embassy here.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Bureau of Immigration also confirmed that
it does not have any record of the arrival or departure of Bin
Laden.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Minister Meets NLD Party Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Minister of Home Affairs
Colonel Tin Hlaing met here with two top officials of the National
 League for Democracy (NLD) party for talks Monday, according to
an official Information Sheet.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came three days after the expiry of a deadline set
by the NLD to the ruling State Peace and Development Council
(SPDC) for a demand that parliament elected in the May 1990
Multi-Party General Election be convened for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The two NLD officials are members of the party's Central
Executive Committee U Than Tun and U Soe Myint.
</P>
<P>
The talks were described as "frank and cordial."
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, SPDC First Secretary Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt had a 45-minute meeting with NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe. Khin
Nyunt said that it was "the first in a series of meetings with the
NLD," while the NLD described it as an "informal meeting."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLD has decided to convene in the near future a
National Parliament elected in the 1990 General Election. A total
of 93 political parties took part in the election.
</P>
<P>
However, the government warned that "such an action by any
individual political party would be in contravention of Myanmar
Law and seems designed to derail the ongoing discussions between
the government and the NLD."

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Interviews Taiwan Affairs Office Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Political negotiations between
the Chinese mainland and Taiwan Province remain high on the
agenda, according to a leading official from the State
Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a recent interview with Xinhua, the official said
that the concerted efforts of Chinese people on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits have led to the steady development of economic and
cultural exchanges in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently called for a formal end to the state of
hostilities between the two sides in accordance with the 'one
China' principle and the beginning of talks covering procedural
arrangements for political negotiations, as well as the resumption
of economic and practical negotiations between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Taiwan-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities should exhibit their true intent to end
hostilities between the two sides by abandoning their "two Chinas"
stand, said the official, adding that they have no reason to delay
talks on procedural issues involving political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The official reiterated that the the ARATS welcomes SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his delegation to visit the mainland in
either September or October.
</P>
<P>
He said, "With the exception of those who stubbornly insist on
the 'independence of Taiwan', we will be delighted to hold talks
with Taiwan residents from various parties and all walks of life
concerning cross-straits relations and China's peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan authorities are truly committed to the reunification
of China, they should steadfastly refrain from creating disputes
over social systems. At the same time, they should abandon
attempts to explore broader international living space and to seek
membership in the United Nations, as well as actions disrupting
exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the "independence of Taiwan" and "two Chinas"
are beyond the realm of possibility, no matter it's from the point
of view of common wishes of Chinese people on both sides or from
the trend of international situation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We sincerely hope that Taiwan authorities will
fulfill promises concerning the "one China principle", and will
remove all barriers to promote the great cause of peaceful
reunification."
</P>
<P>
The official asked Chinese citizens on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits to join hands and engage in a concerted effort to ensure
the timely realization of reunification of the motherland and for
the invigoration of the Chinese nation in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total retail sales
in June recorded a double-digit decline from a year earlier as
consumers were reluctant to spend in economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The value of total retail sales in June, estimated at 15.9
billion HK dollars (2 billion U.S. dollars), decreased by 16
percent compared with the same month of 1997, the Census and
Statistics Department released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
After discounting the effect of inflation, total retail sales
fell by 16 percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
Department stores were hit hardest, with sales slumping 29
percent in value and 30 percent in volume in June, while
supermarkets posted a two-percent gain in value of sales, and a
moderate 4 percent decline in volume.
</P>
<P>
Sales of clothing and footwear, motor vehicles, miscellaneous
consumer goods, jewelry, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts
all registered significant declines in the month.
</P>
<P>
Total retail sales in the first six months of 1998 decreased by
14 percent in value and 15 percent in volume compared with the
first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Monday that retail sales continued
to record a double-digit decline in June, mainly due to the
prevailing subdued consumer sentiment and the setback in inbound
tourism.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Accuses S. Africa of Behind-Curtain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of
Congo Monday accused South Africa of "behind-curtain manoeuvres",
saying a signal from a South African Airways (SAA) aircraft was
intercepted in its eastern town of Goma.
</P>
<P>
"We learnt yesterday (Sunday) evening from different reliable
sources that a South African airplane from SAA was intercepted by
our radios, asking for permission to land in Goma at around 6
p.m. (1700 GMT) yesterday," DRC Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo
said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"We informed the South African government and we are still
waiting for their explanation," Kongolo was quoted by South
African Press Association (SAPA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Congo believes that such behind-curtain manoeuvres are not
likely to bring peace in this country," he added.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Machiel van Niekerk
denied there was a South African plane in the Rwandan-held DRC
town.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, there is no such plane in Goma," he noted.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted government sources as saying that two South
African Air Force Boeing 707s were in Kinshasa to evacuate
Tanzanian military instructors caught between government troops
and rebels.
</P>
<P>
A military Hercules C130 also landed in Kinshasa Sunday night
to evacuate equipment. The Tanzanian troops were refusing to
leave without their equipment as they were afraid of looting.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo, who is in South Africa for peace talks with Ugandan
and Rwandan presidents, said the DRC would only engage in peace
talks after a complete and immediate withdrawal of Ugandan and
Rwandan troops from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"They must not only stop hostilities, but also withdraw their
troops without delay," he said. "In such a case, Congo commits
itself to refrain from attacking the withdrawing troops."
</P>
<P>
Kongolo said troops from Zimbabwe and Angola, sent to support
the DRC government, would not be asked to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are a legitimate government. We have the right to have any
troops that we want.
</P>
<P>
"Angola and Zimbabwe are part of that right. They are there
because we invited them to come. They will go when we agree with
them that they go."
</P>
<P>
Kongolo said the two countries had helped to bring Rwanda and
Uganda closer to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
"It was important that Rwanda and Uganda felt Congo was not
alone, Congo has friends who can come and help, so that they can
think twice about their position. I believe that they thought
twice."
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Sunday
called for a ceasefire and troop standstill in the DRC, saying
this was approved by all role players who attended the SADC
emergency summit in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo said the DRC had made it clear during the discussions
that a ceasefire meant a complete and immediate withdrawal of
Ugandan and Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
"This definition went without protest from the countries
present at the meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo said it was now up to South African President Nelson
Mandela as SADC chairman, and the Organization of African Unity
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, to put in place steps to
effect a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had talked to Salim Monday morning and would
speak to him again soon.
</P>
<P>
He said no time should be lost in bringing about a ceasefire
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo said the rebels were believed to be on their way to
Matadi, a few hundred kilometers away from the capital, Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Reversion of Stand on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu denied Monday that he has given up his demand
that the Palestinian National Council (PNC) convene to annul the
clauses of the Palestinian Covenant that call for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by his office in Jerusalem, Netanyahu
stressed that any agreement with the Palestinians was contingent
upon the annulment of parts of the Palestinian Covenant.
</P>
<P>
The statement disclosed that Netanyahu discussed this issue
with the U.S. President Bill Clinton last week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office issued the statement after local daily
Haaretz reported Monday that Netanyahu has for the first time
officially reversed his stand on revising the Palestinian
Covenant.
</P>
<P>
It said the concession was contained in a document that was
conveyed in the past few days by Netanyahu's senior adviser and
attorney Yitzhak Molcho to Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled since
early last year mainly due to the dispute over the scope of
Israeli second troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly accepted the 13.1 percent pullback plan
put forward by the U.S., but it demands the Palestinian side agree
to turn 3 percent of West Bank into natural reserves and that the
PNC amend the Palestinian Covenant before signing an agreement.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom to Deploy New Internet Billing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China's largest public
telecommunications service provider, China Telecom, will launch a
new Internet billing system in September.
</P>
<P>
The system will be jointly developed by China Telecom and the
world's computer software giant, Microsoft Corp. A cooperation
agreement was recently signed between the Data Communication
Bureau of China Telecom and Microsoft (China) Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye Yongdong, a senior Data Communication Bureau
engineer in charge of the project, the new billing operation will
be designed on the Microsoft Commercial Internet System (MCIS) 2.0
platform, which was launched last week in Beijing, and on Windows
NT.
</P>
<P>
The billing system is expected to have the capacity of
authentication of billing on access and information
interfaces, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom will market the system on China Net and among
Internet service providers (ISP).
</P>
<P>
Officials say this joint development program is part of the
implementation of the framework agreement between China Telecom
and Microsoft signed in March.
</P>
<P>
The framework pact was aimed at facilitating China Internet
and Intranet services. And aside from the billing system project,
the agreement encompasses joint development of China Telecom
Internet Explorer, and exchange of Internet related technologies.
</P>
<P>
The newly introduced MCIS 2.0 is a group of server applications
designed to make it easier for Internet commercial service
providers to deploy virtual networking and surfing, administrate
Internet, Intranet and commercial websites, and provide
telecommunications service such as e-mail, news releasing and
NetMeeting.

BONN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
Monday he was confident that Russian Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin will push through the necessary reforms to stem the
financial crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The chancellor has stressed that he trusts Chernomyrdin, whom
he and the German government know well and appreciate through many
years of good cooperation," said Kohl's spokesman, Otto Hauser,
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Kohl is confident that Chernomyrdin will push through the
necessary decisions given the dramatic and serious situation in
Russia," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Apparently under the increasing pressure of a financial crisis,
Yeltsin earlier on Sunday suddenly sacked the entire cabinet of
Sergei Kiriyenko and named former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, who was fired just five months ago, as Acting Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has asked the Russian State Duma, the lower house of

Cheong Monday called upon ASEAN members to work together in their
efforts to tide over the current regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his message of greetings to the 19th ASEAN
Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO) General Assembly opened in

order to remain relevant in a world of globalized markets and
remain committed to economic liberalization and achieve
integration by fully implementing the AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade
Area).

<P>
The president also asked the parliamentarians to help keep
ASEAN fundamental principles and goals, to rally support for ASEAN
and promote strong personal ties and network among ASEAN current
and future leaders.

<HEADLINE> Large Power Stations Planned For Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A number of large power
stations, many much larger than the existing one, will be built
on the Yangtze River in the next century.
</P>
<P>
One of the projected facility will be on the upper reaches of
the Jinsha River, a tributary of the Yangtze, and will have a
designed capacity of 12 million kw.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Ertan Hydropower Station, located on the
Yalong River, a tributary of the Yangtze, is China's largest to be
completed in this century. With a designed capacity of 3.3 million
kw, the facility has gone into partial operation here in
Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Ertan facility is often cited as a good example of
introducing international bidding, and the future projects will most
probably follow the Ertan example, experts say.
</P>
<P>
On another section of the Jinsha River, another huge plant with
a designed capacity of 5.2 million kw will be constructed.
</P>
<P>
On the Dadu River, also a Yangtze tributary, a 3.3 million kw
facility, the same size as the Ertan plant, is projected. An
estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people will have to be relocated to
pave the way for the project.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, over 20 more power stations will be built on the
Yalong River, the largest with a capacity of 3.6 million kw,
also larger than the Ertan facility.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the Jinsha, Yalong and Dadu rivers, all
at the upper reaches of the Yangtze, have a combined water reserve
of over 120 million kw, accounting for one fourth of the country's
total. At present, only five million kw have been tapped.
</P>
<P>
The completion of these facilities will enable the power grids
of southwest, eastern and northern China to become connected,
helping the country end its history of electricity shortages,, and
substantially reducing the threat of flooding, according to
experts.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Government Hopes Further Talks with NLD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government hopes
sincerely to continue meetings with the National League for
Democracy (NLD), according to an official information sheet issued
here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The information sheet said that the government encourages the
NLD to join in a meaningful discussion, and to avoid actions that
would disrupt national peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
"The Myanmar government noted with concern the decision by the
NLD to convene a national parliament. Such an action by any
individual political party would be in contravention of Myanmar
law, and seems designed to derail the ongoing discussions between
the government and the NLD," it said.
</P>
<P>
Last talks between NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe and First Secretary
of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt took place on last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the government's view that those talks marked the
beginning of a period of conciliation, cooperation and mutual help
in building a better future for the people of Myanmar," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
"The government would be disappointed if radical and
provocative actions by NLD leaders made further discussions
impossible," it added.
</P>
<P>
"During the current economic crisis in Asia, it is more
important than ever for all Myanmar citizens to work together for
the good of the people, rather than to play politics," it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, the NLD leaders set a deadline for a demand to the
ruling SPDC to convene a national parliament within 60 days, but
the government made no response to it.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the NLD on August 21, the
NLD will convene a national parliament in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Israel Tightens Security in All Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Monday tightened
security in all airports where international airlines are landing
and taking off in a bid to prevent terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the measure was taken after receiving the
warning issued by militant Islamic groups that they would attack
U.S. and Israeli airports and other strategic places, including
bombing foreign airlines in Israel, to avenge the U.S. missile
attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the U.S. launched cruise missile strikes at
suspected targets of Islamic militants in Sudan and Afghanistan,
who were believed to have carried out the August 7 twin bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed over 250
people and wounded 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the closest ally for the U.S., is one of a few
countries that have voiced strong support to the strikes. But most
of the Arab and Islamic countries gave denounced or expressed
reservation over the U.S. air strikes, terming them as provocative
actions against the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
At the busy Ben Gurion International Airport, security checks
were beefed up while all baggage were searched thoroughly. All
passengers, particularly those from Arab and Islamic countries,
were strictly questioned by the airport security staff.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Airport Authority said that the security measures had
also been taken for foreign airlines at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel is taking preventive security measures at
all strategic targets in the country to prevent possible
terrorist attacks.

KATHMANDU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Lower House of Nepali
Parliament Monday passed by a majority the budget for 1998-99
fiscal year which began in mid-July as Prime Minister Girija

MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines coconut exports
this year are expected to equal last year's 1.8 million metric
tons despite the El Nino and La Nina weather phenomena, an
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Coconut Authority Deputy Administrator Norberto
Boceta said that coconut is not as affected as other crops by the
lingering drought caused by the El Nino and the arrival of the La
Nina which brings about devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
"Production would go down either in the latter part of the year
or in the early part of 1999, but the figures (for exports) I have
up to July still look good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's coconut exports target took into
consideration of the January-July exports which have already gone
up to 1.3 million metric tons, up by 21 percent from the year-ago
level.
</P>
<P>
In terms of value, exports earnings also rose by 15 percent
from 482 million pesos (11.2 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 556
million pesos (12.9 million dollars) during the period.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the largest coconut exporter in Southeast
Asia and one of the biggest in the world.

holder Kieren Perkins said in Sydney on Monday that a recent
illness has disrupted his preparation plan for next month's
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Perkins, an Olympic swimming gold medallist, has been hit by
an influenza, which may affect the defence of his Commonwealth
Games 1,500 meters freestyle title.
</P>
<P>
The swimmer, who missed training last week, said: "The biggest
problem we've got at the moment is that if I get back into it too
hard, too fast, I could have a relapse."
</P>
<P>
Perkins set the existing world record for 1,500 meters when he
won the 1994 Commonwealth Games title in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Perkins will travel to Perth on Tuesday to join the Australian
Commonwealth Games swimming team for three days of training.

<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) - Draft laws on land management
and the organization of village committees have been revised in
response to public opinion, according to a meeting attended by
members of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee
which opened today.
</P>
<P>
These are the first two draft laws published by the ninth NPC
Standing Committee to solicit public opinion. The revised drafts
were submitted to the legislature for further discussion today.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen changes were made to the draft law on land management
relating to the issues of building factories on farmland and land
distribution, among many others.
</P>
<P>
In response to letters from the public and advocacy from local
governments and legislators, the new laws increase the local
legislature's role in protecting farmland and supervising the
government's land management.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers wrote to the legislature that tighter controls
should be imposed on farmlands to prevent them from being
commercialized. Thus, a new amendment was added that the use of
farmland for industrial projects must be authorized by the
government.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan, Ugandan Troops Must Pull out of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) would only engage in peace talks after troops from
Rwanda and Uganda withdrew from the country, DRC Justice Minister
Mwenze Kongolo said Monday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said troops from Angola and Zimbabwe, who are supporting
the DRC government, would not be required to leave the country,
according to South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"We are a legitimate government, we have the right to have any
troops we want."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Angola sent troops and arms to support DRC
President Laurent Kabila against a rebel uprising allegedly
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Sunday
called for a ceasefire and troop standstill in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The SADC was holding an emergency summit in Pretoria to search
for a peaceful solution to the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo said a signal from a South African plane was
intercepted in Goma recently which reported that Goma was a
Rwandan-held part of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo said the DRC had informed the South African government
about the incident and was awaiting an explanation for the presence of
a South African aircraft over its territory.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo is in South Africa for talks with presidents of Rwanda
and Uganda. He was sent in Kabila's plane as Kabila was
reportedly ordered by his doctor to rest.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nornal life was paralyzed in
Bihar State of northern India as a strike organized by the
Rashtriya Janata Dal (National People's Party) began Monday
morning to protest against the raids of the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) on the State Chief Minister Rabri Devi's
residence.
</P>
<P>
CBI raided the Chief Minister's official residence and other
related places at the same time last Thursday to find out illegal
assets belonging to the Chief Minister's husband Laloo Yadav for
his alleged involved in a multi-crore fodder scam.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Draft Laws Amended In Response to Public Opinions (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
The new draft of the law on village committees, whose primary
aim is to safeguard the autonomy of villagers over their own
affairs, incorporates more suggestions put forward by the public
after it was published last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC Law Committee, because of the
participation of villagers, the procedures for village committee
elections and impeachment are now more detailed and easier to
enforce.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee told the legislators that many letters
differ on two major issues: relations between village committees
and local governments, and whether or not village committees
should be empowered to handle economic matters.
</P>
<P>
Some, mainly local government officials, said that township
governments should play a leadership role in relations with
village committees in order to increase the government's ability
to lead agriculture. The opposing side maintained that if village
committees are to be "led" by township governments, village
autonomy will only nominally exist.
</P>
<P>
The Law Committee agreed with the latter argument, and have
not accepted the "leadership" relations in the new draft, because
"it has not been found that village autonomy, practiced in China
for 10 years under the existing law, has in any way adversely
affected local government execution of its power according to law."
</P>
<P>
The existing law gave village committees the right to manage
collectively owned village economic entities. Some propose the
abolishment of this right, others insist on upholding it. The Law
Committee said that due to the complexity of the rural economy and
its position during this transitional period, the new draft will
retain the existing stipulations.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Hit New Low of More Than 12 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar hit the
downhill trail Monday, sliding under 58.00 U.S. cents for the
first time in more than 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The fall ignited market speculation of central bank
intervention in the foreign exchange market to prop up the ailing
domestic currency.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) appeared to be absent
from the market Monday, apparently content to monitor the
situation from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts reiterated the RBA's past comments that
intervention was only likely if trade became disorderly, rather
than the steady slow decline noted in recent weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
The addition of Russia's deepening crisis to the existing Asian
economic turmoil was sending the Australian dollar to a bottom of
57.79 U.S. cents that surpassed its previous 1998 low of 58.00
U.S. cents and marked the currency's lowest point since 1986.
</P>
<P>
On July 28, 1986 the Australian dollar tumbled to 57.10 U.S.
cents, the record post-float low for the currency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are now concerned that the Asian and Russian problems
will extend to emerging economies with severe and adverse impacts
on global growth and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar's link with the Japanese yen
has made a resurgence following a breakdown in the correlation
late last week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed trading here at 84.00 yen, from
84.03 previously and it was at 1.0449 German marks from 1.0564.

<HEADLINE> Upper House Speaker Backs Chernomyrdin's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of Russian upper
house of parliament on Monday expressed his support for President
Boris Yeltsin's nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is a constitutional right of Russian president to appoint
and sack chiefs of cabinet," Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the
Federation Council, said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was appointed acting premier after Yeltsin sacked
the entire cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko Sunday night amid a
serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet "should be formed on a basis of accord and
stability in society", Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Yeltsin telephoned speaker of the lower house
of parliament on the establishment of a tripartite conciliation
commission.
</P>
<P>
The conciliation commission, to be composed of the government,
now under Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Duma and the Federation
Council, or upper house of parliament, was to develop an
anti-crisis program, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying that he had authorized
Chernomyrdin to discuss the content of the program and cabinet
line-up on behalf of the executive authority, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's offer of a conciliation commission was believed to be
a gesture of peace to lawmakers, especially hostile deputies of
the opposition factions in the Duma, who only last Friday passed a
resolution urging Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
News of Chernomyrdin's authority on personnel matters had
emerged earlier Monday. Some reports said that the 60-year-old
Chernomyrdin had set this as a precondition for his return to
government.
</P>
<P>
About five months ago, Chernomyrdin's cabinet was abruptly
fired by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
As debate over composition of the new cabinet intensified,
Chernomyrdin held meetings with leaders of various factions of the
State Duma in an effort to rally support.
</P>
<P>
However, Chernomyrdin said he would only announce the new
cabinet line-up after the State Duma approved his nomination of
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting Chernomyrdin Monday afternoon, Yeltsin also
held what was described as "working meetings" with the acting
ministers of defense, interior and the acting head of the Federal
Security Service, the presidential press service said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- At the Fourth Meeting of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
here this morning, Vice-Chairman Zou Jiahua showed video tapes to
demonstrate the serious pollution problems in the seas along
China's coasts.
</P>
<P>
At 10:45 a.m. Zou stood at a rostrum in the Great Hall of the
People. Instead of delivering a speech, Zou said, "I would like to
have a video tape played for you to show the marine pollution."
</P>
<P>
Zou was to deliver a report to the NPC Standing Committee on
the implementation of China's Law on Marine Environment
Protection.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time China's top legislature watched a
video tape before their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 15-minutes show, the 137 members of the NPC
Standing Committee including the chairman and vice-chairmen were
captivated by the scenes of increasing pollution on the seas.
</P>
<P>
On the bottom of the sea at Jiaozhou Bay there is no longer any
marine life; a dyeing enterprise in Shanghai is pouring black
sewage into the East China Sea; a beach at Dapeng Bay in the South
China Sea has become a waste area under pollutants from five
dyeing mills in Shenzhen City.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that since 1983 when China's Law on Marine Environment
Protection was promulgated, China has achieved progress in laws
concerning the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, in some places marine pollution was
getting worse and laws were being ignored.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the worsening ocean environment along the coasts
has led to frequent environmental calamities.
</P>
<P>
"Ocean pollution has hindered economic and social
development in the coastal areas and constitutes a threat to
people's health," he said.
</P>
<P>
One member said that the video show helped him learn more about
the polluted situation on the seas along China's coasts and that
it was more persuasive than a report.

bearing U.S. markings was found Saturday near Basima, Kharan
district, Baluchistan province in northwestern Pakistan, two local

</P>
<P>
The Nation said that people in the village, about 10 kilometers

The report said that the news of cruise missile spread like a

Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The projectile was found on Saturday, two days after the U.S.
fired cruise missiles at alleged terrorist targets in Afghanistan
bordering the Baluchistan province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another newspaper The Dawn said that local
authorities have ordered a massive evacuation as a precautionary
measure. The nearest resident settlement is just 12 kilometers

DAR ES SALAAM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has instructed its military training team in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to stop its training mission
to avoid becoming embroiled in conflict in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is on an official visit in Denmark, has admitted
that Tanzania has a few soldiers in the DRC whose assignment was
to train the national army of the central African country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the National Danish News Agency Sunday,
Mkapa said Tanzanian soldiers have stopped training the DRC army,
because Tanzania does not want to be drawn into the conflict
militarily, local newspapers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, did not say whether or when the
Tanzanian soldiers will move back, or what they will be doing in
the DRC if they stay there.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa commended the efforts made by South African President
Nelson Mandela in bringing all parties involved in the conflict
to the negotiation table and expressed Tanzania's resolve to work
relentlessly for a political solution to the current volatile
situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out a consensus on a regional military
intervention, saying the priority should be an immediate
ceasefire irrespective of which army is involved. He said this
will be in the interest of regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who said the situation in the DRC is very worrisome,
once again cautioned that there will be no military solution to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania will stretch its resources to the limit to
pursue peace and stability in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president discounted allegations that there is rivalry
between South Africa and Zimbabwe and that the conflict might
lead to the collapse of the Southern African Development
Community.
</P>
<P>
There was no rivalry between South Africa and Zimbabwe, he
said, adding Tanzania is prepared to work with either of them to
reach a negotiated political settlement in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa's remarks came after Zimbabwe, which has sent troops to
bolster DRC President Laurent Kabila's forces on the western
front, boycotted a SADC meeting in South Africa called by Mandela
to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
As the war between the rebel troops and the government is
escalating in the DRC, more than 500 refugees from the country
have fled into the Kigoma Region in west Tanzania since August 5.

<HEADLINE> Measures to Slow Deforestation Discussed in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The first substantive session of
the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests began here Monday to
discuss measures to slow deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day meeting of the forum will also try to have
background talks on possible elements and work toward consensus on
international mechanisms, such as a legally binding instrument to
be decided in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
Since the creation of the United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Forests in 1995 after the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro, governments agreed on over 135 proposals for action
towards sustainable forest management.
</P>
<P>
How to put those proposals into action and track progress will
be among top items to be discussed at the meeting of the new
forum, which was established in June, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among the key action proposals to be discussed at the forum are
national forest programs, criteria and indicators, trade and
environment, and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Deforestation continued in the 1990s although reports prepared
for the forum session show significant progress since the Earth
Summit, both in improving national forest planning at the country
level, and in increasing international coordination.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the world lost an average of 11.3
million hectares of net forest area annually, an area roughly the
size of Honduras, according to the Worldwatch Institute, based on
data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.

<HEADLINE> NPC to Pass Bill Prohibiting Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A bill on the prohibition of
landmines and laser blinding weapons was presented today for
approval to the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the State Council, vice-minister of foreign
affairs Zhang Deguang gave a detailed explanation at the meeting
of the reasons China should approve the Revised Provision
of Landmine Protocols and the Protocol of Prohibition of Use of
Laser Blinding Weapons, which are additional protocols to the
Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons signed in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the two protocols embody the attention
paid by the international community to humanitarianism, and the
protocols' contents do not go against relevant laws in China.
</P>
<P>
"The approval of the two protocols helps to safeguard China's
image in world peace, and accords with the demands of the country's
diplomacy and foreign policy and with the interests of its
national defence," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China signed the Convention on Prohibition or Restriction on
the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons in September 1981, which
so far has 57 member states, and approved the treaty and its
three additional protocols in March 1982.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Increases in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)
recorded an improved inflow of foreign direct investment
totalling 9.5 million U.S. Dollars in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the NSE said the figure represents an
increase of 64 percent compared with the corresponding period of
last year, the Business Corcord reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the NSE, the half year report noted, Nigerian companies
raised a total of 84.5 million Dollars through the issuance of
new shares as against 14.3 million Dollars in the first half of
last year.
</P>
<P>
NSE's Assistant Director General Alhaji Rasak Oladejo told the
newspaper that the political climate in the country was hazy
during the review period but high returns have continued to
attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
However, the value of share transaction at the NSE dropped
from 69 million Dollars to 63 million Dollars while market
capitalization declined from 3.3 billion Dollars at the end of
March to 3.1 billion Dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The fall in value of share transaction and depression on the
market capitalization have been attributed to losses in share
prices which was fueled by poor corporate earnings and dim
expectations for the future, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the NSE all-share index fell by 8.5 percent in the
first half to 5892.05 in contrast to a growth of 21 percent from
January to June last year, the NSE report said.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the all-share index, it added, was a reflection of
the "negative market response to declining corporate earnings and
the cash flow problems of investors."
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of NSE, Oladejo noted that "foreign portfolio
investors were not encouraged by the uncertainty in the political
environment and the lack of modalities for implementing the
proposed privatization program."

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Sharply Down as World Markets Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Weakness in key overseas equity
markets and a softening Australian dollar combined to push the
local sharemarket sharply lower Monday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed down 33.2 points at 2601.8,
with buyers largely sidelined in a nervous environment brought on
by outbreaks of strife in emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
After Wall Street's drop on Friday, weak European markets and a
sharp fall in Japan contributed to the negative sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"We're just taking a lead from the overseas markets once again
and also the dollar was very weak which will worry the markets,"
Sam Panetta from Shaw Stockbroking said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index finished 59.3 points lower at 4596.4.
</P>
<P>
Insurance major AMP was 34 cents lower after announcing a
half-year net profit, and competitor National Mutual plummeted 19
cents as the market responded to Friday's late announcement of a
forecast sharp drop in investment earnings by its Hong Kong listed
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed 12.1 points down at 987.9 with
commodity prices broadly weaker.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was 19.5 points weaker at 964.5 as the bullion
price slipped 0.90 U.S. dollar per ounce to 283.90.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 210.84 million shares traded at a value of just
639.25 million Australian dollars (370.76 million U.S. dollars),
with falls bettering rises by 705 to 323.

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Opens With Five PMs Absent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The annual South Pacific Forum
opened Monday in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) with the
prime ministers of five major members absent from the summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The forum is scheduled to discuss an economic action plan aimed
at helping the struggling island members ease their dependency on
aid and develop sustainable economies, the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) reported Monday from Pohnpei, Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
Australia has made clear its objection to a proposal for a
South Pacific free trade area, and is instead proposing all
nations in the region to lower tariffs in a non-discriminatory
manner.
</P>
<P>
The forum groups Australia, New Zealand, Cook Islands, FSM,
Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG),
Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and
Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
The AAP report said this year's forum was undermined by the
absence of leaders from virtually all the major members, including
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, and the prime ministers of
New Zealand, PNG, Solomon Islands and Samoa.
</P>
<P>
The absence of the leaders made many observers question the
long term future of the annual meeting of South Pacific leaders,
which is now in its 28th year.
</P>
<P>
However, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who is
representing Howard at this year's summit, insists that Australia
has no intention of abandoning forum members, who receive 270
million U.S. dollars of Australian aid every year. Australia is
the second largest aid provider to these members after Japan.
</P>
<P>
"They are in our backyard, and ... they are very important to
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
A joint Australia-New Zealand plan for a South Pacific whale
sanctuary, which is reportedly opposed by Japan, has angered many
smaller island members attending the meeting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Australia Monday also unveiled an aid program to help South
Pacific governments deal with the Year 2000 computer bug problem.

SEOUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Defense Ministry
announced Monday that the Armed Forces Athletics Corps and the
Nursing Academy will be disbanded in the next few years as part of

</P>
<P>
The sports unit will stop enlisting athletes in October this
year and will be disbanded in the year 2000.

and more than 400 officers, soldiers and civilian employees, won
five medals in the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics and two in the 1992
Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Nurse Academy, set up 1967, will stop
recruiting new members next year. After it is closed down in
2003, the Defense Ministry plans to recruit nurses from nursing
colleges.

The Defense Ministry also said that five military hospitals in
Pochon, Masan, Chinhae and Pohang and three other mobile Army
surgical hospitals will be deactivated in the next two years.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Seleznev Hold Telephone Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday telephoned Gennady Seleznev, speaker of the State Duma
(lower house of the parliament) on the set-up of a tripartite
conciliation commission, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The conciliation commission, to be composed of the government
now under Viktor Chernomyrdin, the State Duma and the Federation
Council, or upper house of parliament, was to develop an
anti-crisis program, Yeltsin's Spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had authorized Chernomyrdin to
discuss the content of the program and cabinet line-up on behalf
of the executive authority.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's offer of a conciliation commission was believed to be
a gesture to seek peace with lawmakers, especially hostile
deputies of the opposition factions in the State Duma, who only
last Friday passed a resolution urging Yeltsin to step down
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
News on Chernomyrdin's authority on personnel matters had
already emerged earlier on Monday. Some reports said that the
60-year-old Chernomyrdin had set this as a precondition for his
return to government.
</P>
<P>
About five months ago, Chernomyrdin's cabinet was dismissed by
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
As activities heat up over composition of the new cabinet,
Chernomyrdin held meetings with leaders of various factions of the
State Duma in an effort to rally support.
</P>
<P>
However, Chernomyrdin said he would only announce the roster of
the new cabinet after the State Duma approved his nomination as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting Chernomyrdin on Monday afternoon, Yeltsin also
held what was described as "working meetings" with the acting
defense, interior ministers, and acting head of the Federal
Security Service, the presidential press service said.

of the new Cabinet," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, it was said that the State Duma has decided to entrust
parliamentary speaker Gennady Seleanyov to request the president
to withdraw the nomination of Chernomyrdin to the post of prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Yeltsin said on Monday
that the appointment of Chernomyrdin is a sign of continuity of
government ahead of the elections in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also called on the parliament, regional leaders, and
the citizens "to understand and support" his decision to appoint
Chernomyrdin as the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is currently holding talks with ex-Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and is expected to meet for consultations with
Grigory Yavlinsky, who leads the Yabloko faction, and Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democratic faction.
</P>
<P>
The acting prime minister said that he wants "to hear
proposals of leaders of the Duma factions, including on personnel
issues."

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Nominated, Shaping Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin met leaders of various factions in the State
Duma Monday morning in an effort to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Nomination for his premiership has already been submitted to
the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, by President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Chernomyrdin, who replaced Sergei Kiriyenko
only five months after Yeltsin fired him, is expected to face a
hostile Duma in terms of his confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party, the largest opposition faction in the
lower house, and the Agrarian and People's Power groups, have
already voiced their opposition.
</P>
<P>
They have asked Yeltsin to withdraw Chernomyrdin's nomination,
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He again demanded that Yeltsin step down. "As long as Yeltsin
remains in power, no reshuffling will lead the country out of the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Before accepting Yeltsin's offer, Chernomyrdin had set the
condition that he be given the authority to shape the cabinet's
line-up, the local Ekho Moskvy radio station reported, quoting a
source close to Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, barely four months in office, met news of his ouster
Sunday night calmly, thanking his aides and made a telephone call
to U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
He had already turned down an offer by Yeltsin to remain in the
government as a first deputy prime minister, the Itar-Tass
reported, quoting a government source.
</P>
<P>
The government shake-up sent the weak ruble to a new low of
7.14 rubles to the U.S. dollar on the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange (MICEX).
</P>
<P>
Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov had predicted "important news"
later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who held closed-door meeting with Chernomyrdin, told
the nation that the move to bring down the Kiriyenko cabinet was
to ensure the stability and normalcy of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Yeltsin said he had
discussed the line-up of the new cabinet with Chernomyrdin.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Heads for U.S. to Meet King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh left here Monday morning for Washington to meet King
Hussein to report on the work schedule of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Tarawneh on his U.S. trip was Jawad Anani, the new
chief of Royal Court, which is a powerful body in charge of the
royal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh, former chief of the Royal Court, took over last
Thursday the premiership from Abdul Salam Majali, who resigned to
take responsibility for the worsening economic situation and a
water pollution in the capital in July.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein has been hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester in Minnesota State, since July to treat the cancer in his
lymphatic tissue with chemotherapy. He ordered the government
reshuffle from his hospital bed in the U.S. last week.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the king finished his second session of
chemotherapy and went to Washington for recuperation.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh, in his first public address since the formation of
his government, said on Saturday that he and his colleagues would
do their best to restore the people's confidence in the government
by improving its administration of political, economic and
diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to ensure the transparency of government work, reform
a stagnant economy, streamline a bloated civil administration,
curb unemployment, combat poverty and develop relations with the
Arab countries and other nations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that domestic issues, mainly the economic reform,
would top the agenda of the 23-member cabinet, which was dominated
by technocrats and leading economists.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh, himself a United States-educated economist, has
appointed several leading economists to lead the ministries of
finance, planning and development affairs.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Development Affairs Tahir Kan'an is a
development economist and former minister of planning.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mishail Marto was former deputy governor
of the Central Bank and has played an active role in helping the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank implement their
10-year economic restructuring program in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
And Minister of Planning Nabeel Ammari, who once led the
Jordanian delegation that negotiated Jordan's entry into the
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Agreement, has been in charge of
negotiating Jordan's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
With such an efficient team and the economic reform-oriented
agenda, Tarawneh intends to realize a 6 percent economic growth so
to curb unemployment, combat poverty and improve people's living
standard.

<HEADLINE> Antique Furniture Repaired in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Dilapidated old furniture, most
dating back to the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties, are taking on the look of their original features after
being renovated by the Beijing Inlaid Gold Lacquer Ware Plant.
</P>
<P>
The plant has repaired more than 1,000 pieces of antique
furniture by taking advantage of a technique from the Chinese
imperial palace workshop.
</P>
<P>
The furniture are made of a variety of materials such as camphor,
cypress, elm and China fir, and includes beds, cabinets, painted
screens, cases, and tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the pieces were useless before being repaired, paint
peeled off and falling apart.
</P>
<P>
The antique furniture were gathered from all over the country,
some of it from the remains of old houses or even discarded as
junk..
</P>
<P>
The plant collected the furniture and shipped them back to
Beijing where craftsmen do the repair work.
</P>
<P>
Antique furniture are popular on both the domestic and
international markets including the United State, Canada, Britain,
France, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Dredges Urban Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua)-- Beijing citizens soon may have
the romance of sailing on the Changhe River in the western part of
the city, just like Parisians enjoy the Seine.
</P>
<P>
This could become a reality when the dredging of the Changhe
River is completed at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 5.5-kilometer-long Changhe River begins at the Miyun
Reservoir Canal in the western suburbs of Beijing and flows into
the North City Moat, passing Purple Bamboo Court Park, the
Five-Pagoda Temple, the Beijing Zoo and the Beijing Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
Due to sewage pollution, some parts of the river were less than
five meters wide, and the banks were overgrown and covered by
weeds and rubbish. More than 40 sewage pipes turned the river into
a putrid gutter.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the city government invested one billion yuan
to improve the city rivers, including the Changhe River and the
Imperial Palace Moat.
</P>
<P>
The Changhe River, connecting with the Miyun Canal, will become
a 20-kilometer prime water course for sightseeing from the Summer
Palace to the Jade Abyss Pool Park, after it regains its former
purity.
</P>
<P>
The water surface then will be more than 30 meters wide,
enough for large boats carrying 30 to 50 passengers to sail along.
</P>
<P>
But the responsible authorities haven't shown much interest in
boating. The Beijing Tourism Bureau worries that the river will
be crowded by motorized boats if water-based sightseeing is
permitted.
</P>
<P>
Boating between the Summer Palace and the Jade Abyss Pool Park
began four years ago, but came to a premature end because of such
problems.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the city rivers and lakes said that
the noise and pollution caused by motorized boats are problems
which must first be solved.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Higher Adoption Standards for Foreigners (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doje said countries throughout the world attach great attention
to transnationals adoptions, and noted that rigorous stipulations
are not only in full accord with international practices, but will
also provide greater protection for adopted children.
</P>
<P>
He said the purposed relaxing restrictions on domestic
adoptions are to provide more orphans with access to family warmth
and ensure healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
The existing law on adoption placed excessive restrictions on
people who are fully capable and willing to adopt children, and
prolonged overcrowding in government institutions for orphans and
handicapped minors, according to Doje.
</P>
<P>
"Welfare institutions are less than ideal places to promote the
healthy growth of unfortunate children because of poor living
conditions and the lack of family warm," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The existing law stipulates that people seeking to
adopt must be childless, and can only adopt one orphaned or
handicapped child. The new draft excludes the limitation that
requires people to be childless or to adopt only one child.
</P>
<P>
The draft also lowers the minimum age required for adopting
people from 35 to 30, and removes restrictions on people unable
to bear a child. It also permits some people to adopt children
over the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that all domestic adoptions be registered
with the government, and notes relationships take effect upon
registration and are protected by law.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Party Leadership in Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The draft law has been submitted to the nation's highest
legislature for deliberation during a six-day session which opened
today.
</P>
<P>
The law was revised in response to suggestions legislators and
localities tabled during previous legislative sessions, said Qiao
Xiaoyang, vice chairman of the NPC Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of institutions of higher education is to train
talented specialists and thus was extremely to strengthen Party
leadership," said Qiao, noting that universities successfully
carried out "the presidential responsibility system" under the
leadership of Party committees for many years.
</P>
<P>
The revision empowers Party committees in universities and
colleges to "determine operational procedure and leaders for
internal organizations, and to discuss and decide major issues
concerning the reform, development and fundamental management
system of the institutions."
</P>
<P>
Committees will also be responsible for "enforcing the
policies and guidelines of the Chinese Communist Party, ensuring
adherence to the socialist educational orientation and leading
work related to political, ideological and moral education."
</P>
<P>
University presidents are "responsible for all work related to
teaching, scientific researches and other administrative work,"
according to the draft law.
</P>
<P>
Their duties include formulating development programs,
university bylaws, developing and enforcing annual plans,
recommending candidates for various posts, including vice
presidents, hiring or firing staff, and rewarding or punishing
students.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest revision will not apply to nongovernmental
universities which have "more complicated internal management
systems," said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
He said the revision also includes a stipulation encouraging
more nongovernmental institutions of higher education to improve
programs to train the young generation.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Monday after the political uncertainty in Russia and fears of a
potential financial crisis in Latin America sent stock prices
lower around the globe last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged 309.84 points, or 2.03
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 14,988.36, falling
below 15,000 for the first time in a week.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all First
Section issues, lost 18.21 points or 1.55 percent to 1,158.30.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section dropped to an estimated 310
million shares from Friday's 358.16 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan was the day's most heavily
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell sharply in Tokyo from the beginning of trading
following the gloom at the end of last week in major world markets
including Frankfurt, London and New York, where shares all dropped
Friday on fears over Russia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Tokyo investors dumped large quantities of
export-oriented shares, rattled by the prospects of lower
corporate earnings due to these overseas developments.
</P>
<P>
Traders also noted that the crisis in emerging Asian markets
seems to have spread to South American countries including Chile,
Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outnumbered gainers by 900 to 210, with 150 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China's First Unified Contract Code Goes To Lawmakers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited contract draft,
five years in the making, was finally put before China's top
lawmakers here today.
</P>
<P>
With 441 articles, compared with the three existing with 140
articles, the new law will be the country's first unified law
governing all economic agreements, according to lawmakers of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu Kangsheng, deputy director of the Legislative Affairs
Committee of the NPC Standing Committee, explained the draft to
the legislature's fourth meeting, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, the new law is based on the three existing
contract laws, which deal separately with domestic economic
contracts, foreign trade contracts and technology contracts, as
well as court explanations relating to contract disputes over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
"As to the new issues surfacing in the course of the ongoing
economic reform of which China has no experience, more overseas
practices have been borrowed for this draft law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be more comprehensive and detailed and easier to
enforce," he added.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the three fragmented, incomplete and sometimes even
contradictory existing contract laws, the new law covers all
debtor-creditor relationships between equal entities, but excludes
economic management activities by the government and agreements on
marriage and adoption and custody, which will be defined by other
laws.
</P>
<P>
The draft sets five principles for legally enforceable
agreements: equality, mutual willingness, fairness, honesty and
credibility, and consistency with the law.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Anti-flood Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
cabinet, has sent a fact-finding group to Hunan Province, one of
the hardest-hit flood areas, for damage assessment and
rehabilitation preparations.
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by Zhou Yongkang, minister of Land and
Natural Resources, will focus on harnessing Dongting
Lake by giving up farmland in order to recover the lake area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 35 medical teams have been sent to Jalaid Banner
(County) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to treat more
than 25,000 sick farmers and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 11,000-square-kilometer Banner was
inundated, and more than 10,000 households lost their
crops and houses. The local government raised 20 million yuan to
provide its 260,000 affected people with food and other
necessities.
</P>
<P>
In Heilongjiang Province, railway workers and soldiers are
working to restore traffic to the suspended Harbin-Manzhouli
Railway, which is part of the first Eurasian Continental Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Qiqihar City along the Nenjiang River has so far used over 12
million sandbags, 21.1 tons of iron wire, and 8,642 cubic meters
of lumber to fight four flood crests.
</P>
<P>
Affected areas in Chongqing Municipality on the upper reaches
of the Yangtze River are busy rush-harvesting their ripe
crops. Flood and mud-flows in this area have claimed more than 370
lives this year and affected nearly 20 million people, resulting
in some 7 billion yuan in direct losses.

<P>
The new law details procedures for contract signing, validity,
and enforcement, responsibility for breaking contracts, and
contract supervision.
</P>
<P>
To prevent contract-related fraud and protect the interests of
creditors, the draft empowers creditors with the right to
terminate a contract if it is discovered that the other side is
intending to cheat or is not able to discharge the terms of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
Creditors are also entitled to the subrogation right of claim
and the right to appeal to the court to cancel debtor transactions
such as free giveaways intended to avoid paying creditors, the
draft says.
</P>
<P>
Contracts shall be invalid if they are drawn up out
fraudulently, with coercion, or by taking advantage of the other
side's precarious position which go against the real intent of
that side; or if the contract conspires to violate the interests
of the state, or a third party.
</P>
<P>
"As China is shifting the majority of its economy to the
market, a unified and comprehensive contract is urgently needed,"
another official from the Legislative Affairs Committee said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the great number of commodities and production
materials controlled by the state 20 years ago, there are now only
five such items: crude oil, oil products, petroleum, coal and
automobiles, which remain in the hands of the State Development
Planning Commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that more than four billion new contracts
are registered with government industry and commerce bureaus
each year, and Chinese courts handle three million contract
disputes annually.

<HEADLINE> 430,000 Lepers Cured in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Out of the 472,000 lepers
diagnosed in China from 1949 to 1997, 430,000 have been cured, and
there were only about 6,000 lepers in the country by the end of
1997, according to one expert.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiangsheng, who is associated with a national center for
the control of venereal diseases and leprosy under the Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences, said here today that the prevalence rate of
leprosy in China has fallen from 2 per 10,000 people in the 1960s to
the present 0.056 per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease, has a history of more
than 2,000 years in China, and was widely spread in China before
1949, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
After New China was founded in 1949, the Chinese government paid
great attention to the prevention and treatment of the
disease, and comprehensive measures have been taken and a leprosy
examination system has been set up nationwide, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set strict standards to eliminate the
disease, requiring all counties and cities to keep the
prevalence rate of leprosy under 0.1 per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 14 percent of all counties and cities have failed
to meet this requirement. Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region, and Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces have the highest
leprosy prevalence rate at present.
</P>
<P>
Chen estimated that those regions will be able to meet the
requirement by 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that China should pay more attention to
the social problems caused by the disease, and make an effort to
dispel fears and discrimination toward lepers.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Higher Adoption Standards for Foreigners (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China is considering more
rigorous qualifications for foreigners seeking to adopt Chinese
children in order to "ensure the maximum safety and protect the
interests of adoptees," according to Civil Affairs Minister Doje
Cering.
</P>
<P>
The government is also preparing to relax restrictions on
domestic adoptions since an increasing number Chinese families
have the economic means to support more children, according to
remarks the minister made when explaining the revisions to the
1992 Adoption Law during today's meeting of China's highest
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji has affixed his signature and the draft law
has been submitted to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The draft revision stipulates that foreigners seeking to adopt
Chinese children must first be approved by the government in their
home country, and must then submit valid legal documents to
related Chinese agencies, including health records and proof they
have "no criminal record."
</P>
<P>
Adoption petitions and the aforementioned documents must be
confirmed by diplomatic agencies or authorized departments in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Adoption procedures also require that parties involved in the
adopting sign a written agreement, register with the Chinese
government agency and have all documents authenticated by Chinese
notaries public.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Expel 25,000 Lebanese Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany has decided to expel a
total of 25,000 Lebanese refugees in the coming weeks, Lebanon's
Daily Star newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
These refugees include 15,000 Lebanese citizens, 5,000
Palestinians holding Lebanese travel documents and 5,000 Lebanese
Kurds, Hussein Bekdash, president of the League of Lebanese
Emigrants in Germany told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Some 16,000 Lebanese refugees will be deported in the first
wave, and the others will be expelled later, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bekdash is on a visit here to discuss the issue with Lebanese
officials.
</P>
<P>
During Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war, more than 110,000 Lebanese
fled the country and sought shelter in Germany as refugees.
</P>
<P>
The German government has demanded all the Lebanese refugees
without residence leave Germany since Lebanon's civil war has
ended, Bekdash said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has told
German officials that Lebanon is ready to accept all the
returning emigrants.
</P>
<P>
Germany has expressed willingness to provide aid in many
sectors to help the Lebanese government accommodate these
refugees, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Franz Rohrs, member of the German Lower Saxony parliament, is
in Beirut to see what kind of aid is needed.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has not sent any troops
to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to help the embattled
President Laurent Kabila in the fight with the Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by President Frederick Chiluba Sunday on
his arrival at the Lusaka International Airport from the one-day
emergency summit held in Pretoria, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to government-owned Times of Zambia published
Monday, Chiluba said no Zambian troops had been sent to DRC,
adding that all 14 members of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) represented were committed to securing a
peaceful resolution of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Zimbabwe, Angola and Zambia have sent
their troops to the DRC for a military intervention in the
country's three-week crisis in a bid to safeguard Kabila's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The rebels who claimed earlier to have controlled one third of
the territory said Sunday that they were within 30 kilometers of
Kinshasa, the capital city with five million people.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa said at the
weekend that the Zambian government had put in place stringent
measures to protect citizens from warring factions in its
northern neighbour.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambians had nothing to worry as the war in the DRC
was at the moment still confined to far flung areas.

<HEADLINE> Power Station Design to Ignore Logging Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA (Sichuan), August 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to
protect the environment by eliminating float channels for felled
timber from the design and construction of hydropower stations in
the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Reservoirs constructed in the area will no longer include float
channels for logs, according to Cheng Zhihua, vice president of
the Chengdu Survey and Design Research Institute under China
National Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, chief designer of the Ertan Hydropower Station, the
second largest domestic project of its kind following the massive
Three Gorges Project, said the the initial design for the station
including a float channel with an annual handling capacity for 1.1
million cu.m.. of timber.
</P>
<P>
"However, construction of the proposed 800 million yuan float
channel has been suspended as part of effort to protect the
environment," said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
The Ertan station is located on the Yalong River, a major
Yangtze tributary. The denudation of virgin forests in upstream
areas over the years has led to increasing devastation, with
statistics showing that some 500,000 cu.m. of timber has been
felled on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The research institute, the primary designer of power stations
in the upper reaches of the Yangtze, will abandon related design
practices, according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Experts note the serious erosion in the upper reaches of the
Yangtze has been a major factor contributing to this summer's
flooding along the river.
</P>
<P>
The State Council recently issued an emergency circular calling
for the expanded protection of primeval forests.

<HEADLINE> Tax Rebates Support Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT) show that related departments
handled export tax rebates totalling 4.3 billion yuan during July,
up 33.7 percent on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Total export tax rebates for the first seven months hit 20.4
billion yuan, up 9.7 percent over the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
SAT sources point out that the Asian financial crisis since
last July has a noticeable negative impact on China's exports. The
foreign trade value for the first seven months this year stood at
179.5 billion U.S. dollars, with exports for the period growing
at 6.9 percent to 103.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The SAT indicates that China's foreign trade system will faces
serious conditions in terms of fulfilling this year's 10 percent
growth target for exports. The central government has attempted to
reverse the declining trend with three increases in tax rebate
rates so far this year, while the SAT has attempted to promote
export growth by formulating a series of measures to accelerate
the processing of tax rebates.
</P>
<P>
China's tax departments processed export tax rebates totalling
18.6 billion yuan during the first seven months, or 33.6 percent
of the annual target and substantially below the figure for the
1997 period.

WELLINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- There were 106,540 visitor
arrivals in New Zealand in July, one percent more than in the same
month of last year, according to government statistics released
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
But for the whole year ending on July 1998, 1.459 million
people visited the country, down five percent from the previous
year's total of 1.542 million.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors from Asia during July this year totaled
27,240, a drop of 25 percent, or 9,090, compared with the same
month last year. About nine-tenths of this fall was due to a drop
in visitors from the Republic of Korea (down 8,000). However this
drop was more than offset by increases in visitors from Australia,
Britain and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During the month of July 1998 there was a turnaround in the
migration balance, registering a net loss of 430 permanent and
long-term migrants, compared with a gain of 1,020 in July 1997.
For the whole year ending on July this year, there was a net loss
of 990 permanent and long-term migrants, compared with the net
inflow of 15,870 migrants for the previous year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 New Zealanders
have
been saved, and 1,000 serious injuries prevented, on the roads
since the
government introduced its hard-hitting road safety package three
years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The package, incorporating graphic television advertisements,
compulsory breath testing, and speed cameras, had proved effective
in
lowering New Zealand's road toll, said a report, which was
submitted by a
number of road safety researchers and issued by the New Zealand
Ministry
of Transport Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the researchers advocate extending the hidden
speed
camera program, introducing demerit points for speed camera
offenses and
improving open road conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, reported Monday
that the
New Zealand Government is expected to issue shortly a discussion
document
on stricter enforcement of road safety regulations. The document
would
look at introducing demerit points for speed camera offenses,
tightening
up mobile phone use in vehicles, and reducing allowable alcohol
limits.
</P>
<P>
According to New Zealand official yearbooks, road accidents
resulted
in 582 fatalities and injuries to 16,870 other people, with 3,153
seriously injured in 1995. The figures were reduced to 514 killed
and
14,796 injured, including 2,939 seriously injured, in 1996.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China has introduced a series of
advanced technologies and equipment from the United States for the
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, which claim more lives than
any other diseases in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has more than 100,000 infants
suffering from congenital heart disease and in need of operations
every year. Over two million Chinese suffer from valvular heart
disease at present, and 150,000 to 200,000 patients need cardiac
valve replacements every year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many coronary patients are under the threat of
death because they cannot get timely operation.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are conducting a variety of
governmental and non-governmental technological and academic
exchanges to step up the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Starr-Wood Cardiac Group, the largest cardiac surgical
organization in the northwest the United States, and
Qingdao No.2 People's Hospital in east China have jointly set up

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Rejects PM Nominee for Fifth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy on Monday rejected for the fifth time the nomination of
Davaadorj Ganbold as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president last Saturday, the leadership of
the ruling union -- the Mongolian National Democratic Party and
Social Democratic Party -- nominated Davaadorj Ganbold for the
fifth time as prime minister, a presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, President Bagabandy again refused to submit the
nomination to the Great Hural (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Instead, the president still proposed the nomination of
Dogsomin Ganbold, a member of the Great Hural and the Mongolian
National Democratic Party, for the post, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Before this, the nomination of Davaadorj Ganbold, the chairman
of the Standing Committee of Economic Policy of the Great Hural,
had been rejected by President Bagabandy four times since he was
put forward by the ruling union this month.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy believed that Davaadorj Ganbold was responsible for
the country's intensified banking crisis, which led to the fall of
the former cabinet in July.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolia's law, the ruling party's parliamentary group
should discuss the nominees for prime minister with the president,
who in turn submits the nomination to the Great Hural for approval.
</P>
<P>
The ex-government led by Prime Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj was
dismissed on July 24 as a result of its decision in May to merge
the state-owned Renovation Bank with the private Golomt Bank.
</P>
<P>
The decision was repealed by the Great Hural in mid August.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy in Uganda to Move For Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States Embassy in
Uganda will move out of the city center for the sake of security
following bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on
August 7.
</P>
<P>
A report carried by the East African weekly said the movement
of the embassy was revealed by a highly-placed official in
Uganda's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the U.S. Information
Service told Xinhua in a telephone interview Monday that it could
not confirm the move.
</P>
<P>
The move is a long-term security measure taken by the embassy
in light of fresh terrorist warnings against the United States
around the globe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy and British High Commission share the same
building on the Parliament avenue in downtown Kampala, almost the
only foreign missions located in city center. Most of the
foreign embassies in Uganda are located in three other places
known as Kololo, Nakasero and Bugolobi.
</P>
<P>
Since the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam which are
reported to have killed 263 people and injured more than 5,000
others, security around the U.S. embassy here has been tightened.
</P>
<P>
The avenue on which the embassy is located has been closed to
traffic and no parking has been allowed near the embassy.
Patrolling policemen, government soldiers as well as U.S. marines
have been guarding the place.

<HEADLINE> AOC Wants Tougher Penalties for Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympic Committee
(AOC) president John Coates called Monday for tougher penalties
for importing and using performance enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The level of non-medical use of anabolic steroids is now
greater than heroin and cocaine and is estimated to be two
percent of the population," said Coates in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Coates said there was no doubt current penalties for dealing
with sports drugs were inadequate and criminal laws must be more
stringent to deter people from dealing in the drugs.
</P>
<P>
He called for legislative changes to raise the penalties for
making, importing, trafficking and use of the more serious drugs
in sport to the same level as for banned narcotics.

<HEADLINE> East Asia Urged to Jointly Safeguard Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday called upon East Asian economies to
undertake joint action to safeguard their own interests.
</P>
<P>
These economies have perhaps been too trusting to the point of
leaving themselves too open to the machinations and manipulations
of foreign speculators, he said at the opening of a five-day ASEAN
Inter-Parliamentary Organization conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"When they (foreign speculators) talk of friendship and
cooperation, we believe them without reservations," he said,
adding that because East Asian economies had no hidden agenda,
they also did not suspect that "anyone else had any of their own
and we allowed them to plot and scheme behind our backs."
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also finance minister, was of the view that East
Asian economies had been hurt because of certain excesses in a
free market system, excesses which had been overlooked amidst
these economies' desire to ensure rapid development of societies.
</P>
<P>
The East Asian economies and ASEAN countries need to have sober
and realistic assessments of the situation, taking into account
the interests of everyone, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the crisis in the region had given rise to internal
divisions within countries, as well as tensions and
misunderstandings among ASEAN members, which could only lead to
greater difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We need to acquire strength from national unity and regional
solidarity if we are to succeed. Our present difficulties must not
be allowed to destroy what we have diligently built for decades --
a truly peaceful and prosperous Southeast Asia," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Blaming commentators who had been quick to put the entire blame
on Asian governments for the present economic crisis, Anwar said,
"It is unfair, if not altogether unjust, simply to blame
governments of affected economies for the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the fundamental flaws in the global financial system
such as the unpredictability of the international capital market
and the destabilizing impact of short-term capital flows, as well
as the systemic fragility of the international monetary system
need to be remedied to avoid financial convulsions of increasing
severity.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that international financial institutions and
global hedge funds managers should adopt the same practices
imposed by international institutions on developing countries,
such as transparency and full disclosure.

<HEADLINE> India Sets Up Group to Handle European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Exchange Dealers
Association of India has set up a working group to draw up
guidelines for handling the euro, the common currency of the
European Monetary Union, by Indian banks, official sources said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group is also in the process of preparing an exhaustive
study on the implications of the euro on the Indian monetary
system.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to submit to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) its
set of recommendations on the guidelines of euro operations by the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are also expected to cover different issues
pertaining to simultaneous handling of euro accounts and accounts
in other European currencies by Indian banks.
</P>
<P>
Since the euro would emerge as a strong alternative to the U.S.
dollar, RBI would like to tap all the possible hedging mechanisms
for the euro to curb speculations in the future, the same sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The other issues which are being looked into by RBI in regard
to euro operations include forward and spot dealings in the euro.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Foreign Exchange Reserves Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserves, which saw a steady decline in the past few months,
showed signs of improvement this month, rising to 1.717 billion
U.S. dollars as of August 20 from 1.618 billion dollars at the end
of July.
</P>
<P>
The improvement was mainly a result of the country's prospering
garment industry and an improvement in its trade balance, a report
in The New Nation newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvement, the reserve levels continued to remain
inadequate, considering the country's narrow export base, heavy
dependence on imports for industrial investment and production and
vulnerability to natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
After reaching a record high of 3.07 billion dollars at the end
of June 1995, the nation's foreign exchange holdings dropped to
2.037 billion dollars at the end of June 1996 and further to 1.719
billion dollars at the end of June 1997, the report quoted
officials of the country's central bank, Bangladesh Bank, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency reserves continued to decline to 1.56
billion dollars in November 1997 before improving gradually to
1.82 billion dollars at the end of March 1998 and then falling
again to 1.74 billion dollars at the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserves were short of the
appropriate level as recommended by the International Monetary
Fund, which asks a country to retain foreign currencies equivalent
to three months' import payments, as Bangladesh's monthly import
bills usually amount to 650 million dollars and its present
reserves could roughly meet only two and a half months' import
bills, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Newspapers to Offer Sharp Discounts for Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The mass-circulation Thai Rath
and business newspaper Than Setthakij are planning major discounts
to attract advertisers to offset shrinking revenue, the
English-language Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time Thai Rath, the paper with the biggest
circulation in Thailand, has cut advertising charges by 30-50
percent, according to Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Than Setthakij plans to offer 40-percent discounts on
advertising soon.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an ad agency as saying media spending on
press advertisements plunged by 43 percent between January and May
this year, compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Rath advertising department source said the newspaper
usually offers 15-percent discounts to special clients only.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the 50-percent discount, clients must spend more
than 2 million baht (50,000 U.S. dollars) in one month. Those who
reserve pages will face a 10-percent surcharge if the
advertisements are canceled.
</P>
<P>
Thai Rath would extend payment periods from 15 to 30 days for
those spending 3 million baht (75,000 dollars) and to 60 days for
those spending 6 million baht (150,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, total spending on newspaper
advertisements declined by 43 percent from 4.36 billion baht (109
million dollars) to 2.48 billion baht (62 million dollars), mainly
because big customers, especially vehicle and property firms,
recorded slow sales.
</P>
<P>
Ad spending by property firms fell by 63 percent from 2.04
billion baht (51 million dollars) to 764 million (19.1 million
dollars), while car advertising was down by 59 percent from 768
million baht (19.2 million dollars) to 314 million baht (7.85
million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Pak Foreign Exchange Reserves Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's foreign exchange
reserves were reduced to 750 million U.S. dollars on August 22
from 817 million dollars on August 11, the newspaper The Frontier
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted official sources as saying the foreign
exchange reserves of 750 million dollars are enough to meet import
requirements of four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is striving hard to increase its
foreign exchange reserves to meet the import liabilities and its
foreign debt servicing, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The government is banking on the financial assistance from
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the sources said,
adding that assistance from the two countries was already in the
pipeline, but unfortunately, the U.S. missile attacks on
Afghanistan and Sudan had delayed this badly-needed assistance.
</P>
<P>
A total assistance of about 600 million dollars from the two
Muslim countries is expected.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan desperately needs 1 billion dollars ahead of the
second week of September, when the country's financial managers
expect a bailout package from the Islamic Development Bank as well
as the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
This South Asian nation has been on the verge of declaring a
moratorium on its external debt servicing commitments because of
the international economic sanctions imposed after its detonation
of nuclear devices at the end of May.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Keep Relations with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine should keep traditional
relations with Russia and actively cooperate with the members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Chairman of the
Supreme Soviet of Ukraine Alexandr Tkachenko said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tkachenko made the remarks when addressing a meeting
celebrating the Independence Day of Ukraine which falls on August
24.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine must live peacefully with all neighboring countries, he
said. To join European and international organizations does not
mean Ukraine should cut ties with Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tkachenko also quoted President Leonid Kuchma as saying Ukraine
should actively exert its influence on the policy of the CIS
members and protect national interests.
</P>
<P>
Tkachenko pointed out that the Ukrainian people's living
standards have not improved in the seven years after
independence. During this period, he said, the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) dropped by about 62 percent, agricultural
output fell by 50 percent and half of the enterprises are losing
money.
</P>
<P>
To spur the economy, Ukraine has decided to readjust its reform
policy and make an outline for national rejuvenation, Tkachenko
said.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Kuchma and Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko were present at the ceremony attended by several
thousand people.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Fall in British Exports to Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- British exports to Sri Lanka
fell sharply in the first five months of this year because of the
strength of the pound and more competition from Asian countries,
the official newspaper Daily news reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the period, British exports to Sri Lanka dropped by 36
percent compared with the same period in 1997, but Sri Lanka's
exports to Britain were up 16 percent largely because demand for
garments in Britain remained high, British High Commissioner David
 Tatham was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
British investors have faith in the Sri Lanka's long-term
potential and there were good prospects in power generation, water
and sewage, roads and railways in the country, he told the annual
general meeting of the Sri Lanka-United kingdom Business Council
recently.
</P>
<P>
The report said Sri Lanka's Trade with Britain boomed last year
which was described as the boom year for bilateral trade between
Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the two countries reached record levels
last year. Sri Lanka's exports to Britain increased by 18 percent
to 274 million British pounds while exports to Sri Lanka from
Britain were up by 42 percent to 211 million pounds compared with
1996, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Finalize State-Enterprise Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The preliminary draft master
plan for the reform of Thailand's state enterprise sector will be
completed at the end of this month, the newspaper The Nation said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the plan calls for sectoral action plans in
the telecom, transport and energy industries by November.
</P>
<P>
Covered by the plan are also water, industrial, commercial
services, agricultural, social and technological sectors.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program is also intended to generate proceeds
to finance the reform of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, Provincial
Electricity Authority, Telephone Organization of Thailand,
Communications Authority of Thailand, Thai Airways International,
Bangkok Mass Transit Authority, State Railway of Thailand, Krung
Thai Bank, Bank for Agriculture and Cooperatives and Metropolitan
Electricity Authority are on the top-10 list of largest units to
be privatized.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program is expected to result in improved
economic efficiency, quality and choice of service, attraction of
higher value-added services, reduction in subsidies to state
enterprises, fewer loan guarantees by the government,
strengthening and deepening capital markets and new investment in
social and public services.
</P>
<P>
Under the master plan, the state will be responsible for
policy-making and regulatory supervision while having a limited
and defined role in operating activities.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the government will ensure that there is open
competition and a level playing field through effective
regulation.
</P>
<P>
New state-owned enterprise reform legislation will provide
framework legislation for regulatory systems.
</P>
<P>
Regulators will be responsible for licensing, compliance
monitoring, tariff setting, promotion and encouragement of
competition.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Police in Central China's Henan
province have completed a 19-month investigation into a financial
fraud that involved 510 million yuan (US$61 million), China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested four major suspects and recovered stolen
money and goods valuing 182 million yuan (US$22 million).
</P>
<P>
On January 31, 1997, the Zhengzhou branch of the Bank of China
(BOC) reported the discovery of fraud involving a senior local BOC
official and a businessman.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianmin, deputy director of the BOC branch in Xingyang,
Henan province, was discovered colluding with Ren Chengjian,
chairman of Henan Sanren Group Company, in fraudulent activities.
</P>
<P>
The case is the worst in Henan in the past five decades and has
attracted the attention of provincial and central government
leaders, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The initial investigation showed that a large criminal
financial group headed by Ren committed fraud on 37 occasions in
the past two years, obtaining 347 million yuan (US$41.8 million)
and 1.5 million US dollars illegally.
</P>
<P>
Police traveled the length and breadth of the country and
finally arrested three key suspects at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But Ren, the mastermind behind the activity, had fled to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In January and February, two teams of local police flew to the
United States to continue the hunt for Ren.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- An enormous flash lit up the sky
when the Chinese Long March 2E Rocket carrying an Apstar-2
telecommunications satellite exploded 51 seconds after it took
off, three years ago, killing six people and injuring 23.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Shanghai's Pacific Insurance Company (PIC) had
insured the satellite project and arranged reinsurance on the
overseas market, and in only 50 days, it paid 160 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dai Fengju, general manager of the People's Insurance
(Reinsurance) Company of China (PICC Re), spoke about the accident
today with Xinhua and explained reinsurance as simply "insuring
insurance".
</P>
<P>
He said that an individual insurer's ability to insure is
limited and even its total yearly income might not be enough to
pay off a claim for a big disaster or accident.
</P>
<P>
This is where reinsurance comes in, in alleviating risks and
stabilizing the insurance business.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Dai is quite proud of his two-year-old company,
China's sole reinsurer, whose incomes from premiums in 1997 was
10.54 billion yuan, meaning that they are one of the world's top
20 reinsurance companies.
</P>
<P>
PICC Re is only two years old, but was honored as "Company
Launch of the Year 1997" by the magazine 'International
Reinsurance Review' for their reputation last year, Dai
said.

<P>
ROME, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An Italian official said Sunday
although one can be sympathetic with the reasons behind the
U.S. strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan, there are other better ways
to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Undersecretary Patrizia Toia, a senator for the
People's Party, backed the idea of a U.N.-sponsored "universal
assembly on terrorism" to define a common strategy, relaunch
international cooperation in intelligence-gathering and take
"urgent steps" to continue the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
She also urged a long-term cultural and political dialogue
between the West and the Arab and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
The aim would be to isolate those who choose violence as an
instrument of political struggle and to strengthen ties with
countries which firmly condemn such practices, Toia said.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Pillaging of rice exports is
damaging Thailand's reputation, said the country's major traders,
who are demanding police action.
</P>
<P>
Buyers of rice have complained about theft of shipments,
Vorapong Pichpongsa, president of the Rice Exporters Association
of Thailand, was quoted Monday by the newspaper The Bangkok Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies are charging more to cover exports because
of an increasing number of claims.
</P>
<P>
"we have asked the police to take action. Exporters are
delighted that the prime minister has taken the issue seriously,"
Vorapong said.
</P>
<P>
A marine police officer said that apart from rice, other
commodities, especially sugar, had been targeted by thieves.
</P>
<P>
according to the Police Department's Piracy Prevention Center,
30 cases have led to arrests since the start of this year, of
which 21 involved theft of sugar, five of rice, three of sawn wood
and one of bunker oil.

<P>
Dai said that the PICC RE transacts various kinds of domestic
and international reinsurance services, including compulsory
reinsurance business as entrusted by the state authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Insurance Law promulgated in 1995 and related
regulations issued by the State Council, the insurance companies
registered in China must reinsure 20 percent of their portfolio to
PICC RE, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the latter's
gross premium income.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that in spite of the negative impact the
Asian financial crisis, the premium income the PICC RE gained
in the first half still stood at 3.35 billion yuan, up 3.38
percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, the insurer has paid an indemnity totalled 369
million yuan in advance to the flood-hit areas in the Yangtze
River Valley, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicts that premium income of China's
insurance industry is expected to reach 240 billion yuan by 2000,
which also means a huge demand for reinsurance, Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
Dai disclosed that PICC RE's premium income is expected to hit
11 billion yuan this year, which will further exceed 13 billion
yuan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We also plan to establish branches in Shanghai and Shenzhen."
he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, related insiders also revealed that China's
insurance sector expects to adopt some new innovative
measures.
</P>
<P>
The PICC, for instance, will be disbanded, and its subsidiaries
of life insurance, property insurance and reinsurance, are
expected to become three independent state-run insurers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nation will also build up a special supervision
organization to take charge of its huge insurance market.
</P>
<P>
Local Analysts noted that the reforms will optimize the
structure of China's insurance industry, and also are beneficial
to the development of the young reinsurance undertaking.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Assembly of the Poor in
Thailand denounced the government for focusing only on financial
sector problems and ignoring the plight of the poor.
</P>
<P>
In a statement available Monday, the umbrella organization of
activists, mostly from northeastern provinces, said it would stop
negotiations with the government until the administration came up
with clear-cut measures for solving the poor's problems.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the government had focused only on solving
financial sector problems and on helping the rich, but had ignored
the plight of the poor.

<P>
The assembly annually organizes rallies at the Government House
and in major northeastern provinces to press the government to
address their problems.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the assembly would invoke the new
constitution to sponsor their own bill, which would seek to
establish an office to guarantee the poor's welfare.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution allows groups of at least 150,000 eligible
voters to submit bills to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the assembly would gather the necessary
signatures and submit a bill to Parliament President Wan Mohammad
Noor Matha on October 11, which is the first anniversary of the
implementation of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
"From now on we will launch every possible means to pressure
the current and future governments to issue concrete measures to
solve the poor's problems," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Slashes Economic Growth Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to slash the country's gross national product (GNP) growth
rate to 2 percent from the early-projected 3 percent, a newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its revised economic growth targets for this year, the
government is forecasting a maximum 2-percent GNP growth by
yearend after insisting on a 3-percent goal early this year,
according to Business World.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the gross domestic product (GDP) has similarly
been downscaled to 1.5 percent from a previous 2.4-percent
projection.
</P>
<P>
These adjustments were made by the interagency Development
Budget Coordinating Committee after the resident representative of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the Philippines predicted
earlier a 1-percent GNP growth rate for the country in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The GNP represents a country's total output of goods and
services including income from abroad while GDP represents only
domestic production.
</P>
<P>
The new growth targets, along with projections for 1999, will
be presented to the congress Monday when deliberations on the
proposed 579.5 billion peso 1999 budget begin.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Foreign Loans Decline Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign loans listed with the
Central Bank of the Philippines fell by 45 percent in the first
seven months this year to 3.4 billion U.S. dollars from 6.2
billion dollars a year ago, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Monday, Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson attributed the decline to relatively high interest
rates prevalent in the market up to the present and to the falling
value of the Philippine peso which continues to be under
speculative attack.
</P>
<P>
"The widening spreads on Philippine debt coupled with the
depreciation of the peso have particularly discouraged private
companies from tapping the international capital market for
funds," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign loans must be first registered with the central bank so
that these may be eligible for dollar servicing later via the
Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic foreign
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Those that have not been cleared first by the central bank will
have to source their dollars elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the country's current foreign reserves
are estimated at around 10.6 billion dollars or roughly equal to
2.3 months worth of imports or foreign obligations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign borrowings by the country's private sector for the
first seven months in 1998 dropped by 72 percent to 1.2 billion
dollars from 4.1 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The public sector's foreign borrowings, however, increased 9
percent to 2.2 billion dollars during the period.

<HEADLINE> BJP Calls for Better Coordination Among Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) Sunday called for better coordination and greater
cooperation among the coalition partners, according to the Press
Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Apparently ignoring the threat of withdrawal of support for the
BJP-led government by All-India Anna Dravida Muunetra Kazhagam
(AIADMK), a political resolution adopted Sunday at the end of a
three-day meeting of the BJP National Executive chose to
concentrate attack on the opposition particularly the Congress.
</P>
<P>
AIADMK, based in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and a
decisive partner of the BJP in the coalition government, has
threatened several times to withdraw its support since the BJP
came to power last March.
</P>
<P>
Without even mentioning the name of AIADMK, the resolution
merely said the government has to work within the limitations of
coalition politics in light of experiences of the last five
months, PTI reported from Jaipur, capital city of the northwestern
State of Rajasthan.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the opposition parties of ganging up to try and
subvert the BJP-led government, the ruling party called on the
people to rebuff these disruptive forces and ensure that the
polity was not destabilized.
</P>
<P>
The decision-making body of the BJP adopted a resolution
Saturday asserting that India had the strength and capacity to
withstand and survive the economic sanctions imposed by many
countries and international organizations following the country's
nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
The National Executive favored reviewing a decision of the
BJP-led government on a nuclear moratorium if future developments
jeopardized India's national strategic and security interests.
</P>
<P>
The executives asked the government not to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), saying it is
"discriminatory."
</P>
<P>
Members of the executive were critical of the failure of the
coalition government to curb mounting prices in the country since
the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
An economic resolution adopted Sunday by the executives blamed
the price rise on previous governments and unfavorable weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted party sources as saying the BJP-led coalition came
in for sharp criticism by some members at the meeting for its
failure to ease the price rise which, they felt, was eroding the
vote banks of the BJP.
</P>
<P>
The BJP elite suggested that the public distribution system be
streamlined and strengthened and distribution of essential
commodities at reasonable rates be ensured so that the common
people are relieved of the burden of back-breaking prices and
shortages created by hoarders.
</P>
<P>
The prices of essential commodities have skyrocketed since the
BJP-led government came to power last March and especially since
the country conducted nuclear tests in May, with some having
increased by more than 10 times.

<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing body
UEFA denied its co-operation with organisation behind a proposed
European Super League.
</P>
<P>
Milan-based Media Partners issued a statement on Friday,
saying that UEFA had agreed to review the company's plans for the
league.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted UEFA official Guido Tognoni as saying the
claims by Media Partners were "absolutely not true".
</P>
<P>
"General secretary Gerhard Aigner made it clear to Media
Partners that UEFA has its own plans and does not need their
advice on running a European league," Tognoni said.
</P>
<P>
UEFA officials met with Media Partners on Friday in Geneva and
following the meeting the company issued a statement saying:
"UEFA have agreed to review the European Football League plans in
consultation with national associations."
</P>
<P>
Tognoni said there was no such agreement. "We agreed to meet
them as a courtesy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We listened to their presentation but told them we will go
our way. We have our own project which we will reveal in our own
time. We certainly don't have any further meetings scheduled."

<HEADLINE> Salary Grievance Hearing to Determine Leverage in Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The NBA and the Players
Association resume their legal wrangling Monday as an arbitrator
begins a hearing to determine whether player contracts are
guaranteed despite the lockout and which side will have
bargaining leverage in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arbitrator John Feerick will hear two days of testimony before
making what is expected to be a quick ruling on the grievance
filed by the union, which calls for players to be paid during the
lockout. The NBA, which unsuccessfully tried to remove Feerick
as arbitrator, contends its actions are entirely legal during a
work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
Feerick's ruling will have a major effect on future collective
bargaining sessions, which have digressed from unproductive to
acrimonious over the the last four months and are threatening the
start of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
The NBA is the only major pro sports league that never has
lost a game to a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
Feerick upheld the sanctity of the guaranteed contract in the
case of Latrell Sprewell, whom he reinstated as a member of the
Golden State Warriors after the team terminated his 25 million
U.S. dollars contract.
</P>
<P>
The grievance was filed on behalf of some 220 players just
hours before NBA owners imposed the lockout. And the lockout a
llowed Feerick to remain as arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
Eleven players were named in the grievance the union filed on
behalf of more than 200 players whose pay schedules would be
affected by a lockout. They includes Boston Celtics guard Kenny
Anderson, who was to receive his entire 5.8 million salary for
next season on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Other players are scheduled to receive similar payments this
summer, but the NBA maintained it is under no obligation to pay
the salaries. In March, Feerick shortened the NBA's one-year
suspension and reinstated the contract of Sprewell, the All-Star
guard who attacked coach in a practice.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles beat third seed
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain to win her fourth consecutive
Canadian Open title in Montreal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fifth seeded American took command from the start and
swept to the victory 6-3, 6-2 in one hour and 17 minutes,
collecting her first title of the year.
</P>
<P>
The matchup was a rematch of this year's French Open final
which was won by Sanchez Vicario. After a 27-month absence from
the tour following her stabbing, Seles made a dramatic return by
winning this tournament in 1995 -- and she has won it every year
since.
</P>
<P>
The French Open champion Sanchez Vicario won only 10 points on
Seles's serve and had just one break point in the entire match,
which she failed to convert.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ms. Qiu, who owns a foreign
trade company in the south China city of Guangzhou, just didn't
know what to do with her increasing income, until she got a
financial adviser on her own at the individual accounts department
of the Guangzhou Branch of the China International Trust and
Investment Corporation's Industrial Bank.
</P>
<P>
She now makes a steady profit on the money she has deposited,
and can purchase shares, bonds, or investment funds.
</P>
<P>
China Business Daily recently told Ms. Qiu's story as an
example of the good results of a nationwide banking reform that
has prompted banks to improve their services in a market-oriented
reform that focuses on profit and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
CITIC Industrial Bank's Guangzhou Branch was the first to open
an individual accounts department in 1996, the daily reports, and
it can help individuals manage their money through various
investment plans. It has also enlarged its business scope by
providing individuals with housing, university study, or other
loans.
</P>
<P>
By June, it had helped customers manage 270 million yuan and
provided 300 million yuan in loans.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Bank of China's Guangzhou Branch, having got
the clue from CITIC Industrial, began to offer individual banking
services last year.

<P>
NANNING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region become the most efficient thoroughfare to the
sea for southwest China five years after that, when most of the
completed highways are connected with waterways and railways.
</P>
<P>
To support highway construction, the regional government has
increased investment for this purpose from the previously planned
3.73 billion yuan to five billion yuan this year, according to Li
Zhaozhuo, chairman of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the increased investment will be able to
generate two billion yuan in gross domestic product (GDP), provide
job opportunities to 100,000 people, and vitalize the industrial
production of cement and steel.
</P>
<P>
The Construction Bank of China Guangxi Branch recently signed
an agreement with the regional bureau of communications under
which the former will provide the latter with 6.08 billion yuan in
loans to finance the construction of communications projects in
Guangxi in the next three years. Some 1.37 billion yuan of these
loans will be provided this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the autonomous region will add
2,932 kilometers of highways this year, including 203 kilometers
of expressways and 229 kilometers of graded highways.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Aston Villa Beats Middlesbrough in Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa claimed their first
victory in the new English Premier league season on Sunday with a
3-1 victory over newly-promoted club Middlesbrough 3-1 at Villa
Park.
</P>
<P>
Julian Joachim fired Villa ahead from 12 meters in the sixth
minute and they should have made it two in the 39th when the same
player was hauled down by Italian defender Gianluca Festa in the
area.
</P>
<P>
However, Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer dived to his
right to save Alan Thompson's penalty.
</P>
<P>
Villa, who this week sold striker Dwight Yorke to Manchester
United for 12.6 million pounds (20.51 Million U.S. dollars), were
in total command and the second goal duly arrived early in the
second half when wing back Gary Charles cut in from the right and
curled in a left-footed shot.
</P>
<P>
Dane Mikkel Beck came on for the disappointing Paul Gascoigne
after an hour and immediately pulled one back for Middlesbrough
with a sharp near post header.
</P>
<P>
But Thompson made up for his penalty failure when he lashed a
free-kick through the wall and into the net 13 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
The victory took Villa to four points from two games, along
with six other clubs. One of them, Charlton Athletic, are the
early leaders on goal difference following their 5-0 thrashing of
Southampton on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Champions Arsenal drew 0-0 at Liverpool while Manchester
United were also involved in a goalless draw, at West Ham.

<HEADLINE> Corretja Beats Agassi to Win RCA Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Alex Corretja of Spain
claimed his second hardcourt title of the year today as he
rallied past American Andre Agassi in three sets to win the
745,000 U.S. dollars RCA tennis championship in Indianapolis, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The sixth seed Corretja broke Agassi in the eighth game of the
third set and served out the 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory. He captured
his third ATP Tour title of the season, seventh overall and first
on American soil.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the fifth seed, was seeking his fifth ATP Tour title
this season, which would have tied him for the 1998 lead with
Chile's Marcelo Rios. He remains one title behind Stan Smith for
12th on the all-time list with 38 victories.
</P>
<P>
Corretja, who earned his first career victory in five meetings
with Agassi, became the first Spaniard to win this event since
Jose Higueras in 1982.
</P>
<P>
A finalist at the French Open, the 24-year-old Corretja landed
his first career hardcourt title in February at the Dubai Open
and won last month's Swiss Open in Gstaad.
</P>
<P>
One day after posting his 50th match win of the year, Agassi
suffered just his third loss in 22 matches on the summer
hardcourt circuit leading up to the U.S. Open in two weeks. He
leads the ATP Tour with 44 hardcourt match wins against only
eight defeats.

<HEADLINE> Kucera Wins Pilot Pen Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Karol Kucera of Slovakia
ended Goran Ivanisevic's hopes for his first American title
Sunday, beating the eighth seeded Croatian in three sets to win
the 870,000 U.S. dollars Pilot Pen international tennis event in
New Haven, Connecticut, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic has won 21 career singles titles but is now winless
in five finals on American soil. He complained of bad calls and
a sore left shoulder but ultimately was undone by Kucera's smooth
all-court game.
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning it was hurting," Ivanisevic said of the
shoulder that caused him problems in his semifinal win over
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia. "Not on the first serve, but on the
second serve. That is why I started to hit some different second
serves."
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Kucera earned 122,500 U.S. dollars and captured
his second title of the year in one hour 45 minutes as he beat
Ivanisevic for the third stragiht time in four meetings. He won
the Sydney International in January and was a finalist at the Me
rcedes Cup claycourt event in Stuttgart, Germany last month.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Kucera will jump back into the top 10 when the
ATP rankings are released Monday. The Slovak was ranked a
career-high No. 9 earlier this season. The U.S. Open seeding
committee likely will use those rankings as its basis seeding at
the final Grand Slam of the year in eight days.

<HEADLINE> German FM Voices Concern about Russian Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Sunday expressed concern about the situation in Russia
after a sudden shakeup of the entire Russian government announced
by President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Apparently under the increasing pressure of a financial crisis,
Yeltsin earlier on Sunday sacked the entire cabinet of Sergei
Kiriyenko and named former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who
was fired by Yeltsin just five months ago, as interim Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German ARD television network Sunday
evening, Kinkel described the situation in Russia as "not quite
confidence-promoting", but he also expressed the belief that
Chernomyrdin would be able to create confidence.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's move came one week after the Russian government and
the central bank devalued the ruble and imposed a 90-day
moratorium on repayments of foreign debts, sending stock markets
plunging to record lows.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sacks Government, Reinstates Chernomyrdin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Sunday sacked the whole cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko and named
ex-premier Viktor Chernomyrdin as interim Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The move marks another surprise turn in Russia's unpredictable
political climate. Chernomyrdin himself was fired just about five
months ago together with most of his cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Kiriyenko, barely four months since he took
office, left the Government House Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko's ouster came one week after the government and the
central bank raised the ceiling of the ruble's exchange corridor
from 6.3 to 9.5 rubles to the U.S. dollar, which amounted to a
devaluation of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
A 90-day moratorium was also imposed on repayments of foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Kiriyenko cabinet was already facing an angry
State Duma, or lower house of parliament, where Communists were
threatening a vote of non-confidence and most law-makers expressed
dissatisfaction over the government's handling of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
As Russia's stock market plunged to record lows amid an ever
weaker ruble, the economic prospect looked as bleak as ever, if
not worse.
</P>
<P>
Prices of the most liquid shares on the Russian market shed an
alarming 25-40 percent over the past week alone amid extremely
thin trading.
</P>
<P>
Observers had expected the stock market to recover somewhat
next Monday when the government, now the ex-government, was
scheduled to announce details of a planned swap of short-term
government treasury bills into longer-term securities, another
step announced last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russians' average real income, or after-tax income adjusted
for inflation, dropped 8.9 percent in the first seven months of
the year as compared with the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest government shake-up received mixed reaction from the
Russian political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov welcomed news of Kiriyenko's
demise, saying it was expected as the Kiriyenko team "is not
capable of working efficiently," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he blasted Yeltsin's choice of Chernomyrdin as the
interim premier.
</P>
<P>
"This endeavor is unlikely to succeed since Kiriyenko's
government... continued what the former Cabinet was doing,"
Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Shokhin, leader of the Our Home is Russia (NDR)
faction in the Duma, hailed the comeback of Chernomyrdin, who is
chairman of the NDR movement.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin sorted things out after returning from vacation
and that Kiriyenko, central bank governor Sergei Dubinin and
Yeltsin's chief negotiator with international lending agencies
Anatoly Chubais had failed to reveal the actual situation in full
to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had never recognized the
cabinet of Kiriyenko, blasted Yeltsin's move as "an upside down
decision" based on willpower without consulting parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko was picked from the obscurity of a minor position in
the energy ministry to replace Chernomyrdin in March, less than
one year in the Kremlin politics.
</P>
<P>
Over its brief life, the Kiriyenko cabinet had for the most
part played the role of fire-fighters, as the country was rocked
by railway blockades staged by miners who were not paid for months
and waves of financial crises, dashing Yeltsin's ambition of "a
year of growth" this year.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts to prop up the ruble and boost the
stock markets, even with over 22 billion U.S. dollars of loans
pledged from Western lenders, succumbed to waning investor
confidences.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday's move by the Kiriyenko government to effectively
devalue the national currency was seen as a step that erased one
of the few economic achievements of Yeltsin's presidency, a stable
ruble exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who is already reportedly making political
consultations on possible line-up of a new cabinet, is expected to
return to the Government House Monday.
</P>
<P>
If he was to serve as prime minister for an extended period of
time, confirmation would have to be sought from the State Duma.

The Secretariat calls upon the U.S. to respect international

McHale called Clinton's actions "morally repugnant."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton testified before a federal grand jury
investigating his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, then went on
television and admitted an inappropriate relationship with the
former intern. Many people have expressed disappointment that he
used neither the word "apologize" nor "sorry" in his talk.
</P>
<P>
George Stephanopoulos, a former Clinton confidant, said despite
the admission, resignation is not warranted.
</P>
<P>
"For the president to resign now would be wrong,"
Stephanopoulos writes in the Newsweek magazine on newsstands
Monday. "President Clinton may have debased himself with his
behavior, but we shouldn't debase the office with an impulsive
overreaction."
</P>
<P>
He noted Clinton enjoys broad support in polls for his
presidential ability.
</P>
<P>
Similar views were shared by other Democrats, including several
Cabinet members.
</P>

"As an American citizen and as a friend of the president, I
accept what he said on Monday," Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on ABC. "I know that he is determined and has the
judgment and the ability to be a president that defends the U.S.
national interest."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen told NBC's "Meet the Press,"
"I have confidence in his ability when it comes to leading the
country on national security issues."
</P>
<P>
Reverend Jesse Jackson said Clinton needs to speak to the
American public again about the matter.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that he will in time, that he will say more," Jackson
said on CBS' "Face the Nation."

<HEADLINE> Khatami Vows to Fight Terrorists After Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday vowed to fight terrorists, hours after the
former chief prosecutor, Assadollah Lajevardi was assassinated by
two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to do everything possible within
its capacity against notorious terrorists," Khatami said in a
message of condolence to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
and the family of Lajevardi.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted Khatami as urging
information and security organs to quickly identify and arrest the
terrorists who gunned down Lajevardi and two other people.
</P>
<P>
Lajevardi, along with his brother and a passer-by were killed
in an assassination by two armed assailants at his business office
in Tehran's grand bazaar, a traditional marketplace.
</P>
<P>
One of the assailants was arrested and police cordoned off the
bazaar shortly after the attack. It was reported that the
foreign-based opposition Mujahedin Khalq claimed responsibility
for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Mujahedin accused Lajevardi of being responsible for the
notorious killing and arrest of tens of thousands of dissidents in
the early years of the Islamic revolution since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Lajevardi, who was a confidant of the late supreme leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had "a bright record of services" for
the Islamic revolution, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Once a prisoner in the late shah's regime, Lajevardi was asked
to administer the Prisons Organization after establishment of the
Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani and Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri also issued separate messages
condemning the terrorist murder.
</P>
<P>
Lajevardi supported Nouri in last year's presidential election,
which the speaker lost to Khatami. He resigned last year and
returned to the same business he did in the bazaar before the
revolution.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Syria Narrows Gap on Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Sunday that Egypt and Syria will soon reach an
understanding on an Egypt's proposal to convene an international
conference to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from a surprise visit to
Damascus, Moussa said he will report to President Hosni Mubarak
the results of his "lengthy talks" with Syrian President Hafez
Assad and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides are still coordinating their stances on
the issue, but "the time will come soon to reach an understanding
on this subject."
</P>
<P>
Amid efforts to seek ways to break the 16-month-old deadlock in
the Palestinian-Israeli talks, France and Egypt put forth an
initiative in May for an international conference on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Syria has reservations over holding the conference, fearing
that it could give Israel a pretext to wriggle out of the
principles of the 1991 Madrid Conference, which lay the basis for
the process.
</P>
<P>
Syria broken off peace talks with Israel in early 1996 and
vowed not to resume the negotiations unless Israel agreed to pull
back from the Golan Heights, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast
war and annexed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he delivered a message from Mubarak to Assad and
received a reply. But he did not disclose the content of either
message.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to Damascus was part of the continued
consultations between the two countries on the peace process and
the general situation in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Moussa denied reports that his visit was to arrange for an
visit by Mubarak to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mubarak and Assad exchange visits periodically
and "this takes place in the normal manner."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Files Claim for Compensation From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudan requested that the United
States compensate for the damages of el-Shifa pharmaceutical
plant, attacked by the U.S. Thursday under the pretext that it was
producing chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese News Agency reported that about 300 workers of the
plant made the claim for compensation from the U.S. for the losses
they suffered, including the loss of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the plant Sayed Haj Hamad put the damages
of the plant at 100 million U.S. dollars - the value of the
facilities, equipment, pharmaceuticals and other materials in the
plant.
</P>
<P>
Sudan insisted the plant was producing medicines for human and
veterinary consumption and export some of the drugs to finance the
import of other medicines.
</P>
<P>
The plant was one of the largest in Africa and used to produce
20 kinds of human medicines and 23 kinds of veterinary ones. Its
production went to some Arab and African countries beside meeting
domestic demands.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese officials pointed out that the lack of such medicines
will give rise to medicine price hikes and affect the growth of
the animal wealth in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sudanese Association for Patient Protection
asked for an immediate apology from the United States for its
fatal mistake and urged the U.S. to rebuild the plant and offer
real compensations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fired cruise missiles on the pharmaceutical plant in
the industrial zone in north Khartoum under the claim that it
produced the deadly VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government dismissed the accusation and cited Tom
Carnavin, a British engineer who took part in the construction of
the plant, as saying that the plant "could never produce the nerve
gas VX."

<HEADLINE> Porfile: Kiriyenko Sacked By President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and his entire Cabinet was fired by President Boris
Yeltsin on Sunday. It was the second time the president dismissed
the Russian government within five months.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin took the decision doubtlessly because of a financial
crisis which has deepened under Kiriyenko and provoked fierce
attacks on the prime minister and the president in parliament on
Friday. The chamber demanded Yeltsin resign.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, 36, was appointed prime minister by Yeltsin after
dismissal of the cabinet led by Chernomirdin on March 23.
</P>
<P>
When nominating Kiriyenko to the post of prime minister, the
president said that Kiriyenko as an independent politician was
skillful in keeping contacts with different parties, and that
ability and energy do not depend on ones age.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko became a millionaire through the system known as
arbitrage. Then he went into banking in Nizhny Novgorod (Gorky)
and quickly made fortune.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko had been less than a year in the Kremlin politics
when Yeltsin picked him from the obscurity of a minor position in
the energy ministry to replace the even more wealthy and
experienced Viktor Chernomirdin.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko became the first deputy minister of the fuel and
energy ministry on March 23, 1997, and then the minister in
November of that year.

MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Four Pakistani nationals were
ordered to leave Tajikistan for spreading ideas of Islamic
fundamentalism amongst Dushabe residents, a ranking Tajik official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tajik Deputy Security Minister Shamsullo Dzhabirov said the
four, identified as Malik Haiyat, Talhi Mohammad, Omar Mohammad

Wahhabi is a radical Islamic sect that is active in Central
Asia and Russia's Caucasus region.

He said the Pakistani embassy in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital,
had been notified of the investigation into the four's activities.
</P>

The four "exporters of the fundamentalist ideas and advocates
of the ideas of the Taliban" were told about the inadmissibility
of such conduct on territory of a foreign sovereign country, the
minister said.

ATHENS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Austria agreed Sunday
that more observers should be sent to the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo in order to find a political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference in the northern Greek city

Austria agreed that more observers should be sent to strife-torn
Kosovo, their safety should be ensured, so that they might exert

Slobodan Milosevic to stop the violence in Kosovo where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of its nearly two million population.

<P>
ATHENS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece Sunday called on Austria
to begin entry talks for Cyprus into the European Union (EU) as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Austrian Chancellor
Viktor Klima, who arrived Friday in Greece for a three-day private
visit, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that negotiations
for EU applicants including Cyprus should begin before the end of
a screening process that involves collecting data on the workings
of each country, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece's position on entry talks was that talks should begin
simultaneously for the six applicants, but not necessarily on the
same subjects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Klima, whos country is currently holding the EU rotating
presidency, said that screening for EU applicants, due to end in
October or November, should be completed as soon as possible as
the outcome would have major repercussions on security, combating
organized crime, and overall progress in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he stressed that the EU should not allow
its interest to diminish in the five countries slated for the
second wave of entry along with Cyprus, and care should be taken
to close ties with them in order to avoid discriminatory
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Klima said that entry talks would be conducted with each of the
six countries separately, and would focus on the extent to which
each individual applicant met EU standards.

WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will go ahead with his trip to Russia scheduled at end of the
month despite Sunday's shakeup in the Russian government, said
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The United States' priority is that necessary economic reforms
move forward in Russia, said Crowley, who is with the president in
Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
"Those policies are not specifically based on personality," he
said. "We'll continue to work closely with the Russian government
and watch the situation closely as it evolves."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is vacationing on Martha's Vineyard until August 30. He
leaves August 31 for two days of summit meetings with Yeltsin and
members of the Russian parliament in Moscow
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and the rest

Chernomyrdin who was fired by Yeltsin in March.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said the U.S. hopes Chernomyrdin's first order on his

Russian economy and private investors, and others to improve the
