<HEADLINE> EU Envoy: Syria Interested in Making Peace with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos today conveyed to Israel a peace message from
Syria, which expressed its willingness to resume the peace
process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos conveyed the message to Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy during their talks here to discuss ways of breaking the
 Israeli-Syrian deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy returned from Syrian capital Damascus
Saturday night where he held discussions with Syrian leaders
on ways of resuming the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which have
been suspended since early last year.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that when he was in Damascus, he heard
only voice of peace instead of drums of war. He said the
Syrians were "fully committed to relaunching the peace process
and recuperating the comprehensiveness of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"The message I brought from Damascus is the message of
peace, not a message of war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos refuted the charges by some Israeli officials that
the EU mediating role was counterproductive, clarifying that the
EU efforts were complementing those by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Israeli critics said that the foreign ministry's move to
grant a greater role to the EU would only complicate the
peace process and create more difficulties for the U.S., which
is widely regarded as the leading mediator.
</P>
<P>
"I only can answer by saying that we work closely with
the U.S. in a complementary way ... because we are all
interested in facilitating the end of the deadlock in the
peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
No details were disclosed on the Levy-Moratinos meeting,
which was believed to have focused on finding a bridging formula,
based on the model of the 1991 Madrid Conference, to enable
the two sides to resume negotiations. Israel interprets the
Madrid model as setting no precondition on either side for
holding peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry's Director-General Eitan Bentsur, who
also took part in today's talks, said a day earlier that Israel
had rejected a recent Syrian offer to renew peace talks, because
it set a precondition on Israel's agreement to return the whole
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal was the latest of three formulae put
forward by Syria and relayed to Israel by Moratinos, who has been
active in mediating the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel rejected all the three Syrian proposals
simply because they all contained a demand on Israel's full
withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, Bentsur said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the final communique of the recent Malta
Conference included a call for resuming negotiations between
Israel and Syria on the basis of the Madrid Conference. The
announcement was approved by all 27 states attending the
conference including Syria, an indication that it might provide
an opening for a bridging formula that would enable the
resumption of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous Labor government, Israel and Syria
appeared on the verge of reaching a Golan-for-peace deal, but
it was not finalized. The current Israeli government led by
the hardline Likud party, which came to power last June,
opposes a full return of the Golan Heights.

<P>
TIRANA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Another large group of refugees from
northern Albania have fled their country for Italy by an oil ship
following the 600 Albanian refugees from the region who arrived
in Italy earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The ship carrying more than 1,000 people from the region of
Shkoder left the northern Albanian port of Shengjin on Saturday
evening, media reports here said today.
</P>
<P>
The ship is expected to reach the Italian coast this evening,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 13,000 Albanians have fled their country for Italy in
the past three months after the country was engulfed by violent
unrest caused by the collapse of the shaky investment schemes in
which people lost their life's savings.

BRAZZAVILLE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zairian rebel leader
Laurent-Desire Kabila today ordered his troops to cease attacks on
all the fronts against government forces, the United Nations
special envoy Mohammed Sahnoun announced today.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun, who attended today the first face-to-face talks
between Kabila and Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko on board the
South African navy ice-breaker SAS Outeniqua, said that Kabila
issued the order as "a goodwill signal."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mobutu promised that he would not pose as the
candidate for a future presidential election, and proposed the
establishment of a transitional authority in Zaire to prepare for
the election, according to Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu and Kabila will meet again within six to 10 days, said
the envoy.

<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Samsonov of
Belarus downed Ding Song and Kong Linghui edged Ma Wenge, both
making the men's singles semi-finals at the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, 21, famed for consistency and strength, gave a 21-13,
21-9, 21-10 humiliation to Ding, who had vowed to avenge two
losses on the rival five years his junior.
</P>
<P>
World No. 4 Samsonov played patiently against the Chinese
chopper-and-attacker, making a kill only when he got a sure chance.
</P>
<P>
Ding, ranked seventh in the world, has lost to Samsonov in the
World Cup last year and the Qatar Open in February.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 and defending champion Kong outlasted Ma 16-21,
22-20, 18-21, 21-12, 21-12 in an all-Chinese quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
Kong will take on Samsonov in the semi-finals Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The sport's all-time great Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden earlier
routed French 1993 world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien to book a
semi-final berth.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Waldner, the most successful male of the modern
era, combined his usual array of table tennis wares to deadly
effect, beating the Frenchman 21-7, 22-20, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Waldner's deceptive serves and lethal forehands were just too
much for Gatien, who moved into the quarter-finals with a 3-0
blanking of Chinese world No. 6 Wang Tao on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Swede is to vie for a final spot with Chinese Yan Sen
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Chinese, who had upset world No. 5 Kim Taek Soo
of South Korea, moved into the last four by beating Spain's He
Zhiwen 21-19, 19-21, 21-13, 21-19.

<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zairian rebel leader
Laurent-Desire Kabila today ordered his troops to start a
ceasefire on all the fronts engaging government forces, while
Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko promised to step down after the
holding of a free election in his country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations envoy Mohammed Sahnoun made the announcement
today on board the South African navy ice-breaker SAS Outeniqua
anchored at the Congolese port of Pointe-Noire, where Kabila and
Mobutu held their first face-to-face talks under the mediation of
South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun, who is also the representative of the Organization of
African Unity, said that Kabila ordered the ceasefire as a
goodwill gesture, and that Mobutu proposed the establishment of a
transitional power in Zaire to be followed by the holding of free
election in the country, in which he himself will not participate.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who has been ruling Zaire for 32 years, declared until
now that he would seek a succession of the presidency if a
presidential election was held in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Zairian president, who is suffering from prostate cancer,
will go back to Kinshasa this evening and is scheduled to meet
Kabila again within six to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Vice President Thabo Mbeki, Defense Minister Joe
Modise and Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo also participated in
today's 90-minute talks, which finally took place after three days
of delay.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that it is not known whether the government
forces of Zaire and the rebel forces themselves, both of them
enjoying some degree of independence from their leaders, will
cooperate with the peace arrangement by the United Nations and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zairian rebel forces, who have conquered three-quarters of the
country's territory, are now approaching the capital Kinshasa and
their exact position on the front is not known.

<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- France's ruling Gaullist Rally for the
Republic (PRP) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF) will keep
291 seats out of the 555 seats for mainland France in the National
Assembly in the next general elections, according to a newest
poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was jointly conducted by the daily Le Figaro
and SOFRES and will be published on Monday, said that the
Socialist Party, the independent candidates and ecologists will
win 236 seats, the Communist Party 26 seats, and the extreme-right
National Front (FN) two seats.
</P>
<P>
The PRP and UDF will win 34 percent of the votes, the
opposition Socialists 28 percent, the Communists 10 percent, and
FN 15 percent in the first round of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the elections will be held among those who
fail to get an absolute majority of votes in the first round, and
most of the FN qualify in the first round are expected to lose in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
However, 35 percent of the people polled said that it is still
possible that they will change mind in the voting to be held on
May 25 and June 1.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the people polled said that they think the
ruling majority have better chances to win, against 24 percent who
think the leftist parties will carry and 20 percent who fail to
give their opinion.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by telephone questioning of 1,000 voters
representative of all the social strata of the nation in 461
constituencies of mainland France.
</P>
<P>
France's overseas territories hold 20 seats in the National
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> GCC Commodities Classification Committee Meet in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Technical Committee for
Customs Tariffs in charge of classifying commodities in the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states started its meeting today in
the Saudi capital of Riyadh to resume its work on classification of
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), citing a press statement
issued by the six-member GCC General Secretariat, said that the
committee would continue to classify commodities into three
categories in its two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The three categories are goods exempted from tariffs, basic
goods with a tariff of 4 to 8 percent or 8 to 12 percent and
other goods.
</P>
<P>
The GCC Foreign Ministers Council decided during its 62nd
meeting in Riyadh last March to entrust the technical committee
to speed up the classification measure and reach an agreement in
its coming gatherings.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the committee would refer a
list of the classified commodities to the economic and financial
cooperation committee during its coming meeting later this
month.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic organization
founded in 1981, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Customs and tariffs in the GCC states at present vary from 4
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
There existed a wide gap among the six states towards the
unification due to differences in each country's economic
priorities. The disagreement has blocked a tariff agreement
almost since the alliance was formed.
</P>
<P>
GCC Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs Abdullah
Al-Khulaifi said last March that "the major problem is
classification of goods."
</P>
<P>
The GCC has recently finished classifying 900 kinds
of commodities out of 1,200 expected to be classified, and
the meeting may be the last step before the list is presented to
the alliance's economic ministers and foreign ministers at their
meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
The final authority deciding the issue would be the GCC's
heads of state who will hold their annual summit in Kuwait in
December.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Al-Ghanim, chief of Kuwait General Administration of
Customs disclosed last month that the GCC General Secretariat had
proposed an 8 percent unified tariff, and the member states
considered it as "a suitable meting point."
</P>
<P>
The progress made in the GCC states' customs unification
efforts was considered as a big success towards achieving a
strong economic bloc in the face of other international
alliances.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Can Boost Natural Gas Export in Future: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has a very good chance to boost
its potentials of natural gas exports in the future through
developing a number of untapped oil fields in cooperation with
foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
A according to a study issued here today by the Iraqi Oil
Ministry, Iraq has a proven natural gas reserve of some three
trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The study said that it is believed Iraq's gas reserves are
estimated at about 4.5 trillion cubic metes.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the coming years would witness an
increasing demand for Iraqi gas since it is a clean fuel of great
use in electric power generation and in petrochemical and basic
industries.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Turkey may have a big chance to obtain
Iraq's natural gas as a neighboring state that enjoys great
conveniences.
</P>
<P>
In April, a Turkish oil delegation held negotiations with
Iraqi officials in Baghdad on the possibility of building a
1300-kilometer pipeline that would take gas to Turkey at an
annual capacity of 10 billion cubic meters and a cost of 2.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is seeking to develop its gas industry that would secure
huge revenues and contribute to conserving energy and protecting
the environment. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zaire Peace Talks Fail, Rebels Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko
and rebel leader Laurent Kabila today failed to reach an
agreement on the terms of Mobutu's departure and rebel forces
will continue their advance to the capital.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks between the two men, which started 11:00
gmt on a South African Navy ship, the SAS Outeniqua, moored off
the west African coast, Mobutu agreed to step down, but he said
he would hand over power to an elected president.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's offer was refused by Kabila, who insisted that his
rebel alliance should act as the transitional authority to
organise the elections.
</P>
<P>
"Power must go directly to our president (Kabila)," rebel
"foreign minister" Bizima Karaha said from the ship.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader repeatedly stated Mobutu must stand down from
power and if Mobuto refused he would order his troops to launch
final attacks on the Zairean capital Kishasa with a population
of five million.
</P>
<P>
Kabila told reporters after the conclusion of the talks, his
troops would fight on.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kabila's rebel forces are now only 40 km
from the airport in the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, South African President Nelson Mandela, who hosted
today's talks between the two rivals, said Kabila had issued
orders to his forces to stop advancing but that this did not
constitute a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"The question of a ceasefire is not part of his (Kabila's)
vocabulary. What he is concerned with is that negotiations will
lead to the end of hostilities," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said at a news conference held after the talks, fresh
talks between Mobutu and Kabila would be held in up to 10 days
to "narrow the gap between the two parties."
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Mobutu asked Kabila to give him eight
days for considering the rebels' demand that he resign.
</P>
<P>
"I have agreed to that request and we shall meet again on
this same ship within the next eight days," Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
Howeever, he added: "There will be no ceasefire while he
considers our demands."
</P>
<P>
Today's talks between Mobutu and Kabila lasted for some one
and a half hours. After the talks concluded, Mobutu left the ship
immediately. Kabila aides said the rebel leader would return
to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire led by Kabila took up arms last October
to topple Zairean President Mobutu. In only seven months of
civial war, the rebels have occupied three quarters of Zaire, the
third largest country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The rebels began to march onto the capital Kishasa immediately
after they captured the town of Kenge 200 km to the east on
Thursday. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges UN to Expedite Approval of Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Commerce Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh urged the United Nations here today to expedite
approval of the contracts signed by Iraq with foreign companies, the
Iraqi news agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the U.N. Assistant Secretary General Yasushi
Akashi, Saleh also urged the world body to deduct about 250
million U.S. dollars covering the contracts from Iraq's escrow
account, a special account opened by the U.N. in New York for
Iraqi proceeds from its limited oil sale.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. for its "deliberate obstructive
attempts" to delay the implementation of the memorandum of
understanding (MOU) signed by Iraq and the U.N. last May.
</P>
<P>
The MOU allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil
over six months to purchase food and other necessities badly
needed in the country due to the stringent U.N. sanctions imposed
on Iraq after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed that it had submitted to the U.N. hundreds of
contracts signed with foregin companies on its purchase of food
and other badly-needed daily necessities for its citizens, but
only a small part of them has been approved by the U.N..

<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- About 150 representatives of civil
society organizations from all over Zimbabwe are scheduled to
attend a two-day national consultative conference on May 27 and
28 to discuss land policies in this country.
</P>
<P>
The conference will seek to outline land policies which would
respond to the fundamental socio-economic issues, as well as
resolve the historical injustices.
</P>
<P>
Discussions at the conference will focus around five key
areas: environment and protection of natural resources, women and
land, land administration, land, law and social justice, and land
economics and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Conference Organizing Committee member Joe Matowangika today
said there is need to create a better understanding of the land
issue among all Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
He said the land question has of late emerged as one of the
most important issues in Zimbabwe because of the increasing
levels of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The land-related problems are rooted in the colonial era which
bequeathed marginal land to the majority blacks.

HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Constitutional amendments,
government expenditure, corruption, land redistribution and

</P>
<P>
The one-day national conference was attended by about 50

non-governmental organizations.
</P>

Its discussions were focused on social, economic and political

Most participants agreed there is need for a constitutional
conference involving all political parties to have consensus on
how the constitution of the country could be amended.

Zimbabwe Congress Party President Kenneth Mano said, "the
appointment of the Electoral Supervisory Commission by the

He added to cut unnecessary government expenditure, there is
need to reduce the size of the cabinet and abolish some top

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Israel to Halt Settlement Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today called upon Israel to stop settlement building in Arab
lands, saying that peace and settlement can not go together.
</P>
<P>
"Israel could not obtain peace and settlements at the same
time as the settlement policy destroys negotiations and
contradicts with it," said the Egyptian top diplomat after
meeting with a high-level Palestinian delegation.
</P>
<P>
Moussa held talks today with Saeb Erekat, Minister of Local
Government of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Hassan
Asfour, Palestinian negotiator, and Zuhdi Kedra, Palestinian
Ambassador to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which focused on the latest developments of the
peace process, took place on the eve of the talks by PNA Chairman
Yasser Arafat with President Hosni Mubarak and Moussa Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here this evening, will discuss the
obstacles facing the peace march with the Egyptian president
within the framework of their continuous coordination and
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
intensified its diplomatic drive to salvage the peace talks
stalemated since the Netanyahu government sent bulldozers to break
ground on the new Jewish settlement on Har Homa, East Jerusalem,
on March 18.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has banned the sale of land through unauthorized agents
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank in order to counter Israel's
expansion of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday
in an effort to revive the deadlocked peace talks, the second
meeting of theirs since September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat demanded Israel to halt unilateral activities related
to settlement expansion in Palestinian areas and to suspend the
construction of the settlement in Har Homa, also known as Jabal Abu
Ghoneim, in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> 100 Rwandan Refugees Die on Way of Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 refugees were stamped to
death or died of suffocation today in Kisangani, Zaire, when they
fought to catch a train, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP)
quoting the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)
officials.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Paul Stromberg, a UNHCR spokesman based in
Kisangani, as saying that a panic struck the refugees when
thousands of them tried to get on the train.
</P>
<P>
The train, which over the past three days had been sending
refugees to an airport from where they would be flown back to
Rwanda by the UNHCR, could not hold so many people, said
Stromberg.
</P>
<P>
As the accident took place on the other side of the Zaire River
running across Kisangani, the UNHCR immediately ferried medical
teams across the river to rescue the refugees, he said, adding
that at least 50 other refugees were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, who were from the Biaro refugee camp 40
kilometers south of Kisangani, fled the camp to nearby forests in
April, one month after the rebels took Kisangani. They returned to
the camp recently waiting to be repatriated to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,800 refugees were sent away on the train on Saturday,
and some of them were flown home to Kigali, Rwanda, today.
</P>
<P>
The Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila gave the UNHCR
60 days to repatriate the refugees, estimated at between 30,000
and 60,000.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are in charge of running the trains for the
repatriation, while the UNHCR is now providing logistic support to
them.

<HEADLINE> HABITAT Boss Announces Revitalization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official has
announced a revitalization action plan for the U.N. Center for
Human Settlements (HABITAT) in response to constructive criticism
of the administrative and financial performance of the center.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, HABITAT Executive
Director Wally N'Dow said that the plan focuses on specific,
measurable goals to be accomplished within concrete timetables.
</P>
<P>
The 23-point plan provides for restructuring of the HABITAT
along the programmatic lines defined by the HABITAT Agenda
adopted in June last year at the Second U.N. Conference on Human
Settlements (HABITAT II) in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that the plan will improve operational links
between its headquarters and the field, and streamline
information flows within the organization.
</P>
<P>
The plan presents a revised financial strategy aimed at more
energetic and focused fund-raising, tighter control over
expenditures and a more transparent and efficient financial
reporting system.
</P>
<P>
The release stressed that the implementation of the plan will
start immediately to achieve tangible results on most issues by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
At the on-going 16th Session of the U.N. Commission on Human
Settlements, the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services
(OIOS) issued a report on the review of the program and
administrative practices of the HABITAT.
</P>
<P>
The OIOS report recommends, among other things, integration of
research and technical cooperation activities of the center,
strengthening of regional activities and improved internal
communication flows.
</P>
<P>
The OIOS report is one of two assessment reports tabled at the
commission meeting, which is held to review the center's mandate
with a view to its revitalization.
</P>
<P>
The other report is sponsored by the governments of Denmark,
the Netherlands, South Africa and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Group 77 developing countries and
China, Indian delegation leader Srinivasan said that management
and financial matters deserve the attention of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Opening the session on April 28, Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi noted that while it is important to make HABITAT more
effective, accountable and transparent, the center also needs
more resources and support to fulfill its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands delegation pointed out at the session which is
scheduled to end on May 7 that the main concern of the commission
at this session should be to ensure that the HABITAT Agenda is
implemented.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Netherlands government expected the
center to come up with its own proposals for restructuring.

PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Louis Bonaparte, the great great-nephew
of former French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte I, died on Saturday in
his residence in Prangins, Switzerland, at the age of 83, reported
the Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Louis Bonaparte was the chief of the Napoleon family since 1926

Born on January 23, 1914 in Brussels, he spent his youth in
Britain and Belgium. He was arrested by German troops after
briefly joining the Foreign Legion of the French army during World

He spent his post-war time in North Africa and Zaire, working

<HEADLINE> Canada's Housing Sector Strong in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's housing sector maintained
its momentum in the first quarter of this year, assisted by
favorable prices and low mortgage rates, Statistics Canada
reported today.
</P>
<P>
And the value of residential building permits rose for the
third straight quarter to the highest level since the first
quarter of 1990, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
Between January and March, municipalities issued 3.4 billion
U.S. dollars in building permits for new housing, up 13.5 percent
from the last quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Renewed consumer confidence and more affordable housing make
the short-term outlook for new housing construction positive --
especially if mortgage rates and housing prices remain relatively
stable," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, non-residential construction intentions rose
10.4 percent to 1.9 billion dollars in the first quarter. These
gains were partly offset by a decline in commercial construction
permits.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan to Hold Substantial Talks in Male </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian External Affairs
Ministry's spokesman said today that prime ministers of India and
Pakistan will hold substantial talks on all issues of mutual
interest in Male, capital of the Maldives on May 12, where the two
leaders will attend the summit meeting of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting between I.K. Gujral and Nawaz Sharif has been
raised to an official dialogue from the earlier impressions that
they would be meeting in the fringes of the SAARC summit, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In the dialogue, the two leaders would be assisted by their
respective foreign secretaries, the high commissioners in the two
capitals and heads of the territorial divisions in their
respective foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a series of issues were being discussed
between the two countries at various levels.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possibilities of any tangible results from
these talks, the spokesman said, "I can't anticipate any thing at
this stage."
</P>
<P>
Since last year, leaders of India and Pakistan have expressed
their desire to improve their relations through peaceful talks.
The two countries resumed foreign secretary-level talks at the end
of March this year, which had been stalled during the past three
years and both sides have decided to continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, which was formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> FBI Chief: Catastrophic Mechanical Failure Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Louis J. Freeh said Sunday that a "catastrophic
mechanical failure" is the cause of the crash of Trans World
Airlines Boeing 747 flight 800.
</P>
<P>
The FBI chief made his rare comments after 10 months of
intensive investigation of the mid-air crash that happened over
long Island, New York, and killed 230 people just after the plane
took off from Kennedy International Airport for Paris on July 17,
1996.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the evidence, as we've developed it to date, and
particularly the evidence which we have not found, would lead the
inquiry toward the conclusion that this was a catastrophic
mechanical failure," Freeh said, appearing on the NBC television
program "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
The FBI investigation once involved about 500 agents around the
world, checking wreckage of the plane or forensic evidence of a
blast and tracking terrorists and examining the lives of each of
the victims in search of possible motives for a mass murder,
according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
For months, the leading theory among officials in charge of the
investigation has been that a spark of static electricity, caused
by fuel flowing through the tank or spraying from a leaky fuel
line, triggered the explosion of fuel vapors.
</P>
<P>
Freeh's remarks sent the strongest signal yet that the FBI was
moving toward abandoning its search for clues to a crime in the
air disaster and emphasized the need to draw the criminal inquiry
to a close, the newspaper noted.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges US to Stop Support for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today called for the
United States to stop its support to Israel until the Jewish state
changes its hardline policies as regards the Middle East peace
process, reports reaching here from Doha said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held in the Qatari capital of
Doha today, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam al Majali urged
Washington to put an end to its support to Israel until Israel
changes its policies, Qatar's Gulf news agency said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan made the appeal because such support will
affect the peace process in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister, who is on a three-day official
visit to Qatar, said that Jordan has proposed that the
U.S. should not only be a sponsor "of the Middle East peace
process, but also be an "effective partner."
</P>
<P>
King Hussein went to the U.S. for a prostrate operation at the
end of March and he stayed there until April 10. During the stay,
he held talks with officials of the U.S., the Palestinian
National Authority and Israel on the Middle East peace process,
which has been deadlocked due to an Israeli settlement project in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision on the Jewish settlement expansion has
faltered the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and sparked
world-wide criticism.
</P>
<P>
Majali said that Israel should commit itself to the
implementation of the agreements it signed with the Palestinians
before.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that U.N. resolution 242 is the basis for
achieving peace in the Middle East. The resolution, inked in
1967, provides that Israel should withdraw all its troops from
the occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel now is disregarding the "land for peace"
principle and putting obstacles on the peace track, the Jordanian
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has taken advantage of the concept and claimed
that the word 'land' means Israeli land and Israel gives
Israel's land to Palestinians for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister said that his country will
continue to make efforts with other countries to bring Israel
back to the negotiation table.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU) special
envoy to the Mideast Miguel Moratinos expressed here today his
optimism over the peace process despite present difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League (AL) and the EU are working together on
bringing Arab and Israeli viewpoints closer and furthering peace,"
Moratinos told reporters after a meeting with AL Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
However, the current phase is "very crucial and decisive," said
the EU envoy who is currently on a four-leg regional tour, which
includes Jordan, Syria, Israel and Egypt, to restart the peace
process deadlocked for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the EU and the AL would boost their present level
of cooperation to put an end to the stalemate on the various peace
tracks.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief has affirmed full Arab commitment to the peace
option as a strategic aim to be realized through coordination with
various parties, including the EU, said Moratinos.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the current peace stalemate, I still feels optimistic
towards the peace process," he said, adding that the European and
Arab positions on peace are very clear.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that Tuesday's meeting between Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli President
Ezer Weizman would produce a positive outcome to the peace
process, deadlocked since Israel began construction of a Jewish
settlement in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Cairo Airport Sunday night on the last
leg of his Middle East tour, Moratinos described the next few days
as "crucial in our efforts to revive the peace process."

MANCHESTER, England, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Four-time Olympic
champion Deng Yaping beat fellow Chinese Wang Nan in four sets to
grab the women's singles event at the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, quick on her feet and with a powerful
right-handed attacking game, triumphed 12-21, 21-8, 21-11, 21-10
to become the first Chinese to win three world championship
singles titles.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who plays a left-handed topspin game in the handshake
grip, noneplussed the world No. 1 player as she created wide
angles with backhand to release a devastating forehand, winning a
lopsided opening set.
</P>
<P>
Deng, whose forehand requires a split-second timing, made it
one-all through powerful smashes and an excellant block defence.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Wang, who had beaten her rival in a domestic
competition last year, fell to the superior reflexes and power of
Deng, losing the ensuing two sets.
</P>
<P>
Deng had won the singles event in the 1991 and 1995 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
Li Ju and Wu Na, both from the southeasten Chinese province of
Jiansu, finished joint third.
</P>
<P>
In the last world championships, Deng led her teammates to a
sweep of the women's singles top four places as China won all the
seven titles.

<HEADLINE> King of Spain Visits Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 5 (Xinhua) -- King Juan Carlos I of Spain and Queen
Sophia arrived here today for a three-day state visit to Russia,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Spanish monarch is to meet Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to discuss bilateral relations and a new
European security order and NATO's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The King's visit will focus on boosting trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries, which, in the Spanish
opinion, is obviously insufficient and by no means corresponds to
the potentialities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The king is accompanied by about 80 business leaders and
bankers, who intend to meet their Russian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The king is also to meet Moscow Mayor Yuri Luahkov and
Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and All Russia.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko met for the first time
with the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila. Mobutu said he would
relinquish power, but only to a transitional authority that would
organize elections. Kabila insisted that power be handed directly
to him and vowed to press on with his military campaign.
</P>
<P>
-- The Texas authorities continued searching for two missing
members of a group that claims Texas is an independent nation.
They vanished as the group's leader was surrendering to end a week-
long standoff. The authorities said the men were surrounded and
would be captured soon.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent
Kabila were brought together by South African President Nelson
Mandela for a 80-minute meeting, at which the two rivals presented
differing plans to end the fighting and then agreed to meet again
in eight to 10 days. The two leaders' proposals appeared to differ
manily on the timing and manner of Mobutu's departure.
</P>
<P>
-- A Senate committee said it plans to question CIA
Director-designate George Tenet at his confirmation hearings this
week about Democratic campaign contributors, the Iran-Bosnia
controversy and other subjects that ripped up President Bill
Clinton's previous nominee Anthony Lake.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- With a budget blueprint finally in hand, President Bill
Clinton and the Republican Congress now face the really hard part
of building the spending and tax laws to implement it.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's Labor Party, barely taking time to catch its
breath after its biggest election victory ever, got down to
governing over the weekend while the opposition Conservative Party
began the painful process of picking up the pieces.

<P>
ANKARA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Eight Turkish soldiers and one
village guard were shot dead when rebels of the Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) launched attacks in Hakkari province bordering
northern Iraq, local daily "Turkey" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the PKK militants raided the soldiers,
who were on duty at Uc Memeler place in Cukurca of Hakkari at
02:00 local time Sunday morning. The PKK rebels also wounded 25
soldiers and one village guard with gun shots and rockets.
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldiers were rushed to a military hospital in
Hakkari and the injured village guard was taken to Hakkari State
Hospital for treatment, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper, citing government officials, said that the Turkish
security forces started large-scale military operations in order
to capture the PKK militants who caused the incidents in Hakkari.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war in southeastern
Turkey for autonomy, in which more than 21,000 people, including

<HEADLINE> Swedish Ericsson Ponders Shifting Head Office Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Swedish telecommunications company
Ericsson is studying the feasibility of shifting its head office
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson Managing Director Lars Ramqvist said that the reason
for the move is that the tax levels in Sweden make it impossible
to convince the company's foreign managers to come to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Ericsson's plan to move its head office abroad,
the Swedish Tax Minister Thomas Ostros said that as far as the
company's foreign directors in key positions are concerned, the
government is considering making a set of new tax rules for them.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said that he thought Ericsson is operating under
favorable conditions in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Liberal leader Lars Leijonborg has appealed to Ericsson
not to make a decision at this point until the general election in
1998.
</P>
<P>
If the election results in a non-socialist take-over, he
promises that the conditions for the company will be improved.

<HEADLINE> African GDP Rises in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary data of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) today indicated a
3.96 percent increase of Africa's average economic growth, the
highest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The growth trend will continue this year, said the ECA in a
report which predicted a 4.2 percent gross domestic product (GDP)
growth for the region in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"There are strong grounds for optimism regarding growth
prospects for Africa in 1997," said the annual report on the
economic and social situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It said the economic performance in 1996 compares very
favorably with the average population growth rate of 2.8 percent
for the region, representing a turn-around in real per capita
income in almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 33 least-developed African countries
registered a growth rate of 4.5 percent, well above the regional
average and confirming a strong rebound and sustained momentum
in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate reached no less than six percent in
11 countries and three to six percent in 28 countries.
</P>
<P>
In the agricultural sector, the growth rate hit 5.2 percent
last year, forming the major factor behind the strong economic
recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cereal production was 22 percent higher in 1996 than in 1995,
easing the pressure on food supply, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ECA quoted the food and agriculture organization of the
U.N. index of agricultural production as saying that there was a
rise of 1.8 percent in output per head.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the mining registered positive growth of
6.6 percent last year with a steady growth of 2.5 percent in the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
During the period, export receipts increased by 8.7 percent
with a four percent rise in volume and a 4.7 percent hike in
prices.
</P>
<P>
Imports grew by 9.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said the external debt of African countries jumped
from 328.7 billion U.S. Dollars in 1995 to 340.5 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1996 when the debt service payment hit 24 billion U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate remained in double digits in most part of
Africa in 1996, though there was substantial progress in lowering
the upward pressure on prices in some countries.
</P>
<P>
The human condition in Africa remained as daunting as ever,
with almost two-thirds of the population living at or below the
absolute poverty line, it added.
</P>
<P>
The improvement was due to the deepening of market-based
private-sector-driven policies, favorable weather conditions, a
rise in export revenues particularly for the oil-rich countries,
and better terms of trade, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with faster and more sustained growth on
other continents, Africa's share in world production and trade
continued to decline to no more than two percent in 1996, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Iodized Salt Needed to Fight Iodine Deficiency in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Hou Peisen, of the National Office
of Endemic Disease Control of the Chinese Ministry of Public
Health, said here today that the use of iodized salt will continue
to play a leading role in China's battle against Iodine Deficiency
Disorders (IDD).
</P>
<P>
"At present," Hou said, "people in 85 percent of the Chinese
territory are using iodized salt. The widespread use of iodized
salt is vital to the elimination of IDD by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
The country plans to set up 109 iodized salt plants that can
produce eight million tons annually to meet the nation's demands
for iodized salt, Hou told Xinhua today, which is national IDD Day.
</P>
<P>
Authorities need to improve controls of the salt market and
crack down on illegal dealing in iodine-free salt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng committed China to eliminating IDD by
the year 2000 when he signed the "World Declaration for the
Survival, Protection and Development of Children" on March,
1991. Since that time, the use of iodized salt has become a major
means of curbing IDD because it is an effective and easy way.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, has set up
the National Leading and Coordinating Group for IDD Control to
take charge of production, distribution and quality control of
iodized salt, by cooperating with public health, salt industry,
quality control, education, and transportation departments.
</P>
<P>
"Since 40 percent of the world's people living in IDD areas are
in China, or more than 400 million people, the country still faces
a great challenge," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency can result in low levels of intelligence in
infants, children, and adolescents. There are about six million
babies born in China's IDD areas annually who are thought to run
the risk of suffering from IDD if the problem is not tackled
soon.

<HEADLINE> China to Control Marine Fish Catches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The circular was approved by the State Council, China's highest
governing body.
</P>
<P>
The state will limit the number of fishing vessels involved in
marine production and the horsepower of their engines. Up to the
year 2000, the total number of fishing vessels in the country
should be no more than 265,620, the circular says, giving specific
horsepower limitations.
</P>
<P>
All new and imported fishing vessels must get Ministry of
Agriculture approval and have necessary documents and licences.
</P>
<P>
The State Council says that all provinces and autonomous
regions need to bring the number of fishing vessels under control
and deal sternly with vessels that have no name, proper
certificates, or identification of home port.
</P>
<P>
New fishing licences issued by the Ministry of Agriculture will
go into effect as of July 1, and no new fishing vessels will
obtain licences approved by the Ministry in the period up to July
1.
</P>
<P>
China's marine industry increased at an annual rate of 11.4
percent over the past 12 years with the national catch reaching 10
million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, excessive catches have led to a decline in the number
of fish in rivers, posing a serious threat to sustained
development, the circular said.

<HEADLINE> 30 People Killed in Road Accident in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police confirmed this
morning that 30 people were killed with scores injured Sunday
afternoon in one of the most horrific road accidents in Kenya
this year.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six people died on the spot while four others died
later in hospital.
</P>
<P>
It was feared that the death toll may rise as several people
are still in critical conditions in hospitals in Nairobi, Nakuru
and Naivasha.
</P>
<P>
The multiple crash happened at a trading center called Tukei,
three kilometers from Naivasha on the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that a long-vehicle trailer with a full
load of maize meal and wheat flour had a brake failure as it
motored downhill towards Naivasha.
</P>
<P>
"The trailer driver had full headlights on when it rammed into
the eight Nissan Matatus (mini-buses) which were closely trailing
each on the climbing lane," they added.
</P>
<P>
A ruling party official was reported to offer his vehicle to
ferry the injured to hospital, and immediately sent out an SOS to
rescue teams in capital city of Nairobi for assistance.
</P>
<P>
A 70-year-old villager told local reporters that he had never
seen such an accident in which the bodies of dead victims were
piled up.
</P>
<P>
The Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner, Mohammed Yusuf Haji,
today sent a message of condolences to the bereaved families.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to drivers in the country to take maximum care on
the roads as most accidents occurred due to human error.

JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has announced that he will convene another meeting within
10 days between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel
leader Laurent Kabila, according to sources reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said this at the end of the first face-to-face talks
on the Zairean crisis aboard a South African naval ship, which
was moored at the Congolese port of Point-Noire.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute talks Sunday, mediators said that Mobutu
offered to hand over power to an elected president, while Kabila
insisted that his forces should be the transitional authority in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has been making efforts to mediate the warring
sides in Zaire, told a press conference on the ship that the next
meeting would try to narrow the gap between Mobutu and Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no agreement on a ceasefire, the South
African president said Kabila had expressed willingness to continue
negotiations until it leads to the end of hostilities.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Grain Yield to Increase: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's grain production will
improve this year although some areas have been affected by
natural disasters, according to a survey quoted by local
newspaper the Noticias today.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by a joint team of the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization, World Food Program and South
African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
The expected improvement is due to the hike of sown areas by
two percent and of agricultural workers by 2.5 percent and the
better supply of means of production, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
However, about 125,000 to 150,000 people need food relief in
the southern African country in the coming three months.
</P>
<P>
The grain yield hit a record high of 1.37 million tons in the
country last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Companies Warned of Alliances With Foreign Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean experts have warned that
the increasing alliances between the country's electronic
appliance and telecommunications companies and multinational
giants might endanger the interests of local cooperators.
</P>
<P>
An executive of a Korean conglomerate said that the domestic
businesses need to take a more cautious approach toward teaming up
with international giants as "we might end up digging our own
graves."
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies can take advantage of its South Korean
partner's sales network to expand their presence in the market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean enterprises recently accelerated marketing
cooperation with potential foreign competitors by establishing
joint sales agents in South Korea, and the results, however, have
beaten South Korean party's will.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the American computer giant IBM
Corp.'s share in South Korea has risen rapidly since its tie-up
with LG Electronics Inc., a leading Korean computer manufacturer,
to market both LG's desktop personal computers (PCs) and IBM's
notebook PCs several months ago.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of IBM's notepads, which was around 2,500
units last year, soared to 7,200 units in the first quarter this
year, or 14 percent of the South Korean PC market.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, LG's desktop PC sales volume was little changed
at about 80,000 units in the quarter, they said, adding that IBM
received most of the benefit from the corporate marriage.
</P>
<P>
Anam Electronics Co. has also been importing and selling large
screen TV sets and washing machines in a marketing alliance with
Japan's Matsushida Electronic Co. since 1995.
</P>
<P>
More recently, two of the Hyundai Group subsidiaries have
teamed up with Ado Electronics Co., also from Japan, to set up a
PC distributor in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Also in the auto industry, import and sales agents of foreign
carmakers mainly affiliated with South Korean giants have been
launching a marketing drive for U.S. and European cars, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Through these agents, foreign carmakers have secured a firm
marketing foothold and are now switching to a direct selling
system, they said.

STOCKHOLM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Moderate leader Carl Bildt
has said that the policy adopted by the Swedish government on the
European Monetary Union (EMU) is detrimental to the country.

In an recent interview to the Swedish press, Bildt criticized
the government for not going in for EMU participation from the

majority within the Social Democratic Party in favor of Sweden
joining the EMU from the start in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Family Name Covers Largest Number Of The World's People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The family name Li belongs to some
87 million people, or 7.9 percent of the Han people, knocking
Zhang out of its place as the most widely-used family name in the
world.
</P>
<P>
According to a study of the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Genetics, there are 11,969 surnames among China's 56
ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The number of people with the names Li, Wang, Zhang, Liu, and
Chen totals 350 million. Zhao, Zhu, and Kong, which were at the
top of the list in ancient books on Chinese family names, rank
7th, 14th, and 72nd respectively in the lastest book on Chinese
family names, the Great Dictionary of Chinese Family Names. Zhang
is given by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most
widely-used.
</P>
<P>
The book was compiled by two professors at the Institute of
Genetics, Yuan Yida and Du Ruofu. It is based on studies of the
rate of occurrence of Chinese surnames, sponsored by the State
Foundation of Natural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The book includes 5,327 single-character family names, 4,329
two-character family names, and over 2,310 names that have from
three to nine characters.
</P>
<P>
Professor Du explains that many problems were caused by the
fact that too many Chinese people have the same family names. He
suggests that the country come up with regulations on the use of
family names to ease the problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that associations should be formed to develop the study
of family names, and that it could benefit the study of genetics,
anthropology, sociology, and other sciences, and could help reform
the use of family names.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty for Selling Land to Israelis: PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- In a move to intensify its fight
against Israel's settlement expansion, the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) warned today that Palestinians who sell land to
Israelis would face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
PNA Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein said that death penalty
would be imposed on any Palestinian who sells land to Israelis,
whether directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
This was according to a new ban, passed by the PNA cabinet
Saturday, that outlaws any sale of land by Palestinians through
unauthorized agents. The ban, affecting all of the Gaza Strip and
West Bank, covers areas now beyond the PNA control, including
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The PNA ordered the ban because it discovered that many
Palestinian owners had sold their land to Arab or foreign
dealers working for Israeli companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, all rights on land dealings now belong to
the PNA, which will approve all land deals and all real estate
agents.
</P>
<P>
PNA cabinet secretary Abu Abdel Rahman said that PNA had
ordered Palestinian security forces and judicial apparatus to
implement the ban and to punish anyone charged with
unauthorized selling of land.
</P>
<P>
Fighting Israel's settlement expansion has been top at the
PNA's agenda, especially after Israel began the controversial
building of the Har Homa settlement in southeastern Jerusalem,
leading to the current deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process. Most of the land in Har Homa were sold to Israeli
companies by Palestinian landowners.
</P>
<P>
In the Old City of East Jerusalem, some Jewish companies
devote to buying land and real estate from Palestinian owners as
part of the campaign to expand the Jewish presence in the hotly
disputed holy city.

to Project Love of Humanity at today's ceremony.
</P>

discovered that many women and children still suffer from
illnesses in the poverty-stricken areas because of a lack of
sufficient medicines, and they also found that a number of PLA
soldiers living in mountainous areas suffer from arthritis.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi said
here today that the return of Macao will help further the
frienship and cooperation between China and Portugal instead of
harming bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the President of the Portuguese Parliament
Almeida Santos in Beijing today, Qiao Shi, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC), said that China and Portugal have coordinated well in the
Macao issue and are unanimous in their attitude in this regard.

<P>
In recent years, there have been frequent exchanges of
high-ranking officials, bilateral ties have entered a new era, and
communication between the NPC and the Portuguese parliament has
made considerable progress, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest developing country and still faces

are of great significance to the development of bilateral
relations, and said that sound co-operation between Portugal and
China on the Macao issue in the past has laid a solid foundation
for further coordination.
</P>

MANCHESTER, England, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Reigning Olympic doubles
champions Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang trounced the French duo of
Jean-Philippe Gatien and Damien Eloi in straight sets at the
semi-finals of the World Table Tennis Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Chinese controled the table with excellent short
returns and wide-angled forehand attacks, winning 22-20, 21-7,
21-9.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchmen, who made the Olympic semi-finals last summer,
lost the first set point as Eloi netted a backspin serve by Liu.
</P>
<P>
Upset with the narrow loss, the French pair conceded two sets
in a row as almost half of their forehand attacks failed to find
the mark.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu will take on the Swedish duo of Jan-Ove Waldner
and Jorgen Persson in the final late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Former world singles champions Waldner and Persson, partnering
for 17 years, outlasted Japanese Koji Matsushita and Hiroshi
Shibutani 21-19, 13-21, 21-18, 18-21, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish tandem, quarter-finalists in both the 1995 Worlds
and the Atlanta Olympic Games, yielded the second set as the newly
crowned Qatar Open champions got on their nerves with consistent
chopping play.
</P>
<P>
Waldner and Persson then pressed on their rivals with
wide-angled topspin forehands to put it 2-1 up.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese had led 11-7 in the third set until the Swedes
clawed back to 14-all. But the Swedes' momentum ended here and
they saw the Japanese level the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
The top Swedish combination led all the way in the deciding
set, overwhelming the Japanese with aggressive forehand attacks.
</P>
<P>
Sweden won their last world doubles title through Peter
Karlsson and Thomas von Sheele in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian Trade Minister Mondher
Znaidi said today that his country supports lifting the
embargo imposed on Iraq so that the latter will return to its
Arab community.
</P>
<P>
Znaidi made the remarks in an interview with the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) here today after the ninth session of the
Iraqi-Tunisian Joint Committee wound up its work.
</P>
<P>
The determination of the leaderships of the two countries to
deepen ties of fraternity between them serves bilateral interests
and leads to the achievement of the desired inter-Arab economic
integration, he said.

The Tunisian trade minister added the current session of the
Iraqi-Tunisian Joint Committee has shown that both sides are
willing to diversify their economic relations and promote their
bilateral exchanges.

cooperation in the fields of trade, industry, oil, energy,

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Complete Works of Cervantes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held in Beijing today
to mark the 450th birthday of Miguel De Cervantes and to honor the
publication of "The Compete Works of Cervantes", the first time
all of the Spanish writer's works have appeared in China in
translation.
</P>
<P>
Cervantes once said he wished that a Chinese emperor would mail
him a letter and ask him to bring Don Quixote to China, but he
never lived to see his dream come true.
</P>
<P>
His most famous novel, "Don Quixote", was first translated into
Chinese in 1922 as part of the "New Culture Movement", whose goal
was to learn from Western literature. There are now more than 10
Chinese versions.
</P>
<P>
Yu Youxian, director of the Press and Publications
Administration of China, said at the ceremony, "The knight,
astride a skeleton of a horse and holding a long lance, has
appeared before generations of Chinese and the eyes of Chinese
readers, who are so enthusiastic about him."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people like Don Quixote not only for his naive and
straightforward manner, but also because he resembles something in
Chinese society, according to Chen Zhaochun, president of the
People's Publishing House, the book's publisher.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that Lu Xun, the Chinese literary master of the
1920s, used Don Quixote as a mirror in which to reflect China's
political and social evils.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who has visited Spain, said that Cervantes was as great as
Shakespeare during the Renaissance, and that the publication of
his complete works will allow Chinese readers to get to know that
the great novelist was also a dramatist and a poet.
</P>
<P>
The eight-volume collection contains 3.2 million Chinese
characters and was translated by some of China's best scholars.
</P>
<P>
Cervantes's works, along with other Western classics, were
banned during the Culture Revolution (1966-76) because they were
considered decadent, and it was not until the late 1970s that the
translation work and publication were resumed. So, "The work can
be described as a milestone," said Yu.
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremony was held by the Ministry of Culture, the
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, the Press and Publication
Administration, and the People's Literature Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siyuan and Buhe, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress; Wan Guoquan, Vice-Chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference; and Spanish diplomatic envoys to China
attended today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Juan Lena, Spanish ambassador to China, wrote a letter of
congratulation, saying that the publication would help increase
mutual understanding between Spain and China.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will soon
introduce new fees in universities and other higher institutions,
the official New Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Muzali Jibril, executive secretary of the National
Universities Commission was quoted as saying in the southern Port
Harcourt recently that the decision was taken in the light of
chronic shortage of funds to take care of the nation's 37
universities.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary said it had been recommended that
tuition remains free, while hostel fees would be 90 Naira (about
one U.S. Dollar) per bed space.
</P>
<P>
Jibril, however, said that any tuition increases by
universities would be within the unregulated charges in which
"universities are free to increase fees in line with their own
perception."

any country, Jiang noted that both China and Russia are willing to

Sierra Leone rebel commandos in the camp."

"Senior Sierra Leonean rebel commandos now want all fighters to
be allowed to surrender but their Liberian counterparts are
opposed to this," one rebel called Black Jesus told investigators.

<P>
Five female commandos who tried to escape from the camp were
"butchered" to death, the surrendered rebels said.

<P>
The military said out of the 60 surrendered rebels, 26 were
from the south, 22 from the north, six from the east and the rest
from the western area which includes the capital.

and a Palestinian taxi was hit in the second explosion, wounding
seven Palestinian passengers inside the car.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation in
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), said the bombings were
carried out by Islamic Jihad suicide bombers who were recruited
by Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli agents provided explosives to the two
bombers who both missed the Israeli-claimed targets -- Israeli
school buses. He added that Israel plotted the bombings in order
to hurt the standing of PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Shaath made the accusation after Palestinian security agency
arrested an Israeli agent who reportedly recruited the two
Islamic Jihad suicide bombers. Ibrahim Halaby, 27, was shown at
a news conference Sunday held at the PNA Ministry of Information
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Halaby confessed that he was recruited by Israeli secret
police in 1988 and his job was to infiltrate Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, the two leading anti-Israeli militant Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
He said that he recruited the two suicide bombers under order
of another Israeli agent who provided the explosives, which were
donated prematurely by Israeli agents before the bombers reached
the targets.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombings, Israel and the PNA traded accusations
over the responsibility for the bombings. Israel blamed the PNA
for failing to prevent the bombings, while the PNA held Israeli
agents for plotting the bombings in order to pressure to crack
down on Islamic militants. Nevertheless, the PNA security forces
launched a crackdown on the Islamic Jihad, arresting dozens of
its activists including Halaby.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister's Office issued a statement Sunday,
describing the PNA's charges as a "grotesque lie." Israeli
security officials said the PNA was trying to "blacken" Israel,
while refusing to restore full security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of verbal war came on the eve of the arrival
of United States peace envoy Dennis Ross, who is due here
Tuesday on another mediation mission.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the main purpose of Ross' visit
was aimed at stepping up the Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation that has been at a very low level since Israel began
the controversial building of the Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Banks Post Higher Profits in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi banks have posted an
increase of 11.6 percent in net profits in the first quarter of
1997 compared to the same period of last year, according to bank
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
The net profits of 11 out of the kingdom's 12 banks for the
first three months this year recorded 1,634 million Riyals (435.7
million U.S. dollars), showed financial statements from the 11
banks.
</P>
<P>
The statements showed that the rise in income was primarily
due to a 27.8 percent increase in income from investment
securities which stood 1,653 million Riyals (440.8 million
U.S. dollars) for the first three months this year.
</P>
<P>
An 8.2 percent increase in income from banking services, which
recorded 342 million Riyals (91.2 million U.S. dollars) for the
three-month period, also helped increase the banks' profitability,
according to the statements.
</P>
<P>
But the banks' income was partially offset by a decline of
interest income and an increase in staff costs and loan
provisions, the statements said.
</P>
<P>
The largest absolute increase in net income has been reported
by National Commercial Bank (NBC) to be followed by Riyadh Bank,
Samba, Arab National Bank and others.
</P>
<P>
NCB's net profits rose by 44 million Riyals (11.7 million
U.S. dollars) to reach 267 million Riyals (71.2 million U.S.
dollars) in the first quarter of this year compared with 223
million Riyals (59.5 million U.S. dollars) in the same period
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the end of March this year, the loans to customer deposit
ratio of the 11 banks taken as a whole stood at 58.9 percent
compared to 64.8 percent a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Meet in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
began talks here this morning on obstacles facing the Mideast
peace process and efforts to give new life into the process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Sunday evening, is the fourth Arab
leader Mubarak has met in a week amid stepped-up efforts to
restore the Mideast peace talks derailed since Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu gave the order to begin a new
settlement in East Jerusalem on March 18.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president recently made brief visits to
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria and met with the heads of state of
these countries.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-hour meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Friday, Arafat stressed his confidence in the Arab support
to get Israel back to the peace wagon, saying he relies much on a
"cohesive Arab stance."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian leader has expressed his conviction
that the U.S. would not bring along any new proposals to the
stalled Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure Ross will not bring with him anything new," Arafat
said, on the eve of another swing of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
to the region starting this week.
</P>
<P>
Since his mission to the region two weeks ago, the U.S.
efforts so far have been limited to demanding a zero terrorism
from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has banned the sale of land in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank through unauthorized agents in order to counter Israel's
expansion of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Netanyahu's voiced readiness to take
good-intentioned measures toward the Palestinians, Arafat said
these measures must be comprehensive and stressed that Israeli
practices on Judaizing Jerusalem are a "serious crime."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he and Moussa reviewed problems obstructing the
peace process, primarily the erection of Jewish neighborhoods in
Jerusalem in contravention of the already-signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, for his part, said Egypt is working for salvaging the
peace process and contributing its own ideas for breaking the
current peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday
in an effort to revive the deadlocked peace talks, the second
meeting of theirs since last September.

<HEADLINE> Australia Stresses Economic Ties With Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today stressed the importance of Australia's economic ties
with Europe at his meeting with visiting German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Howard told a joint press conference after one and half hours
of talks with Kohl this morning that the talks covered a wide
range of bilateral issues as well as world political and economic
matters.
</P>
<P>
"I emphasized to the chancellor that despite the very strong
affinity between Australia and the Asia-Pacific region, the bulk
of our direct investment goes into the European Union."
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely nothing incompatible between our
association with the Asia-Pacific and our ties with the nations of
Europe," Howard told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived in Australia last Friday, said his first
visit to this country as the chancellor of the reunified Germany
is to inject a new quality into the economic, political and
cultural relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of carbon dioxide emission targets, Howard said his
country is opposing the emission reduction targets which are
supported by the United States and the European Union and would be
submitted to a climate change conference in Kyoto, Japan, in
December.
</P>
<P>
Australia is arguing that it is unique among industrialized
nations in being a net energy exporter and any targets should take
into account each country's particular circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said, "I told the prime minister I would see to it at home
in Germany and in the European Union that we have to be careful,
and I myself will personally get involved in the greenhouse gas
issue, preventing that Australia should be placed in a position
where it is in the dock."
</P>
<P>
Last week Howard tried to persuade visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to support Australia's position, but
the Japanese leader only said he hoped confrontation could be
avoided at the Kyoto conference.

<HEADLINE> Convicts in Malaysia to Take HIV Test Before Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- All convicts in Malaysia will
have to undergo a blood test before their release to ensure that
they are free from the AIDS-causing HIV under an official program
to be implemented soon.
</P>
<P>
The test, to be done earlier than their release date, is to
prevent the disease from being spread among the public, a senior
Malaysian official in charge of prison affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
The program is an integrated strategy planned with the
cooperation of the Health Ministry and will be implemented soon,
Prisons Director-General Mohamed Zaman Khan told reporters after
opening a HIV/AIDS counseling course for prison counselors in
Langkawi, a famous resort island in northwestern Malaysia,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The test result would allow the convicts to be counseled for
them to be more responsible upon returning to their family and
society, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The test is also to identify whether the HIV was contracted in
prisons even though no such cases have been reported so far, he
said.
</P>
<P>
All prison staff would be given counseling on HIV/AIDS by the
counselors who attended the course, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six prison counselors are attending the course.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, 1,228 convicts in the country were
HIV/AIDS positive including 14 women last year compared to 363 in
1991 and 90 percent of them were drug addicts using hypodermic
needles and those involved in prostitution.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Open New Channel to Indian Ocean via Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- According to authoritative sources
from southwest China's Yunnan Province, China has reached an
agreement with the Myanmar government on the joint development of
Irrawaddy River, a major inland river of Myanmar, to open a new,
short channel to the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the move is "of profound impact" for
China's general opening-up, but especially for opening-up drive in
southwest China, whose inland location and poor transport system
have impeded economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the channel starts from Kunming,
Yunnan's provincial capital, and extends along China's No. 320
National Road. Entering Myanmar via Ruili, a land port in
southernmost Yunnan, the road goes about 100 kilometer further to
Bhamo, a major harbour of the Irrawaddy River. From the harbour
1,300 kilometers down the river is Rangoon, capital city of
Myanmar and a sea port to Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Transport experts indicate that the new route provide a
convenient channel for China and Myanmar. "There is no need to
make a detour from Strait of Malacca to enter or exit southwest
China," one expert notes. "Still an inland province, the land
ports along the Sino-Myanmar border in the future could be a trade
entrepot for surrounding inland provinces, including China's most
populous Sichuan Province and the underdeveloped Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the traditional routes linking Kunming to major
seaports, such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Facheng of Guangxi, the
distances can be shortened 5,800 km, 3,400 km and 2,050 km,
respectively. "The trade volume between China's inland provinces
and other countries in and out of the region is expected to soar
after the opening," he concludes.
</P>
<P>
Conditions now are ripe to push forward the project which was
initiated in the early 1980s. The stable political situation in
north Myanmar and good neighborly relationship between the two
countries are believed to be an impetus to the project. Sources
revealed that China and Myanmar are to sign a land-river joint
transport agreement in the second half of this year. The two
countries will also give the go-ahead for co-building some
industrial and agricultural projects in Bhamo.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the border trade between the two
countries has thrived since the mid-1980s. The trade volume
between the two countries last year was 410 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly weaker in trade that was markedly diminished by public
holidays in Japan and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 78.28 U.S. cents from 78.32 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign exchange dealers said the local currency is
expected to gradually strengthen throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
They said increased speculation that the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) would not cut interest rates further was
strengthening the value of the local currency against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The RBA would hold its monthly board meeting tomorrow and
economists do not expect a change in rates.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed slightly
weaker against the Japanese yen, at 99.06 from 99.27, but up
against the Deutsche mark, at 1.3524 from 1.3486.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Post Office has
begun a campaign to strip the crown insignia off its letter boxes
throughout the territory in preparation for the handover,
according to today's press reports.
</P>
<P>
Contractors for the Post Office braved heavy rain yesterday to
unscrew the insignia from the red boxes.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of boxes to have the facelift were on Queen's
Road, which will keep its name after June 30. The exercise is
expected to be completed by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The insignia will be returned to Post Office headquarters, but
the mode of disposal is still unknown. New logos are expected to
set in next week.
</P>
<P>
The move came as government departments continued to brush off
colonial vestiges by dumping old insignia for future display in
museums.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Looks for More Open-Sky Pact Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is considering having
open-sky agreements with other countries besides the United States
in an effort to boost its aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
Among the countries and regions are intermediary destinations
for long-haul flights such as South Korea, Taiwan and Japan,
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said last night in
Ipoh, 205 kilometers northwest of here, according to the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted as saying, "Discussions on the idea of
open sky pacts with the respective authorities are under way."
</P>
<P>
Ling said a Malaysian-U.S. open-sky accord, now being
finalized, is expected to be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is among the first Asian countries that will be
signing such a pact this month to liberalize air travel between
them and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would give Malaysia Airlines (MAS) the right to
fly anywhere in the United States instead of only Los Angeles, to
which MAS currently flies six times a week.
</P>
<P>
This augurs well for MAS' expansion plans since it could now
look forward to securing landing rights in other parts of the
United States, especially New York or Washington.
</P>
<P>
The open-sky agreement, designed to deregulate commercial
aviation, would eliminate restrictions on the number of carriers
and their possible routes and there would also be no more
restrictions on charter flights.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would also open code-sharing opportunities
between airlines. MAS, for example, could sell Delta Airlines
tickets in Kuala Lumpur to passengers flying from Los Angeles to
any point within the United States and split the revenue with
Delta.
</P>
<P>
The open-sky policy would increase tourism and business as
people take advantage of cheaper air travel brought about by
increased competition between air carriers.

<HEADLINE> 50th World Health Assembly Opens in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from 191 member states of
the World Health Organization (WHO) met here today to debate the
1997 World Health Report and other worldwide health issues.
</P>
<P>
During the 50th World Health Assembly, which is scheduled to
last 10 days through May 14, extensive debates are expected on the
annual health report "Conquering suffering, enriching humanity."
</P>
<P>
The 1997 annual report highlights the worldwide situation of
chronic conditions, which are now increasing in importance as a
result of lengthening life expectance and changes in lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Other items on the agenda, said a WHO press release, include
the proposed 1998-1999 Program Budget and the Geneva-based United
Nations specialized agency's reforms and response to global change.
</P>
<P>
"Issues related to reform at WHO will be high on the agenda" of
the Assembly, said WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima, who has
recently announced that he will not run for a third term.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary reform, a key element in the reform process, has
concentrated on developing a more transparent and user-friendly
strategic program budget for consideration by the assembly.
</P>
<P>
Draft Policy for the 21st Century, a renewed Health-For-All
Strategy, calls for member states, nongovernmental organizations,
U.N. partners and the private sector's involvement in WHO's reform.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 World Health Assembly is expected to adopt the
finalized policy which will be based on two fundamental
principles: equity and solidarity, said the WHO press release.

submit his power to an elected president.

<P>
ANKARA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani President Gaidar Aliyev
arrived here today for a four-day official visit to Turkey to
enhance the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Turkey, Aliyev is to meet with Demirel,
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Turkish press reports have said that one of the major topics to
be discussed between Aliyev and Demirel will be the Caspian Sea
oil issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has put forward a proposal of transporting the Caspian
Sea oil from Azerbaijan, along the planned Baku-Ceyhan (southern
Turkey) route, to the world markets but this tentative idea has
not been approved by Azerbaijan so far.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Azerbaijan are expected to sign a number of
bilateral agreements on maritime, energy, small and medium-size
enterprises, and social security issues during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes only a week after Aliyev and his Armenian
counterpart Levon Ter-Petrosyan held a summit meeting under the
mediation of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev and Petrosyan held the summit in Istanbul, the largest
city in Turkey, on April 28 on the dispute over the status of

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Djibouti have
planed to set up an embassy in each other's capital city in order
to further enhance bilateral ties, Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the move by Djibouti, whose ambassador in Tokyo is now
accredited to Malaysia, to establish an embassy here would also
help the republic to have links with the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Djibouti also planned to expand bilateral
cooperation through trade and education and embark on exchange of
visits between their officials and leaders, Abdullah told
reporters after a one-hour meeting with visiting Djibouti Foreign
Minister Mohamed Moussa Chehem here today.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that initially, Malaysia had agreed to receive
Djibouti's senior officials involved in planning to hold
discussions with officials at the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in
the Prime Minister's Department, the Treasury and relevant
departments involved with development here.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister said that business opportunities would
also be further explored in both countries for purposes of
investment especially by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also welcomed Djibouti's interest to send more
students to study in local institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
At present, 11 students from the republic are studying at
Malaysia's International Islamic University (IIU).
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister said that students from Djibouti wishing
to pursue higher education here would have to observe the normal
procedure for the intake of students.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Meet in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
began talks here this morning on obstacles facing the Mideast
peace process and efforts to give new life into the process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Sunday evening, is the fourth Arab
leader Mubarak has met in a week amid stepped-up efforts to
restore the Mideast peace talks derailed since Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu gave the order to begin a new
settlement in East Jerusalem on March 18.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president recently made brief visits to
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria and met with the heads of state of
these countries.
</P>
<P>
Stressing his confidence in the Arab support to get Israel
back to the peace wagon, Arafat said he relies much on a
"cohesive Arab stance."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian leader has expressed his conviction
that the U.S. would not bring along any new proposals to the
stalled Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure Ross will not bring with him anything new," Arafat
said, on the eve of another swing of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
to the region starting this week.
</P>
<P>
Since his mission to the region two weeks ago, the U.S.
efforts so far have been limited to demanding a zero terrorism
from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has banned the sale of land in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank through unauthorized agents in order to counter Israel's
expansion of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Netanyahu's voiced readiness to take
good-intentioned measures toward the Palestinians, Arafat said
these measures must be comprehensive and stressed that Israeli
practices on Judaizing Jerusalem are a "serious crime."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he and Moussa reviewed problems obstructing the
peace process, primarily the erection of Jewish neighborhoods in
Jerusalem in contravention of the already-signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, for his part, said Egypt is working for salvaging the
peace process and contributing its own ideas for breaking the
current peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday
in an effort to revive the deadlocked peace talks, the second
meeting of theirs since last September.

<HEADLINE> Samsonov, Waldner Dampen China's Hope for Title Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Europeans Vladimir
Samsonov and Jan-Ove Waldner dashed China's hope for a repeat of
the seven-title clean sweep at the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles semifinals, Samsonov of Belarus, who
ranked fourth in the world, snatched the first victory over
defending champion Kong Linghui in their fourth encounter, whereas
Sweden's world No. 2 Waldner routed Chinese penholder Yan Sen in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
China, which bagged all seven titles in the 1993 Worlds in
Tianjin, China, have retained the top honors at the men's and
women's team, women's singles and mixed doubles events.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu Guoliang, the Olympic champions in Atlanta, are
the only Chinese combination left in the men's doubles semi-finals
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Yunping and Chai Po Wa, a China-Hong Kong duo, and three
Chinese pairs have reached the women's doubles last four.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Samsonov said that his victory over the world
top-ranked Kong had a special significance.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for Europe since no European reached the
semi-finals at the last championships," said Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov put up ferocious topspin play and solid defence to win
the first two games. Kong cashed in on Samsonov's momentary slips
of attention to pull one point back.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set had been a seesaw game until Samsonov pulled
away 19-16. Normally composed Kong was crushed under pressure as
he made a forehand return off the end to face the match point.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese made a desperate forehand attack to put it 17-20
and then had a backhand return too long to concede the match.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, struggling in form throughout the team competition,
has reached his dizzying height. The 31-year-old Swede hasn't
lost a set in his singles campaign.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who trounced Waldner 21-6, 21-7 in a team match a
week ago, expected a tough battle against Sweden's 1992 Olympic
champion.
</P>
<P>
"The score like 21-6, 21-7 is not normal," said Samsonov. "The
result of tomorrow's game is unpredictable."
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles semi-finals, Olympic and reigning world
champion Deng Yaping trounced fellow Chinese Li Ju in straight
sets.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, who has twice won the world singles
championship, overwhelmed the world No. 5 21-12, 21-19, 21-7.
</P>
<P>
Deng, the most successful female player of the modern era, will
take on the 19-year-old Chinese Wang Nan in Monday's final.
</P>
<P>
Wang clinched the final berth by beating Wu Na 29-31, 21-10,
21-16, 21-15 in the other all-Chinese match.
</P>
<P>
Known for steady nerves and lethal forehand attack, Deng kept
pressing on the 19-year-old rival while Li failed to play to her
best and made a lot of errors.
</P>
<P>
Wang vs Wu game was a clash of same styles and left-handers.
</P>
<P>
There were less swings in the opening game which went virtually
point for point until Wang missed a return to lose 29-31.
</P>
<P>
The narrow loss seemed to jolt Wang into action as she began to
find her mark with strokes from both wings, taking three sets in a
row.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Lift Sanctions on Iraq Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China is calling for the settlement
of Gulf War issues, including lifting the sanctions imposed on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that
the settlement of the problems at an earlier date is in the fundamental
interests of the people in the gulf region, and peace, stability, and
unity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Qian told visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz
during their talks that China always sticks to the principles that
relevant parties should solve the problems left by the war on the
basis of complete implementation of resolutions of the Security
Council, and that Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity
should be respected by the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that China appreciated Iraq's stand of continuing
cooperation with the United Nations, and hoped that UN departments
would accelerate the process of inspecting Iraq's arsenal, and
objectively and justly appraise Iraq's efforts to carry out
relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council in order to ease
and gradually lift the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is satisfied with the constant development
of Sino-Iraqi ties since the two countries established diplomatic
ties 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
China would like to advance its ties with all Arabic countries
including Iraq on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz expressed thanks for China's objective and just stand on
the Gulf issue, and spoke highly of China's independent foreign
policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
He extended congratulations to the Chinese government on
resuming the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq would continue to cooperate positively with
UN departments so that the sanctions on his country would be
lifted at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also expressed the hope that China, as a permanent member
of the UN Security Council, would play an active role in the
council in making contributions to the peace and stability in the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Aziz is here at the invitation of Qian on a four-day official
visit.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila's Income Tax Reform in Hard Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives recently approved a bill granting higher income
tax exemptions that would directly benefit one-third of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, a family of six would be exempted from
an income tax of 146,000 pesos (about 5,570 U.S. dollars) a year,
or an exemption of 120,000 pesos (4,580 dollars) for a working
couple and 6,500 pesos (248 dollars) for each of their dependents.
</P>
<P>
Reform on personal income tax was the third and last part of
the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package launched by the government.
The first two parts, restructuring of oil taxes and the shift from
ad valorem to specific taxes (based on sales volumes) on beer and
cigarettes, were signed into law last year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was put under the supervision of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1962 for serious economic
problems. After the country's economy recovered and even
registered fast growth in recent years, the IMF started
considering Manila's exit from the IMF, but it insisted that
Manila should first complete its tax reform.
</P>
<P>
Top government officials had promised the IMF to approve the
tax measures before May 1 this year. President Fidel Ramos also
wanted the early passage of the bill, so he could present it as a
gift to workers on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
However, the President failed to do so because the bill was
still pending in Congress due to serious clashes over tax
exemptions among the government, the House of Representatives and
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The House first proposed a total exemption of 184,000 pesos
(7,022 dollars) for a six-member family, announcing this was the
lowest level for a family to keep a decent life.
</P>
<P>
But senators accused that the House's exemptions would damage
the poor's interests. They said such a higher level would result
in huge revenue losses for the government and force the government
to spend less on infrastructure and public services including
education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they planned a 30,000-peso-exemption (1,145 dollars)
for a married couple and 6,500 pesos (248 dollars) for each of the
five dependents in a family.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department of Finance (DOF) said the government
would have an annual revenue loss of 37 billion pesos (1.4 billion
dollars), therefore, the House bill would put the country's fiscal
and economic stability in great danger. The DOF favored 10
percent, 20 percent and 30 percent tax rates for different income
levels.
</P>
<P>
Under the combined pressure from the Senate and the DOF, the
House agreed to lower its exemption level to the current 146,000
pesos (5,572.5 dollars) last month after a caucus attended by
members of the House Ways and Means Committee, the opposition bloc
and other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvement, the Senate and the DOF were still
unhappy. Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, chairman of the Senate Ways
and Means Committee, insisted that the latest version of the House
was "simply unacceptable" and needed an "overhaul".
</P>
<P>
Losing hopes of getting its version adopted by the Lower House,
the DOF became confident that the Senate would correct the
"mistakes" made by the House.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said it was different political interests that
caused the repeated delay of the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
The country will have a national election next year. Many
lawmakers in the House had expressed the desire to run for the
Presidency or a second term in Congress, so they preferred higher
exemptions to woo voters.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, often in clashes with the administration controlled
House, repeatedly opposed the tax versions of the House while the
DOF were worried over the health of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Although passed in the House, analysts said, it was still hard
to tell the fate of the income tax bill. After being delivered to
the Senate for deliberation, the Senators might reject it and
replace it with their won version. Even if approved in the Senate,
it might also face a veto by the President.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, analysts said whether Manila would have a graceful
exit from the IMF in June would be decided by how quickly the
three parties involved could find a middle ground and strike a
compromise.

<HEADLINE> China Raises Share-issue Quota by 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) - China will raise the total quota of
new shares to be issued this year to 15 billion yuan worth (about
1.8 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said the
increase of five billion yuan was set last year but not announced
when the ten billion yuan's quota was originally made public late
last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase is deemed necessary to meet the demands of the
large- and medium-sized state-owned companies that have been
selected by their local governments to issue shares on the
country's two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according
to a commission's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The focus of share-listing this year is on the state-owned
large and medium-sized enterprises. Since the firms recommended
by the local governments for new share issues this year are
relatively large in size, the announced quota proved not to be
enough to meet their demands," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5.5 billion yuan's worth of shares were issued last
year by the state enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: No New Proposal From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat has expressed his conviction that the
U.S. would not bring along any new proposals to the stalled
Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, who arrived here Sunday evening,
made the statement following a two-hour meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit precedes another swing of U.S. special envoy
Dennis Ross to the Middle East starting this week. Since his
mission in the region two weeks ago, the U.S. efforts so far
have been limited to demanding a zero terrorism from the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure Ross will not bring with him anything new," Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief President Hosni Mubarak today on the
obstacles facing the peace process and the ongoing efforts to
breathe new life into the talks, derailed since Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu sent bulldozers to begin a new
settlement in East Jerusalem on March 18.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has banned the sale of land through unauthorized
agents in the Gaza Strip and West Bank in order to counter
Israel's expansion of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>

good-intentioned measures toward the Palestinians, Arafat said
these measures must be comprehensive and stressed that Israeli
practices on Judaizing Jerusalem are a "serious crime."
</P>
<P>
In a gesture to rebuild confidence, Israel has set a
high-level meeting with the Palestinians and promised a more
even-handed policy with Arabs and Jews, including launching
within two weeks a housing project for Arabs near the Har Homa
Jewish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he and Moussa reviewed problems obstructing the
peace process, primarily the erection of Jewish neighborhoods in
Jerusalem in contravention of the already-signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
On how far the Palestinian side depends on Arabs to get Israel
back to the peace wagon, Arafat said he relies much on a
"cohesive Arab support."
</P>
<P>
This Arab stance was clearly manifested in the recent
Arab League and U.N. Security Council meetings as well as the
Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamabad summit.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, for his part, said Egypt is working for salvaging the
peace process and contributing its own ideas for breaking the
current peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
However, he said every side has its own ideas but all ideas
must come up with the exigency of halting building Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday
in an effort to revive the deadlocked peace talks, the second
meeting of theirs since last September.
</P>
<P>
Amid intensified peace efforts in Cairo, EU Special Envoy to
the Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos, who is shuttling in the
region, will meet Egyptian officials today.

8,945 "Jetta" cars in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a rise of 88.7 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the company, a Sino-German joint
venture, auto manufacturer made more than 9,000 cars from

modern assembly line with the production capacity of 150,000 cars
a year. The assembly line was completed last year when the
auto market was recovering after more than three years of
depression.
</P>
<P>

and using sales agents, which were implemented since last year,
have been key factors to help promote the growth of the company's
business.
</P>
<P>
The company now produces Audi luxury sedans and three
categories of Jetta cars, with more choices of colors. The company
employs more than 150 sales agents who are headquartered in 30

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Comply with Accords with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas today urged Israel to comply with the provisions of various
agreements reached with the Palestinians by withdrawing from all
occupied Arab territories and recognizing the basic political
rights of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day seminar on the Palestinian issue here, the
minister said Israel must now salvage its credibility by complying
with the agreements reached with the Palestinians - not
selectively, sporadically and conditionally, but with consistency
and fairness.
</P>
<P>
Only on this basis can the parties resume a productive dialogue
on the remaining key issues and get back on the road to peace,
Alatas said at the U.N.-sponsored seminar, titled "United Nations
Asian Seminar and NGO (non-governmental organization) Symposium on
the Question of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
The seminar is being attended by about 200 representatives from
the host government, the United Nations agencies as well as
representatives from diplomatic missions accredited in Jakarta,
media representatives, non governmental organizations,
universities and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
Alatas pointed out that the signing of the Hebron protocol on
January 15, 1997 should be followed by negotiations on other
contentious issues, including settlements, refugees, borders as
well as the final status of the occupied territories, including
Jerusalem - within the time-frame stipulated in those accords.
</P>
<P>
The states of Asia constantly and vigorously advocated in all
international forums that the Palestinians be set at liberty to
exercise their fundamental rights including their right to
self-determination, Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently called for the full implementation of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425
(1978) and for the recognition of the principle of land-for-peace
which constitutes the corner-stone for peace in the Middle East,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
For the peace process to succeed, he said, the role of the U.N.
is indispensable. Meanwhile, it is important that Asia's
solidarity with the cause of the Palestinians and its unwavering
support for their struggle for a just, durable and comprehensive
peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
To Indonesia, Alatas reaffirmed that Israel's occupation of
Arab territories is a fundamental issue. "No diplomatic relations
between Indonesia and Israel can be envisaged as long as the
Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict are not
peacefully and justly resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
At today's opening session, representative of the U.N.
Secretary-General also made his statement for achieving a just,
comprehensive and lasting solution of the Palestinian issue.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Statesmen of China and Japan should
constructively deal with problems concerning the Sino-Japanese
ties so as to ensure the healthy and stable development of the
bilateral relations, China's top legislator Qiao Shi said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should be far-sighted and adhere to the
principles of the Sino-Japanese Communique and the China-Japan
Treaty on Peace and Friendship, said Qiao, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, during his
meeting with a delegation from the Japanese Dietmen's League for
Japan-China Friendship headed by its President Hayashi Yoshiro.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that this year witnesses the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of the Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties. In the past 25
years, he said, the general trend of the bilateral ties is good
because the exchanges on every aspect between the two countries
have enjoyed significant advancement.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there exist some problems and differences in
the bilateral ties, and the Chinese side hopes that Japan could
draw lessons from history and educate the younger generation with
them to safeguard the development of the friendship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hayashi Yoshiro said that the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of the bilateral ties deserved commemoration and
celebration from both countries. Although there were twists and
turns during the last 25 years, the friendship and cooperation are
the guiding principles of the bilateral ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side will bear firmly in mind the instruction of
late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai -- lessons learned from the past
can guide one in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The league is the largest organization of the Japanese Diet,
composed of 480 dietmen.

<HEADLINE> Deep Blue Beats Kasparov in Second Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer
beat Russian world chess champion Garry Kasparov in the second
game of their six-game rematch, evening the score in the series
at one-all.
</P>
<P>
Deep Blue -- an upgraded version of the computer Kasparov beat
in Philadelphia in 1996 despite losing the first game -- forced
the Russian to resign at the 45th move.
</P>
<P>
The new computer is twice as fast as the original and can
calculate 200 million possible moves per second, or up to 100
positions within the three minutes usually allowed for a move in
tournament chess.
</P>
<P>
The championship match, sponsored by the Association for
Computing Machinery, will be decided over the course of six
rounds.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov won the first game of this series in 45 moves
Saturday, prompting IBM technicians to work to improve Deep Blue
overnight.
</P>
<P>

ANKARA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino
is expected to pay an official visit to Turkey soon at the
invitation of his Turkish counterpart Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News reported today that the invitation
to Fino was conveyed personally to him by Turkish Ambassador

<HEADLINE> China to Commend Disabled and Models in Helping Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 122 disabled persons, and many
groups and individuals who have helped the disabled will be
commended in a national conference scheduled in Beijing on May 13
and 14.
</P>
<P>
The 122 disabled persons are praised for their self-reliance
and unremitting efforts in self-improvement to be a useful person
to society.
</P>
<P>
Eighty groups, 80 individuals, 80 "homes for the disabled," and
31 social workers will also be praised during the two-day
commendation ceremony organized by the Coordinating Committee for
Work on the Disabled under the State Council, China Disabled
Persons' Federation, and several other organizations.
</P>
<P>
This will be China's second large-scale commendation for the
disabled and those who have made notable efforts on behalf of the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
China first commended some handicapped persons and model groups
and individuals for helping them nationally in May of 1991.
</P>
<P>
There are about 60 million disabled persons in China, and the
Chinese government has made the promotion of the welfare of the
disabled an important part of its endeavors to protect human
rights in the country.
</P>
<P>
China's legislature promulgated the Law on Protection of the
Disabled in December of 1990, setting the third Sunday in May each
year as the National Day for Aiding the Disabled.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China aims to provide enough to eat
and wear for all its disabled, help three million disabled persons
eliminate their disabilities to various degrees, and ensure that
about 80 percent of handicapped children or adults receive
compulsory education or find jobs respectively.

<HEADLINE> China to Cancel Half of University Specialities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission plans
to slash the number of university specialities by half, bringing
the number down from 624 to some 300.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Binglin, director of the commission's Higher Learning
Department, announced here today that the plan will be released
next year and carried out in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It will directly affect enrollment, training, graduation, and
employment, as well as teaching programs and educational systems
as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that the Chinese universities were fragmented into
over-specialized narrow fields, and some of the specialities are
uncalled-for.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the reasons why many graduates can not find
jobs, Zhong explained.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese university specialities are not in accordance with
the modern norms, thus the Chinese universities can not compete
with their foreign colleagues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities began to establish specialities in 1952
based on the Soviet model.
</P>
<P>
"The reform will transform the country's system of cultivating
professional talents, and it will have an great impact on
China's social, economic, scientific, and cultural development in
the 21st century," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhong did not reveal what specialities will be canceled and
what will remain, saying that the question is still under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that after the reform is carried out, for a few
universities, only one or two specialities will continue to
survive.
</P>
<P>
The country now has some 1,000 universities.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms in Race for Radar Deal with Indian Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign firms are reported to have
been in race for a 200 million US dollar deal of advanced radar
with the Indian navy.
</P>
<P>
India plans to buy a maritime surveillance radar to the naval
version of advanced light helicopter (ALH). While the heavier
naval ALH is undergoing its prototype tests, a number of
international firms are gunning for the Indian Defense Ministry's
contract to supply the ALH radar.
</P>
<P>
Among those in the race for the Indian contract is the US firm
Texas Instruments, besides Israeli, French and British firms.
</P>
<P>
Among the radars on offer is one by Daimler-Benz Aerospace
(DASA), the German high-technology giant, which is said to have
unique "turnaround" facility by which the spotted ship can be
electronically viewed from different angles. These virtual visuals
are compared from a data bank to identity the ship.
</P>
<P>
The radar, called "ocean master", is a compact, lightweight
system specially designed for maritime surveillance and is
particularly efficient in terms of discretion and detection
capability.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Defense Ministry is likely to make a shortlist and
ask the selected parties to prove their systems in trials before
deciding on whom to buy the radar from.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's textile and garment
industries, often referred to as "sunset industries," will be much
boosted by a low-interest loan program offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
The 25 billion baht (1 billion U.S. dollars) program will help
the two sectors invest in new technology over the next three
years, allowing them to produce high-quality goods at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
For some years Thai garment manufacturers have been looking
forward to producing high-quality goods for export. However, one
problem they face is the low quality of local textiles. As a
result, they have to rely on costly imported fabrics, which
increase their costs and make their goods less competitive.
</P>
<P>
Of the total loan, 2 billion baht (80 million dollars) will be
available this year, 7 billion baht (280 million dollars) in 1998,
and 16 billion baht (640 million dollars) in 1999. The loan will
have an average annual interest rate of 9.43 percent, considerably
lower than loans from commercial banks, with a seven-year
repayment period.
</P>
<P>
Investment in new technology is expected to help local textile
producers upgrade product quality and productivity.
</P>
<P>
Technology is considered the key to producing the kind of
upmarket garments Thailand needs to export.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that leading garment exporting countries in
Europe, such as Italy and Germany, can maintain healthy exports by
selling high value-added products despite labor costs as high as
19.52 dollars and 31.6 dollars per hour respectively, as compared
with Thailand's 8.48 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most Thai factories in both upstream and downstream industries
still use old machines which leading garment exporting countries
have long since abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Even though now it is the era of shuttleless production, more
than 80 percent of Thai weaving firms still use shuttles. In 1995,
Thailand had about 97,000 weaving machines, 80,000 of which were
the shuttle-type. And the average age of 88 percent of the
machines is 25 years.
</P>
<P>
In the spinning industry, 70 percent of the spinning machines
are more than 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
New dyeing machines are also needed to reduce production cost
and improve the environment because new machines produce less
waste water.
</P>
<P>
For the garment industry, computerized machines are needed for
pattern design, clothes grading, cutting, spreading and sewing.
Technology can help manufacturers shorten delivery time.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has about 1,000 garment factories, but in the whole
country, there are only two computerized cutting machines, 11
computerized spreaders and 87 computerized pattern, design and
grading machines.
</P>
<P>
The textile and garment sectors account for about 10 percent of
Thailand's gross domestic product and employ 1.7 million workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to further cut costs, the government is urged to
waive tariffs on import of machinery and parts and reduce import
tariffs on chemicals used in bleaching, dyeing and printing.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World's Top Porcelain Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China has become world's largest
porcelain maker with industrial porcelain topping 1.6 billion
square meters a year, "International Business Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The country produces an average of 55 million pieces of
sanitary porcelain a year.
</P>
<P>
China has 800 large-and medium-sized porcelain factories and
several thousands of township-run firms. Foshan, Tangshan, and
Boshan are national famous porcelain production bases.
</P>
<P>
Some 440 enterprises have imported 2,000 automatic porcelain
pressers from Italy, Germany, Japan, and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the rapid development of the porcelain
industry to the rising demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, urban districts have seen completion of
buildings with a combined floor space of 300 million sq. m. while
the building space in rural areas averaged 600 million sq. m. in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, 230 new cities and 5,000 townships will be
added, requiring a huge amount of porcelain, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
A government official predicted that China would retain the
place of top porcelain maker through 2001.

KUNMING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China has been promoting new
eco-friendly method to produce sulphur, to end the destructive
pollution caused by sulphur refining.
</P>
<P>
The method, developed by the environment scientific research
institute in southwest China's Yunnan Province, is expected to
expand the scale of production.
</P>
<P>
The process has been used in 32 sulphur factories in

<HEADLINE> Major Car Makers in India Face Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Major multinational car makers in
India such as Daewoo, Pal-Peugeot, Ford Mahindra and Mercedes-Benz
India are among the car companies that face action for failing to
honor their export obligations.
</P>
<P>
Director-General S. B. Mahapatra of the Directorate-General of
Foreign Trade (DGFT) has said he would first call a meeting of all
the offending companies to assess the reasons behind their failure
to fulfill their obligations under the memoranda of understanding
they signed with the DGFT.
</P>
<P>
The matter is also formally being brought to the notice of the
Foreign Investment Promotion Board.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a number of foreign automobile companies applied to
the government for large projects in the country based on the
assembly pattern of manufacture. This led to fears that unchecked
imports of spare parts by major Car Makers would result in a large
foreign exchange outflow, apart from minimizing the employment
benefits of the projects, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent such a development, the Commerce Ministry has laid
down the condition that each company would have to submit its
business plan for the subsequent five years and this plan would
then be converted into an memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what action can be taken legally against the
companies since they have signed no bond or guarantee and the
export obligations undertaken by them are more in the nature of a
"gentleman's understanding," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The directorate could rule that no new licenses for imports of
kits/components will be given till previous export obligations are
met, they added.

<HEADLINE> China Acts to Protect Xinjiang Coal Resources from Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China has been organizing scientific
workers to study new, efficient techniques that can help quickly
extinguish fires consuming vast area of coal resources in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the central government has also increased
funding and recruiting more people to form a stronger contingent
to put out fires on coal fields.
</P>
<P>
This way, 9.7 billion tons of hidden coal resources in Xinjiang
will be effectively protected from burning out, said Hou Xuecheng,
who is responsible for fire extinguishing work in the Xinjiang
coalfields.
</P>
<P>
As a coal-rich region, Xinjiang has a verified coal reserve of
1,600 billion tons, accounting for 35.7 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
However, due to dry and hot weather, many Xinjiang coalfields
are prone to natural burning which usually lasts a long time.
</P>
<P>
A latest geological survey shows that 42 out of Xinjiang's 88
coal production bases have naturally caught on fire. And some
coalfields of the region are still on fire, which is destroying
the region's coal resources at a loss of 4.2 billion yuan a year,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The current methods used to extinguish fires have been backward
and inefficient, said Hou, who also called for developing more new
fire extinguishing skills, to increase the speed for putting out
fires and enhance effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> Private Overseas Transfers to India Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Private fund transfers to India
from abroad topped a record 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1996-97,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Private transfer receipts continued their upward trend, rising
from 6.2 billion dollars in 1994-95 and 7.5 billion dollars in
1995-96, contributing to a robust outlook on the balance of
payments.
</P>
<P>
With the trade deficit turning out to be much lower than
anticipated, the current account deficit for 1996-97 is now being
projected at 1 percent of gross domestic product (3.5 billion
dollars) compared with the initial estimate of 1.4 percent (5
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
India received over 3.5 billion dollars of foreign capital
inflows in 1996-97, showing a marked rise from the previous year.
The spurt in foreign inflows forced the Reserve Bank of India to
step in and absorb the surplus U.S. dollars, sending foreign
exchange reserves surging by 5.2 billion dollars in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Officials here, however, have predicted a deceleration in
private transfer receipts from abroad this year. They argue that
the buoyancy in recent years has been the outcome of the
introduction of full convertibility of the rupee on the current
account.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's health authorities have
decided to take new measures to control the rampant prevalence of
water-borne diseases in the country's rural areas, official
sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Health Service Department under the Health Ministry is

spreading in the monsoon, or rainy, season, which is less than one
month away this year, department officials said.
</P>

Sporadic outbreaks of diseases like gastroenteritis, diarrhea,
typhoid and hepatitis have been frequently reported in the rural
areas without adequate sanitation and drinking water facilities
during the monsoon season, claiming hundreds of lives every year.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the health authorities will provide
information about preventive means against such diseases through
mass media and pay special attention to keep drinking water safe
by distributing bleaching powder to rural families.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the Health Ministry showed that more than 7,550
cases of diarrhea were registered across the country in 1995 with
a death toll of about 300.

<HEADLINE> Thai Feed Producers Demand Maize Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai animal feed producers have
demanded that the Commerce Ministry allow 200,000 tons of maize to
be imported.
</P>
<P>
Maize supplies in the local marketplace stood at only 3,000 to
4,000 tons per day, while the feed industries needed at least
10,000 tons per day. As a result, maize prices are spiraling,
according to Prasit Damrongchitanonda, president of the Thai
Animal Feed Producers Association.
</P>
<P>
Maize prices have jumped to 4.75-4.90 baht (18.27-18.85 US
cents) per kilogram since mid-April and would rise further as the
end of the harvest season approached.
</P>
<P>
Animal feed producers are worried that their operation plans
would be hurt by the government's hesitation to import since it
would take about two months for those imports to begin rolling in.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to approve imports beginning this
month, saying they could not wait for the next harvest season in
late August.
</P>
<P>
However, the Internal Trade Department claimed that market
demand was equal to supply for the March-June period.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Increase Coal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to increase
its coal export volume from 3.8 to 4 million tonnes this year, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's state-owned coal corporation Vinacoal is trying to promote
its exports, hoping to reduce its losses on the domestic market due to
the government-set sale price which is lower than production costs.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vinacoal exported 3.6 million tonnes of coal to
China, Russia and Japan and other countries, grossing a value of
110 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vinacoal sources here said fund is badly needed to help
modernize its production technology.
</P>
<P>
At present, only 50 percent of the coal industry is functioning well
while 20 percent is outdated, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
By this year's plan, Vinacoal needs an investment of 550
billion vnd (one U.S. dollar equals to 11,646 vnd) for
modernization, of which 252 billion vnd is for construction and
273 billion for new equipment installment.
</P>
<P>
However, only 17.2 billion vnd are expected to come from the
state budget with 127 billion vnd coming from Vinacoal's own
fund.

<HEADLINE> New Regulations for Punishing Tourist Cheaters Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan, one of
China's top tourist attractions, has promulgated new regulations
to punish tourist workers found cheating tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, tourists who suffer from a
changed or reduced itinerary on the whim of irresponsible tourist
guides will be compensated.
</P>
<P>
Those held responsible for the malpractice will be subject to a
fine of 1,000 to 3,000 yuan, and a three-month suspension from
work.
</P>
<P>
Overcharging may lead to fine of ten times the amount
overcharged, and asking for commission and tips may result in a
fine of up to 10,000 yuan, the new regulations state.
</P>
<P>
A major sea resort in the South China Sea, tropical Hainan is a
fast-emerging tourist destination in China, which received 4.86
million tourists last year, including 400,000 foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the tourism boom, malpractices are also on the
rise, resulting in the increase in tourist complaints. Last year,
the province dealt with 289 such complaints, punished 200
law-violating travel agences and 190 tour guides.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the new regulations is seen as the latest
move to maintain the order of Hainan's tourist market.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Tourist authorities in
Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei Province, has designed a new tour
route which connects cultural attractions surrounding the city.
</P>
<P>
As one of the youngest Chinese provincial capitals,
Shijiazhuang lacks historical and cultural sites in the city
proper, but has cultural attractions on its outskirts which have
become hot tourist spots in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The newly-designed route, which takes two to three days, first
leads tourists to Bilu Temple, located 13 kilometers to the west
of the city.
</P>
<P>
Built in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the temple features
architecture of the period and a large number of invaluable art
treasures including bell and drum towers and murals devoted to
Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism.
</P>
<P>
From the Bilu Temple, visitors will be taken to Zhengding
County to the north of Shijiazhuang and on the
Beijing-Shijiazhuang Superhighway.
</P>
<P>
In Zhengding, one can visit Xinglong Temple where one can see
China's largest bronze thousand-hand Bodhisattva.
</P>
<P>
Other attractions in the county also include four ancient
pagodas featuring styles of different ancient dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Zhaoxian County located to the southeast of the city is the
third point on the new route, where travelers are exposed to the
world-famous ancient Zhaozhou Bridge and other cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The last place on the route is the scenic Cangyan Mountain,
which, located 72 kilometers away from Shijiazhuang, is a national
summer resort of the Taihang Mountain Range.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- In the first quarter of this year,
central government investment in western China surpassed that in
the country's eastern coast, according to a survey conducted by
the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The rate of investment to east China grew by 12 percent, to
central China grew by 18 percent and that to western China by 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
Central and western China covers 18 inland and less developed
provinces, autonomous regions, and cities. The area occupies 89
percent of China's territory and 64 percent of the country's total
population.
</P>
<P>
Central and western China has attracted Chinese and overseas
investors with their rich coal, petroleum, non-ferrous, and gas
resources, ample and cheap labor, and good development prospects.
</P>
<P>
Song Baorui, governor of southwest China's Sichuan Province,
said over 50 countries and regions had built 6,268 foreign-funded
firms in his province.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has utilized
1.4 billion US dollars from 60 countries and regions to build key
projects and develop pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
A development plan adopted in March 1996 by the Fourth Plenary
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, put forward five strategic measures to revitalize the
economy in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has also
announced five preferential policies for these areas last year.
</P>
<P>
Provinces in east China have rendered economic assistance in
various ways. By the end of 1996, more than 30,000 east-west
cooperative projects operated by township-run enterprises had been
built, with a total investment of 30 billion yuan.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a "brightness
project" to give eight million poverty-stricken people access to
electricity in five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Planning Commission, in the next five
years the project will provide a total installed capacity of
400,000 to 600,000 kilowatts of electricities for eight million
people, 10 percent of the total population in China living without
electricity.
</P>
<P>
The project will make the best use of the wind and solar energy
resources to produce the electricity. China has been able to
manufacture many kinds of wind-fueled power generator sets.
</P>
<P>
China boasts rich wind and solar energy resources, with the
total wind-energy reserve reaching 253 million kilowatts, and
two-thirds of the country's territory have over 2000 hours of
sunshine annually.
</P>
<P>
The project is the Chinese government's response to a proposal
put forward at the "World Solar Energy Summit" to carry out the
"brightness project" in the no-electricity global areas.
</P>
<P>
About 77 million people in China live without electricity,

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Manila stock market is expected
to break new support levels this week due to the absence of clear
market impetus that can bail out stocks from their current bottom
levels.
</P>
<P>
After breaking several support levels last week, the Philippine
Stock Exchange composite index (Phisix) closed at 2,605.65 on
Friday, down sharply by 265.72 points or 9.25 percent from its
previous week's level of 2,872.37.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the market is expected to take a nose dive
and test the 2,200 support level.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the 2,200 level is now the local bourse's
major support, while minor support is seen at 2,400.
</P>
<P>
Bearish sentiments will continue to prevail in the market, they
said, because of concerns in the market. They said pieces of good
news would hardly influence the market to make a rebound.
</P>
<P>
Fears of property bust and doubts in the banking industry's
loan exposure, among others, were blamed for the market's slump
last month.

her top rivals Martina Hingis and Steffi Graf, both due to
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Other top players in the 925,250-U.S.-Dollar tournament,
include Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Conchita Martinez, who will be
bidding for her fifth consecutive Italian title, Anke Huber and
Iva Majoli.

KIEV, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has
postponed a two-day trip to Turkmenistan dated on Monday as
Turkmenistan urged Ukraine to repay its energy debts before the

</P>
<P>
Ukraine's State Minister Anatoly Michenko said the Turkmen
Foreign Affairs Ministry sent a message to Ukraine on Friday,

Kuchma had scheduled to visit Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital,

Turkmenistan. One of the Agreements supposed to be signed is about
Turkmenistan's continuous supply of natural gas to Ukraine until

is responsible for importing natural gas from Turkmenistan, has
owed to the Central Asian country 205 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (63-64) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (63-64) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Who owns the land and natural resources in the Hong
Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Article 7 of the Basic Law stipulates that the land and
natural resources within the Hong Kong SAR shall be state
property, that the government of the Hong Kong SAR be responsible
for their management, use and development and for their lease or
grant to individuals, legal persons or organizations for use or
development, and that the revenues derived therefrom be
exclusively at the disposal of the local government.
</P>
<P>
That is to say, the state has only the right of ownership to
the land and natural resources within the Hong Kong SAR, whereas
the right to use them and all revenues derived from them go
exclusively to the government of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will there be foreign exchange controls in the Hong
Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hog Kong began removing controls on foreign exchange
trading in 1973, and has since gradually formed a free foreign
exchange market. Related policies will remain after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Article 112 of the Basic Law stipulates, "No foreign exchange
control policies shall be applied in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region. The Hong Kong dollar shall be freely
convertible. Markets for foreign exchange, gold, securities,
futures and the like shall continue. The Government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region shall safeguard the free flow
of capital within, into and out of the Region."
</P>
<P>
Simply stated, the open policies for Hong Kong's financial
markets will not be tightened after 1997, nor will the basic
policies of allowing free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar,
the free convertibility of foreign currencies, and the free entry
and exit of both capital and profits change.

<HEADLINE> Kasparov Found Weaknesses in "Deep Blue" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- World chess champion Garry
Kasparov, fresh off beating IBM's "Deep Blue" in the first game
of their six-game rematch, said Sunday he had found a few
weaknesses in the supercomputer.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the weaknesses to which
Kasparov referred were linked to the computer's ability to
evaluate certain extremely complicated positions hinging on the
human player's intuition and overall understanding of chess.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, a year after beating Deep Blue in Philadelphia
despite dropping the first game, played more cautiously in his
45-move victory against an improved version of the computer he
defeated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new version is twice as fast as the original and can
calculate 200 million possible moves per second, or up to 100
positions within the three minutes usually allowed for a move in
tournament chess.
</P>
<P>
The championship match, sponsored by the Association for
Computing Machinery, will be decided over the course of six
rounds.

<HEADLINE> China Looking for Qualified Managers For State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a massive
campaign to look for more qualified managers for its state-owned
enterprises in a bid to improve efficiency of such enterprises and
remove unqualified managers from their posts.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that the Organization Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee is asking all local
governments to send inspection teams headed by senior officials to
state-owned enterprises to inspect the qualifications of managers
who are selected.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the Chinese government's efforts to improve
the efficiency of state-owned enterprises. Unqualified managers
have long been a major factor in their poor economic performance,
sources say.
</P>
<P>
The Organization Department has also asked governors to be
fully responsible for the assessment of state-owned enterprise
managers and the picking of "able men" as managers.
</P>
<P>
This campaign is being applied extensively nationwide.

<HEADLINE> North China City Attracts More Investment from Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Linfen, in north China's Shanxi
province, has established 11 Taiwan-funded enterprises, with a
total investment of 170 million yuan (about 20 million US
dollars), according to official sources here.
</P>
<P>
By now, 43 overseas-funded enterprises have invested 675
million yuan in developing chemical, building materials, and other
industries in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, Linfen has been designated by
the provincial government as its first experimental city in
attracting Taiwanese investment. The city, where the first
Taiwan-funded enterprise was set up, was also one of Shanxi's
first cities open to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has sought investment and trade
opportunities by taking advantage of the opportunity when Taiwan
businessmen came to visit relatives, or the Fenyao Temple, and
Hukou Waterfall, major tourist attractions in Linfen.
</P>
<P>
The local government has offered favorable policies for land
use and taxes for overseas businessmen, and a consultation center
has been set up to handle investment affairs.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city raised one million yuan (120,000 US dollars)
in supportive funds for a group of Taiwanese-backed projects, the
official said.

his left thumb.
</P>
<P>
However, the 22-year-old Czech rediscovered his serving rhythm
in the second set and levelled the score.
</P>
<P>
In the decider Pioline, known for his nervousness in finals,
quickly moved to 3-1 lead only for Ulihrach to recover to 4-4. The

MANCHESTER, England, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Olympic and reigning

straight sets to cruise into the women's singles final at the
World Table Tennis Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, who has twice won the world singles
championship, overwhelmed the world No. 5 21-12, 21-19, 21-7.
</P>
<P>
Deng, the most successful female player of the modern era, will
take on the 19-year-old Chinese Wang Nan in Monday's final.
</P>
<P>
Wang clinched the final berth by beating Wu Na 29-31, 21-10,
21-16, 21-15 in the other all-Chinese match.
</P>
<P>
Known for steady nerves and lethal forehand attack, Deng kept
pressing on the 19-year-old rival while Li failed to play to her
best and made a lot of errors.
</P>
<P>
Wang vs Wu game was a clash of same styles and left-handers.
</P>
<P>
There were less swings in the opening game which went virtually
point for point until Wang missed a return to lose 29-31.
</P>
<P>
The narrow loss seemed to jolt Wang into action as she began to
find her mark with strokes from both wings, taking three sets in a

<P>
Samsonov, 21, said that his victory over Kong had a special

</P>
<P>
"It's very important for Europe since no European reached the

</P>
<P>
The victory, which Samsonov said he hadn't expected, will
certainly boost his confidence to be the king of table tennis.
</P>
<P>
"I had a poor record against the Chinese," said Samsonov. "But
in this championships I beat four Chinese and that will certainly
help my future."
</P>
<P>
Samsonov had downed Chinese rising stars Ma Lin and Wang Liqin
and the world top defensive player Ding Song in early rounds.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov put up ferocious topspin play and solid defence to win
the first two games. Kong cashed in on Samsonov's momentary slips
of attention to pull one point back.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set had been a seesaw game until Samsonov pulled

he made a forehand return off the end to face the match point.
