GRANT CALLS TRADE A BLESSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Horace Grant can't talk about his
relationship with Shaquille O'Neal without lapsing into hyperbole,
describing every chapter as either a mortal injury or a religious
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he feels that strongly about playing with the NBA's
greatest center.
</P>
<P>
   They were bosom-buddy Orlando Magic teammates for two seasons in
the mid-1990s, but a quick exit from the NBA Finals was followed by
O'Neal's exit from Florida. O'Neal defected to the Los Angeles
Lakers in 1996 and Grant took it hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Lennox Lewis or Mike Tyson punched me in my
stomach,'' Grant recalled. ``I went home to Georgia and spent a
whole week there and thought about my life without Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Four summers later, Grant is a Laker himself, courtesy of last
week's four-team blockbuster trade. Grant is thrilled with the
reunion and at age 35 just as thrilled to be in position to win a
championship alongside O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hope and pray, good things happen,'' Grant said
Wednesday, at a press conference at Lakers headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' chimed in Greg Foster, who also came from Seattle to
the Lakers in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a lot of people were doing a lot of praying for this
deal _ from the players, to the Lakers brass who were desperate to
trade Glen Rice and acquire some big bodies, to O'Neal himself.
O'Neal has been clamoring for a physical power forward ever since
he arrived here and had openly lobbied for Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had problems at the `four' spot. That will be no
more,'' O'Neal said in a separate interview. ``The nice thing about
Horace is, in Orlando when I played with Horace, when I wasn't in
position to get a rebound, most of the time he had it.''
</P>
<P>
   That, O'Neal said, will free him up to zip down the floor for a
fast-break outlet pass now and then _ ``That's an extra four to six
points on my average,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the 6-10, 245-pound Grant brings a physical
presence. He is a tough defender and rebounder who will relieve
some pressure from O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a big difference,'' O'Neal said. ``Me and Horace, we
played well together. Horace is very unselfish. Horace is one of
the greatest role players that I've played with. He doesn't worry
about scoring. He doesn't worry about a lot of stuff. But he knows
he's out there to defend and rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant averaged 7.8 rebounds last season, but that was as
Seattle's de facto (and undersized) center. He averaged nine
rebounds while playing alongside O'Neal in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won the championship last season despite using an
undersized power-forward tandem of A.C. Green and Robert Horry, but
there's no question where their Achilles' heel was located.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on other teams, like Chicago and Orlando and
Seattle, you wanted to attack (the Lakers) at the power-forward
position,'' Grant said. ``Shaq is going to be Shaq. He just needed
a power forward to really sort of `get his back,' so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   These will be familiar surroundings for Grant, who also played
under coach Phil Jackson's staff for three championship seasons in
Chicago. Grant also was an Orlando teammate of guard Brian Shaw,
expected to re-sign with the team shortly.
</P>
<P>
   And his expectations are unabashedly high.
</P>
<P>
   ``My quote was, 'Size us up (for championship rings), because
we're going to be definitely hard to beat,' '' Grant said. ``I'm
looking for a few championships here.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistaking Foster's emotions, either. The former
UCLA Bruin (he transferred to UTEP after two seasons) called the
trade ``somewhat of a homecoming for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Foster's emotions once got him in trouble with the
Lakers. Two seasons ago, while playing for the Utah Jazz, he
enraged the Lakers with a now-infamous throat-slashing gesture,
drawing fire from O'Neal and an eventual payback takedown by Rick
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope there's no ill will,'' Foster said. ``It was just
all in fun for me. I'm an emotional-type player at times and I hope
I can bring that to this team also. It's all water under the bridge
as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two acquisitions in the trade, guard Emanual Davis and
forward Chuck Person, were not present. Davis is expected Monday
when the Lakers hold their annual media day. But Person is mulling
retirement, and with the Lakers deep at small forward, he's a long
shot to make the rotation.

CHAMPAGNE STILL ON ICE FOR YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Champagne will be flat by the time
the New York Yankees get around to clinching the American League
East. If they drag it out any longer, George Steinbrenner might
disgustedly tell his players to split a six-pack of beer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' magic number remains frozen at one after the
last-place Tampa Bay Devil Rays crushed Denny Neagle and the
Yankees Wednesday night, 11-1 _ the Yankees' fifth loss by 10 or
more runs in the last two weeks, their third straight defeat and
their 11th in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible for the Yankees to find a way to lose
the division race. They lead Toronto by 4 1/2 games and these are
all the things that would have to happen: The Red Sox and the Blue
Jays would have to win all of their remaining games, and the
Yankees would have to lose here Thursday, lose three in Baltimore
over the weekend, lose a makeup of a rainout against the Florida
Marlins on Monday and then lose an intradivision playoff game on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees have little chance to recoup the confidence they
built in August and early September, in taking 4 of 6 games from
Seattle and Oakland on a road trip and sweeping three games from
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the doubts that have grown over the last two
weeks _ about the bullpen, about an offense starved for hits, about
Neagle and his propensity for implosion _ are assured of carrying
over into the playoffs. And there is a strong chance that the
Yankees will open the postseason on the road, something they have
not done since 1981. At the moment their game concluded here
Wednesday night, the Yankees had the fourth-best record in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner lives in the Tampa area, and within the Yankees'
organization, it is widely accepted as fact that beating the Devil
Rays is only slightly less important than winning the World Series
and world peace. If there was one positive to be drawn from the
slump that began with a 3-2 loss to Toronto on Sept. 14, it was
that the Yankees were presented with the opportunity to come here
and obliterate the Devil Rays in Steinbrenner's neighborhood and
spray Champagne all over Tampa Bay property.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devil Rays edged the Yankees, 2-1, on Tuesday, and
Steinbrenner vacated his private box without stopping at the
clubhouse. He was here again Wednesday night to see Neagle, who
lasted three innings and took another giant stride in sabotaging
his chances of getting a serious contract offer from the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, however, is only one symptom of a team malaise. The
Yankees want to know what it's like to win games again before the
playoffs start, but they are running out of time.

HEALTHIER STEELE IS PICKING UP PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker Markus Steele has been billed as a
Butkus Award candidate, but it took three games finally to play
like one.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, who like teammate Zeke Moreno is being pushed for the
award that goes to the nation's top linebacker, admittedly didn't
have the greatest start to the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm hurting the team, players tell me to pick it up,''
Steele said. ``They told me to pick it up against Penn State and I
made some mental mistakes in the first couple games. I figure if I
make a mistake, that's called for because it hurts the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele had just 12 tackles and two sacks in USC's first two
contests. But he rebounded with a game-high 12 tackles, including
four for loss, against San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't pay attention to whether I had a breakout game,
I just care about winning,'' Steele said. ``A lot of people may
make up hype about the Butkus Award, but I just want to go out and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele's start also seems quieter because he hasn't made any
highlight-reel plays yet after debuting last year with a 46-yard
fumble recovery for a touchdown against Hawaii, and an interception
and fumble recovery against San Diego State. But he's happier this
season because he's healthy for the first time after undergoing
shoulder surgery last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it last year was plays where I caught people's eyes
with,'' Steele said. ``This year, instead of eye-popping plays, I
get to play every play. I finally have two good shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bring on the noise: It seemed too good to be true, at least
for USC's players, that there would be no loudspeakers blaring
simulated crowd noise during practice this week as preparation for
the trip to Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a headache when you're leaving practice,''
quarterback Carson Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had Palmer spoken than USC coach Paul Hackett
announced he would bring out the speakers for today's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a little volume out here. I hear they are going to
have a noisy crowd,'' Hackett said. ``They're going to be better
off if we're (hearing) it than if we just talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But do the speakers actually work? ``Probably not,'' Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slippery when wet: With the latest weather forecast for
Corvallis calling for scattered showers and temperatures in the
high 60s, Hackett decided to used wet footballs for a portion of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Defensive tackle Bernard Riley (ankle) and
defensive end Lonnie Ford (ankle) will make the trip and play.
Offensive guard Trevor Roberts (sprained foot), who said Tuesday he
could play, will also make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Ife Ohalete left practice early Wednesday with the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   __ Going deep: Palmer said he hopes USC will revive its
deep-passing game, which has largely been absent to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't attacked people with fade routes and deep
balls,'' Palmer said.

COMMENTARY: THE WILD POLL PENDULUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 6th graf to change 16 to 14 percent; subs 3rd graf to insert
`Similarly,') 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Are you getting the feeling, as I am, that we are
being jerked around by wildly swinging poll numbers?
</P>
<P>
   Pre-conventions, George W. Bush led by 17 points;
post-conventions, Al Gore took the lead. Last week most major polls
had Gore breezing to victory; this week, it's Bush edging him out.
</P>
<P>
   With every swing of the poll pendulum, media coverage changes to
savage the front-runner. Similarly, whoever is in ``free fall'' can
do nothing right _ until a ``surge'' by the formerly collapsing
campaign restores smugness at headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Is the American majority really switching every few days? Did
Gore's Kiss change tens of millions of minds? This week The
Washington Times headlined ``Bush Surges Ahead of Gore After Chats
With Oprah and Regis.'' Was a 13-point lead in the previous, wacky,
Newsweek poll really all but erased by a Bush countersmooch on
Oprah's cheek?
</P>
<P>
   No. The reasons for the unprecedented swings, and for the
reporting that further exaggerates the swings, are (1) the
pressured pollution of the public opinion polls, and (2) the
horse-race media's hyping of polls as predictors of voting
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Have you noticed, in all the breathless reports of poll results
as if they were reflections of coming reality, the disappearance of
a category that used to be called ``the undecideds''? If one of the
candidates is reported leading by 44 percent to 42, that means 14
percent are determinedly undecided or pulling for splinter parties.
And that is after ``pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because client news organizations in hot competition demand a
hard answer to ``who's winning?'' the pressure is on pollsters not
to take ``I dunno'' for an answer. The pollster pushes: ``Which
candidate do you lean toward today?''
</P>
<P>
   If the interviewee had just been impressed by a powderpuff TV
interview, he or she will reluctantly ``lean'' toward whoever seems
hotter on the Internet or in cable talk or whose name is more
familiar. The poll then counts that person as taking a side. Next
day, the same type of person's soft leaning could easily switch and
would appear as a change of mind. It is not; what is reported as a
``surge'' is merely a sample of wavering out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the seeming voter volatility is the social
unacceptability of appearing uninformed. Many people who are
unwilling to commit before the debates toss out a name to avoid
appearing apathetic or unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes pollsters will assuage their media clients' demands
for results by means of allocation. If one candidate is ahead in a
poll by 45 percent to 40, and 15 percent haven't made up their
minds, a poll may allocate the uncommitted on the ratio of decided
respondents, thereby exaggerating the front-runner's lead.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``respondent'' sends shudders through the nose-counting
community. The dirty secret of political surveys is this: As
recently as 1984, the response rate to pollsters' questioning was
65 percent; that is, two out of three people reached would answer.
Pollster friends whisper to me that the response rate is now down
to 35 percent. (Two out of three pollsters I called went mum or
hung up on me, thus validating this reported figure in my mind,
which never leaves margin for error.)
</P>
<P>
   What does this remarkable response refusal tell us? It means
that two out of three Americans are guarding their privacy with
answering machines or Caller ID, or are telling pollsters to ``stop
bothering me at dinnertime.'' Also, because we suspect that a
response puts our private opinions on a telemarketer's data base,
we are now much less likely to cooperate with pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   The one-third of potential interviewees who do respond are
either the aforementioned pushables or people eager to make their
views known: partisans, activists and the committed. Together,
these are not representative of all likely voters and ignore the
widespread indecision.
</P>
<P>
   All major polls in the 1996 election underestimated support for
Bob Dole, the New York Times/CBS poll by 7 percent, affecting media
coverage and voter turnout. Only the maverick, Zogby/Reuter, came
in on the money.
</P>
<P>
   So I called John Zogby and laid on him my irate view of the
abuse of polling. He in turn gave me this insight: ``Since 1998, we
have evidence that voters are more likely to reject the views of
all pundits.'' Why do I need to know that? ``If you want to help
Bush _ attack him.''

EDITORIAL: AN OVERVIEW _ THE WEN HO LEE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   With the public testimony of Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI
Director Louis Freeh on Tuesday, the Wen Ho Lee case entered a new
phase. It is now possible to see for the first time in a full
public accounting the outlines of the government's case against
Lee, the former government scientist who pleaded guilty to
mishandling classified materials.
</P>
<P>
   That case is sobering in its account of Lee's pattern of
suspicious and ultimately illegal activities, though not conclusive
on the question of how the Chinese government made its undisputed
gains in nuclear weapons technology. But in the wake of Tuesday's
joint session of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees,
any assessment of the national security and civil liberties aspects
of the case _ and the continuing journalistic debate about coverage
of the case _ can begin by evaluating Freeh's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   That Lee grossly and consistently mishandled classified material
beginning in 1993 seems beyond reasonable dispute. He pleaded
guilty to that specific charge. Freeh's account paints a picture of
an individual purposefully and repeatedly overriding the
classification system on computers at the Los Alamos Nuclear
Laboratory. For the FBI and Energy Department not to react to Lee's
declassifying and copying of 470 nuclear weapons files and his
repeated efforts to make unauthorized entries into the laboratory's
X Division would have been a dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The Government's Case
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's account was the equivalent of a prosecutor's opening
statement to the jury. It provides a picture of the government's
worst-case scenario, delivered at a time when both Freeh and Reno
are under sharp attack for mismanaging the case. It must be tested
in the days ahead to see if it is accurate and whether there are
mitigating or exculpatory explanations. Some questions may be
answered by Lee in the presence of federal agents under the
conditions of his plea bargain _ a process that will initially be
far from public view. But this is how we would frame those
questions on the basis of the record to date, as amplified by the
Senate hearing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The primary question is what Lee did with the seven computer
tapes still missing from the 10 he originally made, and also what
he did with the additional copies that his attorneys informed the
government about just before the plea agreement hearing. Freeh and
Reno said the government had reduced their 59-count indictment to
the one plea bargain in court because of the compelling national
interest in getting Lee's cooperation in locating those tapes.
</P>
<P>
   As ominous as that sounds, it has to be analyzed in light of
other information given to the committee on Tuesday when it comes
to looking at Dr. Lee's motives and whether the information he
downloaded was available in open sources. Sen. Richard Bryan, a
Democratic member of the Intelligence Committee, took a measured
approach. On the question of whether a leak from Los Alamos might
have aided China in its development of new warheads, Bryan
correctly observed that classified information on the critical
American W-88 warhead existed in 546 government and industry
offices other than Los Alamos. Freeh conceded that the government
had ``no direct evidence that Lee passed classified information to
a foreign government.'' There is less clarity on Lee's purpose in
copying sensitive data in recent years. The committee in its closed
sessions and in the upcoming interrogations of Lee by federal
intelligence and law enforcement agents must explore why he engaged
in a mystifying binge of copying classified material and then, once
the FBI got on his trail, deleted 310 files in a single day in an
apparent attempt to hide what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the Evidence
</P>
<P>
   These issues lead to the related and critical national security
question of how much of the information collected by Lee was
available outside the lab as unclassified information that the
Chinese could have gotten by clever research. On this question,
experts remain divided. Lee's defenders, including some scientific
colleagues, have maintained that the material he transferred would
not be greatly useful to a foreign power and that the bulk of what
he copied was available from open sources.
</P>
<P>
   The senators heard testimony from T.J. Glauthier, a deputy
secretary of energy, that while discrete scientific and
mathematical models were not classified, the way to assemble them
into weapons was highly secret. In an interview with The New York
Times, John L. Richter, a weapons designer who had earlier
testified for Lee, accepted the government's definition as to the
sensitivity of some of the underlying information.
</P>
<P>
   But Richter said he still believed that the government had
exaggerated the significance of the material. Clearly, the Senate
Intelligence Committee will have to determine just how critical the
downloaded information is.
</P>
<P>
   Let us turn now to the civil liberties aspects of the case.
While taking a grave view of Lee's activities, Bryan spoke out
sharply about a ``Keystone Kops'' investigation. Others raised the
question whether Lee had been the target of racial profiling, and
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania asked whether Lee had been
shackled and denied bail as part of a regimen of ``pressures to
compel a guilty plea.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and Reno denied that Lee's Asian descent had played a role
in his prosecution. Even so, the treatment of Lee after his
indictment on Dec. 10, 1999, was unnecessarily harsh, and the
government used false testimony to persuade U.S. District Court
Judge James A. Parker to hold Lee for nine months without bail.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, commenting on the case on Sept. 15, got the
balance about right in concluding that Lee had pleaded guilty to
``a very serious national security violation,'' while also
expressing concern about the denial of bail as fundamentally
offensive to normal legal practice. On the same day, Joe Lockhart,
the White House press secretary, complained at his daily briefing
that ``near-hysterical investigative reporting'' had created a
crisis atmosphere around the issue of nuclear weapons security. His
deputy, Jake Siewert, condemned this page for not having given the
administration due credit for security efforts. That brings us to
the journalistic issues raised by the Lee case and the subject of
security at the nuclear weapons laboratories at Los Alamos, Sandia
and Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Journalism Issues
</P>
<P>
   The official and journalistic records are replete with
convincing evidence that a lax security culture has long prevailed
at those institutions, and senior administration officials continue
to confirm that those laboratories are the subject of continuing
corrective action and attendant morale problems. The Times' news
department has been in the forefront of investigative journalism on
weapons security, technology transfers to China and the Lee case.
Earlier this week, our colleagues in the news department published
a lengthy note from the editors reviewing the paper's coverage. The
critique affirms The Times' news department's commitment to
vigorous, timely reporting and to fairness as an active principle.
</P>
<P>
   On this as on many other issues, this page has had its critics,
too. That is a constant of opinion journalism. In the spirit of
self-examination, we have reviewed the editorials we published over
17 months about the Lee case and the need for stronger security
procedures at the nuclear laboratories. Many of the main arguments
have held up well, although with the benefit of hindsight we find
that we too quickly accepted the government's theory that espionage
was the main reason for Chinese nuclear advances and its view that
Dr. Lee had been properly singled out as the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we remain convinced of the need for the newly
created National Nuclear Security Administration to take over
supervision of the laboratories from the Energy Department. We
continue to believe that Republican demands for the resignations of
Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, and Samuel R. Berger, the
president's national security adviser, were premature. But in
retrospect we may have been overly sharp in comments about Berger's
fitness for his job and about Reno's refusal to issue a wiretap
order on Lee. In analyzing potential sources of technology
transfers to China, we rightly identified commercial espionage as a
possible source, but we may turn out to have been premature in
concluding that the critical expertise on miniaturization of
warheads was ``most likely'' stolen from computers at the weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 months ago _ four months before Lee was indicted,
but five months after the case became public _ we warned about the
dangers of racial profiling in his case. As events unfolded, we
should have looked more searchingly at the conditions under which
he was confined and the government's arguments for denial of bail.
</P>
<P>
   A Fuller Accounting
</P>
<P>
   In summary, we think the importance of the nuclear weapons issue
to the safety and security of the nation warrants aggressive
reporting and assertive, timely commentary. It is important to
remember that the central figure in many of these articles had been
the target of investigation for more than three years before the
first pieces were published. Moreover, transfer of technology to
China and nuclear weapons security had been constant government
concerns throughout this period. To withhold this information from
readers is an unthinkable violation of the fundamental contract
between a newspaper and its audience. The only choice is to bring
that information forward in news and opinion columns in a
professionally careful, self-critical way.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of serious journalistic effort has been expended as
this case evolved, both in regard to Lee's activities and the
conduct of the government's investigation. Now the tools are at
hand for a fuller accounting of the entire episode, through the
Senate hearings, the expected disclosures from Lee in fulfillment
of his plea bargain, and Reno's recommended release of heretofore
classified documents on the handling of his case. &QL;

 LIVERMORE LAB GETS GRANT TO FIGHT TB  &HT;     By BERNADETTE TANSEY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will receive a $4 million
research grant from the National Institutes of Health as part of a
drive to eradicate tuberculosis, the world's No. 1 infectious
disease threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Livermore lab is part of a consortium of 13 laboratories in
six nations awarded a total of $28 million to study the proteins
that help the tuberculosis bacterium invade cells, produce toxic
chemicals and hide from the human immune system. That information
will be provided free online to researchers and pharmaceutical
companies trying to design drugs to thwart the deadly infection,
which kills 2 million people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the United States who are infected with the AIDS
virus actually die from complications of tuberculosis, which is
more dangerous to those with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year tuberculosis project will be coordinated by Los
Alamos National Laboratory, which will use genetic cloning
techniques to produce samples of 400 bacterial proteins for testing
by other labs.
</P>
<P>
   The $28 million grant is part of a larger $150 million
investment by the National Institutes of Health in seven pilot
studies that build on the discoveries of the government Human
Genome Project and other DNA sequencing research. Now that
scientists have uncovered the sequences of DNA that code for
proteins in human beings, bacteria and other life forms,
researchers can use that information to develop disease remedies
and other useful products.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will receive $4 million
to determine the complex shapes of large tuberculosis proteins by
converting them into crystalline form and then using X-rays and
computer analysis to reveal their structure. Knowledge of the shape
of a protein helps medical researchers design drugs that bind to
the protein the way a key fits into a lock, allowing the drug to
block the protein from harming the body.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley, also
part of the consortium, will receive $2 million during the
five-year program to study proteins used by tuberculosis bacteria
to copy and repair their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other protein pilot studies funded by the National
Institutes of Health is a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
project to study bacteria that cause pneumonia and infections of
the human genital and respiratory tracts.

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS APPROVE A DEAL TO ALLOW FOOD SALES TO CUBA
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House and Senate leadership Wednesday approved
a deal to allow the sale of U.S. food products to Cuba, clearing
the way for the most significant rollback of U.S. sanctions against
the island in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on sales, which was brokered between farm-state
and anti-Castro lawmakers, was eagerly sought by U.S. farm groups
and first proposed this spring by Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.
It would allow cash sales to Cuba and financing through third
countries but bar U.S. financing, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   It would also add a new category to the designated groups of
Americans who are allowed to travel to Cuba, despite restrictions
on spending money there. U.S. exporters of grains and other food
products would be authorized to visit the island to promote sales,
just as scholars and journalists are currently allowed, the
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement does not, however, allow for the sale of Cuban
products in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Washington first imposed a ban on trade with Cuba in 1962, after
the revolutionary government of President Fidel Castro appropriated
more than 6,000 U.S.-owned properties without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., brokered the deal between Nethercutt and
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., on one hand, and Congress' two
Cuban-American lawmakers from Florida, Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, both Republicans, on the other. Until now,
the two Cuban-Americans have opposed any easing of sanctions
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt, who said Republican leaders in Congress had approved the
deal, said in a telephone interview that it would open Cuban
markets to U.S. exporters of rice, pork and other staples. Cuba has
long sought to resume trade with the United States, arguing that
the trade embargo had forced it to pay a premium in shipping costs
from more distant nations. ``It provides a significant opening of
that market to U.S. agricultural products,'' Blunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations in recent weeks between the farm-state and the
anti-Castro lawmakers bogged down over the question of financing.
The Cuban-American lawmakers prevailed by ruling out U.S. credits
for the sales, but those favoring sales scored a victory by winning
an allowance for third-country financing.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, which has been under an austerity program for a decade
since the breakup of the Soviet Union, its former patron, relies on
foreign banks for most of its imports.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new deal becomes law, it would in theory allow the
Havana government to turn to a Mexican bank, for example, to
finance a purchase. That bank would then notify a U.S. bank that a
transaction had been approved, and the U.S. bank would notify the
U.S. exporter to proceed with the sale, Blunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources close to the negotiations warned Wednesday
night that it could still fall apart, especially if pro-trade
Republican lawmakers, such as Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., object to
the restrictions against U.S. financing.
</P>
<P>
   But the drive toward greater openness with Cuba has been evident
in recent months, as lawmakers have steadily approved measures to
ease restrictions on trade and travel. The Clinton administration
has facilitated that effort, by approving visits throughout the
Midwest by Cuban diplomats and agricultural officials.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman did not immediately return a call for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal does not affect the sale of U.S. medicines to Cuba,
which is already authorized, provided that purchasers there can
demonstrate that the items are not misused or packaged for resale.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote on the Cuba food bill as part
of a $75 billion agriculture funding bill next week, Blunt said,
with the Senate expected to follow later in the week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR;  &LR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The compromise was reached on Capitol Hill as eight prominent
Republicans released a joint statement calling for an end to the
embargo on food and medical sales to Cuba and a lifting of all
travel restrictions imposed on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The group _ including Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, William P.
Clark, the national security adviser under President Reagan, and
Frank Carlucci, defense secretary in the Reagan administration _
said, ``Humanitarian trade should not be used for political
leverage.'' A lifting of sanctions would allow ``a flow of people,
commerce and ideas that would increase American influence,'' they
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement released through the Lexington Institute, a
conservative research group, the Republicans said the 1996
Helms-Burton Act, which tightened sanctions on Cuba had proved
ineffective. ``It has not brought political change,'' they said.
``It has not resolved property claims; it creates costly disputes
with major trading partners.''

ARREST AT SHEA MAY PUT KILLER OF INFANT SON BACK IN JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., N.J., N.Y.)   By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYCKOFF, N.J. _ Since returning here in January after a prison
term for discarding the body of his newborn son in a motel trash
bin, Brian C. Peterson had compiled a spotless probation record.
But on Tuesday night, he and a friend from high school went to Shea
Stadium for a New York Mets game. Peterson left in handcuffs, his
eight months of good behavior tarnished and his future at risk.
</P>
<P>
   New York police say that Peterson's friend, Raymond Maniaci,
hurled a partly filled bottle at John Rocker, the outspoken relief
pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, as Rocker stood on the mound in the
eighth inning. The bottle landed about 10 feet from the pitcher,
and officers stationed near the first base box seats arrested
Maniaci. As they led him away, Peterson began interfering, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint filed Wednesday said that despite three warnings to
move away, Peterson followed the arresting officers and his friend
down a ramp and pushed through a cluster of fans, yelling, swearing
and flailing his arms, even as the officers arrested and tried to
handcuff him.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officials in Delaware _ where Peterson and his high
school sweetheart, Amy S. Grossberg, had pleaded guilty to
negligent manslaughter in the death of their newborn son there _
said Wednesday that Peterson's future would depend on the outcome
of the new case.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, 22, spent the night in a police lockup and was
arraigned Wednesday afternoon in Criminal Court in Queens on
charges of resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment. He
said nothing as he appeared with his lawyer, Russell M. Gioiella,
before Judge Stephen Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the media reports are correct, I hope your client realizes
the stupidity of his actions,'' Knopf told Gioiella.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer responded, ``Nobody in Queens is more aware of the
stupidity of his actions than my client.'' After Peterson entered a
not-guilty plea, the judge ordered him to return for another
hearing on Oct. 10 and released him without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Maniaci, 22, of Wyckoff, who was a high school soccer teammate
of Peterson's, was charged with reckless endangerment, attempted
assault, harassment and disorderly conduct. Knopf also released him
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as reporters followed Peterson, and his mother, Barbara,
from the courthouse, Gioiella paused briefly and called the
incident ``very, very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Welch, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of
Correction, which is supervising Peterson's two-year probation
term, said it was too early to determine what impact the arrest
would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to date, he's not been a problem,'' Welch said. She said
Peterson was working, taking college courses and fulfilling a
requirement he serve 300 hours of community service by lecturing
teen-agers about his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``His record has been very good, and he's not broken any
rules,'' Welch said. She noted that before going to Shea Stadium,
Peterson had received permission from his probation officer to
travel outside New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction on the new charges could lead to revocation of his
probation or stiffer probation restrictions, Welch said. If he is
acquitted, he might avoid any change in his probation status, she
said. The ultimate decision will be made by Henry duPont Ridgely,
the Delaware judge who conducted pretrial proceedings against
Peterson and Grossberg, and in 1998 accepted their guilty pleas in
the death of their newborn son at a motel. The two were college
freshmen when the baby died.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson served 18 months of a two-year sentence.

DAVIS VETOES BILLS TO EXPAND DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS,
EXPAND  GAMBLING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis stuck to his word Wednesday and
vetoed two bills that would have expanded domestic partner
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor had previously said he did not want to
consider any expansion of the state's domestic-partner laws, which
he signed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said when I vetoed an earlier bill by this author, I
would be pleased to consider reasonable changes to the Domestic
Partner Act next year,'' Davis said in his veto message of a bill
by state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And on another subject that Davis has set forth a strict policy,
he vetoed eight bills Wednesday that he said would expand gambling
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden's bill would have included domestic partners in
relationships covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. Another
bill by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, would have
made technical changes to the portion of the law allowing seniors
to register as domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis signed a bill creating a domestic-partner
registry and benefits for state employees.
</P>
<P>
   A domestic partner is defined as a member of a couple, over 18
years of age, ``who have chosen to share one another's lives in an
intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the statewide registry started at the beginning of the
year, 5,523 partnerships have been logged, according to the
secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   Migden and supporters of expanded benefits for gay and lesbian
couples say they will be back next year with more comprehensive
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this is disappointing, we cannot lose sight of the fact
that we had a banner year last year,'' said Eric Astacaan, the
lobbyist for the California Alliance for Pride and Equality.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden's measure was a modified version of a bill Davis vetoed
last spring. At the time, he said it was too broad because it
included people who live together but are not related or in a
committed relationship, such as roommates.
</P>
<P>
   The revised version that Davis vetoed Wednesday would have
included only domestic partners, people caring for grandparents and
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess (Davis) is trying to teach us a lesson to not be in a
hurry, but this affects the lives of a lot of people,'' said
Hayden, who is leaving office because of term limits. ``And the
people affected can't wait _ they have to pay bills every day and
go to work while a loved one is home sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing law requires employers to allow family leave only for a
birth, adoption or serious illness of a child, to care for a parent
or spouse with a serious illness or because of the employee's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' refusal to consider even technical changes mirrors other
stances the self-described centrist has taken. After signing
several gun-control measures in his first term, Davis told several
authors of legislation this year that he would veto anything that
reached his desk.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, he also vetoed a bill that would have made
changes to laws regarding the sale or transfer or firearms, saying,
``It is inconsistent with my policy to provide law enforcement
agencies, both state and local, time to absorb and enforce the
major firearm provisions that have been recently enacted into
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis showed that same attitude on a series of bills that he
vetoed related to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said many times, I am not generally inclined to
support measures that allow more than a modest expansion of
gambling,'' he said in several of the veto messages.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bills would have allowed out-of-state
gambling interests to own similar businesses in California,
expanded the types of horses allowed to run in quarter horse
racing, and allowed wagering on an increased number of horse races.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis signed a compact with California Indian tribes
setting a limit on the number of slot machines allowed in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis termed it a ``moderate increase'' in gambling, the
non-partisan legislative analyst said the numbers could be very
high _ giving the state three times as many machines as New Jersey.

 BUSH SCORES HITS IN SWING THROUGH CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush brought his campaign to
a South Central Los Angeles Catholic school Wednesday, buoyed by
rising poll numbers and looking ahead to next week's debate with
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP candidate scored some solid hits on his two-day
California swing. His appearance on ``Larry King Live'' with his
wife, Laura, gave him an extended chance to talk about his vision
for America. A Los Angeles Times editorial heaped praise on his
educational plan, while the paper's latest poll, released
Wednesday, showed him up by 6 points, 48 percent to 42 percent,
over Gore nationally.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought out big and enthusiastic crowds for fund-raising
events that brought in $1.4 million to the state Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all the good news, Bush ran into problems
Wednesday keeping his campaign's message on track.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself seemed to hint at the cause of the apparent
distraction when he ran into a fourth-grader Wednesday at Ascension
Catholic school and was asked if he had ever met Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to see him next Tuesday, when we have what's called
a debate,'' said Bush. ``I look forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming debate, widely viewed as a make-or-break event for
both candidates, at least partially overshadowed Bush's message
during the West Coast trip that ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were continuing stories about a pro-Gore ``mole'' who may
have infiltrated the Bush campaign and sent a debate preparation
video to the Democrats. Other stories dealt with the preparations
for the debates, even while Bush worked valiantly to stress
education and what he has called an ``education recession'' that he
believes has occurred under the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy and it didn't always work.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was scheduled Wednesday to highlight the efforts of
faith-based institutions to help kids and neighborhoods with a
visit to a Watts Catholic school _ which sits directly across the
street from Figueroa Elementary, the local public school.
</P>
<P>
   The venue could have made for a vivid explanation of why Bush
supports school vouchers, which he believes they could lend a
needed hand to low-income and minority parents, Latino and
African-American, struggling to provide kids a good education in
some of America's toughest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the public school parents, many of them angry, stood on
the street because they weren't invited in to see the governor. A
group of Latino mothers, all with kids at the public school, said
they tended to like Bush and were curious about his voucher plan
for low-achieving schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the real poor. We can't afford the $300 a month
tuition'' at the Catholic school, said Irma Campos in Spanish.
``Ay, no, that's too much.'' And she added, ``If he wants to get
the Latino vote, he has to come where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids need books and materials,'' added Cecilia Serrano.
``And they need someone to watch over them ... why doesn't he come
over here to see us?''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Ascension school, where parents pay an average of $2,200
a year in tuition _ Bush talked up his recurring education themes:
the ``soft bigotry of low expectations'' and the need for
accountability and local control.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Catholic schools for their successes, saying he
appreciated the discipline and the policy of ``zero tolerance`` for
drugs and disruptions in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you for allowing me to come to this little
haven of love,'' he told students.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has said he would be focusing on ``real people'' as he
campaigned, spoke only briefly to the invited crowd of about 50
parents, as a group of about two dozen students in plaid uniforms
sat behind him on the stage. He left without taking questions from
either the parents or the children.
</P>
<P>
   The governor occasionally jumbled words and phrases, shredding
his own message.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said America must provide teachers and principals ``with
strong tort reform legislation that protects our teachers from
doing what they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the formula for successful schools, he said,
``One of the common denominators I have found is that expectations
rise above that which is expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as some national reports suggested Bush will pull back from
the nation's most populous state _ where he lags by double digits
in recent polls _ the Texas governor repeatedly declared he will
win California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win California. I am,'' Bush told Larry King on
Tuesday. ``I'm ... down in the polls (here), but who pays
attention, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Donors at an Atherton fund-raiser Tuesday were promised by state
campaign chair Gerry Parsky that when the debates are over, Bush
will return to California for more campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush lent little more than financial support to GOP hopefuls
in California. In his Bay Area appearances Tuesday, Bush gave
little more than a nod to Jim Cunneen, the GOP congressional
candidate facing a tough race against Democrat Mike Honda in the
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And in Southern California, where Republicans face congressional
contests that could decide the balance of power in Congress, there
was no mention at all of other GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The governor now will head out to the crucial Midwest and then
hunker down in his home town of Austin to prepare for Tuesday's
debate in Boston.

A MINI-MART'S BIG, NEW IDEAS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The world keeps getting better.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-Eleven people are giving a sneak preview Thursday of some
of their new products at the San Mateo County Expo (it's not too
late to phone in sick!).
</P>
<P>
   They call the event the University of 7-Eleven. Not to brag, but
I'm an alum, with a doctorate in cheese-like snacks.
</P>
<P>
   The new products include the Salad Gulp and the Fruit Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   Great products for what the kids call ``dashboard dining.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Salad and Fruit Gulps, I recommend you also
purchase the Dr. Henry Heimlich Ride-Along Robot ($14,000, but
watch for a ``two-fer'' sale), because I don't want to die in a
flaming car crash after being rear-ended by some guy trying to
dislodge a softball-size melon ball from his esophagus with a
chopstick that came with his 7-Eleven sushi (Raw Gulp).
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous mini-marts will also carry a new line of keen
teen jewelry, because studies show that a leading cause of teenage
depression is the lack of stuff to spend money on.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with all these great new goodies is that in
order to make room for them, other fine items must go. Some of the
traditional items that no longer will be stocked:
</P>
<P>
   _ Raccoon jerky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Janet Reno ``Back Off!'' mud flaps.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funyon snuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Widowmaker Lap-Scalder Cup o' Joe, known affectionately as
the Big Yelp.
</P>
<P>
   But some 7-Eleven traditions will remain intact. You can still
buy lottery tickets, using numbers based on the horoscope you
calculate right there at the checkout counter, especially if I'm in
line right behind you, late for work and trying to buy a quart of
malt liquor (Big Buzz) with the correct change.
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER fake news, the 49ers have backed off their stand
against Terrell Owens' midfield celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Owens  &UR; will  &LR; be allowed to celebrate 49er touchdowns by running
to midfield and cavorting on the opposing team's logo. But he'll
have to do it in street clothes, and he'll have to buy his own
ticket to the game, and dodge security forces with dogs in order to
dash onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish him godspeed,'' one 49er official said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lacey says he hears that NFL fans have filed a
classless-action lawsuit against Owens.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Owens explained that what he was doing last Sunday in
Dallas was ``trying to provide my team with a positive spark.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Owens said that what he was doing was praying,
``thanking God for the ability that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that changes things. Now we see that what Owens did was
the ultimate gesture of humility.
</P>
<P>
   CLIP THIS item and save it for when you can read it several
times. It is an explanation to policyholders in the Fremont
Compensation Insurance Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original insurer of this policy, Fremont Compensation
Insurance Company, no longer exists because it has been merged into
another insurance company member of the Fremont Compensation
Insurance Group, UNICARE Workers' Compensation Insurance Company,
also known as `UNICARE Insurance Company.' Immediately following
this merger, UNICARE's name was changed to Fremont Compensation
Insurance Company. Your workers' compensation insurance coverage is
now provided by Fremont Compensation Insurance Company, formerly
known `UNICARE Workers' Compensation Insurance Company', or
`UNICARE Insurance Company'.''
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in the name-this-organization contest: Fremont
Unified Bureau of Ambulatory Rehabilitation (FUBAR).
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATE for reading material while riding a 27-Bryant Muni
bus, Robert Shepard picked up a Muni ``Destinations'' newsletter.
It was the August issue, a month behind, but at least it was August
of '00.
</P>
<P>
   One story told of the picturesque 29-Sunset line. ``It curls
between the Bayview/Hunter's Point community and 3Com Park, through
at least half The City's neighborhoods. ... It's like an old
European local train that wends its way through the marketplaces
and countryside.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say a more appropriate comparison would be to the
Japanese Bullet Train.
</P>
<P>
   The 29 route wends through the S.F. State Campus, and
``Destinations'' writer Anita Hill writes: ``Sometimes the driver
hot-rods it around the campus and up Sunset Blvd. We're actually
happy when that occurs because it means we get home earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's fun to watch the pedestrians scatter like frightened
sheep on a European country lane.
</P>
<P>
   SEE THIS: ``Michael Jordan To the Max,'' the IMAX movie, now
playing at the San Jose Tech Museum.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a kid (or are a kid) who likes basketball, you have
to take him or her to this show. Dr. Naismith invented basketball
for Jordan, and Dr. Imax invented the monster movie screen for
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly TV sports-highlight shows have trivialized the dunk,
but this is Jordan five stories high, dunking like Zeus. Even the
music is cool.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Inspiring messages are presented.
</P>
<P>
   AN 87-YEAR-old S.F. woman fell. Her daughter couldn't lift her
up and so called 911, told the operator it was not an emergency but
she could use some help.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance was dispatched, the woman was helped to her feet.
Then came the bill for $568, not covered by Medicare or Medi-Cal.
</P>
<P>
   So before you call, make sure it's an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Or send for my T-shirt: ``Help! I've fallen and I can't afford
to get up!''

HOW ABOUT CSUN-UCLA IN 2002 OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA is looking for an opponent for the 2002
football season opener. If Cal State Northridge coach Jeff Kearin
had his way, the search would be over. CSUN plays at least one
Division I-A team every year and Kearin wouldn't mind traveling
down the road to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said he talks to every Division I-A coach or athletic
director he meets about the prospect of getting on their schedule.
Kearin said he talked to Bob Toledo about a game against UCLA at a
golf tournament last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it would be a hard sell for their fans and alumni to
play a I-AA,'' Kearin said. ``. . . I'd love to play UCLA. We'd bus
over, it would be a big payday and it's a local game. It would be
one of the greatest experiences this program has ever had. But I
just don't know if they'd be open to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then and UCLA still hasn't filled that slot. Every
Thursday, the Northridge coach makes calls to try to land a
Division I-A opponent. Kearin might call Toledo today to let him
know CSUN is still available.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Toldeo) has been a small-college coach and he knows the
trials and tribulations of being a small-college program,'' Kearin
said. ``It would be a huge value to us emotionally, financially and
for our stature.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Very special teams: This is the one area in which the
Matadors have consistently played well this year. CSUN will be
challenged when CSUN hosts Idaho State in a key Big Sky Conference
game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   DeRonn Finley returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown in ISU's
41-39 win over Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're solid enough to contain a good special team from
anybody,'' Kearin said. ``Fortunately, we have a good punter who
puts the ball up high. But our punt coverage hasn't been that great
and that's my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finley is a threat every time he touches the ball. But I feel
good about our special teams now. We blocked a punt last week and
that always helps.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's Ethan Beck is second in the Big Sky in punting with a
43.6-yard average over 18 punts _ including four inside the 20.
Finley averages 15.2 yards per punt return and also has 11 catches
for 159 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: A day after running routes, wide receiver Drew
Amerson's right knee was OK. Amerson, who hyperextended his knee,
is day to day. . . . Defensive lineman Erik Gardner sat out
Tuesday's practice because of a bad back but practiced Wednesday. .
. . Defensive lineman Andy Zaldivar (ankle) is practicing in full
pads. . . . Receiver D.J. Hackett, who suffered a minor knee injury
against Northern Arizona, is OK and will play Saturday. . . .
Receiver Jamaal Perry is nursing an ankle injury but is expected to
play Saturday.

 MORE POVERTY THAN AFFLUENCE IN OIL-FED ECONOMY  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CABIMAS, Venezuela _ Fredy Valero put down his beer and kicked
the dirt angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how much wealth comes out of this soil?'' he
asked. ``Dig a hole anywhere and out comes oil. I can't even think
how much money that is. And how much do I have? Or anyone here?''
</P>
<P>
   His right arm flailed out, pointing over the ragged,
working-class neighborhood. ``Next to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to oil country, Venezuela-style.
</P>
<P>
   Cabimas is at the heart of the Lake Maracaibo region, which
pumps about $13 billion worth of crude annually, a greater
concentration of petroleum production than in any other zone in the
world. But its story could be echoed in many places in other OPEC
nations, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   Valero is an unemployed oil worker, one of many around the poor,
sweltering town. Despite the vast wealth produced in the area,
little of it stays or returns to benefit the people. Living costs
are sky-high, almost all consumer goods are imported and
unemployment is estimated at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that the Maracaibo region and Venezuela are
classic examples of the so-called Dutch Disease, a term derived
from the Netherlands' experience in the 1970s after huge North Sea
natural gas fields came into production. Instead of the bonanza the
country expected, the resulting flood of cash warped the economy by
making citizens rely on government largesse and imports rather than
export revenue and domestic products.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela's case, the government has exacerbated the problem
by its intervention in currency markets to keep the bolivar's value
artificially high _ by as much as 40 percent, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch Disease is alive and well here, and it's the cause
of all our problems,'' said Pedro Garcia, co-owner of an import
company and president of the Maracaibo Chamber of Commerce. ``Oil
has distorted our economy horribly.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia should know. He is a member of the region's small elite,
which has long lived ostentatiously from the nation's oil wealth.
In Venezuela, as in other OPEC nations, those who have it, flaunt
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think nothing of flying to Miami on Friday to buy
shoes for a party here Saturday night,'' said Norka Marrufo,
society columnist for Panorama, Maracaibo's leading daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not as common as it used to be,'' she added,
referring to Venezuela's deep economic recession in the 1990s _ a
slide caused by low international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's a world apart for Valero, who talked with a Chronicle
reporter as he was kicking back with his friends and relatives at a
backyard get-together last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old worker on the boats that constantly ply the waters
of Lake Maracaibo, which are studded with thousands of oil
derricks, Valero likes the pay, when he can get it _ about $560 per
month, plus medical care and other generous benefits given by
Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   By Third World standards, that's not bad. But he has been
unemployed for most of the past year and large portions of previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   People from the low-lying, hot and humid Maracaibo area are
known nationwide for being extroverted and fun-loving _ ``the
Texans of Venezuela,'' many proudly call themselves. That's saying
something, since Venezuelans in general have a similar reputation
among other Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, vice is all too common because of the
boom-and-bust nature of this business,'' said Pastor Lopez, an oil
union official. He noted that gambling on horses and dominoes soaks
up a large part of many local residents' income.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela has another dubious distinction that analysts link to
the flow of oil money _ it is the world's fifth-highest per capita
consumer of Scotch whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   For Valero and many of his compatriots in what is widely known
as ``Saudi Venezuela,'' oil has been a curse, not a blessing, tying
them to a cyclical and inherently unstable industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although they might have more work if OPEC increased production
to drive prices down, they voice fervent, almost unanimous support
of President Hugo Chavez's attempts to keep prices relatively high.
Chavez was enthusiastically elected because he promised to quell
corruption in Venezuela, and that issue still resonates with
ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is hailed for having unified the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and helping to triple the price of
oil since he was first elected in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to see our president travel around the world, go to
Iraq, to Saudi Arabia,'' said Fredy's sister, Iris. ``He has
brought the price of oil up to where it should be. Finally, we
hope, we'll benefit from Venezuela's God-given wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Venezuelans fondly recall the boom years of the 1970s and
early 1980s, when OPEC succeeded in pushing world oil prices as
high as $50 per barrel _ more than twice the current price, when
inflation is taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   A recent nationwide poll found that 80 percent of the population
believes the country is among the richest in the world, although at
least two-thirds live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It thus follows, in the minds of millions, that the primary task
of government is to redistribute existing wealth rather than to
create it. Venezuela has developed hardly any high-tech industry
and, apart from oil, produces little but consumer goods for
domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the nation's land is fertile and well-watered,
83 percent of the country's food is imported.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is plenty of money sloshing around in the
coffers of OPEC nations these days: They are expected to earn more
than $200 billion this year, up from $160 billion last year and
$116 billion in 1998, and oil proceeds account for roughly half of
Venezuela's $26.7 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   When Chavez took the oath of office last year, oil was selling
for $13 a barrel and soon tumbled to $8. Among his first acts was
to slash public spending. The charismatic former army colonel's
government now has $10 billion more in extra oil revenues than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He is planning to spend much of it on Plan Bolivar 2000, an
anti-poverty program run by the armed forces _ perhaps the only
institution in corruption-ridden Venezuela that enjoys public
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the country's severe socioeconomic drama, the
military is forced to fill the holes left by the rest of the
government,'' said Rafael Guerra, a retired army general who
directs the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Venezuelan people know their country is rich, but they are
poor. We hope we are able to use the new oil resources
appropriately. If not, there will be big trouble.''
</P>

MENNINGER CLINIC TO LEAVE TOPEKA FOR HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   TOPEKA _ In a blow to Kansas, the
Menninger Clinic announced plans Wednesday to move the
world-renowned mental health center to Houston to affiliate with
the Baylor College of Medicine and Methodist Health Care System.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Houston effort to attract the financially struggling
Menninger Clinic won out over the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas and the University of Kansas Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mixed feelings, because we have a lot of roots here,''
said W. Walter Menninger, a psychiatrist and the Menninger Clinic's
president and chief executive officer, at an evening news
conference that followed a meeting by Menninger's board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we would not have chosen this to happen, we could not
continue to survive if we had continued to operate the same way in
the same setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Menninger, the third generation of his family to lead the
clinic, said the transition to Houston would be complete by 2002.
He said it was too early to say what would happen to Menninger's
242-acre Topeka campus, but he added that Menninger programs in the
Kansas City area probably would be phased out in four to six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger said the organization employed 1,162 persons _ 918 in
Topeka and 244 in the Kansas City area. About 50 are doctors. He
said that there would not be jobs for all the employees in Houston
but that it was too early to say how many would be offered jobs
there.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger disclosed few financial details of the relocation
agreement but said that Menninger, Baylor and Methodist together
would raise an endowment of more than $200 million to support joint
research, in addition to the existing Menninger endowment of about
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   A public-private consortium proposed an incentive package worth
as much as $100 million to persuade Menninger to stay in Kansas and
form a partnership with KU Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Donald F. Hagen, executive vice president of KU Medical Center,
said his institution would continue to press ahead with plans for a
neurosciences research center as part of a larger life sciences
development effort in the area ``and to fill any gaps that might
occur as a result of Menninger leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Building KU Medical Center's research programs in neurosciences
has long been a campus priority, and development of a neurosciences
institute has been under discussion by medical center officials for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed with the decision, but it doesn't lessen
our commitment to provide research, education and psychiatric care
for the people of Kansas,'' Hagen said. ``We thought Menninger was
such an important part of the history of Kansas, and we wanted them
to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas proposal included the establishment of a brain
research center near the medical center's Kansas City, Kan.,
campus, and possibly a freestanding mental health center. Gov. Bill
Graves had said he would ask legislators to increase the budget of
KU Medical Center to help create an alliance with Menninger.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Graves said he was saddened by the news but
appreciated the ``opportunity the Menninger board provided for
Kansas to develop and submit a proposal in hopes of maintaining
Menninger's presence in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to keep Menninger was mounted amid heightened
interest in life sciences research, propelled by the scheduled
opening of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas
City around Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Baylor and Methodist calls for the three to
form an alliance to establish a national center for specialty
psychiatric services for the mentally ill and create a new brain
and behavior research center. The Menninger name will be
transferred to Houston, where Baylor and Methodist already have an
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are enthusiastic and honored to form a partnership with the
highly acclaimed Menninger Clinic,'' Ralph D. Feigin, president and
chief executive officer of Baylor College of Medicine, said in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision marks a turning point for Menninger,
founded in 1925 by C.F. Menninger and sons Will and Karl in a
Topeka-area farmhouse. It is still considered one of the nation's
top mental health centers, despite recent financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, tighter spending by managed-care companies and
government health programs, and new pharmaceutical treatments for
mental illness, have cut into longer, lucrative stays by patients
at mental health centers such as Menninger.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to remain financially viable, Menninger slashed
jobs, trained fewer psychiatrists, formed partnerships with care
providers to reach patients in their own communities and launched
research projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial losses have continued, and Menninger officials
said earlier this year that they were considering closing its
Topeka campus.
</P>
<P>
   John Leifer, a Kansas City area health-care consultant who has
done work for Menninger, said he was shocked by Menninger's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its roots run so deep in this community, and Menninger has
been working arduously to build a community psychiatric presence
within the Kansas City metroplex,'' Leifer said. ``I assume that
tremendous deliberation went into reaching this difficult decision,
and I'm saddened that Kansas will no longer be home to arguably the
greatest legacy in American psychiatry.''

 OIL LEADERS PRESS THEIR DEMANDS  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ Leaders of the world's top oil-producing nations
warned politely but firmly Wednesday that they intend to strike a
hard bargain in exchange for increased cooperation with the Western
countries that buy their crude.
</P>
<P>
   Heads of state and top officials of the 11-member Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries tried to allay the world's current
jitters over soaring oil prices, saying OPEC wants to help create a
system that sets ``fair'' prices, not high ones.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a remarkable display of unity, the leaders also made
clear that they sought a more equitable relationship with the more
powerful consuming nations. Speaker after speaker demanded that
Western countries reduce the taxes they levy on fuel, an issue that
prompted thousands of protesters to paralyze highways in Europe in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The summit's host, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, urged OPEC
leaders to not just stop there. Instead, he said, OPEC should use
its clout to pressure rich countries to give poorer nations more
favorable terms of financing and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are asking for is justice,'' said Chavez, who has
built his political career on populist appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone of the OPEC summit's opening day was generally
moderate, typified by Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, who said
the organization ``is willing to open a dialogue about finding a
reasonable price for crude and a mechanism to set it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a sign that such a dialogue may indeed be emerging _
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin phoned Chavez Wednesday to
propose negotiations between the European Union and the oil
producers. The two agreed on the idea, but no date was set,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was plenty of resentment at the meeting over what
was described as the West's dominance of international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez drew laughs from the assembled leaders when he compared
the $31 price for a barrel of oil with the per-barrel prices of
other internationally traded products: Coca-Cola, $78; shampoo,
$2,056; suntan lotion, $5,365.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let consuming nations blame us for high fuel
prices,'' Chavez said. ``We're victims of the unjust terms of
trade, in which we sell cheap and buy dear, yet get blamed for high
prices that aren't high.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has said he wants OPEC to step up pressure on consuming
countries, especially in Europe, to slash government taxes on fuel,
which account for as much as 75 percent of the cost to consumers in
some countries.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's call for dialogue accompanies European governments'
growing nervousness about the domestic political costs of
high-priced fuel. His overture to Chavez suggests that he does not
want the issue to simmer until a scheduled meeting Nov. 18 in Saudi
Arabia between oil producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The last meeting between consumers and producers was held two
years ago in Cape Town, South Africa, when oil prices were falling
toward their lowest level in 12 years, and consuming nations were
clearly in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, whose government has long taken a hard-line stand in
favor of keeping prices high, said OPEC will offer a quid pro quo:
production increases only in return for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to raise production to keep prices stable, but
we are concerned about high taxes, and we ask for measures to
rectify this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also demanded concessions on environmental regulations, which
also add to the cost of gasoline, although he did not specify which
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah indicated that his nation, which has
close ties with the United States, will keep nudging fellow members
toward compromise, but he added that it too wants the world's most
powerful countries to address the problem of poverty in the Third
World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been supporting dialogue, and we still support
dialogue, to reach comprehension and mutual effort,'' he said.
``(But it) should help end poverty and reach international
equilibrium for developing nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-isolated Iraq, which bears the greatest grudge against the
West, had its own demand.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan complained about the
U.S.-backed oil sanctions against his country, enforced by the
United Nations since the 1991 Gulf War. He indicated that Iraq will
insist that OPEC make lifting the sanctions a condition of any deal
on prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the spirit of the day, Yassin repeated some of the
other leaders' conciliatory rhetoric: ``If the embargo is lifted,
it will be conducive to reaching a long-term strategy that
guarantees oil producers fair prices while guaranteeing supplies to
consuming nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the leaders insisted that there is little
reason to increase the amount of oil they produce.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the United States starts releasing 30 million
barrels of oil from its strategic reserve, while OPEC will produce
an additional 800,000 barrels a day starting in October. Both
measures are expected to lower prices. ``I don't see why anybody
should worry,'' said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   ``No deficit of crude exists,'' declared OPEC President Ali
Rodriguez. He said crude supply exceeds demand by 2 million barrels
a day _ and added that some European Union members are quietly
drawing from their own reserves.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to reveal which ones, saying, ``I know, but you have
to find out.''

DOLE INDUCTED INTO AGRICULTURE HALL OF HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ Bob Dole was feted as an
American hero again Wednesday, this time right up there with Smokey
Bear.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture inducted the former senator
from Kansas, the bear and scientists George Washington Carver and
Hugh Hammond Bennett into its new Hall of Heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The waddling Smokey stole the show, but Dole seemed to expect no
less from the guardian of the nation's forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get Smokey to endorse me in 1996, and he wouldn't
do it,'' quipped Dole, a former Republican presidential nominee.
``That's probably why I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent survey found that 98 percent of Americans over age 10
could identify Smokey by his picture, compared with 27 percent for
Dole, said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Dole had something going for him, though, said Glickman, another
former lawmaker from Kansas: ``Bob, you are the only one of these
inductees who is alive and who is not a bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Glickman got serious: ``Senator Dole was the author and or
principal co-sponsor of virtually every piece of farm legislation
passed by Congress in the past 35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has two Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, said being in the Hall of Heroes was
also a valued honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved the Department of Agriculture,'' Dole said.
``Agriculture is never partisan. We'd say, `You write this section,
and I'll write that section.' There is very little politics in
agriculture, so I'm proud to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Carver, a southwest Missouri native born into slavery in 1861,
was a teacher and scientist who developed industrial chemical
products from organic materials. Bennett crusaded for soil
conservation at the Department of Agriculture in the wake of the
Dust Bowl of the middle 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Smokey Bear was created as a cartoon character for the U.S.
Forest Service in 1944.

 Seven Station Casinos executives again ordered to testify  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM   
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The chairman of the Missouri Gaming Commission has
ordered seven executives at the Las Vegas headquarters of Station
Casinos Inc. to appear and testify under oath at a special meeting
next month in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not appear Oct. 10, Chairman L.G. Ullery said
Wednesday, the company's licenses to operate riverboat casinos in
Kansas City and St. Charles, Mo., may be in jeopardy when they
expire this winter _ or sooner.
</P>
<P>
   After noting the casinos' license expiration dates, Ullery said:
``This commission will shortly face the question of whether Station
Casino has proven by clear and convincing evidence its suitability
as to receive new excursion gambling boat licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles German, Station's lawyer in Kansas City, said late
Wednesday that it hadn't been decided whether the seven executives
would appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission chairman's statement is something we will study
and that we take very seriously. We will respond to him before
October 10,'' German said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Station's Kansas City license expires Jan. 15, 2001,
and St. Charles on Dec. 27, Ullery also ordered commission
investigators to report at the commission's regular meeting later
in October on Station's general suitability to hold state gambling
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ullery said that special staff report should emphasize ``the
institutional knowledge and control of Station Casinos' agents and
Station Casinos' ability to supervise activities of its agents.''
Under its rules, the commission can reopen a license hearing at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Wednesday in Jefferson City, the commission also
proposed that Station Casino Kansas City be fined $50,000 for
displaying placards on its River King casino floor that advertised
incorrect payback percentages for a specific set of slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   A Station executive called the proposed fine ``excessive'' and
said he expected the company to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Station executives ordered to appear Oct. 10 refused to obey
commission subpoenas issued last month. The executives are Frank J.
Fertitta III, chairman and chief executive; Glenn C. Christenson,
executive vice president and chief financial officer; Scott
Nielson, executive vice president and general counsel; William W.
Warner, vice president of finance; Richard Haskins, associate
general counsel; John Pasqualotto, vice president of regulatory
compliance; and Marnie Hinrichs, executive secretary to Nielson.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is an investor in a spinoff company of Station insiders
proposing to buy the Kansas City and St. Charles casinos for $475
million.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's consideration of that sale is caught up in the
larger issue of license revocation and the escalating discord
between Station officials and state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted unanimously Aug. 31 to revoke Station's
Kansas City and St. Charles licenses for the seven executives'
refusal to honor subpoenas and testify under oath at a formal
inquiry that week in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   That inquiry centered on events surrounding the guilty plea in
federal court earlier this year of former Station outside counsel
Michael Lazaroff. The St. Louis lawyer admitted to multiple
felonies, including misappropriation of law firm funds that
included $500,000 in questionable bonus payments from Station.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff agreed to cooperate in the commission's investigation
while awaiting sentencing in exchange for leniency in his expected
27-month to 33-month prison sentence. Lazaroff is scheduled to be
sentenced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings were intended to reveal whether Lazaroff used bonus
money to improperly influence public officials on Station's behalf.
Instead, the commission's staff presented evidence that Lazaroff
spent all the money on himself.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry now appears to turn on Lazaroff's personal
relationship with former commission Chairman Robert L. Wolfson and
whether their prohibited private conversations over several years
gave Station an unfair advantage in winning its riverboat licenses
_ which Lazaroff testified it did.
</P>
<P>
   Station is expected to appeal the revocation decision and defend
itself at a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is considering additional charges against Station
in connection with the Lazaroff-Wolfson relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Station said last month that it was refusing to participate in
what it termed an ``unfair, one-sided proceeding'' at which it
could not cross-examine witnesses. The company also has challenged
the commission's authority to issue subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $50,000 fine against Station was approved by
commissioners Wednesday after staff investigators reported that the
company failed to ``honestly and fairly represent jackpot payouts
in its advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   Station has 30 days to appeal the penalty or pay the fine.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, John F. Finamore, Station's Midwest
president, said the fine almost certainly would be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``$50,000 is extremely excessive,'' Finamore said. ``There was
no deliberate attempt by us to mislead the public. It was an honest
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said a bank of eight slot machines was replaced in May
with a set of 12 ``Eye of the Tiger'' $1 devices. But the roughly
20-inch square signs nearby promoting the payback rates of the old
slots were inadvertently left in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just forgot those signs,'' he said. ``They were so small we
didn't even notice them.''
</P>
<P>
   The old machines paid back jackpots to players in excess of 97
percent of all coins played through them, and the sign advertised
that number.
</P>
<P>
   The linked-jackpot ``Tiger'' games, which are still in place,
pay 94.5 percent, plus an additional 2 percent to a pooled bonus
jackpot fund, Finamore said.

 CHAVEZ'S OIL WINDFALL  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ If money is power, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
suddenly has lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rise in oil prices, the government _ which
derives most of its revenues from Petroleos de Venezuela, the
state-owned oil company _ has seen its annual revenue increase by
$10 billion this year, a 60 percent jump over last year. Much of
the money is being put aside in a special ``stabilization fund'' _
essentially, a rainy-day fund for when oil prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chavez announced his first major spending program.
The plan totals $2.1 billion, including $819 million for
infrastructure, $756 million for social programs, and the rest for
economic stimuli, technology and security. Only $84 million is to
be spent on the police and army.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chavez is a former army paratrooper and led a failed
military coup in 1992, he has surprised his critics and angered the
military officer corps by not increasing the budget for arms
purchases. Officials say little or nothing from the new package
will go to weapons spending.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the program will be administered by Plan Bolivar 2000, a
military-run social-service program that has won widespread public
praise. While officers resent being sent to supervise ditch-digging
and the like, ordinary Venezuelans are delighted by the program
because most believe the military is not corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez gained power because of public revulsion over decades of
graft, during which revenues from previous oil booms were stolen
and squandered.
</P>
<P>
   The worst damage occurred during the administrations of
Presidents Luis Herrera Campins, Jaime Lusinchi and Carlos Andres
Perez, which spanned 1974 to 1993. The losses during the period
were estimated last year by Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel at
$100 billion _ three times the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The era was capped in 1994 by a crisis touched off by dishonest
bankers. Almost the entire private banking system had to be
nationalized, at a cost of $8.5 billion, the equivalent of
three-quarters of the federal budget. The bankers responsible
absconded with most of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of this history, Venezuelans will probably
love him forever if he can spend the proceeds of the current oil
boom honestly and efficiently.

STREISAND'S CONCERT A BIOGRAPHIC MUSICAL FAIRY TALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With STREISAND-CONCERT) 
(DUPLICATION WARING: The following story is also being sent with an
``e'' category code) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leave it to Barbra Streisand to turn her own life
into a musical fairy tale, one with a resoundingly happy ending.
That is the essence of the farewell show Streisand brought to
Madison Square Garden for two sold-out performances Wednesday and
Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The personal story she tells in songs and anecdotes is a
variation on any number of myths in which a lonely, gifted child
who never knew her father dreams of finding and marrying a handsome
prince and living happily ever after. But before the blissful
fadeout into a heavenly sunset, she also becomes the queen of the
Hollywood dream factory with her spellbinding voice. That voice
lingers over the word ``love'' like no other. The ``l'' is
typically rolled voluptuously for an extra half beat, the ``o''
quivers with a tremulous anticipation, the ``v'' is soft and
inviting. Both the yearning for that love and its fulfillment are
built into the voice. Love of the most romantic kind is the magic
word that if you repeat it enough times can conjure up a romantic
savior.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's show even includes a child version of herself (the
gifted young singer Lauren Frost) who is used to fine dramatic
effect playing the singer as an adolescent girl recording ``You'll
Never Know.'' Streisand eventually chimes in on the number, and the
two join voices on ``Something's Coming,'' the great
Bernstein-Sondheim ballad of romantic anticipation from ``West Side
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the show, in the most effective of several video
sequences, Frost and Streisand rejoin voices with video images (two
live and one from the movie ``Yentl'') singing ``Papa Can You Hear
Me?'' The song is the touching musical climax to Streisand's
anecdote about being sent a love letter her father wrote to a woman
(not her mother) 60 years earlier when he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into possession of the letter, the singer said, made her
feel a mystical spiritual connection with him that helped her
through the rougher moments of making ``Yentl.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the show is a fairly straightforward career
retrospective that carries the singer from that early recording
session, to nightclubs, to Broadway, and finally to Hollywood and a
late-blooming fairy-tale romance and marriage to the actor James
Brolin. The closer it gets to the present, the more shamelessly
sentimental the show becomes. The love songs that accompany
Streisand's wedding and happily-ever-after pictures with Brolin are
pure greeting-card mush.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder is that Streisand's voice can make such sing-songy
romantic doggerel sound if not deep, at least deeply heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising about Streisand's show is that personal
happiness has lightened up her singing. She has always been better
in a relaxed, tender mode than in her steely stentorian one, In her
recordings, especially her more recent ones, Streisand's
perfectionist drive has tended to eradicate spontaneity in the
quest for an inhuman technical perfection. Again and again, the
singing conveyed a relaxed joy, a playful tenderness that rarely
makes it to Streisand's recordings nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many magical moments, some of the most memorable were
a wistful ``The Way We Were,'' a tender ``Something Wonderful,''
``Alfie,'' ``Send in the Clowns'' and ``Don't Like Goodbyes.''
Among misfires, only two seriously grated: The frantic disco hit
``The Main Event,'' and an awkward beyond-the-grave video duet with
Frank Sinatra on ``I've Got a Crush on You.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the concert reconfirmed Streisand's status as the
last (and possibly the greatest) true believer in the old romantic
myths that are vanishing from pop. She's living proof that
schoolgirl dreams really do come true, and happy endings aren't
just found in fairy tales. But if these are really her last
concerts, her happy ending is our loss.

VENEZUELA'S CHAVEZ MASTERMINDS AN OPEC COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  CARACAS _ The man who cavorted on the airport tarmac with his
honor guard, playfully ordering them here and there and cracking so
many jokes that they looked at each other in amazement, didn't seem
like the kind of figure who commands world attention.
<P>
   Yet there Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was, breaking
red-carpet protocol at nearly every chance _ bounding up an
airplane stairway to give a bear hug to the emir of Qatar, kissing
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and kidding and flirting
with journalists who surrounded him at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's performance Tuesday as he welcomed leaders to the
summit meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
was typical of his strange magic.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who almost single-handedly brought OPEC back from what
only a few years ago seemed like near-death status, is now trying
to make the organization a major world player again.
</P>
<P>
   In his frequent travels since he took office in February of last
year, Chavez has charmed and beguiled Middle Eastern sheiks, Wall
Street bankers and Cuba's Fidel Castro. When the occasion calls for
it, he can be serious and eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely enough, Chavez's informal shtick seems to work
well for the formal, often pompous circles of OPEC diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, for example, he phoned OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu
Lukman, abruptly interrupting the Nigerian as he was giving a press
conference. Chavez _ who was holding his weekly call-in radio show
at the time _ put the startled official on the air live: ``OK,
Lukman, welcome to the country of Bolivar. We're glad you're
here,'' said Chavez in broken English, referring to independence
hero Simon Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   Lukman paused, then grinned ear to ear, obviously tickled pink.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unclear whether Chavez will succeed in keeping
OPEC unified. He has no real control over the group's underlying
divisions, rivalries and differences in national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that Chavez has gotten away with what he has,''
said a Caracas-based diplomat, referring to OPEC's acquiescence in
his informal leadership role. ``He's riding high. But I wonder how
long it will last.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's current diplomatic success seems unreal after his
checkered past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after the then-army colonel led a failed coup against
the government, he was imprisoned and his career appeared to be
over. But his populist appeal _ based largely on his vow to stamp
out the flagrant corruption that plagued Venezuela for 30 years _
touched a nerve in the impoverished public, and the government was
forced to release him after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's radical harangues against what he called the country's
``rancid oligarchy'' propelled him to power in the 1999 elections
and again in May.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in effect, a bloodless revolution. The leading political
parties, widely loathed for their tolerance of graft and cronyism
among the elite, have been virtually wiped off the map, while the
Congress, Supreme Court and constitution have been overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   Among the middle and upper classes, though, there is widespread
anti-Chavez sentiment. The wealthy, who are almost entirely white,
often look askance at the president's humble origins and dark,
mixed-race features.
</P>
<P>
   He has also irritated former colleagues in the military by
insisting that the institution participate in his popular Plan
Bolivar 2000 poverty-fighting program. This has saddled soldiers
with such unfamiliar tasks as repainting schools, cleaning
drainpipes and operating low-cost ``popular markets'' in poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's foreign-policy views often seem like echoes of Third
World anti-Americanism from an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   He withdrew the Venezuelan military from regional naval
exercises in the Caribbean and refused to allow U.S. planes
monitoring drug trafficking to fly in Venezuelan airspace. He has
harshly criticized Washington's $1.3 billion aid program for
neighboring Colombia's war against leftist rebels and drug dealers,
saying it may lead to ``the Vietnamization of the entire Amazon
region,'' and he has expressed sympathy for the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Chavez defied Washington and world opinion in general
by becoming the first head of state to visit Iraq's Saddam Hussein
since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   And he clearly sees Castro as a mentor, declaring last year that
Venezuela and Cuba are swimming together ``toward the same sea of
happiness and of real social justice and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Chavez, who calls himself a ``revolutionary,'' a new Castro
in the making?
</P>
<P>
   Rumors and accusations abound _ arms shipments to the Colombian
rebels, the infiltration of hundreds of Cuban security agents into
Venezuela _ but U.S. diplomats say they have found no proof yet.
The Clinton administration, in fact, has treated Chavez with
patience _ a far cry from bygone days when deviations from U.S.
policy lines drew bellicose responses from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a little in Chavez of the priest his mother
wanted him to become _ although he never rose higher than altar
boy, and his own dream was to be a U.S. major league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He has a preacher's gift for oratory, and his speeches are
sprinkled with biblical references _ despite the fact that he once
told an interviewer he was ``not familiar with Christian doctrine,
nor do I practice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary Venezuelans seem to find little to object to in
the comparisons Chavez often draws between himself and Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord sent him to us,'' said Emma Duran, a Caracas resident
who the president comforted recently after her slum dwelling was
partially destroyed by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hugged and kissed the 68-year-old widow and, after
speaking with her for several minutes despite being late for an
appointment, ordered his military aides to deal with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the president's energy that it sometimes seems as if he
intends to solve the problems of the poor one-by-one and by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It is a technique dismissed by critics as unsustainable
micro-management, and it is clearly no substitute for efficient
state institutions. Emma Duran's house still leaks, despite the
efforts of the construction gang sent by the president's men.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubting the impact Chavez has on the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez talks to people in their own language,'' said Teodoro
Petkoff, a former planning minister and editor of the opposition
newspaper TalCual. ``Politicians here stopped talking to people
years ago.''

GARDNER'S GOLDEN MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Growing up in Afton, Wyo., Rulon Gardner
wrestled eight siblings, heads of cattle and small-town
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew his obscure background would provide the perfect
training ground to dethrone the most colossal of Greco-Roman
wrestlers?
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, 29, became the first man in 13 years to beat three-time
Olympic champion Aleksandr Karelin of Russia, in the heavyweight
gold-medal match Wednesday at the Sydney Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin felt his grip loosen on his astounding streak in the
second period when, while battling for an advantageous position, he
broke his hold on Gardner, who was promptly awarded one point. That
would be the only score of the consequential match.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's 1-0 win contrasted sharply with the result the only
other time the two wrestlers squared off. At the 1997 World
Championships, Karelin won 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   In six years of competing internationally, Gardner never had
notched an international title. He picked a heck of a stage for his
global breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on a farm,'' Gardner said. ``As a kid, I could
barely pick up a bale of hay. By the time my senior year in high
school came around, I was grabbing four bales of hay at a time. I
always learned that when you work, you go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't actually think I could beat (Karelin), but I was
going to work as hard as I could. I just tried to push on him like
I push cows,'' Gardner added. ``I knew if he got a point on me,
he'd win the match. When I wrestled him the first time, in 1997, he
threw me on my head three times.''
</P>
<P>
   In Olympic competition, Karelin handled most of his opponents
like rag dolls. In 1988, Rangel Gerovski was the only one of
Karelin's five opponents to go the distance. Karelin came from
three points down in the final 30 seconds to beat Gerovski for the
gold medal 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 Summer Games, only one of Karelin's opponents
managed to last the full five minutes against him. Karelin needed a
total of 5 minutes, 32 seconds to pin the other four.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later in Atlanta, Karelin scored a one-point takedown
less than two minutes into his gold-medal match against American
Matt Ghaffari, repelling Ghaffari's best moves for the remainder of
the match and the ensuing overtime to become the first Olympic
wrestler to win the same division three times.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gardner has a streak to wrestle with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from a small town, I'm not used to this big-time stuff,''
Gardner said. ``It was incredible standing on the (victory) podium.
I won the gold medal, but I know nobody in wrestling will ever
forget (Karelin). He's a legend.''

ARBITRATORS REJECT APPEAL BY ROMANIAN GYMNAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Less than a week after the charismatic
Romanian Andreea Raducan won the prestigious Olympic all-around
gold medal with a style some compared to Nadia Comaneci, she was
stripped of her medal on Tuesday after testing positive for a
banned drug.
</P>
<P>
   A Romanian team doctor administered the drug stimulant
pseudoephedrine to the 16-year-old Raducan in the form of a cold
medicine. Dr. Ioachin Oana was held responsible and expelled from
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan is the first gymnast to be stripped of a medal because
of a drug violation. She is the second athlete at these Games to
lose a gold, and it was the sixth positive drug case at the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team physician should be able to read a bloody label on a
package,'' said Dick Pound, vice president of the International
Olympic Committee and head of the IOC's World Anti-Doping Agency.
``It was reckless on the part of the physician. His athlete tested
positive; and because of it, her medal was withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan, the first Romanian to win the gold in the all-around
since Comaneci, was allowed to keep the gold she won as a part of
the team competition and also the silver medal she won in the
vault. But with Raducan's disqualification, the Romanian sweep of
the all-around medals came to an end. The Romanian Simona Amanar
claims the gold in the individual all-around competition, and her
teammate, Maria Olaru, moves up from bronze to silver. Liu Xuan of
China, who placed fourth, is the bronze medalist.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the IOC's
executive board, the presence of the banned substance was detected
in the A urine sample. The Romanian delegation was informed of the
results on Monday, and they requested a B sample be tested. The
results were the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this case is completely irrelevant,'' Ion Tiriac,
the president of the Romanian National Olympic Committee, told The
Associated Press. ``The athlete is the best gymnast in the world at
this time _ she has proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan was part of a mighty Romanian gymnastics team. On
Thursday night, she stood atop her coach's shoulders and smiled
brightly after her dominating performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of them,'' said Bela Karolyi, the U.S. team
coordinator, who laid the groundwork for the Romanian program. ``I
feel good about what has happened to their program.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan has been the sparkling ornament on the Romanian program.
She has steadily risen through the factory-like system in Romania
and become one of the elite gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Russian Svetlana Khorkina _ who was one of the
favorites for the gold, but saw that chance ruined by an error in
the vault measurement _ Raducan revealed herself to be the template
for the gymnastic pixie. At 4 feet 10 inches, and only 82 pounds,
she is the perfect size to impress the judges. She is also better
equipped to adjust on the fly. But now, after a team physician
administered Nurofen, an over-the-counter cold medicine with the
banned drug, Raducan has been stripped of her glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the physician is a moron, he should know what he is
giving an athlete,'' Pound said. ``If there is a presence of a
banned drug, he should be able to realize that.'' &QL;

NO PLAYOFFS AGAIN, SO JOHNSON SET FOR FATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tonight might be the last time manager Davey
Johnson puts on the home uniform of the Dodgers, but he insists he
holds no ill will about how the process has gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he understands when a payroll is $98 million, up
nearly 20 percent from 1999, and the team doesn't win, somebody
must fall. After all, pitching coach Charlie Hough met the same
fate last season when the Dodgers didn't live up to expectations
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have the payroll we have here and you don't win,
there's no question someone's going to take the brunt of it,'' said
Johnson, in his second season with the Dodgers. ``We just weren't
as good as the Giants. Basically, their starters pitched better
than our starters. Their starters are (23) games over .500. Their
offense generated more runs than ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to win, you don't have any areas of weakness.
That's why you win. I think I have as much experience managing the
clubs that win divisions and get in postseason play as anybody in
baseball, and I think I would recognize a championship club and
what it takes to be a championship club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club was actually overvalued last year, because I think
of the money spent. There were definitely deficiencies (in the)
bullpen and flexibility. We had a lot of injuries (this season) and
our starters, all five of them, have never been consistent at one
time. That's the difference in winning and losing, a championship
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the Dodgers' inability to get consistent,
even mediocre, outings from their fourth and fifth starters. That
part of the starting rotation was 10-25 with a 6.38 ERA heading
into Wednesday. That weighed heavily in the Dodgers' starting
pitchers going a combined 52-49 with a 4.33 ERA. By contrast, the
division-winning Giants saw their starters go 68-45 with a 4.35
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also didn't have a true leadoff hitter for four
months, had no dependable lefty in the bullpen and are the
second-worst fielding team in the major leagues with 135 errors.
But the pitching was the biggest thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some disastrous results, four and five,'' Johnson said.
``Not only those games, but there was an overriding effect in other
games because of what it did to my bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   But disappointment this season was set up by the terrible 1999
in which everyone associated with the Dodgers, from the moment
Kevin Brown signed a $105 million deal, talked about them competing
for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of money was spent and expectations go with a high
payroll, regardless of whether all the pieces are there or not,''
Johnson said. ``That's just part of it. Were we a championship club
last year? No. Were we better than our (77-85) record? I don't know
that either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we played pretty good this year? I think we've played
pretty good this year. I think it's been an improvement, a lot of
steps in the right direction. Could we have done more? Yeah, I'd
like to have done more. A lot of times we were restricted by
contracts, by personnel, lack of depth, lack of minor-league
support.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tommy due in: Dodgers senior vice president Tommy Lasorda,
fresh off leading the United States baseball team to its first gold
medal, is expected to be at Dodger Stadium for tonight's home
finale. Lasorda and the team were due to arrive at LAX this
morning.

ANOTHER PRIME OPPORTUNITY MISSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How cool would that have been?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Cuba baseball gold-medal game live at 1 in the morning
here, creating a buzz as the East Coasters woke up to see what some
have overzealously compared to the ``Miracle On Ice'' from 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   We could have even handled Tommy Lasorda's overexuberance, kinda
like the rooster's crow to start the day.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't have spoiled it for prime-time viewers later
Wednesday, right?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but that's where NBC compounded its blunder in its coverage
of what could be the Games' biggest event so far. It picked the
middle of the day Wednesday to show it on MSNBC. True, it got the
best uninterrupted time chunk, but so much for getting the most
eyeballs glued to the TV to America's so-called pastime.
</P>
<P>
   As for NBC's prime-untimeliness coverage, it didn't come until
past 9:30 p.m., when Lasorda went into the studio for an interview
with Bob Costas. At which point, when it aired here, Lasorda was
already on a plane heading home.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ratings roundup: Anchored by the mind-numbing fluff of the
gymnastics champions' gala exhibition and some really obese guys
lifting weights on an offday for track and field, Tuesday's
prime-time ratings stumbled in at 12.4 and a 21 share, the smallest
of the 12 days during NBC's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The network spin, of course, was that it was 80 percent better
than the network's season-to-date Tuesday average of 7.5 with
``Frasier,'' ``Just Shoot Me,'' and ``Dateline NBC,'' while it
crushed that night's competition from Fox (4.4/7), CBS (4.8/8) and
ABC (7.8/13).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NBC has also figured out a way to manipulate and
boost ratings without messing with the overproduced programming.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has instructed Nielsen research to not include ratings on
the 7- to-7:30 p.m. portion of each night's telecast, which has
been about 40 percent lower than the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC spokesperson confirmed the move and said national
advertisements were moved to later in the broadcast. NBC has been
doing this nifty little trick the last five nights.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the overall 12-night rating of 14.6 (with a 25
share) is well under the 16.1 guaranteed to advertisers, 36 percent
off from Atlanta in '96 (22.7/43), and 19 percent off Barcelona in
'92 (18.1/34) and Seoul in '88 (18.0/32).

 NAPSTER MAY HAVE STARTED SOMETHING NO COURT RULING CAN STOP  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In Ian Clarke's view, it won't matter whether
Napster lives or dies in its big courtroom showdown next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is already filled with Napster-style programs,
including one Clarke wrote called Freenet. Each accomplishes the
same digital share-and-swap functions as Napster, yet won't be as
easy to slap down with a civil court summons.
</P>
<P>
   A host of new companies inspired by the wildfire success of
Napster are popping up with business plans that not only promise
legal uses of ``peer-to-peer'' file sharing, but could make the
technology even more widespread than Napster could ever accomplish
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, companies like Lightshare Inc. and Flycode _
started by two of Napster's original investors _ hope to take file
sharing far beyond free downloadable music. The technology could be
used to easily find company sales reports and expense forms, or
sell San Francisco Giants tickets, used motorcycles or even fully
licensed copies of Metallica songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peer-to-peer (technology) is gaining legitimacy aside from
being just a piracy tool, which was the very-early-2000 point of
view,'' said Clarke, 23, a computer programmer in London who has
just started his own company called Uprizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of linking millions of decentralized computers to share
information rapidly could be the most powerful ``democratic
publishing model'' ever seen, said Doug Ross, chief technology
officer of BadBlue Corp., a Cincinnati peer-to-peer software
company that will launch Thursday. ``There's nothing you can do
about the free flow of information.''
</P>
<P>
   An unstoppable people's revolution was far from Northeastern
University student Shawn Fanning's mind when he wrote the Napster
program during January 1999. He simply wanted an easy way to share
digital MP3 music files with his friends, and named his creation
after the nickname he picked up after getting a short, nappy
haircut.
</P>
<P>
   The program soon begat a company, Napster Inc., which originally
set up shop in San Mateo, Calif., and is now based in Redwood City.
And with lightning speed, Napster became what company employees
have called an ``accidental empire'' of about 28 million registered
users, one of the fastest-growing software applications ever
unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster program enables music fans to connect their
computers via the Internet on a one-to-one basis. With millions of
computers, that peer-to-peer network forms a huge database of songs
not possible with a central computer server. Napster also became
popular because the program is easy to use and can find virtually
any song quickly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Copyright Lawsuit
</P>
<P>
   But the world's biggest record labels, which own the copyrights
to the majority of those songs, sued Napster on grounds that the
program serves only to promote illegal music piracy.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a U.S. District Court judge in San Francisco agreed,
slapping a preliminary injunction on Napster and ordering it to
halt the swapping of copyright songs. Two days later, however, the
U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco issued a stay of the
injunction, and a three-judge Appeals Court panel will hear oral
arguments in the case Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Napster loses the case, it could be forced to shut down. A
similar suit by the Motion Picture Association of America could
eventually shut down a Beverly Hills company called Scour, which
created a similar program that enables users to find and share
digital music and movie files.
</P>
<P>
   But shutting down similar programs like Gnutella and Freenet
would be difficult because, unlike Napster or Scour, they do not
depend on any one company or central computer server to function.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who argue that new limits should be placed on copyright
law may get their way in the courts as intellectual property
holders push their cases,'' media analyst Malcolm Maclachlan said
in a recent report. ``Meanwhile, new peer-to-peer programs may make
any copyright law irrelevant by making them impossible to
enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are dozens of freely distributed programs
available for download from the Internet with names like HackSter,
MyNapster, INapster, BeNapster, Macster, Gnapster, Snap, WebNap,
Gnotella and MyGnut. None, however, comes close to having the
number of users Napster claims.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Decentralized Network
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing is Freenet, which provides a more
pure form of peer-to-peer computing than Napster. Clarke wrote the
program while earning a degree in computer science and artificial
intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1999
and released it onto the Internet as an open-source program.
</P>
<P>
   A computer with the Freenet program installed becomes a ``node''
in a network connected by the Internet to other ``nodes.'' So
someone using Freenet to search for a particular MP3 music file has
one node contacting other nodes until that file is found and
anonymously relayed back to the originating computer. And each node
contacted learns where that file is stored, so subsequent searches
become easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting about this technology is the fact that you
can design a system that does not have centralized controls and
that is scalable and efficient,'' Clarke said. ``And each time it
forwards information, it learns more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he didn't write Freenet to trade music or movie
files, but as a way to protect intellectual freedom on the
Internet. He wanted a way to disseminate information, whether it is
about controversial political views, alternative religions and
lifestyles, or whistle-blowing data on companies, even within
countries where governments censor such thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freenet is politically motivated as a tool to allow free,
anonymous speech,'' Clarke said. ``Ultimately, my aim is to make
censorship impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Freenet is a beta program that has been downloaded by
300,000 people. Clarke said it is intentionally designed to be
difficult for the average consumer to use because it is still a
beta, but there are programmers who are close to making it as easy
as the Netscape or Internet Explorer Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Freenet is already being touted as a way for people to keep
trading digital music files if Napster is shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Freenet might start to play a significant role
when Napster is shut down because there is no legal remedy,''
Clarke said. ``We don't own Freenet, and we don't control it. I
don't even control it. Even if I was held personally liable for
so-called crimes due to Freenet it would not affect Freenet.''
</P>
<P>
   Free speech aside, Clarke is also moving into the world of free
enterprise. He has just incorporated a Los Angeles company called
Uprizer Inc. that is trying to steer clear of the sticky issues
surrounding digital copyrights, yet apply the Freenet technology to
corporate Intranet or wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the underground, power-to-the people mantra of Freenet,
Clarke describes Uprizer as a company with a very standard business
mission of being an ``application service provider,'' or ASP, that
helps companies easily share work documents and other files among
its employees or departments.
</P>
<P>
   BadBlue'sRoss said his company is also an ASP, with a
shrink-wrapped corporate software product, scheduled to premiere
during the fourth quarter of this year, that helps find documents
like expense forms and sales reports within a company. Eventually,
though, BadBlue hopes its peer-to-peer technology ``makes every
machine into a Web server.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said Napster's success with music leads to the question,
``What if every machine were a Web server?'' As for the legal
implications, ``we'll let the attorneys figure that out,'' he said.
``Our business model is we're moving digital bits around. They can
only legislate so much.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
P2P Commerce
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Kwan, chief executive officer and founder of Lightshare
Inc., said his Mountain View company is another ASP looking to a
day when peer-to-peer technology is used to buy and sell both
digital and physical goods, sort of a Napster-ized version of EBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to make money without having to have a Web site or
a large server,'' Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lightshare's business plan is to become the clearinghouse for
transactions set up by a Napster-style network. As an example, Kwan
said customers could search the entire network for Giants baseball
tickets, locate the best deal and arrange the sale, with Lightshare
providing the mechanism for the money exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Software, research papers, even CDs can be sold the same way,
Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to transform this whole peer-to-peer concept, which
has gotten a bad rap,'' Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a proliferation of computers using peer-to-peer
programs, that will also make swapping of free digital files like
music and movies and e-books even easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were just Napster, I think the Recording Industry
Association of America would have a good chance of shutting it
down,'' Clarke said. ``Now there's a proliferation of Napster-like
systems that can't theoretically be shut down one by one.''

 JUDGE CALLS AOL LITIGATION TERMS UNFAIR  &HT;     By HENRY K. LEE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ America Online users who sue the Internet giant
should not be forced to transfer their lawsuits to the company's
home state of Virginia because it is ``unfair and unreasonable,''
an Alameda County, Calif., judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision Monday, Superior Court Judge Ronald Sabraw said
legal remedies in Virginia are not comparable to those in
California, which AOL has acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes in a lawsuit filed in June by Al Mendoza Jr.
of Sacramento, Calif.,who accused AOL of continuing to charge his
credit card _ which he was forced to cancel _ three months after he
canceled his trial subscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am required to sue in Virginia, I will drop the matter
because the cost of travel alone is obviously many times more''
than the $65 that AOL owed him, Mendoza said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he was surprised when he learned that AOL had a
standard membership agreement requiring all lawsuits to be filed in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he did not remember reading a clause saying all
lawsuits had to be filed in Virginia and lambasted AOL for using it
``as a way to avoid its legal responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   He has asked the case to be deemed a class-action lawsuit on
behalf of ``many hundreds of people who I believe have suffered
from the same unfair billing practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Graham, an AOL spokesman, said Wednesday that he could
not discuss the lawsuit because he was unfamiliar with its details.
Everett Johnson, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing AOL, did
not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he signed up for AOL in early October using an
unsolicited free disc he received in the mail that promised free
trial service for 30 days. He remembered following numerous
instructions and reading ``densely worded, small-size text that was
hard to read on the computer screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Richardson, an Oakland, Calif., attorney representing
Mendoza, said AOL routinely mails formal requests for dismissals to
local small-claims courts, citing the Virginia requirement. In most
cases, the claimants drop the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single individual plaintiff from outside Virginia sued AOL
in Virginia during 1998 and 1999, he said.

 EXODUS COMMUNICATIONS PURSUING HOSTING BUSINESS  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Exodus Communications Inc. in Santa Clara,
Calif., which bid for Global Crossing Ltd.'s Web hosting business
in Sunnyvale two months ago, reportedly was negotiating furiously
Wednesday night to revive the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones News reported Wednesday that Exodus is in ``advanced
discussions'' to buy the GlobalCenter business for $6.5 billion and
said both boards were scheduled to consider the deal Wednesday
night. Unnamed sources told Bloomber News that a pact could be
announced as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company returned phone calls seeking comment. But
analysts said the deal could help Exodus meet its aggressive
expansion targets and bolster its position as one of the largest
Web hosting companies. Exodus, which has data centers around the
world, helps companies manage large Web sites and link them to the
Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill analyst Alex Arnold said Exodus would be
giving up as much as 30 percent of its stock to grow by 20 percent.
But Arnold said the deal makes sense because it would enable Exodus
to grow far faster than it would on its own and give it access to
new customers and services.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said Exodus' data centers cover about 2.5 million square
feet, and it hopes to expand that to 3.9 million by year end. A
deal with Global Crossing would quickly give Exodus an additional
500,000 square feet _ putting it closer to its goal. ``This is an
interesting way of getting there,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus reportedly lost out when WorldCom Inc. acquired another
Web hosting firm, Digex Inc., three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also benefits Global Crossing, which acquired its Web
hosting business as part of a $10 billion purchase of Frontier
Communications. It has already sold off its local phone service for
$3.6 billion. Should Global Crossing sell its Web hosting business
for $6.5 billion, it would essentially be allowed to get back its
entire purchase price for Frontier and keep teh long-distance
business and data networking for free.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the deal could also include a commitment from
Exodus to use Global Crossing's telecommunications network to carry
its data traffic _ a pledge worth $4 billion. The firms are also
considering pooling their efforts in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the deal wasn't final as of Wednesday afternoon. Word
of similar negotiations leaked out in July, only to be called off
over a dispute about the price.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the news sent investors scurrying to trade their shares
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus plunged $2.75 to $53.25 during regular trading and
tumbled an additional $2.25 during after-hours trading on concerns
the price was too high and could dilute earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Global Crossings jumped $1.88 to $29.88 during
regular trading and rose an additional $1 during extended trading.
Both stocks were among the most actively traded during after-hours
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms have a raft of competitors, ranging from other Web
hosting firms like Verio Inc. _ which typically manage other firm's
Web sites on their computers _ to companies like Equinix in Redwood
City, which runs ``telecom hotels,'' where Web site operators and
hosting companies can easily link to the Internet. Equinix's data
centers cover about 500,000 square feet, about the size of
GlobalCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Equinix chief executive Peter Van Camp said the recent deals
underscore the ``opportunity in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Exodus deal under discussion also outlines the
differences in their strategies. While Equinix is setting up data
centers around the country to give other firms a place to easily
offer their services and interconnect, Exodus prefers to offer
one-stop shopping for a wide suite of services to put companies
online.

MTV'S INTERNET UNIT CUTS STAFF, SETS ASIDE PLANS FOR
SPIN-OFF,  IPO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Attempting to cut costs in the increasingly
cutthroat dot-com market, MTV's Internet branch will lay off 25
percent of its staff, including some workers in San Francisco, the
company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   MTVi also shelved plans for a spin-off and initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of the 105 layoffs will come as a result of
consolidating the music news divisions of MTV.com, VH1.com,
Sonicnet.com and Country.com, a spokesman said. As a result, the
four Web sites will share content.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to have four people reviewing the same album.
It just doesn't make sense,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   MTVi said the move is simply a shortcut to profitability and
does not reflect a change in strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The company this year expects to double last year's $20 million
in revenue, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet music analyst Stacey Herron suggested that the
company is following the industry trend away from content, where
profits have been elusive.
</P>
<P>
   MTVi may provide more interactivity and fewer articles on its
site, Herron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're evaluating how people are interacting with their site.
Are they smart to do this? Yes,'' Herron said.
</P>
<P>
   MTVi was formed in July 1999 when MTV bought San Francisco's
Sonicnet and merged it with MTV.com and VH1.com. The New York
company maintains Sonicnet's offices as its San Francisco branch,
where it employs about 60 people. MTVi would not disclose how many
San Francisco employees will be laid off. The local office will
remain open, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   MTVi, a unit of Viacom, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in February to sell 10 percent of its stock to the
public. But an unfavorable IPO market scotched that plan, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the online music entertainment space, Wall
Street is not looking at it as favorably as they were a year ago,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet spin-offs of large media companies have not fared
well. NBC Internet's stock has fallen from an IPO price of $76 to
close Wednesday at $7 a share, and the company laid off 20 percent
of its staff last month. Disney spin-off Go.com has fallen from
$35.44 on IPO day to Wednesday's $10.50.
</P>
<P>
   MTVi parent Viacom closed at $56.56 Wednesday, down 50 cents.

MEDIA BYTES: IMAGINE MEDIA'S BRITISH STOCK OPTIONS BETTER THAN
NO  OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Brisbane, Calif.'s Imagine Media has tried to
attract journalists to work for its magazines, one key competitive
edge is that it can offer options in a stock that's publicly traded
while many other magazines can't.
</P>
<P>
   But those options have turned out to be, in the words of one
employee, ``hollow gift boxes,'' because of a serious lag between
the time employees decide to sell and the time the stock is
actually sold.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Imagine _ which publishes such magazines as
Business 2.0, MacAddict and PC Gamer _ is owned by a British
company, the Future Network.
</P>
<P>
   With stock in the Future Network trading on the London Stock
Exchange, it can take several days to cash in options _ and in some
cases, it has even taken a month.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot can happen in a month.
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, for instance, Future's stock price
dropped from 7.4 pounds on Aug. 29 to 6.55 pounds Tuesday. Putting
that into U.S. dollars, that's a drop from $10.76 to $9.57 _ or a
one-month decline of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From its high of 9.26 pounds (or $13.52) on Feb. 25, the stock
price is off 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident this summer, one journalist at the company
apparently suffered a paper loss of about $5,000, according to
employees. The worker was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, employees at TheStreet.com can exercise their
options and sell the stock all in one day, according to a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine's management is addressing the problem, but it will
still take at least several days to execute any stock sale,
according to the company's new president, former Times Mirror
executive Nancy O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does take a longer time with the London Stock Exchange than
it would on the Nasdaq,'' O'Neill said, citing ``longer settlement
times.'' ``They operate on different terms. The broker needs a
certain number of days to be able to effect the trade. ... We still
think this is reasonable, though.''
</P>
<P>
   From now on, once employees place their order, they will get
their money in 15 days, O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said some of the earlier problems had several causes.
Some of those were internal problems at Future Network and have
been fixed, either administratively or by patching up the software.
</P>
<P>
   Others were ``issues with our broker that were one-time
issues,'' O'Neill said. The brokers ``now understand how much
importance we place on this and how we want to make sure our
employees can exercise options in a timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The employees I spoke to did not want to be identified but said
that the issue has been raised in a virtual ``suggestion box'' on
the company's intranet. O'Neill said she has not had a chance to
alert employees to the changes but would soon.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have noted that Imagine's founder, Chris Anderson, has
used the stock options as a recruiting tool. Business 2.0, for
instance, competes for talent with magazines like Wired, the
Industry Standard, Fast Company, Upside and Red Herring _ none of
which are publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me,'' one employee said, ``is that Imagine and
Anderson have said to employees that we have nice stock options.
Granted, at my level it's not a huge amount anyway, and I don't
think any of us are talking much about the stock or glaring at the
ticker symbol on our screens in anticipation of making the first
$20 million, but I think management has been selling us some hollow
gift boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said the irony was not lost on management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a value of ours,'' she said. ``We want people to
be able to share in the success of the enterprise. This is
something you try to do for employees to be an unusual benefit. You
don't want there to be a drag on it.''
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S IN THE NEWS: MarketWatch.com is in the News _ the New York
Daily News Express, that is. The Express is a free afternoon paper
that the News premiered earlier this month, and San Francisco's
MarketWatch.com is providing most of the business section coverage.
</P>
<P>
   MarketWatch Chief Executive Officer Larry Kramer has experience
with afternoon papers: He was once the executive editor of the San
Francisco Examiner. ``I'm back,'' he said last week, sitting on one
of the gaudy yellow leather chairs in his office. ``I can't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   MarketWatch doesn't get any money for its stories, but Kramer
says it's a great deal because it takes little extra work and it
gives the company promotion _ both by putting MarketWatch.com
bylines on the stories and by getting ads in the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``My board had said, `Promise us you won't go into print,'''
Kramer said. ``But this kind of print, there's no downside.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW NOT TO CRASH A PARTY: Salon.com is throwing a big bash
Thursday night at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts,
with Comedy Central's Ben Stein moderating a panel discussion
called ``From Degas to Dot-com.'' Actress Tracey Ullman, movie
critic Roger Ebert, comic-book artist Stan Lee, director Mike
Figgis, rocker Jerry Harrison and entrepreneur Brenda Laurel will
have a real-life salon on the fusion of art and technology.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 750 people have RSVPd. CEO Michael O'Donnell is worried
that even more will try to crash but he figures they won't be too
hard to stop. ``We found Web sites that tell you how to
successfully crash the parties,'' he said. ``The No. 1 way is to
tell them you're a venture capitalist.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell added his own tip: ``We said, `Tell them you're a
venture capitalist who's into content.' Then you're really not
believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I thought the era of big dot-com parties was over, but
O'Donnell said Salon found a way around that, too. He said Lexus, a
big sponsor on Salon's Web site, is footing the bill. (He wouldn't
say how much the party cost.)
</P>
<P>
   STAYING PUT: Employees at my old paper, the Marin Independent
Journal in Marin County, Calif., were sure the paper was being sold
recently when the publisher and advertising director left on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   The paper was indeed sold, by Gannett Co. to ANG Newspapers. But
the ad boss, Marty Rubino, has had a change in circumstances, and
he is no longer moving. He was going to run the ad department at
the Fang-owned San Francisco Examiner, but now he is going to stick
with the IJ.

N.Y. CITY POLICE DEPT. RELAXES REQUIREMENTS FOR RECRUTIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with a dwindling number of applicants for the
city's Police Academy, the Police Department relaxed its
eligibility requirements on Wednesday to allow younger recruits to
join the department and to admit more officers without two years of
college study.
</P>
<P>
   Under the changes, which Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik
said would take effect immediately, the department will accept
21-year-old applicants. For the last five years, the department set
22 as the minimum age, in the belief that officers younger than
that were more likely to become disciplinary problems during their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik also said the department would waive a requirement that
recruits have 60 college credits for two more categories of
applicants. The department already waives the requirement for those
with two or more years of honorable military service. Now the
education requirement will be waived for any of the city's 5,200
traffic enforcement and school safety agents who have at least two
years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new initiative is a creative way to enlarge our pool of
qualified applicants and attract city residents to a career in the
NYPD,'' Kerik said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were the department's clearest acknowledgment to
date of its struggle to find recruits for the 40,000-member force.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 31,000 people applied to take the department's
admission test. In 1999, fewer than half that number applied, and
this year the department has had to extend its application
deadlines to find even several thousand people willing to take the
test. Kerik said on Wednesday that the Oct. 6 deadline would be
extended to Oct. 27 to allow more people to apply. To date,
slightly more than 2,000 people have applied, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police and union officials have cited multiple problems in the
department's effort to attract new members, including the strong
private-sector economy and the relatively low starting pay _
roughly $31,500 _ for rookie officers, as well as the public outcry
surrounding several fatal shootings by the police of unarmed black
men.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have been severe enough to have become evident at
the Police Academy. The next class of recruits, set to begin
instruction on Friday, is roughly 300 short of its 1,589 planned
members, the first time in memory that the department has been
unable to meet its budgeted class size.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who appeared at a news conference with
Mr. Kerik to announce the changes, said the extension of the
education waiver to school safety and traffic agents would not
affect the quality of the applicants because these agents had been
monitored during their years of city employment. Kerik said that by
loosening the eligibility requirements for these employees, the
department gains a pool of 1,300 potential applicants, many of whom
are members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the changes run counter to some of the department's
previous thinking, and certainly to its public posture to date.
Since last year, when the drop in public interest in city police
careers became apparent, the department had steadfastly maintained
that it did not have a hiring problem, and said its stepped-up
recruiting efforts, including two $10 million advertising campaigns
since the spring of 1999, were aimed more at diversifying the ranks
than maintaining the department's size.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Spurred by growing demand for its software,
Adobe Systems unveiled plans Wednesday to expand its San Jose,
Calif., headquarters and hire 1,000 more employees.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, the largest manufacturer of software for online
publishing and graphic design, will add 250 workers each quarter
for the next year to meet the demand for products such as Acrobat
Reader, Photoshop and PageMaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expanding rapidly,'' said Kristin Fabos, a spokeswoman
for Adobe. ``The company is doing incredibly well. We need more
room to accommodate our new employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The hirings will increase Adobe's workforce by 40 percent to
3,500 from 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new jobs, ranging from marketing to engineering to
research and development, will be at the firm's downtown San Jose
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the growth, Adobe plans to add a third tower and
a parking garage to its campus.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the 17-story building, which will feature
hanging walkways to nearby towers, an employee cafe and large
sixth-floor patio, is scheduled to begin in spring 2001 and take
about 18 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to expand its offices in Seattle, San
Diego, India and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has prospered recently with increasing demand for its
software that has been fueled by the expansion of the Internet and
desktop publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has recorded five consecutive quarters of record
revenue, driving its stock up nearly threefold in the past year.
Wednesday, Adobe's stock closed down $2.94 at $148.38.
</P>
<P>
   The company earlier this month said it will split shares 2 for 1
in October. The firm also predicted 25 percent revenue growth for
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe is the world's third-biggest software manufacturer for
personal computers behind Microsoft and Novell. It has annual
revenues of more than $1 billion, the biggest part of which come
from sales of its photo editing software.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe's announcement Wednesday underscores its emergence from a
slump in the late 1990s, when the firm laid off 600 workers to
offset poor sales in Asia and to focus more on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It also fended off an unsolicited bid by Quark, a privately
owned softwaremaker in Denver.

 BLUE CROSS OF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO LURE UNINSURED  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Saying it wants to offer cheaper health care to
the uninsured, Blue Cross of California proposed premium reductions
yesterday for most of its individual policyholders while shifting
some of the costs to deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is subject to state approval, would offer
basic plans for as little as $55 a month. People would have to pay
their own drug bills and the first $5,000 in hospital bills, but
the plan would pay the complete costs of all routine doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers called it a novel effort to keep people insured,
while others termed it inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement highlights the central issue in the health care
debate: how to strike a balance between plans that cover everything
at huge monthly costs, and inexpensive plans that don't cover what
people really need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we're going to get some uninsured people back on
board, and more importantly, we're not going to create any new
uninsured,'' said Mark Weinberg, who runs the Blue Cross division
that oversees the 750,000 policyholders directly affected by the
new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Levitt, an insurance analyst with the independent
Kaiser Family Foundation, said while the idea seems well
intentioned, it probably won't induce the uninsured _ most of whom
earn less than $30,000 a year _ to pay a monthly premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think, `I'm just getting by, and to spend $50 or $100 a
month on insurance, maybe I'm just better off rolling the dice that
I don't get sick,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is directed at the 750,000 people who pay for their
own Blue Cross insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The changes do not affect the rest of Blue Cross' 4.3 million
subscribers, whose insurance is provided through employer-sponsored
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was delivered yesterday to the state Department of
Managed Care, which must approve any changes before they can take
effect on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Managed Care Director Daniel Zingale termed the plan ``a new and
innovative approach'' but said he would reserve judgment until he
has studied how it would affect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Blue Cross, the plan would consolidate several
dozen current individual health policies into seven new programs.
Overall, two-thirds of its policyholders would get average premium
reductions of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining third, however, would see premium increases of 9
percent for plans with comparable benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there will be a net reduction in premiums overall,''
Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea was to offer a range of options, beginning with
bare-bones plans that would allow a 40-year-old single mother with
two kids to have a $51 per month health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Such basic plans would come with restrictions. Prescription
drugs would not be covered. The plan would impose a $1,000-a-year
deductible on specialist care and hospitalization, up to a
$2,000-per-family maximum.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even the cheapest plan would pay 100 percent,
without being subject to the deductible, if the mother in this
example needed to take herself or the kids to any of the 48,000
doctors who have agreed to accept Blue Cross patients, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   To add prescription drugs to the coverage for the same family
would add about $30 a month to the premium cost.
</P>
<P>
   The deductibles kick in when people require hospitalization or
advanced diagnostic tests, like MRI scans, Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, policyholders would also pay as much as 25
percent of the first $5,000 in bills.
</P>
<P>
   Once the person has paid $5,000, the plan would step in and pay
100 percent of health bills, to a $5 million maximum, Weinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, with the nonprofit health insurance watchdog group
Consumers for Quality Care, said he is ``cautious'' about the Blue
Cross proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil in these policies is always in the details,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Court predicted that the one-third of Blue Cross policyholders
who would see increases under the proposal would object to being
forced to give up their current plan _ which may contain better
benefits without the new deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's taking away people's choices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Weinberg said Blue Cross is trying to adjust the overall mix
of policies to keep the average monthly cost per individual below
$100. ``That's the magic number,'' he said. ``Above that, you see
people start to drop off.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that under the current mix of plans, the average Blue
Cross individual policyholder pays $110 per month.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other California insurer says it is offering cheap,
individual policies. HealthNet spokesman Brad Kieffer said his firm
recently introduced five plans that are competitive with Blue
Cross' and may not carry deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   A spot check of independent insurance agents who represent Blue
Cross and other insurers elicited mixed reviews on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   An agent in San Francisco, who asked not to be named, said the
budget plans would appeal to the working families among her
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Bauer, an agent in Belmont, said the proposal is more
hype than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Cross does a terrific job on advertising and promotions,
but you and I don't get the benefit,'' he said.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: OLD COMPUTERS CAN BE DONATED  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The san Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have upgraded my PC a couple of times and would like to donate
usable old parts to a good cause. What can you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Unfortunately, there isn't much call for components such as
small hard-disk drives and slow processors, which are the items
most often replaced during an upgrade. You would have a better
chance finding a home for a complete used PC.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, it would have to be Windows 95-capable for it to
be really useful to a school or nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   Most metropolitan areas have a handful of organizations that
``recycle'' old PCs by sprucing them up and giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   You might try offering your old parts to one of those groups.
</P>
<P>
   And you can always donate them to Goodwill or the Salvation
Army, both of which renovate old computers and put them back into
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Lose the Lists
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm having no luck getting rid of the drop-down lists in a
couple of search engines that I use regularly. I went to the
options in Internet Explorer and cleared the History. That emptied
the drop-down list in the IE Address bar. But it didn't affect the
search engines. I still see a list of recent searches every time I
place my mouse pointer in the search box and hit the down arrow. Is
there any way to get rid of these lists?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Sure. Search engines use Internet Explorer's AutoComplete
feature to provide drop-down lists of searches you've previously
made. Specifically, they use the Forms aspect of AutoComplete.
That's the same technology that makes it easier to fill in online
forms by prompting you with names, addresses and other information
you've used in the past.
</P>
<P>
   To empty a drop-down list in a search engine, go to Internet
Options in the IE tools menu. Tab over to Content, click
AutoComplete and then choose Clear Forms. That should do the job.
If you never want to see a drop-down list in a search engine again,
remove the checkmark from the Forms Box.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind, though, that deleting the Forms history or
disabling the AutoComplete Forms function will affect all online
forms, not just the search engines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
More File Storage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I am trying to copy a 2.5-megabyte file to a floppy disk, but I
get a message that the file is too large. How much can you fit on a
floppy, anyway, and is there another way to save big files outside
of the computer?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The capacity of a floppy is 1.44 MBs. Depending on what's in
your 2.5 MB file, you might be able to compress it with a Zip
program enough to fit it onto a floppy. (If you don't already have
a zipping software, you might try WinZip, a $29 program that you
can download from www.hotfiles.com or www.shareware.com.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have a lot of large files that you want to store, you
might consider getting an Iomega Zip drive. The newest models let
you store as much as 250 MBs on a single cartridge. Expect to pay
around $170 for the drive and about $20 per cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   You can also store files online through Web sites such as
www.driveway.com and www.idrive.com. I-Drive lets you store 50 megs
of PC files online for free.
</P>
<P>
   HACKER UPDATE: After I suggested that hacking PCs through a DSL
is rare, I got a flood of mail from folks who have installed
security software and claim that it shows a continual barrage by
outside computers looking for ways to access their systems. One guy
said he runs three different firewall programs ``and you would not
believe the high number of intrusion detection alarms I get all day
long from all three.'' Another person wanted to know if someone he
suspects of trying to tap his phone line could find a way to
monitor his online activity.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, nobody offered evidence of an actual hack attack
in which information in the PC was stolen or the system damaged. If
anyone has any stories of actual attacks, please send them along.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if you want to keep your guard up, you can try
the personal firewall software from Norton or McAfee that I
mentioned last week (Norton Personal Firewall from Symantec Corp.
for about $50 and McAfee Personal Firewall, $30). Two other
programs that readers rave about are Black Ice Defender ($39.95
from www.networkice.com) and ZoneAlarm ($19.95 from
www.zonelabs.com). Safe surfing, you all.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: Want to access a Web site without using your
mouse? In Internet Explorer, hold down the Alt key and press D.
Your cursor will jump right into the Address bar, where you can
enter a Web site's address. In America Online, press Ctrl + K, then
type the address into the Keyword box. In both cases, hit Enter to
go to the site.

 SONY CAN'T DELIVER NUMBER OF PLAYSTATIONS IT PROMISED  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Only half as many PlayStation 2 video-game
consoles as expected will be available in North America for the
Oct. 26 launch date, Sony Corp. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage will make PlayStation 2 this holiday season's
most-hyped toy, predicted Joe Funk, editor in chief of Electronic
Gamers Monthly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see them selling for $500 on EBay,'' Funk
said. PlayStation 2 is to retail for $299.
</P>
<P>
   Sony will provide only 500,000 units to retail stores Oct. 26,
instead of the 1 million originally promised, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Unspecified component shortages have put production one month
behind schedule, the company said. Senior Vice President Andrew
House would say only that the missing components were not for the
console's DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   Sony plans to increase its production and release an additional
100,000 units every week after the launch, with a goal of shipping
1.3 million PlayStation 2s to North American stores by year end.
The company's previous target of shipping 3 million consoles for
the U.S. market by the March 2001 end of its fiscal year will not
be affected, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation 2 was already expected to be in short supply this
holiday season. Retailers nationwide maintain customer waiting
lists for the game machine, and most stopped taking orders during
the summer, said Funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more highly anticipated than any video game system
that's ever launched,'' Funk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone who wants one will get one,'' said Sony
Senior Vice President Jack Tretton. ``The situation will improve
after the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   The supply reduction will be meted out evenly throughout U.S.
stores, Tretton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also said that 25 or 26 game titles will be available for
the Oct. 26 launch, and 24 additional games will be released by the
holidays. Originally, Sony expected only 15 games to be released by
the launch.
</P>
<P>
   Funk said that having 50 games within a few months of launch is
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that it will only make the people who didn't make
the list (to buy the console) even more bummed out,'' Funk said.

 REVIEW: NOMAD JUKEBOX QUICKLY CLEARS MP3 CLUTTER  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you've been wondering what to do with all
those MP3 music files filling up your hard disk, Creative
Technology's new Nomad Jukebox is designed for you. Holding more
than 100 hours of music on a 6-gigabyte hard drive, this portable
player lets you take an entire music collection on the road, albeit
at a stiff price ($499 list, $450 street).
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Jukebox looks just like a CD player. Indeed, at
first I thought it played CDs, too, since several new combo MP3/CD
players have hit the streets recently. But the Nomad is an MP3-only
player.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, it's heavier than a CD player of the same size
(about 1 pound). It's portable, as on an airplane or in a car, but
not ``joggable.'' The rechargeable batteries (two sets are
included) last about three to four hours during playback, less when
connected to a PC. I recommend using the included AC adapter when
transferring files from your PC to the Jukebox. It's available in
your choice of metallic blue or silver.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that sets the Jukebox apart: It is one of the few MP3
players that supports both Windows and Mac platforms out of the
box. Creative bundles Casady &AMP; Greene's top-ranked SoundJam MP3
player for the Mac and its own Creative PlayCenter software for the
PC. Both packages do a fine job of organizing your MP3 collection,
creating playlists, and ``ripping'' audio CDs and converting CD
tracks into MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic sources of music for the Nomad: MP3 files
that you download from the Internet (from sites like MP3.com or by
using Napster), and those that you create yourself using an MP3
encoder. A large collection of music, both pop and classical, also
comes ready-to-go on the Nomad.
</P>
<P>
   Ripping favorite audio CDs will be the first task for most users
to fill up all that disk space. The usual route is to convert and
save CDs onto your PC or Mac, then transfer the resulting MP3 files
to the Jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   On the PC, you can also rip directly from CD to Jukebox,
bypassing your PC hard disk. The process is simple. Popping in a CD
on either platform brings up a list of tracks with the artist and
album names, thanks to an Internet CD database. You then decide
which tracks you want to convert and press a button.
</P>
<P>
   Using the default 128-Kbps settings with either SoundJam or
PlayCenter creates fine-sounding MP3 files, although you raise or
lower the quality level, depending on your preferences. For
portable audio, and using the supplied headphones, which aren't
very good, you don't need absolute CD quality.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to plug the Jukebox into your stereo system,
however, you might want to increase the quality level. High-quality
files (such as 192-Kbps) take more space though, so you won't be
able to fit as many albums.
</P>
<P>
   On my Mac PowerBook with DVD-ROM drive, CDs ripped at about four
times real time. That is, a one-hour CD was converted to
high-quality, variable bit-rate MP3 files in about 15 minutes. On
my desktop PC with CD-ROM drive, things were slightly faster.
Encoding time varies depending on drive and processor speeds, as
well as quality level. Older drives may not be able to encode
faster than real time.
</P>
<P>
   Once converted or downloaded, you transfer MP3 tracks to the
player by plugging it in to your computer's USB port and then
dragging files from one window to another. This is a deceptively
simple process. I found that if SoundJam on the Mac was playing an
MP3 at the same time as I was copying tracks onto the player (which
it seems to do by default), the system would hang in short order.
</P>
<P>
   x On the PC, transferring hundreds of files at once (my entire
MP3 collection) also caused me to have to reboot both system and
player. The problem was fixed on the Mac by turning off the player
and on the PC by copying fewer files at a time. It took just a few
minutes to transfer a couple hours' worth of music.
</P>
<P>
   uncx In the future, the Jukebox will play back other types of
music files, such as Windows Media Audio, through firmware upgrades
downloadable from the www.nomadworld.com site, but for now, only
MP3 is supported.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Nomad also lets you record hours of audio files
with a microphone input. Unfortunately, since there is no way to
save your place within an audio file or fast forward/rewind, the
audio feature is not very useful. But again, Creative hopes to
address these problems in upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jukebox all loaded up, it was time to start playing
things back. You can do this in two ways, via a small LCD screen
and control buttons on Jukebox, or via the PC/Mac software.
</P>
<P>
   Using the software was basically the same as playing back MP3s
on your computer: You create a playlist by dragging files, and then
press play. Very easy. With a big screen, navigating through the
hundreds or thousands of songs on the Jukebox is not a problem. You
can also save playlists for download to the Jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   Using the LCD screen for creating playlists is more difficult,
but adequate to the task. It has room for about seven lines of
data, pretty compact. Pressing the Library button brings up a
choice of album, artist, genre or playlist. You then click your way
to the tracks you want, adding them to your playback queue.
</P>
<P>
   Albums are stored in folders, so you can add a full album to the
queue by selecting the folder. Or you can choose to have things
played back randomly.
</P>
<P>
   As I mentioned before, the headphones are sadly lacking. They
are cheesy behind-the-head models that don't even adjust. I
immediately plugged in my own headphones, and also tried the line
outputs that plug into your stereo. It even supports quad-sound,
with dual outs, and has special effects like auditorium, playback
speedup and slowdown (useful for audio books), and parametric
equalization.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to note is that you can't use the Nomad to transfer
MP3s from one PC to another, even your own machines. This is
because of an agreement with the music industry, but also makes it
impossible to back up the Nomad directly. If you are concerned
about losing the data in your Jukebox (it is a hard drive, after
all, and hard drives crash), you'll need to be careful to keep all
your songs on your PC as well, or perhaps store them on writable
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going so far as to back up your MP3 collection on
CD-R/RW, you might consider getting a new combo CD/MP3 player, like
the aforementioned Philips model, that can play both regular CDs
and writable CDs with MP3s on them. A single CD-R disc can hold
about 150 MP3 songs, and the players sell for one-third the price
of the Nomad. They're also joggable.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting alternative to the Nomad is DigMedia's new
MusicStore. This jukebox is the same price as the Nomad, but
includes a CD player as well as a 5.4-GB hard disk and does not
require a PC to convert CDs to MP3s. It also has optional handheld
MP3 players that hook up to it, each holding one to three hours of
music.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what types of players will take hold with the
market. The only certainties are that the MP3 market is growing
rapidly and that manufacturers will continue to come up with new
combos of storage, portability and playback capabilities. Cahner's
In-Stat Group predicts sales of players rising from $126 million in
1999 to $1.25 billion in 2002, a tenfold increase. The number of
manufacturers is also multiplying, from five last year to 50 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the best way to carry around large amounts of MP3
music is the Nomad Jukebox. Aside from the audio-book deficiencies,
which should be addressed soon, my major complaint is that it takes
too long to start up, about 30 seconds. That can seem like an eon
when you're in the car dodging traffic. (It's easy to add adapters
that plug into your tape deck and cigarette lighter.) It's
expensive, but way cheaper than the same amount of storage in a
flash-card MP3 player, which typically sells for about $200 and
holds just an hour of music. The Nomad Jukebox has my vote!

ARBITRATORS REJECT APPEAL BY ROMANIAN GYMNAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout; subs byline)   By RICHARD SANDORMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The Court of Arbitration for Sport on
Thursday denied the Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan's appeal to
regain the gold medal stripped from her by the International
Olympic Committee because she tested positive for a banned
substance.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member court ruled that it did not matter that the
drug pseudoephedrine was taken in the form of cold medicine or that
it did not enhance her performance at the individual all-around
event. What mattered, the panel decided, was that she committed a
doping offense in violation of the Olympic antidoping code.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strict liability test must thus be applied,'' the court said
in a statement, ``the consequence being automatic disqualification
as a matter of law and in fairness to all other athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the panel said factors such as her age, her
weight and her need for the medication were irrelevant. The panel
held that the ``presence of a prohibited substance in a
competitor's bodily fluid'' is the threshold issue, ``irrespective
of whether or not the competitor intended to ingest the prohibited
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC recognized that Raducan, who turns 17 on Saturday, did
not intentionally violate the code, but refused to make an
individual exception to the antidoping code for her. Jacques Rogge,
vice chairman of the IOC's medical commission, said that revoking
her gold medal ``was one of the worst experiences I have had in my
Olympic life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to strip the gold medal from the individual for
something she didn't intentionally do was very tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan, a 4-foot-10, 82-pound gymnast, performs with a
pixie-ish, crowd-pleasing style reminiscent of her legendary
Romanian predecessor, Nadia Comaneci. Raducan was the first
Romanian to win the gold in the all-around since Comaneci did it in
1976. Although Raducan was stripped of the all-around gold, she was
allowed to keep the gold she won as part of the team competition
and the silver medal she won in the vault.
</P>
<P>
   The court added that it is ``aware of the impact of its decision
on a fine, young, elite athlete. It finds, in balancing the
interests of Miss Raducan with the commitment of the Olympic
movement to drug-free sport, the anti-doping code must be enforced
without compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ioachin Oana, the Romanian team doctor who administered the
medication to Raducan, has been expelled from the Sydney Summer
Games, the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games and the 2004 Summer
Games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when the appeal was filed, there were reports that
Raducan's teammates, who were elevated to gold and silver medals,
would return them in protest. But Romanian national team officials
said on Thursday that they would not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Several IOC members sounded sympathetic toward Raducan, even
though they were the ones defending the decision to strip the
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is with the athlete but it's a decision that stood
the test of arbitration, and everybody must live with that,'' Kevan
Gosper of Australia, an IOC executive board member, said after the
ruling. ``It's a decision that was put to the test. It's a
nonambiguous one, and it demonstrates we're serious about doping,
if anyone had any doubts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the circumstances, Raducan tested positive for a banned
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived the most humiliating moment of my life when I had to
turn in Andreea's medal,'' Octavian Belu, the coach of the Romanian
team, said on Wednesday. ``If they decide to give it back, I would
walk all the way to the Olympic village to bring the medal back to
its rightful owner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Arbitration for Sport is an independent,
international body created to resolve disputes over discipline and
contracts. Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, it establishes a branch
in the Olympic city during the Games.

<P>
   Voters may be prepared to tune out the stump speeches of George
W. Bush, the position papers of Al Gore, and the endless ads of
both parties. But investors ought to pay close attention. The
financial markets certainly are.
</P>
<P>
   The promises made to voters, the stands on issues such as
national defense and insurance payments for prescription drugs, and
the proposals and counterproposals on how to spend the current
budget surplus all have the potential to move stock and bond
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the first votes are cast in November, the financial
markets will have picked electoral winners and losers in the drug,
defense, telecommunications, and technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in interest rates _ and in the overall stock market
indexes _ will deliver the financial market's own vote of
confidence on the fiscal policies of the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have had months to get into the habit of paying
attention to presidential-election-year politics. Anyone trying to
answer the big question of 2000 _ when will the Federal Reserve
stop raising interest rates? _ has had to take the November
election into account.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus prediction that the Federal Reserve would put its
inflation-fighting campaign on hold after its June or, at worst,
its August meeting rested in large part on the belief that the
bankers wouldn't want to be seen as meddling in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to dial in on the specific declarations that Gore
and Bush make as they curry favor with key blocs of swing votes. If
the race is close enough to force an escalation in promises, the
election could well move sectors of the stock market in which the
Democratic administration has staked out strong positions _
positions that Bush might alter.
</P>
<P>
   Consider pharmaceuticals. Stocks like Pfizer and Merck were real
laggards in 1999 _ down 18 percent and 8 percent respectively _ in
part because investors feared Clinton wanted to impose drug price
controls as part of a plan to have government insurance cover the
costs of prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sector has rallied a bit this year, it continues to
go into a shocked retreat whenever someone whispers, ``Price
controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach to paying for prescription drugs advocated by the
Republican majority in the House of Representatives, and by many
Senate Republicans too, would sidestep governmental price controls
by encouraging private insurance plans to offer drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers give the Republican scheme much chance of working
_ there's good evidence that private insurers won't embrace it. But
anyone who has watched the legislative process in an election year
knows that Congressional Republicans _ just as Democrats have done
in other years and on other issues this year _ are really just
trying to cover themselves among senior voters.
</P>
<P>
   From this point of view the key question is: Is the strategy
good enough to help Bush win such key senior-dominated states as
Florida and North Carolina, and for members of Congress to win
re-election? Or will the Republicans have to raise the ante by
offering voters something more ambitious?
</P>
<P>
   A political bidding war that keeps the possibility of price
controls alive won't be good news for drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hope to return the favor on defense. Republicans
accuse Democrats of being soft on defense almost out of sheer
reflex. Some years it works _ remember how silly Michael Dukakis
looked in a tank? Some years it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Republicans hope they can force a Clinton veto of
the Star Wars antimissile shield and then use that to paint Gore as
spineless. A decision to move ahead on the system _ unproven as it
may be _ or a Gore proposal to increase defense spending in other
areas to show he's a true patriot would be good for defense stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Clues to the likelihood of a political bidding war can often be
found at the grass-roots level. The high cost of prescription drugs
plays well nationally and is a major hot button in a few key
states. That combination makes it almost certain that the topic
will get plenty of attention from the candidates and their
surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the mathematics of the electoral college has made
defense policy less significant. It would probably be a bigger
issue if Bush didn't already have Texas _ a major
defense-contractor state _ in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the race in California is becoming tighter, expect to
see Bush or Gore touting his belief in a strong national defense by
making an appearance at a weapons plant outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This same lack of a natural electoral constituency also makes it
unlikely that antitrust policy in the telecommunications and
technology industries will make it to the front burner.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Department of Justice has been more activist in this
area _ blocking the merger of WorldCom and Sprint, for example, and
seeking the breakup of Microsoft _ than a Bush administration
Department of Justice would likely be.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to see how either side could turn this issue into
a political lever on a national scale. Stocks like Microsoft and
Sprint might get a bounce from a Bush victory, but they won't
benefit much from what's said during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Bush and the Republicans have wagered that
some form of huge tax cut is a winning issue for them. They've
talked about ending the estate tax, eliminating the marriage
penalty, and cutting the general income tax rate. Behind each of
these proposals, of course, lies the assumption that voters won't
be able to resist a chance to put dollars in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Democrats have resisted being drawn in. In lieu of
one-upmanship, Democratic leaders in Congress and candidate Gore
have offered a smaller bonanza while stressing the need for fiscal
responsibility, paying down the debt, and preserving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn has forced Republicans to defend their own fiscal
credentials and even to take billions in cuts off the table some
weeks (before adding them back the next).
</P>
<P>
   You can bet Democrats will change their tune, though, if
pollsters at Gore headquarters detect that Americans want a tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   And that would make Alan Greenspan and the rest of the Federal
Reserve even more nervous than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches and testimony, the central bankers have
stressed the need to preserve the surplus. Increased government
spending and/or a tax cut would stimulate the economy just as the
Fed's leadership is waiting to see whether the interest rate
increases it has made to date have succeeded in slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   The mere concept of a nervous Federal Reserve could be enough to
send the bond and stock markets scrambling for cover. Again. &QL;

RIGHT TIME FOR WATER POLO TEAM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Tony Azevedo figures the folks back home are
worried. They shouldn't be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will look at this and say, `They've lost three
times and won only twice and they're out,' '' Azevedo said, ``But,
really, the tournament is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   And at just the right moment, it would seem, for Azevedo and the
U.S.men's water polo team.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo, the 18-year-old polo prodigy out of Long Beach Wilson
High School, scored three goals as the Americans routed Greece 9-3
on Wednesday and secured a berth in the quarterfinals of the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our next game is Russia, and that's a big one, because if we
win we're in medal contention,'' Azevedo said.
</P>
<P>
   His three goals Wednesday before a full house at Ryde Aquatic
Center gives him nine goals in the tournament, tying him for the
team lead withveterans Chris Humbert and Wolf Wigo.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo said he and the U.S. team have made significant strides
sinceopening Olympic competition with a 10-7 loss to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think the first game I played really timid,'' he
said. ``It's the first game in the Olympics, something I've dreamed
about mywhole life, and I was timid. I played timid. I was out
there, and I wasnervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every game I've gotten better, every game I've calmed
myself down, and today I felt fine. There was no nervousness in me.
Our team is doing the same thing; we're progressing. We were timid
the first game, and with every game we're getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. won two of its last three group games, and lost by one
goal to world No.1-ranked Hungary in the other. The Yanks finished
fourth in Group B, and meet Group A champion Russia on Friday. From
here on out, one loss means elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo is not alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   `` I feel confident against Russia, and so does the team,'' he
said. ``The last time we played them was the FINA Cup, and we
needed to win itby three, and we won by three.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that pool play is complete, the Americans wonder whether
Group B was overloaded with good teams. The U.S. losses were to
Croatia, Yugoslavia and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three and us definitely could be the top four teams in
the tournament,'' Azevedo said. ``We've beaten (Group A qualifiers)
Russia, we've beaten Italy, we've beaten Spain, we beat
Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran two-meter man Kyle Kopp, former Long Beach State
standout, said Azevedo is comfortable with his first Olympic
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's handled it well,'' Kopp said. ``We carpool together, and
I've had a lot of time the last year-and-a-half to talk to him and
to preparehim for this -- the ups and downs of the tournament, the
chaos and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been around the pool deck since he was 2 and 3 years old,
so he's been around it, he's seen it, and I think he's handling it
extremelywell.''
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo's confidence is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good about how I'm playing,'' he said. ``We're 0-0
in this tournament now, and we're ready to go get a medal.''

<P>
   Voters may be prepared to tune out the stump speeches of George
W. Bush, the position papers of Al Gore, and the endless ads of
both parties. But investors ought to pay close attention. The
financial markets certainly are.
</P>
<P>
   The promises made to voters, the stands on issues such as
national defense and insurance payments for prescription drugs, and
the proposals and counterproposals on how to spend the current
budget surplus all have the potential to move stock and bond
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the first votes are cast in November, the financial
markets will have picked electoral winners and losers in the drug,
defense, telecommunications, and technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in interest rates _ and in the overall stock market
indexes _ will deliver the financial market's own vote of
confidence on the fiscal policies of the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have had months to get into the habit of paying
attention to presidential-election-year politics. Anyone trying to
answer the big question of 2000 _ when will the Federal Reserve
stop raising interest rates? _ has had to take the November
election into account.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus prediction that the Federal Reserve would put its
inflation-fighting campaign on hold after its June or, at worst,
its August meeting rested in large part on the belief that the
bankers wouldn't want to be seen as meddling in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to dial in on the specific declarations that Gore
and Bush make as they curry favor with key blocs of swing votes. If
the race is close enough to force an escalation in promises, the
election could well move sectors of the stock market in which the
Democratic administration has staked out strong positions _
positions that Bush might alter.
</P>
<P>
   Consider pharmaceuticals. Stocks like Pfizer and Merck were real
laggards in 1999 _ down 18 percent and 8 percent respectively _ in
part because investors feared Clinton wanted to impose drug price
controls as part of a plan to have government insurance cover the
costs of prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sector has rallied a bit this year, it continues to
go into a shocked retreat whenever someone whispers, ``Price
controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach to paying for prescription drugs advocated by the
Republican majority in the House of Representatives, and by many
Senate Republicans too, would sidestep governmental price controls
by encouraging private insurance plans to offer drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers give the Republican scheme much chance of working
_ there's good evidence that private insurers won't embrace it. But
anyone who has watched the legislative process in an election year
knows that Congressional Republicans _ just as Democrats have done
in other years and on other issues this year _ are really just
trying to cover themselves among senior voters.
</P>
<P>
   From this point of view the key question is: Is the strategy
good enough to help Bush win such key senior-dominated states as
Florida and North Carolina, and for members of Congress to win
re-election? Or will the Republicans have to raise the ante by
offering voters something more ambitious?
</P>
<P>
   A political bidding war that keeps the possibility of price
controls alive won't be good news for drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hope to return the favor on defense. Republicans
accuse Democrats of being soft on defense almost out of sheer
reflex. Some years it works _ remember how silly Michael Dukakis
looked in a tank? Some years it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Republicans hope they can force a Clinton veto of
the Star Wars antimissile shield and then use that to paint Gore as
spineless. A decision to move ahead on the system _ unproven as it
may be _ or a Gore proposal to increase defense spending in other
areas to show he's a true patriot would be good for defense stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Clues to the likelihood of a political bidding war can often be
found at the grass-roots level. The high cost of prescription drugs
plays well nationally and is a major hot button in a few key
states. That combination makes it almost certain that the topic
will get plenty of attention from the candidates and their
surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the mathematics of the electoral college has made
defense policy less significant. It would probably be a bigger
issue if Bush didn't already have Texas _ a major
defense-contractor state _ in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the race in California is becoming tighter, expect to
see Bush or Gore touting his belief in a strong national defense by
making an appearance at a weapons plant outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This same lack of a natural electoral constituency also makes it
unlikely that antitrust policy in the telecommunications and
technology industries will make it to the front burner.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Department of Justice has been more activist in this
area _ blocking the merger of WorldCom and Sprint, for example, and
seeking the breakup of Microsoft _ than a Bush administration
Department of Justice would likely be.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to see how either side could turn this issue into
a political lever on a national scale. Stocks like Microsoft and
Sprint might get a bounce from a Bush victory, but they won't
benefit much from what's said during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Bush and the Republicans have wagered that
some form of huge tax cut is a winning issue for them. They've
talked about ending the estate tax, eliminating the marriage
penalty, and cutting the general income tax rate. Behind each of
these proposals, of course, lies the assumption that voters won't
be able to resist a chance to put dollars in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Democrats have resisted being drawn in. In lieu of
one-upmanship, Democratic leaders in Congress and candidate Gore
have offered a smaller bonanza while stressing the need for fiscal
responsibility, paying down the debt, and preserving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn has forced Republicans to defend their own fiscal
credentials and even to take billions in cuts off the table some
weeks (before adding them back the next).
</P>
<P>
   You can bet Democrats will change their tune, though, if
pollsters at Gore headquarters detect that Americans want a tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   And that would make Alan Greenspan and the rest of the Federal
Reserve even more nervous than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches and testimony, the central bankers have
stressed the need to preserve the surplus. Increased government
spending and/or a tax cut would stimulate the economy just as the
Fed's leadership is waiting to see whether the interest rate
increases it has made to date have succeeded in slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   The mere concept of a nervous Federal Reserve could be enough to
send the bond and stock markets scrambling for cover. Again. &QL;

DODGERS HOPES FOR POSTSEASON END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twenty-five minutes before the Los Angeles Dodgers
took the field to be soundly beaten by San Francisco 4-0 Wednesday,
they had a chance to sit in the clubhouse and watch the Mets beat
Atlanta to end offcially the Dodgers' playoff fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers then played as if they had just had the last breath
stomped out of them _ you know, as they've played most of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we play for second place,'' Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw said.
``It'sofficial. We're out of the playoffs, but we still have
something to play for. Whether it be pride, second place, first
place, whatever, you always have something to play for.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Wednesday was a wonderful little parallel for the
season, especially since Luke Prokopec, in the No. 4 spot in the
rotation, took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers' top three starters have all had strong
seasons, anyone they've tried in the fourth and fifth spots has
experienced all sorts of difficulty. Entering Wednesday's game, the
fourth and fifth starters were a combined 10-25 with a 6.38 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Though Prokopec was solid in two other starts, he allowed four
runs in five innings against the Giants to further pad the brutal
numbers of the back end of the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   That glaring gap, which was insufficiently filled by Carlos
Perez, OrelHershiser, Mike Judd, Eric Gagne, Matt Herges, Ismael
Valdes and Prokopec, is the overwhelming reason the Dodgers'
postseason drought has hit four seasons. It also bears reminding
the Dodgers last won a postseason game in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough year,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``We
had some bad moments and some good moments. The Mets played better
than us. When you don't make it (to the playoffs), you don't feel
good about it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Cuba ran into Tommy Lasorda on Wednesday,
and it was a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest ham on the world's biggest sports stage?
C'mon, no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy lives for the limelight. Basks in it. Shines in it. The
bigger the moment, the better he is. He was no more going to lose
to Cuba than take a job managing the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's patchwork Yanks defeated mighty Cuba 4-0 Wednesday night
to win the gold medal in the Sydney Olympics, the first Olympic
baseball gold for the nation that invented the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed the Dodgers 20 years, but this is the greatest
moment of my life!'' Tommy bellowed. ``This is bigger than the
World Series because tonight everybody in the United States of
America is happy!''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it was an upset victory, but did you honestly expect
any &QL;
</P>
<P>
   thing less with Tommy in the dugout mugging for the camera and
crying during the national anthem?
</P>
<P>
   You and I know Tommy is mostly full of beans. You hear one
``Great Dodger in the Sky,'' speech, you've heard them all. After a
dozen renditions of ``bleeding Dodger Blue,'' your eyes glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying Tommy has charisma, and USA Baseball's
choice of him as Olympic manager was inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy can motivate. No one denies that. Perhaps not over a
period of years, but put Tommy with the San Bernardino Stampede for
a month and they'll think they can beat the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And the guys he had here were essentially the Stampede.
Minor-leaguers all, Triple-A and Double-A players not good enough
or seasoned enough for September callups to the big club.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Doug Mientkiewicz, Adam Everett and Brad Wilker &QL;
</P>
<P>
   son. Ernie Young, Mike Neill and Mike Kinkade. John Cotton,
Brent Abernathy and Pat Borders.
</P>
<P>
   And those were Tommy's starters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they were enough to bring down Cuba, which has a player or
two wash up in Florida every month and go directly to the big
leagues. A Cubanteam that has dominated international baseball for
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   What Tommy did in a month with this American team was create the
Olympic version of the 1988 Dodgers. A modestly talented team with
spirit, cohe &QL;
</P>
<P>
   sion, an inspirational right fielder (Kirk Gibson, meet Ernie
Young) and a hot right-hander (Orel Hershiser, say hello to Ben
Sheets).
</P>
<P>
   It was a team that didn't scare anyone, and didn't overpower
much of anyone. But Tommy kept telling them how good they were, how
they were anelite, hand-picked bunch and, by gol &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ly, they bought that whopper.
</P>
<P>
   These 26 journeymen Joes, mostly career minor-leaguers, came to
believe they were something special. And, like Mickey Hatcher and
Franklin Stubbs 12 years ago, believing made it so.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were something special Wednesday night. They
fielded flawlessly. Neill banged a first-inning homer to give them
a lead. Young bounced a bases- loaded single up the middle to make
it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   And Sheets mowed down the Cubans who have terrorized U.S. teams
for more than a decade. Omar Linares, Orestes Kindelan, Antonio
Pacheco &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys could play in the major leagues right now!'' Tom &QL;
</P>
<P>
   my informed us. As could, he said, all three guys who pitched
against his team Wednesday. ``The first guy threw 93 (miles per
hour), the second guy threw 97 and the third threw 100!''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy credited the players with their success, but in his
egocentric little heart he believed he had a lot to do with it. And
he did.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great moment. Really, it was. Neill makes a sliding
catch inleft field to end the game, and Tommy bounces out of the
dugout like Gibson's homer has just reached the right-field
pavilion. (His vertical leap has declined in the 12 years since
1988, but Tommy is 73, as chubby as ever, and we'll cut him a
break.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a great moment because a warhorse put out to pasture
after a heart attack was given one more moment in the sun, a moment
he desperately wanted, and he seized it.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded us why he is a Hall of Fame manager. He wrung a
great Olympic moment out of modestly talented guys. He con &QL;
</P>
<P>
   vinced them they could win, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba never stood a chance.

   Perhaps something good has come out of the recent fuel crisis
after all. The protests over high oil prices during the past two
weeks are now forcing many European governments to rethink their
taxes on fuel. In America too, the threat of a winter heating-oil
crisis has led to a noisy debate over energy policy. In principle,
this is good news. These countries' confused energy-taxation
regimes need some serious scrutiny. But that, of course, is not
what is happening. &QL;

   Nowhere in Latin America has democracy been more openly flouted

dubious term after a decade in power, and then staging a deeply

country and antagonizing the outside world, notably the United
States. So Fujimori's sudden call for fresh elections, this time
ruling himself out as a candidate, is welcome. It offers Peru the
chance to make the fresh democratic start it needs. Alas, there are
plenty of dangers and uncertainties ahead. &QL;

month in New York at a reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Mere coincidence, said Karroubi. Few believed him. All this
posturing and gesturing reveals that both sides in Iran, reformist
and conservative, would like to see an end to the 21-year rift in
relations. For the first time, the conservative establishment has
admitted what it once acknowledged only in private: that Iran can

the health-giving properties of their products, but it has been
suspected for some time that cigarettes, for all their harmful
effects, serve to protect people against Parkinson's disease. And
Parkinson's is not the only illness that tobacco seems to help.
Research studies suggest that nicotine administered by injection or
by a skin patch can alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia,
Alzheimer's disease and Tourette's syndrome, as well. &QL;

   Perhaps something good has come out of the recent fuel crisis
after all. The protests over high oil prices during the past two
weeks are now forcing many European governments to rethink their
taxes on fuel. In America too, the threat of a winter heating-oil
crisis has led to a noisy debate over energy policy. In principle,
this is good news. These countries' confused energy-taxation
regimes need some serious scrutiny. But that, of course, is not
what is happening. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in Latin America has democracy been more openly flouted
this year than in Peru. By standing for a third, constitutionally
dubious term after a decade in power, and then staging a deeply
flawed election, Alberto Fujimori succeeded only in dividing his
country and antagonizing the outside world, notably the United
States. So Fujimori's sudden call for fresh elections, this time
ruling himself out as a candidate, is welcome. It offers Peru the
chance to make the fresh democratic start it needs. Alas, there are
plenty of dangers and uncertainties ahead. &QL;

Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation. But can the
mocking go too far? And can it become so one-sided that it
prejudices an election? &QL;

   HORSE CAVE AND PARK CITY, KY. _ More than 100 years ago, the
small town of Horse Cave became the second city in Kentucky to be
wired for electricity. It did this by harnessing the swooshing
waters of the Hidden River, an underground stream that briefly
opens to the sky in the center of town. After this great feat,
Hidden River cave remained unused for most of the 20th century _
except as a particularly nauseating open sewer. Now, once again, it
is the center of town. Caves are once again becoming big business
in central Kentucky. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ In recent weeks, high-ranking Iranian and American
dignitaries have begun to meet in intriguing ways. A number of
Iranian MPs, including Mehdi Karroubi, the speaker of the
parliament, ran into several American congressmen earlier this
month in New York at a reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Mere coincidence, said Karroubi. Few believed him. All this
posturing and gesturing reveals that both sides in Iran, reformist
and conservative, would like to see an end to the 21-year rift in
relations. For the first time, the conservative establishment has
admitted what it once acknowledged only in private: that Iran can
no longer afford to snub the Great Satan. &QL;

   DONGO, THE CONGO _ His name was Kabwanga Makengo. Born
Lubumbashi, June 3, 1980. Private, 2nd Brigade of the army of the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Catholic. Unmarried. The photograph
shows a baby face startled by the camera. Makengo's muddied _ or
bloodied _ identity card lay in the trench where he is buried, next
to a smashed anti-aircraft gun. When the rebels of the Movement for
the Liberation of Congo (MLC) took this tiny trading post on the
Ubangi River on Sept. 7, they put the 34 dead government soldiers
in the trenches and covered them over. Suddenly, this war has
turned serious. &QL;

   DETROIT _ Depending on how you look at them, SUVs are either
menace or salvation. Despite their propensity to roll over more
frequently than other vehicles, a passenger is more likely to
survive a crash in an SUV than in a smaller sedan. That has led
millions of Americans to trade their cars in for off-roaders in
recent years. But it is also prompting officials with the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration to consider tougher
regulations on SUVs. &QL;

   NY-NEW-TEACHER (New York) _ In July, Donna Moffett abandoned her
comfortable longtime job as a legal secretary near Wall Street to
be one of 320 ``teaching fellows'' _ people with little or no
teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor Harold Levy to
fill chronic vacancies in the system's most troubled schools. In
her first weeks of school, Moffett is learning that teaching is
only part of her job description _ for now, an achingly small part.
Already she is grappling with tardiness and discipline problems,
often spending far more time on ``classroom management,'' as
veteran teachers call it, than lessons. By Abby Goodnough.
</P>
<P>
   ANTHROPOLOGY-BOOK (Undated) _ A book about anthropologists who
worked with isolated Indians in Amazonia has touched off a storm in
the profession, reviving scholarly animosities, endangering
personal reputations and, some parties say, threatening to

John Noble Wilford and Simon Romero.

<P>
   INSURE-POOR-KIDS (Undated) _ Three years ago, Congress provided
$4.2 billion to the states to provide health insurance for the
millions of children whose parents were too poor to afford
commercial plans but who earned too much money to qualify for
Medicaid. But a majority of the states are in danger of forfeiting
their share of the federal money, because they have not been able
to get their versions of the program up and running. What separates
those states that have managed to enroll children into health
insurance programs from those that did not in many ways defies
convenient leaps of logic and, in many cases, the expectations of
experts of the program. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

   PARTIES-SOFTMONEY (Undated) _ The national Republican and
Democratic party organizations are outspending both special
interest groups and the Bush and Gore campaigns on television in
the presidential election, a trend that political analysts say is
transforming the parties this year from supporting players into the
chief advertising agents for the candidates. In fact, this this
year, if the trend continues, the advertising campaigns will have
been financed largely by the unregulated soft money donated to the
parties by corporations and wealthy individuals. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE-KIDS-PARENTS (Westland, Mich.) _ As they shopped for
milk at Kroger's, ate ice cream at the Westland Mall or sat in the
bleachers at the Westland Sports Arena, most of the parents
interviewed here agreed that it was their responsibility _ and not
that of the president, Congress or even Hollywood _ to filter what
reaches their children. The candidates, they suggested, should save
their breath for the economy and health care. Yet all of the
parents conceded that they regularly crossed or blurred the borders
between acceptable and unacceptable content. By Jacques Steinberg.

   GAS-PIPELINE (Inuvik, Northwest Territories) _ For three
decades, geologists probing beneath the Arctic Ocean near here and
offshore Alaska have mapped the largest known untapped reserves of
natural gas in North America _ 165 trillion cubic feet, seven times
as much as the United States will consume this year. But, with gas
prices low, indigenous opposition high and environmental issues
looming, energy companies never sought to build pipelines to send
the gas south to heat homes and to generate electricity. This is
changing as fast as it takes to read a home heating bill. By James
Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-TAX (Paris) _ Europe is rushing to tear down borders, but
the Internet is toppling some of them even faster, making life
distinctly uncomfortable for European policy-makers. A big source
of that discomfort is the threat of lost tax revenue, because
European nations depend far more on taxes on consumption than the
United States does. So in contrast to the United States, European
officials are pushing hard to adopt a seemingly narrow but
potentially far-reaching proposal to ensure that digital products
bought in Europe over the Internet do not escape taxation. By John
Tagliabue.

   DRUG-IMPORTS (Undated) _ If a bill allowing imports of
low-priced prescription drugs becomes law, drug companies will be
able to use a myriad of tactics to protect their profits, Wall
Street analysts said Wednesday, and keep the amount of the drugs to
a minimum. Consumer groups gave the plan a tepid thumbs-up, saying
they would continue to push elected officials to do more to rein in
drug prices, which are now the leading cause of the nation's rising
health care costs. By Melody Petersen.

   BOSS-LARGESSE (Boston) _ Much has been made of the fringe
benefits of working for a dot-com company _ the free cappuccino,
the concierge services and the lucrative stock options. But, for
one day last week, working the production line for a company that
makes floor wax and carpet cleaner brought the perk of a lifetime.

<P>
   GOVERNMENT-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ George W. Bush has finally made
government the issue of the presidential campaign. After wasting
months focusing on Al Gore's character, he returned to what was
always the Republicans' meat and potatoes. As president, Gore would
give you big government, Bush now emphasizes. But if voters elect
him instead, Bush says, he would continue to tame Washington. Bush
is picking up, of course, from the legacy of President Reagan. By

   OLY-AUSSIE-TOWN (Lithgow, Australia) _ Lithgow, population
15,000, lies at the end of the electrified railroad line from
Sydney, 90 miles to the west. It is not the sort of place the
writer Donald Horne was thinking of when he famously described
Australia as ``the lucky country.'' Remote, economically depressed,
and cursed with dreadful weather, Lithgow is worlds away from the
designer skyscrapers and sun-splashed beaches of Sydney. On a
recent weekday afternoon, a few cars rattled along Main Street,
barely outracing the fog that drifted down from the nearby
mountains. And yet, for all its hard-luck veneer, Lithgow is as
proud, as captivated, and as unabashedly excited about the Olympics
as Sydney. By Mark Landler.

the equivalent of finding a two-bedroom apartment for $1,000 a
month. It's possible, but not very likely. By Elaine Louie.

   PARIS _ There is no longer any pretense of competition. An
international language has been accepted as valid for everyone, and
it is English.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, French which was the language of diplomacy and
international exchange well into the 20th century fought to remain
at least a rival. Now even that status is ceded.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a congress of teachers of French this summer, Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said they were able to ``contribute to more
than one way of thinking.'' If French ``is no longer the language
of a power, it can be the language of a counter-power,'' he said,
``one of the languages expressing resistance to the uniformity of
the world and the refusal to diminish identity.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 900,000 French teachers and 82 million students of the
language, according to Le Monde. It is the World Wide Web which
finally, definitely defeated its aspiration to be everybody's
second language. But France is determined to keep it available
nonetheless, by supporting its use on ``la Toile'' (literally, the
Web), Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
   There is an attempt to keep up with the vocabulary of technology
by choosing specifically French words for the new names most people
simply accept in English (a chip is ``la puce,'' literally, the
flea, but marketing turned out to be irreplaceable. It is ``le
marketing.'')
</P>
<P>
   The resistance doesn't suceed very well. The English words
overwhelm usage, no matter what language is being spoken or
written, which therefore appears to confer a tremendous additional
advantage on native English speakers and to justify Americans'
disdain for learning other tongues.
</P>
<P>
   I would argue this is a deception that requires all the more
effort to undo because it isn't self-evident. It is going to be a
big disadvantage. Everyone else plugged into any kind of
international exchange will know at least two and often three or
four languages.
</P>
<P>
   American education has to a large extent abandoned foreign
language requirements for admission to college, which had led to
their often no longer being offered at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent young Americans speak something besides English,
it is likely to be their mother tongue or that of their immigrant
parents, not something they learn in addition to everyday function.
</P>
<P>
   That means they don't need consciously to examine the different
ways ideas are formed. Learning another language isn't just finding
another word to say the same thing, it is learning another mode of
expression and even way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   That is why computer translations are so flat and unhelpful.
They can do the part of equating one set of words with another that
is like mathematics, but they lose all the aura and usually the
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, that is exactly what is being talked about when the
need is expressed for dialogue, for understanding, for
communication with a substantive content. It is just the opposite
of homogenization, a recognition and appreciation of differences
rather than the process of compression which can be the other
result of globalized culture.
</P>
<P>
   As much as American fast food, and blue jeans, and movies and
pop music, as much as American business manners and calculations
are eagerly absorbed by the rest of the world, they build up a
resentment and feeling of abuse of power if all the influence and
intellectual effort go only one way.
</P>
<P>
   When others have learned through language and application to see
how Americans think, it is to put themselves in a position of
inferiority _ not superiority _ for Americans to know only
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological studies reported to the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association provide concrete evidence to
support the intuitive sense that different cultural approaches do
make people think differently. It had been supposed that logic and
use of categories were basic, universal human methods of thinking,
though culture made people think about different things.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nisbett and his colleagues at the University of Michigan
devised research projects which showed this was not true, that
there were indeed Asian and Western habits of thought that were
contrasting, the first more focused on context and relations with
more tolerance for contradiction, the second more analytic, reliant
on formal logic, serial.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing genetic about the difference.
Asian-Americans and Americans of European origin were
indistinguishable in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   These are things which can be learned and are of the greatest
value in dealing successfully with people from other backgrounds.
The key is learning other peoples' language.
</P>
<P>
   Even if everybody in the world can eavesdrop and know what they
are talking about, English-speakers confine themselves to a kind of
mental ghetto if they can't find their way on the linguistic turf
of others. It is self-deprivation, of pleasure as well as utility. &QL;

POLICE SEARCH THE CASH BOXES OF BETTING CLERKS FOR EVIDENCE OF
MONEY LAUNDERING
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The state police went through the cash boxes of
scores of betting clerks at Belmont Park racecourse Wednesday as
part of an investigation into allegations that clerks at New York
tracks laundered money for a criminal organization, law enforcement
and racing officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are auditing the house,'' said Clem Imperato, a
consultant to the New York Racing Association, which owns the
tracks under a state franchise. ``That's really what they are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's president, Terry Meyocks, issued a statement
after the state raids started, saying his organization was
``assisting federal authorities and providing them with certain
documents they need.'' The association ``is not the target of any
investigation, federal or state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation that led to the raids, first reported in The
New York Post, began about six months ago, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's Organized Crime Task Force and the
state police have been examining allegations that people with links
to organized crime have been colluding with parimutuel clerks to
launder money.
</P>
<P>
   The clerks are believed to be, for a fee, exchanging large,
easily traceable bills for dozens of smaller, untraceable bills,
according to these officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Wednesday where the large bills came from or
what sort of criminal organization might be involved. Cash from
drug sales tends to be in small denominations, while gambling money
and stolen cash is often in larger bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully anticipate to at some point soon come forward with
indictments and arrests, but we can't say when that will be,'' said
Darren Dopp, a spokesman for the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Racing officials were also served with federal subpoenas
Wednesday as part of an Internal Revenue Service investigation into
activities at the tracks, law enforcement officials said. It was
not clear whether the two investigations are related.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, dozens of state police officers raided the
betting departments at Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga, seizing
stacks of records, boxes of cashed winning tickets and cash boxes.
At Belmont, the police had to wait overnight for a time-locked safe
to open before they could examine the cash boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday , race track officials said, the state investigators
were poring over the contents of the boxes, which contain not only
large amounts of cash but also records of bets placed, winnings
paid out and money taken in.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said a number of mid-level and
low-level racing association employees were believed to be
involved. The number of parimutuel clerks varies from 125 to 500,
depending on the season, and they have about a dozen supervisors,
racing officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The parimutuel, or betting, department of the racing association
has been criticized for lax money-handling.
</P>
<P>
   The State Racing and Wagering Board, which oversees the racing
association, has been pressing for an independent audit of the
department since February 1999, but racing officials have resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The parimutuel clerks are given a sum of money at the beginning
of a track's racing season and are expected to keep their own
accounts straight until the end, when they must account for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a clerk takes in more than a stated maximum, which
ranges from $2,000 to $10,000 depending on the size of the wager
that can be made at the clerk's window, the excess must be turned
over to a central ``money room,'' Imperato said.
</P>
<P>
   Imperato said supervisors opened and audited the clerks' boxes
at least once every 10 weeks, but usually more often. Most clerks
are audited once every three weeks, he said. Three to five clerks
were subjected to surprise audits every day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews Wednesday at Belmont, several clerks, speaking
on the condition of anonymity, said that typically they were
audited only three or four times a year. They said there were
plenty of opportunities for dishonest clerks to take money out for
their own uses, as long as it was returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run my own store here,'' one clerk said.

SENATORS WARN MOVIE EXECS

bc-SENATE-HOLLYWOOD-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Bill Hillburg 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Under attack for marketing sex and violence to
kids, executives of Hollywood's major studios told Congress on
Wednesday they would clean up their act but failed to assuage
Republican lawmakers or derail the threat of congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the executives opened the Senate Commerce
Committee hearing by outlining their reform plans, Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who chairs the panel, cut to the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you or will you not market R-rated films to children
under 17?'' asked McCain, who called a studio reform plan announced
Tuesday ``full of loopholes.'' He then pressed each executive for a
simple ``yes'' or ``no'' answer.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Harris, president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Stacy
Snider, chairwoman of Universal Pictures, gave qualified responses,
saying they would enact reforms but would continue to make
marketing decisions on their R-rated films on a movie-by-movie
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was less equivocal from Rob Friedman, vice chairman
of the Paramount Motion Picture Group; Jim Gianopulos, chairman of
Fox Filmed Entertainment; Alan Horn, president of Warner Bros.;
Robert Iger, president of The Walt Disney Co.; Chris McGurk, vice
chairman of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; and Walter Parks, co-head of
production for DreamWorks SKG.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have gotten my attention,'' said Snider, who added that
Universal has already implemented changes announced Tuesday by the
Motion Picture Association of America and its president, Jack
Valenti.
</P>
<P>
   She cited ``Boyz N The Hood'' as an example of an R-rated film
that could have educational value for younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's question I cannot answer, sir,'' Harris told McCain.
Stressing that Sony will strictly adhere to MPAA's new rules, he
said each film project is unique and so are its marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was disappointed by the responses, particularly
from Sony and Universal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, issued a warning to the
executives, saying parents were frustrated and concerned by
marketing aimed at their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sending a shot across your bow,'' she said. ``If you don't
try to really make this work, you're going to see some
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison also polled the executives on whether they would
support a federal law banning persons under 17 from access to
R-rated fare. All eight were opposed, citing First Amendment rights
and saying that strong self-regulation of their industry is
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Several studios announced new reforms Wednesday, including Fox,
which will ban the showing of trailers for R-rated films in
conjunction with movies rated G and PG. The MPAA proposal covered
only G-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   Gianopulos also said that the Fox TV Network would not accept
any ads for R-rated films for its shows with a youth audience
measured at 35 percent or more, and would not advertise its R-rated
features on other networks' youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said that Warner Bros. would match Fox's efforts and would
also ban toy tie-ins with fast-food franchises for R-rated films,
as well as licensed products aimed at kids. He said Warner Bros.
was also expanding its movie rating system with more specific
designations of Rv to indicate violence, Rs for sex and Rl for
language.
</P>
<P>
   Iger said that Disney had, on several occasions, ``allowed
competitive zeal to overwhelm sound judgment and appropriate
standards in the marketing of some of our R-rated films'' but said
reforms were already in place.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Disney is leading an effort to set up a unified
ratings system for the movie, music and video game industries.
</P>
<P>
   Iger said he was referring to a report in Wednesday's New York
Times that Disney's Hollywood Pictures unit had tested the R-rated
``Judge Dredd'' with youngsters as young as 13 and that its
Touchstone Pictures had used kids 12-14 to screen the R-rated
``Enemy of the State.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cited documents included in the Federal Trade
Commission's Sept. 11 report on Hollywood's youth marketing
practices. The FTC study and report was ordered by President Bill
Clinton following the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats were less critical of Hollywood's efforts,
including Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who said that media violence
was only one of many negative factors impacting the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne White, director of activist group The Lion and Lamb
Project, said she was unimpressed with Hollywood's latest reforms.
Members of White's suburban Washington-based group, including
parents and their kids, attended the Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an independent ratings board, appointed by Congress
and reflecting a wide spectrum of society, to review movies, music
and video games,'' said White. ``With self-regulation, we have the
foxes guarding the henhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   L. Brent Bozell III, chairman of Parents Television Council, a
Los Angeles-based activist organization, was also critical of
Hollywood's cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   PTC released its survey Wednesday of movie advertising on
network TV during the family hour, 8 to 9 p.m., for the period
Sept. 1-20. It found 45 of 54 spots touted R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 83 percent of all movies marketed during the network
television family hour are R-rated, don't tell me that Hollywood
isn't marketing its trash fare to our children,'' Bozell said.

MTA WANTS NEW MEDIATOR IN BUS STRIKE

<P>
   In an effort to resurrect talks between the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and striking unions, MTA officials asked
the unions Wednesday to agree to bring in a federal mediator,
submit detailed written demands and allow bus and rail drivers to
return to work while talks continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 500,000 people who are about to lose their jobs,''
MTA Board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said, referring to
commuters stranded during the walkout entering its 13th day today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who can't get doctors and children who can't
get to school. Let's keep negotiating, but bring the drivers back
to work so the buses can run.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after talks collapsed amid bitter and angry accusations, a
union spokesman said the 4,300 bus and rail drivers represented by
the United Transportation Union will not return to work until a new
contract is signed, and the union prefers to resume talks with the
state mediator and state fact-finder sent by Gov. Gray Davis and
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys. State Department of
Industrial Relations Director Steve Smith and Assemblyman Herb
Wesson, D-Los Angeles, met with union officials until talks broke
off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a federal mediator on this property in the 41
years I've been associated with this union,'' said UTU spokesman
Goldy Norton. ``We are hoping for Smith and Wesson to reinvolve
themselves and see if they can jump-start the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton and Neil Silver, president of the Amalgamated Transit
Union, which represents MTA mechanics and maintenance workers, said
the only way to end the strike is for the governor to sign Senate
Bill 1101, which would require proposed transit zones in the San
Fernando Valley and other areas to abide by MTA contracts
indefinitely. The bill would protect MTA workers' jobs, union
leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is this is not about money; it's not about
work rules. It's not about anything other than the desire of the
mayor of Los Angeles and his friend Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky who
have put the interest of creating a San Fernando Valley transit
zone ahead of the needs of the bus-dependent public,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky is head of a panel overseeing plans for a
transportation zone to take over operation of dozens of MTA bus
lines in a nine-city Valley region. Zone supporters say Senate Bill
1101 would make a zone unfeasible.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said MTA negotiators met with the mechanics'
representatives Wednesday morning hoping their union would urge
Davis to veto the bill, allowing the creation of the transit zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them we want the governor to sign SB 1101,'' Silver
said. ``It's obvious to me that the MTA is doing the bidding of
special interests in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky took issue with union officials' assertions that the
walkout would end if Davis signs SB 1101.
</P>
<P>
   ``That notion is sheer fantasy,'' he said. ``The zones are one
issue in these negotiations. Even if the zone issue was not on the
table, you have the issues of wages, benefits, work rules and all
the things we've been trying to get the unions to negotiate
about.''
</P>
<P>
   By law, the governor has until Saturday to veto the bill or sign
it into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the governor signs the bill I guarantee it would have a
major impact on the negotiations,'' Norton said. ``It might not
immediately settle the strike, but it would remove the transit zone
issue, and that is the biggest stumbling block. If the governor
vetoes the bill, I think you will have a long strike.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the ongoing strike saga, MTA officials on
Wednesday outlined the package of $43 million in increased wages
and benefits they are offering MTA workers.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the MTA is offering 2.7 percent annual wage increases
that total 8.1 percent over three years. Also, the MTA offered to
pick up almost 2 percent of employees' contributions to their
pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the MTA sought to get $23 million in savings as a
result of improved productivity and reductions in overtime through
work-rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA released figures Wednesday showing 2 percent of MTA
drivers earn more than $80,000 a year, 6 percent make $70,001 to
$80,000, 22 percent make $60,001 to $70,000, and 32 percent make
$50,001 to $60,000.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: No honor in scrapping ban on honoraria
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but the chief justice of the United States, of
all people, is pushing to return bribery to the federal judicial
system. No less than William H. Rehnquist himself is asking
Congress to scrap the 1989 ban on honoraria for Supreme Court
justices and most other federal jurists.
</P>
<P>
   And what is more, he has support for this curious notion from
some substantial part of the GOP caucus, though not, thank goodness
for small favors, from all. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), chairman
of the Senate Ethics Committee, for one, opposes the move,
accurately calling it a ``retreat to the discredited practices of
the past,'' and Roberts's office is counting steadily increasing
numbers in opposition with him.
</P>
<P>
   The speaking fees were declared off limits when it became
apparent that for some judges the honoraria were little more than a
thin veil over raunchy influence-peddling. Corporations and
organizations with on-going and substantial legal interests _ trade
associations, ideological action groups and other special pleaders
_ were ponying fees in the thousands of dollars for the dubious
privilege of sitting at the feet of spouting federal jurists for a
half-hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   The judges seemed less chosen for their legal acumen and
entertaining way with words than for their strategic location in
courts likely to take up cases and issues of abiding interest to
the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist says it's necessary to let the speaking fees jingle
anew in judges' pockets to save the federal judiciary from
impending penury. If the judiciary has fallen on hard times, then
the proper and simple answer is to pitch for a pay raise, not to
ask Congress for a tin-cup franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Even the premise is iffy. Certainly jurists are losing out on
the white-hot oodles that partners in the big law firms are making
these days. Still, federal district judges make $141,300. Appellate
judges, $149,900, and Supreme Court justices $179,600.
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly chump change, and the job has the best tenure
this side of death.
</P>
<P>
   Far from letting wink-and-nudge interests butter up judges with
speaking fees, Congress should be snapping up legislation
introduced by Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Russ Feingold
(D-Minn.) to outlaw another practice that is equally compromising.
</P>
<P>
   Barred from larding judges with honoraria, the same sort of
sponsors have taken to setting up legal, ahem, seminars and then
paying for judges to attend and be wined, dined and spit-shined. By
a strange coincidence, these seminars are almost always held in
exotic places _ the Caribbean, Hawaii, resorts and prized golf
courses _ and never in, say, lecture halls at the local community
college.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the executive committee of the governing U.S.
Judicial Conference, which opposes the Kerry-Feingold bill, says
that ending the junkets would be a draconian intrusion into ``the
marketplace of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least he got the ``marketplace'' part right.

<P>
   Jack Paar was a pioneer. He was the first entertainment-oriented
TV host who was able to convince presidential candidates that it
would be in their best interests if they crossed over to
entertainment television in order to prove they could swing with
the hipsters.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bill Clinton donned sunglasses and played a
sausage-fingered version of ``Heartbreak Hotel'' on the ``Arsenio
Hall Show'' in the summer of '92, even before the Madame
Tussaud-looking Republican contender Richard Nixon intoned, ``Sock
it to me?'' on ``Laugh-In'' in 1968, Paar played host to John F.
Kennedy and the ubiquitous Nixon in separate appearances on the
``Tonight Show'' in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The fidgety, mercurial Paar saw it coming. He knew the idea of a
dignified presidential campaign, if it ever existed, would die hard
in the TV era. He knew these guys would do whatever it takes to
win, whether it meant dirty campaign tricks or phony-friendly chats
with their TV host.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Nixon played the piano on Paar's show. (He
had more musical talent than his duplicitous spiritual stepson
Clinton.) Kennedy? He sang the ``Tonight, Tonight'' number from
``West Side Story'' with Marilyn Monroe. (Just kidding.)
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to the year 2000, when there's no longer any
question of whether a candidate will do ``soft'' talk shows. Now
the only questions are:
</P>
<P>
   A. How many shows will the candidate do?
</P>
<P>
   B. What are the limits for each appearance?
</P>
<P>
   So far the answers appear to be:
</P>
<P>
   A. Everything but ``Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   B. No yodeling.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the desperate-to-appear-not-desperate
candidates seem willing to do just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Will George W. Bush kiss Oprah when he visits her queendom, in
an obvious attempt to upstage Al Gore's polite-but-smoochless hello
to ``O'' the week before? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Is Gore willing to play the part of a cue card man for a Jay
Leno monologue on the ``Tonight Show''? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Will Joseph Lieberman break into a verse of ``My Way'' on ``Late
Night with Conan O'Brien''? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Is it OK with Bush if Susan Hawk, the trash-talking truck driver
from Wisconsin and ``Survivor'' semifinalist, sits in with Regis
Philbin during Bush's guest shot and grills him with irreverent
questions, as if he were running for game warden of her hometown?
Check.
</P>
<P>
   Are Gore and Lieberman willing to star in a wacky,
mock-documentary clip for the benefit of the ``Late Show,'' in
which Gore refers to David Letterman as a ``major-league (expletive
deleted)'' and Lieberman affirms, ``Big time,'' in a takeoff on
Bush's real-world comment about a New York Times reporter and Dick
Cheney's reaction? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Can we get Lieberman to guest with Conan O'Brien and do a hunk
of Jewish-related material, i.e., reading a list of jokey campaign
slogans such as, ``A Matzo Ball in Every Soup,'' and, ``No Bull, No
Pork,'' and telling Conan, ``Sometimes when my wife is out, I go
down to the family room, turn on the VCR and play the love scenes
from 'Yentl' over and over?'' Check!
</P>
<P>
   Will Hillary Clinton do a Top Ten List on Letterman's show?
Check. How about Gore? Check check.
</P>
<P>
   If Letterman asks Bush, ``Who likes interns better, you or John
McCain?'' will Bush shoot back, ``That's the wrong party?'' Check.
</P>
<P>
   Will Bush don a monochromatic shirt-and-tie ensemble, a la Regis
on ``Millionaire,'' when he does Reege's daytime show? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Will Gore, Lieberman, Bush and Cheney move in to the ``Big
Brother'' house this weekend, after the grand-prize winner is
declared on Friday night and the remaining mopes from that colossal
failure have been sent home?
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from me to give a sanctimonious lecture on how
presidential candidates should comport themselves with presidential
dignity. After all, I'm the guy who joshingly asked George Bush to
name the capital of Illinois, knowing full well he'd get the joke
and play along.
</P>
<P>
   If these guys are willing to stray from the heavily scripted,
carefully rehearsed campaign speech all the way over to the heavily
scripted, carefully rehearsed talk-show joke material, let 'em give
it a try.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they understand that, despite what the traveling
press corps may believe, it doesn't fool the average voter _ or
nonvoter. The candidates may think they seem cool and happening by
appearing on these shows and playing along with the gags, but to
the average voter, they're the political equivalent of the
corporate exec who tells a couple of jokes or sings a parody song
at the company Christmas party while we all roll our eyes and say,
``Nice try.''

in the 200-meter dash. Or any medal, for that matter. By JOHN

   FBN-JERRY-RICE (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ Television cameras don't
lie, but they often fail to tell the whole story. Take the image of
wide receiver Jerry Rice bellowing at coach Steve Mariucci during
Sunday's 41-24 49ers win in Dallas. What cameras didn't capture was
Rice going up to Mariucci shortly after his outburst and giving
Mariucci a hug. Rice, who appears embarrassed by the incident,
refused to discuss the matter. By KEVIN LYNCH.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: How much to spend on the kiddies?
 &HT;    For release Oct. 1, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that the nation's
poverty rate hs fallen to its lowest level in two years. A few days
later, at the other end of the financial spectrum, billionaire
Warren Buffett complained that rich people are, ``leaving tons of
money to their kids, whose main achievement in life had been to
emerge from the right womb.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this year's FAO Schwarz ``Ultimate Toy
Catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet ready for those barely poking their noses above the
poverty line but voraciously attuned to those Buffett is talking
about, and maybe those yearning at a slightly lower level, this
catalog would give any socialist a fatal heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   I can imagine only the MacCauley Culkin-played character in the
1994 movie ``Richie Rich'' leafing through its pages, saying ``I'll
have one of these, two of those, one of these...''
</P>
<P>
   And what I find so outrageous about buying outrageously priced
toys is that assembly is still required!
</P>
<P>
   I do not invent this allegation. Page 31 offers a children's
outdoor theater, quite impressive with a second-floor balcony. It
comes with a marquee that has changeable letters, a front ticket
window and, as the accompanying photo in the catalog shows, at
least five kids can get inside the thing. With an included 25-inch
TV, VCR and hardwood floors _ it doesn't say what the walls are
made of _ this nifty little gift for your child sells for $14,500.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that caveat: Assembly required.
</P>
<P>
   If I had $14,500 for a toy for my kids, I'm sure I'd have plenty
more money to hire people to put it together. But it seems to me
that for $14,500, FAO Schwarz ought to be doing it.
</P>
<P>
   How many ``One-Of-A-Kind'' Monopoly sets do you think FAO
Schwarz will sell from its catalog? Likely, it's just one, as in
``One-Of-A-Kind.'' But who would buy the one? This is not your
ordinary, or even premium Monopoly set; it goes far beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   While not giving the amount, the blurb says the game comes with
``hard cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Rosewood board, street names written in gold leaf,
emeralds around the Chance icon, sapphires around Community Chest,
rubies in the brake lights of the car on the Free Parking space; it
goes on and on, up to and including twelve 18-karat gold hotels and
thirty-two 18-karat gold houses.
</P>
<P>
   The price? $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Check and confirm: One hundred thousand dollars!
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rub: Freight costs extra.
</P>
<P>
   Man, that ticks me off!
</P>
<P>
   It's going to make the difference in whether I buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we have become a wealthy population; well, a lot of us
have. We live in an era where people actually spend more than $100
a game to watch pro basketball, where theater tickets sell for $85
and up, where $350,000 homes are not uncommon, where automobiles
are purchased at $30,000 and up. Which brings me back to the FAO
Schwarz ``Ultimate Toy Catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   You can get a replicated Lamborghini, child-sized version, with
a four cycle, five horsepower engine, ``faux'' leather upholstery
(''faux'' means ``fake'') and a working horn (wow!) for $40,000;
also extra for the freight.
</P>
<P>
   As I look at the morning paper, $40,000 will get me three or
four real Chevys, even a utilitarian Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, Warren Buffett knows people who will use this catalog
for their Christmas shopping, and would be concerned about them
bestowing such outrageous gifts upon their Richie Rich kids. And
the news that the poor people aren't quite as poor as they were two
years ago does not portend that they now can choose their gifts
from anything more lavish than a Harriet Carter catalog.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nice to know those fancy things exist, that we can look
at them in catalogs _ and can dream.
</P>
<P>
   Always, we can dream; it's free. No freight, batteries or
assembly required.

 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday.
 &HT;    I have done my small part to bring on the rain
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Fall is finally here, though rain is still
playing hide-and-seek, meaning the temperatures are tolerable, but
the land is still ridiculously dry even with a few showers. Forest
fires are still a fact of life, and anybody who is dumb enough to
burn outdoors or chunk a cigarette out a car window ought to be
horsewhipped.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I have taken the ultimate step to appease the rain gods.
I took the top off my Jeep last Sunday while the Big Strong
Boyfriends were in town to help.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to love this boyfriend deal. At first I was a bit
uncomfortable with the ever-presence of the boys, as my wife and I
call them. The girls show up, and like Siamese twins, there are the
boyfriends, automatically doubling the number of young adults
eating my food.
</P>
<P>
   But then I was struck with a lightning bolt of inspiration. Put
them to work while they're here. Make them lift stuff. Since
they're falling all over themselves to stay in my good graces _ and
they're nice guys to boot _ they hop right up every time I enlist
their brawn.
</P>
<P>
   So the top came off the Jeep, replaced with a bikini top that
keeps the sun off but won't keep the rain out. It's a wonderful
feeling, wearing a jacket early in the cool morning while driving
to work as the sun rises. There's the toasted-wood smell of
International Paper, which pleasantly reminds me of a wood-burning
fireplace, the sounds of a small town waking up, delivery trucks
making their rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even the diesel smell of school buses picking up kids perks me
up. I have to crank NPR up terribly loud to hear the news, but I do
so with a clear conscience, figuring it is an elevating experience
for those boom-boxers playing rap music with the bass turned way
up. Give them a dose of Bob Edwards' cigarette-deepened voice at
6:30 a.m. and maybe they'll forget about Eminem and contribute to
the pledge drive coming up, way I figure. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Riding around in a vehicle without a roof, back windshield or
windows reminds me of my motorcycling days, which concluded a few
decades back after an unfortunate entaglement with a barbed-wire
fence. I had just bought a Honda Hawk and was heading home from the
insurance agent's office, sweeping through the S-curve on Pearl
Street in Nacogdoches, right behind La Hacienda. An old pickup in
front of me dropped a square bale of hay off the bed. I panicked,
made a hard right, jumped the curb and ended up flying over the
handlebars and through the barbed-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   I still have the scars to prove it, from my shoulder down to my
waist. The bike was relatively unscathed, but I was cut up pretty
extensively, though nothing was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   This was my third motorcycle wreck in four years, and somehow I
had managed each time to avoid an overnight stay in the hospital,
though emergency room personnel knew me by sight.
</P>
<P>
   Thus came an epiphany. God doesn't want me to ride a motorcycle,
much as I love them. I'm too short and stubby to keep anything
aloft much bigger than a Moped. A few months after that last wreck,
I sold the bike and have stuck with four-wheelers ever since. Know
your limits, I say.
</P>
<P>
   So in the 25 years since I've settled for rag tops of some type
or description, from an Austin Healy I drove each day from Austin
to Round Rock on I-35 - convinced an 18-wheeler was about to devour
me _ to the Fiat Spider I bought between marriages a few years back
and still kick myself for selling to buy a Ford Tempo. What was I
thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Now I have a Jeep that is loud, cranky, drives rough as a
carnival ride, is built to run over nearly anything, and can be
taken apart like an Erector Set project. You can take off the roof,
rip out the back seats, remove the doors and even take down the
windshield if you enjoy capturing bugs in your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it keeps one occupied. The Jeep is not a motorcycle, but
when heading down the highway, the canvas top flapping loudly and
red dust wafting through the windows, it's a good feeling. And I
don't have to worry about dying if I hit a hay bale.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, once the top came off, a few days later the rain came,
a blessed sight. Unfortunately, the boyfriends had already headed
home to Austin, and I had to shanghai a co-worker to put it back
on.

 &HT;    Telling it like it is, sorta
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ We all know people like that. You know, those
whose elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor. The ones
who are fry or two short of a Happy Meal. Folks whose motor is
running but they can't get it out of Park.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the colloquial put-down, we take to it like,
well, a hog to slop. I received an e-mail the other day that
purports to be ``actual employee performance evaluations in a large
U.S. corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, the list is from the imagination of someone
with too much time on his hands, but they do have a ring of truth
that is all too familiar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Since my last report, this employee has reached rock bottom
... and has started to dig.
</P>
<P>
   _ His men would follow him anywhere ... but only out of morbid
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   _ I would not allow this employee to breed.
</P>
<P>
   _ This employee is really not so much of a ``has-been,'' but
more of a definite ``won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a
rat in a trap.
</P>
<P>
   _ When she opens her mouth, it seems that it is only to change
feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ He would be out of his depth in a parking lot puddle.
</P>
<P>
   _ This young lady has delusions of adequacy.
</P>
<P>
   _ He sets low personal standards and then consistently fails to
achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   _ This employee is depriving a village somewhere of an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   _ This employee should go far ... and the sooner he starts, the
better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Got a full six-pack, but lacks the plastic thing to hold it
together.
</P>
<P>
   _ A gross ignoramus _ 144 times worse than an ordinary
ignoramus.
</P>
<P>
   _ He certainly takes a long time to make his pointless.
</P>
<P>
   _ He doesn't have ulcers, but he's a carrier.
</P>
<P>
   _ I would like to go hunting with him sometime.
</P>
<P>
   _ He's been working with glue too much.
</P>
<P>
   _ He would argue with a signpost.
</P>
<P>
   _ He has a knack for making strangers immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ He brings a lot of joy whenever he leaves the room.
</P>
<P>
   _ When his IQ reaches 50, he should sell.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you see two people talking and one looks bored ... he's the
other one.
</P>
<P>
   _ A photographic memory but with the lens cover glued on.
</P>
<P>
   _ A prime candidate for natural de-selection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Donated his brain to science before he was done using it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gates are down, the lights are flashing, but the train isn't
coming.
</P>
<P>
   _ Has two brains: one is lost and the other is out looking for
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ If he were any more stupid, he'd have to be watered twice a
week.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you give him a penny for his thoughts, you'd get change.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you stand close enough to him, you can hear the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's hard to believe that he beat 1,000,000 other sperm to the
egg.
</P>
<P>
   _ One neuron short of a synapse.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some drink from the fountain of knowledge ... he only gargled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Takes him two hours to watch 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The wheel is turning, but the hamster is dead.

 &HT;    Toyota seeks niche in technology arena with hybrid-fuel Prius
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The number of hybrid-fuel vehicles available to the
public has just doubled.
</P>
<P>
   A hybrid is a vehicle that has more than one power source _ in
this case, a 44-horsepower electric motor and a 70-horsepower,
inline, four-cylinder gasoline motor.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomer, joining Honda's Insight in the market place, is
Toyota's Prius (pronounced pre-us).
</P>
<P>
   Typically when you quiz automotive consumers about which vehicle
first comes to mind when you think of safety, the response is
Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   When you ask about luxury, it may be Mercedes-Benz or Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   But what about if you were to ask about the one with the most
revolutionary technology?
</P>
<P>
   If it were a computer or Palm Pilot that you were referring to,
the answers from many people would be quick. But when it comes to
automobiles, there really is no accepted technology standard.
Toyota's goal is to claim that spot with its new Prius.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota people don't see the Prius as an answer to all our
fuel and pollution problems, but rather as a beginning step. Toyota
hopes consumers 50 to 75 years from now think of the Prius in the
same way we currently think of the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Toyota faces an uphill struggle to fill the
marketplace with its hybrid vehicle. The Japanese almost knocked
down dealers' doors to order the Prius, with now some 45,000 units
on the road. But the American consumer is going to be a harder
sell. Why?
</P>
<P>
   First, even with the rise in gas prices, consumers haven't
gotten that excited about high-mileage vehicles. If they had, they
wouldn't be buying SUVs like they were blue light specials at
Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Second, since we really don't accept the fact that our air
quality is stinko, we typically aren't willing to adjust our
lifestyle to help to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I spent an extended amount of time in the upper Midwest this
summer. Until then, I did not really understand just how bad
Atlanta's air has become and how much better my breathing could be
when I am in a less-polluted environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius does not get as good gas mileage as Honda's Insight,
but my guess is that it is going to be much more widely accepted,
because it has more traditional characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   It can carry five adults, it has a large trunk and it comes
standard with an automatic transmission and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says it gets 45 mpg on the highway and 52 mpg in the
city. No, I didn't reverse those numbers. At city speeds, the Prius
depends more on its electric motor capability than it does its
gasoline partner. Thus the better city mpg.
</P>
<P>
   How does it drive? Driving in downtown Miami, I found it
outjumped most cars at stoplights and cruised admirably on the
freeway. Bottom line, it didn't seem any different than a regular
vehicle, except that it was uncannily quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many automakers that have quietly resisted the
government's mandate to produce an acceptable alternative-fuel
vehicle, and therefore only put forth whatever minimal effort that
was necessary, Toyota is making a concentrated effort to get this
vehicle into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   At a selling price of $20,450 _ or a three-year lease program
with 45,000 miles and a $298 monthly payment _ Toyota is heavily
subsidizing this effort.
</P>

   Actual production cost for the Prius is rumored to be around
$27,000.

<P>
   Toyota is so confident in the reliability of this new product
that it provides an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is not a pure alternative-fuel vehicle, you will
spend a lot less time in your local gas station.
</P>
<P>
   And, more importantly, you will be doing something really good
not only for yourself but the rest of us as well, since the Prius
pollutes the air an impressive 90 percent less than any
conventional vehicle.

 &HT;    Fuel, additives handle injector cleaning
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The question of whether to clean the ``self-cleaning''
Multec fuel injectors on a 1990 Camaro _ broached by R.P Borsody
last week _ prompted me to delve into an area for which I thought I
had a definitive answer.
</P>
<P>
   However, my research of real-world conditions revealed, as is
often the case, that the factory information I have believed to be
gospel contains some discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   I am not completely disputing the original recommendation of GM
when it says in the vehicle service manual, ``DO NOT CLEAN Multec
injectors.'' I think the controversy can best be illustrated by
deferring to its history and usage.
</P>
<P>
   I happened to be working at a GM dealership in the mid-1980s,
when electronic port fuel injection engines began replacing their
carbureted predecessors. Thus I witnessed firsthand a transition,
one that suffered growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   A primary source of engine performance and driveability
complaints stemmed from the incompatibility of the fuel injector
design and the formulation of the gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   While we waited for the injector and fuel engineers to work out
a solution, we replaced injectors in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The Multec ``self-cleaning'' injector appeared on the scene in
1987, incorporating a completely different design than the
traditional ``pintle and seat'' depicted last week.
</P>
<P>
   GM's description states: ``It uses a stainless steel ball and
seat valve, finished to a near mirror smoothness to obtain a
positive seal. A director plate with six holes, which is
insensitive to fuel deposits, provides spray pattern control. As a
result, the Multec injector is less susceptible to plugging caused
by varnish buildup.'' Additional modifications included the
electrical wire windings and sealing of the injector.
</P>
<P>
   As technicians, we were warned that cleaning these injectors
could damage the insulation on the wire windings, causing them to
fail electrically. We were told that because of their design, they
didn't need cleaning, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the discrepancy lies.
</P>
<P>
   According to my research, there are areas both within the fuel
delivery system and the injectors themselves that can become gooked
up.
</P>
<P>
   As with conventional ``pintle and seat'' injectors, a mild to
moderate buildup can often be remedied by cleaning the injectors.
However, the mechanic's choice of chemicals and cleaning method can
make the difference between restored performance of the injectors
or a meltdown nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   If the cleaning solution is too harsh or used in the wrong
proportions, or if it is introduced into the system improperly,
disaster is in your future.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that must be determined is, are the injectors at
fault?
</P>
<P>
   This can only be determined through a diagnostic test that
measures the fuel pressure drop of each injector.
</P>
<P>
   I have never seen all of the injectors go bad at the same time.
Yet because of the way the fuel delivery system is designed, all of
them will need to be cleaned. A single-line unit (bug
sprayer/canister type) is inferior to a dual-line cleaning unit.
</P>
<P>
   I do not adhere to fuel injection cleaning as preventive
maintenance. I do advocate the use of quality fuel containing the
additives to clean injectors, along with a bottle of Techron or 44K
added to a tank of gas every 5,000 miles or so.
</P>
<P>
   Note: More is not better. Oh, and stay clear of products
containing methanol.
</P>
<P>
   Intake or induction cleaning differs from injector cleaning in
that it cleans the air intake plate (throttle plate) intake
passages, intake valves and combustion chamber without going
through the fuel system.
</P>
<P>
   I have had very good success with intake cleaning, which I
recommend performing every 30,000 to 60,000 miles, depending on
driving habits.
</P>
<P>
   This procedure is not usually listed in the manufacturer's
vehicle maintenance schedule, and it can be a little costly. But I
feel it is well worth it in both performance and fuel economy. My
engine seems to like it, too.

 &HT;    Abstinence-only isn't sex education; it's pacification
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Unwrap an arm's length of cotton gauze, wad it in
your mouth and experience what too many health educators say they
feel.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is sex education. It comes out ``sez
nextonuthin.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely what many policy-makers want. Next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Clarification: Next to nothing, they want full-throated
advisories against it.
</P>
<P>
   It? You know. It. Do I have to spell it out? S-E-X.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday two surveys came out showing overwhelming support for
something else, real sex education. The survey that got the most
attention came from the Kaiser Family Foundation. It showed parents
valued comprehensive sex education every bit as much as they valued
abstinence messages and coping skills. Bring it all on, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The other survey, by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, indicates
that nine of 10 health educators are frustrated with sex education
under abstinence-only restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and teachers seem to agree that comprehensive sex
education means discussing contraception: how to use it, how it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Onwafessum?
</P>
<P>
   No. Contraception.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are at odds with policy-makers' increasing
insistence on abstinence education which quite often, and quite
dangerously, serves as a school district's only sex education.
</P>
<P>
   Congress spends nearly $100 million a year on abstinence
education programs, which proponents and some school districts pose
in an either/or proposition: Either you teach abstinence or you're
promoting promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   The nomenclature of abstinence funding has a strong whiff of
someone's ministry of propaganda. There's abstinence education and
there's ``mixed messages'' _ the abstinence-only term for
comprehensive sex education.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry line: Referring to contraception in any way other
than what it can't do _ it can't prevent pregnancy 100 percent of
the time, and condoms fail _ is tantamount to advocating teen sex.
</P>
<P>
   With abstinence-only programs like Teen Aid and Sex Respect, one
has the unfortunate condition of school policy-makers saying
they've done their job by providing sex education. In fact, with so
many questions and concerns that could be addressed in a classroom
setting, the districts simply have handed growing and nearly grown
children a lollipop to pacify.
</P>
<P>
   IMPORTANT THEME
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't think abstinence should be the prevailing theme in
discussing sex with young people? I certainly think it should. So
should any self-respecting sex educator in the age of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser Family Foundation found that virtually all parents it
surveyed, 97 percent, wanted an abstinence theme to sex education.
But a vast majority say they want much more, even on the touchiest
subjects. Seventy-five percent of parents said they wanted
classroom treatment of subjects like homosexuality, abortion and
how to use birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Is this such an unusual request? Absolutely not. With today's
information and influences, what child does not have questions that
need dispassionate, factual explanations in keeping with an
abstinence theme? The facts certainly support the need for
abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one would hope that such answers would come from
home. Not in this world. Not in this life.
</P>
<P>
   The students' parents can supply the passion on the subject
matter if so desired. This is a matter of information.
</P>
<P>
   Survey says: Parents want abstinence-based sex education that's
real sex education. It's not either/or.

   AIDS-CONFERENCE _ ATLANTA _ She struggles to put her fear into
words, but Mardis Andrews knows perhaps better than anyone what the
AIDS epidemic means to her and her children, an 11-year-old
daughter and a baby not yet born. ``I feel like I'm in a world
different from everybody else,'' the 33-year-old Atlanta mother
said. Truth is, Mardis Andrews isn't. She has never been. In
Georgia, 82 percent of women with AIDS are African-American, just
like her. And African-American children represent 62 percent of all
new HIV-AIDS cases in the United States, just like her daughter.
But if these numbers are lost on Andrews, they weigh heavy and wide
on the 3,300 representatives from HIV/AIDS advocacy groups and
service providers who are expected to meet here Sunday through
Wednesday for the U.S. Conference on AIDS. (Staples, Atlanta

 &HT;    Toyota seeks niche in technology arena with hybrid-fuel Prius
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The number of hybrid-fuel vehicles available to the
public has just doubled.
</P>
<P>
   A hybrid is a vehicle that has more than one power source _ in
this case, a 44-horsepower electric motor and a 70-horsepower,
inline, four-cylinder gasoline motor.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomer, joining Honda's Insight in the market place, is
Toyota's Prius (pronounced pre-us).
</P>
<P>
   Typically when you quiz automotive consumers about which vehicle
first comes to mind when you think of safety, the response is
Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   When you ask about luxury, it may be Mercedes-Benz or Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   But what about if you were to ask about the one with the most
revolutionary technology?
</P>
<P>
   If it were a computer or Palm Pilot that you were referring to,
the answers from many people would be quick. But when it comes to
automobiles, there really is no accepted technology standard.
Toyota's goal is to claim that spot with its new Prius.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota people don't see the Prius as an answer to all our
fuel and pollution problems, but rather as a beginning step. Toyota
hopes consumers 50 to 75 years from now think of the Prius in the
same way we currently think of the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Toyota faces an uphill struggle to fill the
marketplace with its hybrid vehicle. The Japanese almost knocked
down dealers' doors to order the Prius, with now some 45,000 units
on the road. But the American consumer is going to be a harder
sell. Why?
</P>
<P>
   First, even with the rise in gas prices, consumers haven't
gotten that excited about high-mileage vehicles. If they had, they
wouldn't be buying SUVs like they were blue light specials at
Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Second, since we really don't accept the fact that our air
quality is stinko, we typically aren't willing to adjust our
lifestyle to help to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I spent an extended amount of time in the upper Midwest this
summer. Until then, I did not really understand just how bad
Atlanta's air has become and how much better my breathing could be
when I am in a less-polluted environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius does not get as good gas mileage as Honda's Insight,
but my guess is that it is going to be much more widely accepted,
because it has more traditional characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   It can carry five adults, it has a large trunk and it comes
standard with an automatic transmission and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says it gets 45 mpg on the highway and 52 mpg in the
city. No, I didn't reverse those numbers. At city speeds, the Prius
depends more on its electric motor capability than it does its
gasoline partner. Thus the better city mpg.
</P>
<P>
   How does it drive? Driving in downtown Miami, I found it
outjumped most cars at stoplights and cruised admirably on the
freeway. Bottom line, it didn't seem any different than a regular
vehicle, except that it was uncannily quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many automakers that have quietly resisted the
government's mandate to produce an acceptable alternative-fuel
vehicle, and therefore only put forth whatever minimal effort that
was necessary, Toyota is making a concentrated effort to get this
vehicle into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   At a selling price of $20,450 _ or a three-year lease program
with 45,000 miles and a $298 monthly payment _ Toyota is heavily
subsidizing this effort.
</P>
<P>
   Actual production cost for the Prius is rumored to be around
$27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is so confident in the reliability of this new product
that it provides an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is not a pure alternative-fuel vehicle, you will
spend a lot less time in your local gas station.
</P>
<P>
   And, more importantly, you will be doing something really good
not only for yourself but the rest of us as well, since the Prius
pollutes the air an impressive 90 percent less than any
conventional vehicle.

IS A CLEAN T-SHIRT A SIGN OF A BAD HEART?

<P>
   Our mothers always told us to wear clean underwear in case we
had an accident and had to go to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose you learned that wearing dingy underwear reduced
your risk of heart disease, what then?
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of Science of the Total Environment reports that
there may be a relationship between clean underwear and heart
problems. It's all in the water you drink and wash with.
</P>
<P>
   When Scottish researchers measured the amount of calcium in the
hair of 4,393 men, they found that those with the most calcium had
the lowest rate of heart disease. And those with the most calcium
in their hair lived in areas with the hardest water _ that is,
water with the most minerals in it, including calcium.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, measurements of water hardness and sun exposure
together were able to account for almost half the differences in
rates of heart disease in Scotland. Harder water and more sun were
better.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback, of course, is that clothes don't wash as well in
hard water. Maybe that's why people wear gray T-shirts to the gym.

<P>
   Premiere week gets under way tonight with a slew of new shows
and season premieres, including the debut of NBC's drama series
``Deadline'' at 9. Oliver Platt stars as New York tabloid columnist
and college journalism teacher Wallace Benton. His newsroom
colleagues include Tom Conti, Bebe Neuwirth and Lili Taylor _ maybe
it's not an all-star cast, but they've got chops. And the producer
is none other than Dick Wolf of ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's already plenty of grumbling among journalists that
this isn't exactly reality television.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Benton reopens a murder case in which he helped
put the accused killers on death row. Now he thinks he was wrong,
and he and his student acolytes get to work finding the real
killers before the wrong guys are executed. We, uh, won't tell you
how it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   This story line has led to suspicions that Benton is based on
Chicago journalism professor David Protess, who has a habit of
getting innocent men off death row with the help of his students.
The producers say not so _ their models are columnists like Jimmy
Breslin, Mike Royko and Mike McAlary. Now Breslin's half-seriously
talking about getting a lawyer, since those other guys are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Smart money says this one won't last as long as ``Law &AMP; Order,''
nor be as fondly remembered as ``Lou Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``King of Queens,'' CBS at 8: Season premiere. Doug finds a new
way to turn Carrie on. Needless to say, he'll make a fool of
himself before he's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddio,'' NBC at 8: Season premiere. Michael Chiklis stars in
this subpar sitcom. Donny Osmond guests as a former boss who
arrives with a job offer in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexiest Bachelor in America Pageant,'' Fox (who else) at 8:
What, you need more details?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS at 9: Special hourlong
season-premiere episode finds Marie springing for an Italian
vacation for the whole family. Pasta and a fine whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Dear,'' CBS at 8:30: Sitcom premiere about the different
parenting styles of two couples. The pilot episode was painfully
predictable. And the two male stars, comics Anthony Clark and Mike
O'Malley, were both less than successful in their previous sitcom
outings. Better catch this one quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tucker,'' NBC at 8:30: Another premiere. Tucker (Eli
Marienthal) and his newly divorced mother (Noelle Beck) are forced
by circumstances to move in with his awful aunt (Katey Sagal of
``Married with Children''). Tucker is sensitive and self-aware _
think ``Malcolm in the Middle'' _ but the pilot episode, at least,
is insensitive and stupid. Malcolm could pull off a long scene
about trying to conceal his, er, excitement, but here it just seems
smarmy. This one will race ``Yes, Dear'' to the cancellation line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football,'' ABC at 9: Seattle at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roswell,'' WB at 9: Season premiere finds the alien high
schoolers and their friends facing new challenges, including the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys,'' UPN at 9: Is a smutty Web site the way to
success?
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfriends,'' UPN at 9:30: Is the Internet a place to find a
mate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Law,'' CBS at 10: Season premiere. Tony Danza joins the
cast as a street-smart lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch,'' NBC at 10: Season premiere. One kidnapper is
dead, the other in a coma. Now where's the kidnappee?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventh Heaven,'' WB at 8: Season premiere of this family
drama. Eric and Annie disagree over work and school issues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Raw'' and ``WWF War Zone,'' TNN at 9 and 10:
Ch-ch-changes. First, these two wrestling hits moved over to TNN
last week. And, at the same time, TNN dropped ``Nashville'' to
become The National Network. The biggest news is TNN now has a big
Monday-night ratings success on its hands _ last week these shows
got the cabler's best numbers ever.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATE NIGHT TALK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' CBS at 11:35: Geena Davis
and Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight Show with Jay Leno,'' CBS at 11:35: Pamela Anderson
and Christopher Titus.

   Olympic stories from The New York Times News Service for Friday,
Sept. 29:
</P>

   OLY-SOC-WOMEN (Sydney) _ Dagny Mellgren's goal in overtime gives
Norway a 3-2 victory over the defending Olympic champion United
States in the women's soccer final. By Jere Longman.

</P>
<P>
   OLY-TRACK (Sydney) _ The day's highlights: Marion Jones, already
the 100-meter champion, resumed her five-medal quest by adding the
200 title in 21.84 seconds, winning by almost a half-second. She
competes in the long jump final Friday. Ivan Pedroso of Cuba took
the men's long jump, reaching 28 feet, } inch on his final attempt.
Konstantinos Kenteris of Greece upset the favorites in the men's
200. China's Wang Liping won the women's 20-kilometer walk after
Australian Jane Saville was disqualified. Erki Nool of Estonia won
the Olympic decathlon, overtaking Chris Huffins of Indianapolis who
led through nine events. Huffins ended up third. Yanina Karolchik
of Belarus took the women's shot put. By Christopher Clarey.

<P>
   OLY-SOC-VECSEY-COLUMN (Sydney) _ Back in Norway, they heard
about the victory tour, the commercials, the sponsorships when the
United States won the Women's World Cup in 1999. ``The United
States has more money,'' said Silje Joergensen, who plays defense
for Norway. ``They are rich.'' The countries are different, the
cultures are different, the economies are different. And, in the
end, the two soccer foes need each other. Sports of The Times
column by George Vecsey.

Marion Jones' gold medal-winning performance in the 200 meters. By
William C. Rhoden.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-ARATON-COLUMN (Sydney) _ If you had put it to a vote, polled
the Olympic community, I suspect it would have been a landslide
Slobodan Milosevic couldn't ignore. By the time it was announced
that Andreea Raducan wasn't getting her gold medal back, people
just wished the cute little gymnast could wipe away the tears and
go home happily to Romania to claim her $30,000 victory prize. Not
to be. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-DRUGS-RADUCAN (Sydney) _ Andreea Raducan still can't believe
her gold medal for winning the gymnastics individual all-around
competition was stripped from her for taking a cold medication that
contained a substance banned by the International Olympic
Committee. And even Thursday, as the Court of Arbitration upheld
the IOC's decision, the 16-year-old continued to be mystified that
taking an over-the-counter drug, pseudoephedrine, that was
administered by the Romanian team doctor, could result in such a
drastic outcome. By Richard Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BOX (Sydney) _ Cuban boxers win four of five fights,
including bantamweight Guillermo Rigondeaux's victory over Clarence
Vinson of the United States. By Bill Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BOX-KAZAHKSTAN (Sydney) _ Nurgali Safiullin, an Olympic
boxing coach of Kazakhstan: ``Kazakhstani people originated from a
very warrior tribe, the Kipchaki. They've always been fighters.
They know how to fight.'' At the 2000 Sydney Games, Kazakhstan is
proving its point. A nation of 14 million, it has four fighters in
the medal round of the boxing tournament. By Bill Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BKO-GAZE (Sydney) _ Andrew Gaze has led Australia's charge
into the men's basketball semifinals, where, after Thursday's
quarterfinal victory against Italy, it will face France. The United
States will play Lithuania. By Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-DIV (Sydney) _ Two systems for developing divers were on
display at the Olympic Park Aquatic Center Thursday night, and the
results were as defining as Fu Mingxia's nearly flawless technique.
Fu won the women's 3-meter springboard title by surpassing her
Chinese teammate, Guo Jingjing, on the final two dives. With the
victory, she joined two Americans, Greg Louganis and Pat McCormick,
as the only divers to win four Olympic gold medals, and she became
the first female diver to win five career medals. She also
continued the Chinese dominance that has accounted for eight medals
so far in this diving competition. By Bill Brink.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SAIL (Sydney) _ In sight of the famous waterside Opera House
and the Olympic rings emblazoned across the Sydney Harbor Bridge,
the U.S. crews of J.J. Isler and Pease Glaser, and Paul Foerster
and Bob Merrick, raced to silver medals Thursday afternoon in the
waning days of the Olympic regatta. Competing in the men's and
women's divisions of the doublehanded 470 dinghy, the twin silvers
represented the best results for the U.S. sailing team in two
Olympiads. But, unfortunately for the Americans, it came on the
greatest day ever for the Australian Olympic sailing squad. By Herb
McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-VOL-WOMEN (Sydney) _ Russia ended the U.S. women's team's
unlikely run with a 5-set victory. The Americans, underdogs in the
tournament, will play Brazil for the bronze. Cuba will get a chance
to go for an unprecedented third straight gold medal against
Russia. By John Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-TEN (Sydney) _ Venus and Serena Williams win the gold medal
in women's doubles. By Selena Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-TAE (Sydney) _ Patience and a penalty point helped propel
Steven Lopez of Sugar Land, Texas, to a gold medal Thursday in the
Korean martial art of taekwondo, 1-0. By Walter Barranger.

<P>
   Tonight offers your choice of hard-fought contests _ either a
presidential debate or an American League baseball playoff game. At
deadline, we only know the contestants in the debate. Baseball, if
that's what you're looking for, will be on NBC at 8.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, of arguably larger significance to the republic,
begins at 9 on ABC, CBS, PBS, C-Span and some, if not all, of the
cable news channels. Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush will meet at the University of Massachusetts in Boston for
90 minutes of questions and answers and rebuttals. PBS stalwart Jim
Lehrer moderates. The format is said to favor experienced debater
Gore, so the real battle here may be Al versus high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Building Big,'' PBS at 8: Premiere. The great explainer David
Macaulay (``The Way Things Work'') begins a series about
structures. Tonight, he crosses bridges, including, natch, the
Brooklyn and the Golden Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jag,'' CBS at 8: Season premiere. Harm and the gang get
tangled up with Russian plotters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC at 8: Guess which network
will have the best debate ratings. Regis Philbin hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Angel,'' Fox at 9: Two-hour premiere of a cyber-noir
drama series from ``Titanic'' and ``Terminator'' director James
Cameron. Newcomer Jessica Alba is terrific as a bike messenger with
souped-up DNA trying to elude the shadowy government agency that
made her that way. Her main ally in post-apocalyptic Seattle is a
high-tech Internet muckraker (Michael Weatherly). It's a little
``Blade Runner,'' a little ``X-Files,'' a little ``Max Headroom.''
And Alba is more than a little sexy. But she can't be brooding atop
the Space Needle in every episode _ the budget can't be that big.
And we have to wonder how many people want their drama this dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show,'' Fox at 8: Season premiere. When last seen,
Hyde was taking a pot rap for Jackie, and now he's taking the
consequences, including getting thrown out of the Formans' house.
Once again this show looks set to score big laughs while touching
on a surprising amount of the confusion and pathos of 1970s teen
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' WB at 8: Buffy (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) and her ``new'' sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) get
tangled up with some vamps as well as some sisterly conflicts. And
no, we still don't know what's up with the whole ``new sister''
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel,'' WB at 9: Mysteries of an abandoned hotel in Hollywood
carry ghosts of the McCarthy era.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We've never done a double entry before, but why not sit the kids
down tonight and watch the debate with them? It's probably a
homework assignment anyway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull,'' TNT at 10: Ryan O'Neal guests tonight as Ditto's
long-lost father. Repeats at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City,'' HBO at 11: Charlotte and Samantha get into
it. A repeat of Sunday's episode.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATE NIGHT TALK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' CBS at 11:35: The elegant
Christine Baranski, who happens to have a new show on CBS tomorrow
night, and punk rockers Green Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight Show with Jay Leno,'' NBC at 11:35: Yasmine Bleeth,
Jackie Chan and musical guest Phish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher,'' ABC at 12:05 a.m.:
TBA. Presumably they'll hash over the debate, whoever they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late, Late Show with Craig Kilborn,'' CBS at 12:35: Sylvester
Stallone, talking about ``Get Carter,'' we presume, and Heather
Page Kent, talking about her new CBS series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien,'' NBC at 12:35: Andy Richter
returns for a visit, and the musical guests are The Corrs.

than any previous host city of the Olympics to protect its official

(1819-1900) this year. It is the centenary of the death of this
artist, art and architectural critic extraordinaire, social
reformer, polymath lecturer, first official professor of art in
England (at Oxford University) and an admirer of little girls. The
Morgan Library has mounted its own show of Ruskiniana, a
biographical assemblage of 133 objects: letters, manuscripts,
photographs, drawings, paintings and artifacts. They were mined
entirely from the Morgan's own Ruskin collection, proclaimed by the

   BIOGRAPHY-THEATER (New York) _ The odds are you have never heard

sweet and fierce directorial debut, deals with the new phenomenon
of women who box by following a fairly standard sports melodrama
story line: We see a lot of hard training, a few triumphs and
setbacks, all on the way to the big fight at the end. Reviewed by
A.O. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   FAITHLESS-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here's an unsettling thought:
The hardest lessons we learn in life (and maybe the only lessons we
truly absorb) are those learned too late. It is precisely this
sense of nagging regret and the compulsion to comb obsessively over
decisions we can't undo that haunts the characters in Liv Ullmann's
morose and profound film, ``Faithless.'' Reviewed by Stephen
Holden.

UNTANGLING `URBANIA' A CHORE WITH REWARDS ALONG THE WAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Urbania'' takes place in a dark and gloomy New York City where
something weird seems to be going on. Charlie (Dan Futterman), a
gay West Villager, is searching for a particular man. He goes to
the bar where the man is said to be a regular _ but he isn't there.
So Charlie heads out into the night where he has all sorts of
unusual encounters _ with a bisexual soap opera actor (Gabriel
Olds), an old friend who is dying of AIDS (Alan Cumming), and the
straight guy who lives in the apartment above his (Bill Sage).
Along the way, there are also some cryptic flashbacks _ to a
boyfriend (Matt Keeslar) Charlie seems to have once had, and to
some violent encounter involving a bunch of leather-jacket-clad
men.
</P>
<P>
   What's it all mean? The fun of these sorts of movies (think of
Quentin Tarantino's ``Reservoir Dogs'') is in piecing together what
bizarre thing has happened to justify all the erratic behavior on
display. The problem with them (Neil Jordan's
brilliant-but-maddening ``The Miracle'' comes to mind) is that when
the final twist turns out to be not quite the earth-shattering
revelation you were hoping for, the entire movie starts to seem
like much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The concluding scenes of ``Urbania'' aren't quite that bad, but
they are a letdown. (As the film drags on into a sentimental
denouement set in a blindingly white apartment that I think is
supposed to be heaven, they also prove painfully mawkish.) The
director, Jon Shear, makes another mistake by stringing a
distracting and unnecessary subplot about urban legends through the
movie. (By the way, can we place a moratorium on the one _ also
seen in last week's ``Urban Legends: Final Cut'' _ about the person
who has sex with a stranger and then finds that his or her kidneys
have been removed?)
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ``Urbania,'' shot in dark blues and blacks on super 16,
and then blown up digitally to 35mm, has style to burn. The large
ensemble cast is uniformly compelling. And there's one scene that
offers the most convincing portrait of homosexual seduction I've
seen since Gregg Araki's 1992 ``The Living End'' _ with Charlie
going up to the soap opera actor's apartment, and the two of them
acting out an uncommonly menacing (and ultimately disastrous)
erotic ``pas de deux.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when gay cinema is defined by candy-colored,
empty-headed cartoons about the beautiful and self-obsessed
(''Trick,'' ``Kiss Me,'' ``Guido''), such achievements should not
be taken lightly.

MINNIE DRIVER PLAYS UNPLEASANT CHARACTER IN `BEAUTIFUL'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minnie Driver has made a career of playing likable, plucky
women, in movies as diverse as 1995's ``Circle of Friends'' and
this year's ``Return to Me.'' Actors get bored, though, and it's
easy to understand their attempts to stretch or to resist being
pigeonholed by playing against type.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Beautiful,'' Driver overdoes it as Mona, a perpetual
beauty-pageant contestant whose attractive exterior masks a
self-absorbed and misanthropic interior. Actually, that might not
be totally fair to Driver, who plays the role passionately _ it's
really writer Jon Bernstein who overdoes it, by making Mona's
desire to win border on the sociopathic. Either way, she's such an
unpleasant character that only the most tolerant will be able to
embrace her.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein tries to justify Mona's behavior by contriving a bad
upbringing for her; her mother belittles Mona's frequent
beauty-pageant entries, and her stepfather appears to want to crawl
into bed with her. But the early scenes, with Colleen Rennison as a
12-year-old Mona, already portray her as so obnoxious that you may
find yourself siding with her mom. It's also curious how the movie
includes the sleazy near-molestation scene, only to never broach
the subject again.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of an unsupportive mother comes up again when Mona
gets pregnant and has her best friend (Joey Lauren Adams) adopt the
child (''Pepsi Girl'' Hallie Kate Eisenberg) because motherhood
would make Mona ineligible to enter beauty pageants (considering
how inconsequential men are to this movie, perhaps Mona should have
scored points by saying it was a virgin birth). The movie then
hinges on whether Mona will acknowledge that she's the real mom.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Sally Field makes her feature-directing debut with
``Beautiful,'' and it's an interesting choice for an actress who
had to win an Emmy and two Oscars before she believed that her
peers liked her. Field never finds a consistent tone, although the
movie is generally either irritating or cloying. It's usually the
latter during the soppy beauty-pageant finale, which seems to play
out in real time and results in a ``surprise'' ending that won't
fool anyone. And the overriding idea _ that beautiful people can be
very mean and that plain-looking ones can be very nice _ is both
familiar and shallow.

MICROSOFT SERVES UP SOME SPAM OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes I feel like that ape in the beginning of the movie
``2001.'' There he is, starving amidst a pile of animal bones. He's
so stupid that it takes a singing black slab from outer space to
make him grab a tibia and go kill something. Couldn't he just
figure it out on his own?
</P>
<P>
   I felt that way this week as I read of the latest outrage
involving unwanted e-mail, better known as spam. I am, of course,
opposed to it. And so, ostensibly, is Microsoft Corp, which has
built antispam features into its e-mail software and its Web-based
Hotmail service.
</P>
<P>
   This makes me wonder why Microsoft is presently engaged in a
massive spam campaign of its own, one that features the unwitting
participation of many Internet users. But I'm even more puzzled by
the fact that evidence of the outrage landed in my lap, and I
ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, I installed the preview version of the new
Explorer software for Microsoft's MSN online service. Basically,
Microsoft has customized its Internet Explorer browser with
specialized links that mimic the features found on America Online.
It's a pretty good job. MSN Explorer's extra clutter isn't to my
taste, but newbies may find it congenial.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after installing the MSN software, I was invited to
click a check box that would have sent e-mails to my friends to
announce the joyous event. This should have got me thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I did what I almost always do when installing Internet
software. I clicked ``no thanks'' and forgot all about it.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, not every user of the new software was so cautious. That's
why I received an e-mail last week from a reader who was hopping
mad about getting an unsolicited advertisement from Microsoft, sent
to him by some guy he'd never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   The reader fired off a complaint to Microsoft, and got this
reply: ``When a user installs MSN Explorer, they have the option of
sending an e-mail from MSN Explorer to invite you to use the
program. This is not an advertisement or commercial e-mail sent to
solicit information from you by MSN _ it is only an invitation sent
by an individual member to try the new product.''
</P>
<P>
   This didn't satisfy the reader, but incredibly, it satisfied me.
Here's my response: ``Well, that's not quite spam, is it? Maybe
it's a questionable tactic, but it was sent by someone you
presumably know.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof positive that too much e-mail makes you stupid. Had I not
been so swamped with the stuff, I might have put two and two
together.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I'd written quite a bit on the Melissa computer virus
_ the one that automatically sent copies of itself to every e-mail
address on a victim's computer. Melissa, you'll recall, only
affected users of Microsoft's e-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   So I had all of the pieces of the puzzle, and only needed to
snap them together. I didn't. But others did, and by Wednesday
morning it was the talk of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the MSN software, unless you tell it otherwise,
will check to see if your computer has a copy of Microsoft's
Outlook Express e-mail program. If it's there, the software then
checks the program's address book, scoops up all of the e-mail
addresses contained therein, and sends them an ``invitation'' to
join MSN. This invitation is, of course, signed by you.
</P>
<P>
   If I hadn't clicked the ``don't you dare'' box while installing
MSN Explorer, I'd have sent this warm, personal invitation to 2,290
of my nearest and dearest friends. That's how many names are in my
Outlook Express address book. These are mostly tech-industry types
who'd have held me in even lower regard than they already do once
this personalized spam arrived. For spam is exactly what this is,
and of a particularly insidious kind.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, MSN Explorer asks for permission before cranking out
the mail. But how many users realize that they'll be sending
advertisements for Microsoft? How many understand that they're
sending these ads to their bosses, their bookies, their best
customers _ everybody?
</P>
<P>
   I understand that Microsoft is frustrated; MSN has 3 million
users to AOL's 24 million. But I never thought they'd stoop to the
favorite market tool of Internet pornographers. Somebody at MSN had
a brainstorm, but then failed to think it through. I guess we need
a couple more of those black slabs. Put one in the MSN marketing
department, and the other next to my desk.

<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ Dean Mallis is cold.
</P>
<P>
   His 65-pound frame writhes beneath a gray blanket. Empty milk
cartons are strewn on the floor of his cell. He nuzzles his face
into a gray plastic mattress, which is smeared with blood.
</P>
<P>
   A door clangs in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut up!'' he screams back.
</P>
<P>
   Mallis, 26, has late-stage AIDS. He will die soon. Of this,
there is no doubt. He is being held in the Cumberland County Jail
on charges of sexually abusing a mentally retarded man. But despite
his itinerant, sociopathic past, practically no one here _ not
local police, corrections officials, lawyers or doctors _ believes
he should die in this jail. He should be in a hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains behind bars, slowly dying.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely web of legal circumstances has left him stranded in
jail. Typically, dying inmates are taken to hospices or nursing
homes or hospitals. Many prisons have them in house. To a large
degree, the modern American penal system has come to embrace the
idea of death with dignity, no matter how distasteful the criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But Mallis, a lifelong drifter with no address and no family
support, is the exception. He continues to lie in his cell, fixated
on his slow descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you call a dying spot,'' he said in an interview
in his dank isolation cell.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Maine court system has essentially given up on trying
him, the judge in the case won't set bail because of Mallis's
history of violence. And Mallis has downright frightened officials
since his jailing in July: Almost daily, he would jab his arms with
pencils or gouge his thighs and try to smear deputies with his
HIV-infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Maine law prohibits the judge from sending him to a
hospital until a doctor confirms he is close to death. But the
state says it has been unable to find a doctor willing to examine
him. So, Mallis stays where he is.
</P>
<P>
   The case has saddened and frustrated everyone involved. Some
have been transformed: a handful of tough-talking sheriff's
deputies have become like gentle, doting nurses, laboring to
provide their patient with minimal comfort despite the abuse he
heaps on them.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Dean Mallis's dilemma has left them all wondering
how a man's life could turn out so pitifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a human being,'' says deputy Ben Smith. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one touches Mallis anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A recent visitor had to don rubber gloves, goggles, a surgical
mask and a full-body smock before entering his cell. Aside from a
few deputies, who take similar precautions, no one is allowed in
his cell, not even his only supporter, Donald Goudreau, 58,
Mallis's lover of seven years.
</P>
<P>
   How are you feeling?
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible. Like always,'' he said. ``I'll probably die. I don't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallis's speech is more a mumble, his words interrupted by blood
and phlegm. No one is sure what he is dying of. HIV has decimated
his immune system but, because he has not been properly examined
and diagnosed, the infection killing him is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sick for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Mallis was at one time prescribed
a daily regimen of 35 protease inhibitor pills, the so-called AIDS
cocktail that has increased the life expectancy of many people with
HIV. But he refused to take the pills, according to the documents
and Goudreau.
</P>
<P>
   He has told Goudreau he was infected with HIV at age 6. He has
also said he was abandoned by family at the same age. No one is
really sure.
</P>
<P>
   Mallis's body is covered with lesions. He can only consume milk,
ice cream and, occasionally, junk food. When he was first jailed in
July he weighed 120 pounds. Now he may be just over half that.
</P>
<P>
   He can barely muster the strength to reach the silver metal
toilet on the wall of his cell, often relieving himself on the bed.
He has a chronic cough, sleeplessness and severe joint and muscle
pain, he said. He gets irregular doses of painkillers or sleeping
pills from the jail's small infirmary. No one is sure when he will
die, though most who care for him predict Mallis has but weeks
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be in a hospital. No doubt about it,'' said Smith,
who is charged with cleaning Mallis's cell twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The isolation cell is long and narrow, with gray cinder block
walls, a cold tile floor, and a thin window. Mallis's mattress is
in one corner, a toilet in another. A few hours after the cell is
cleaned, it is stained with blood, spit, urine and food again, said
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Mallis said he wants to die at his ``friend's house.'' But
Goudreau said he cannot care for Mallis. Goudreau said he would
check him into a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mallis now assumes he will die alone in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't nothing anybody can do about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his mind has gone blank. He barely recalls his family.
He does not reflect on his life, though he said he has no regrets.
He does not think of God or an afterlife or anything remotely
spiritual. He is not sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Past is unclear &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not much is known about Mallis's life. He attended the Harbor
School in Newbury for emotionally troubled children, according to
the school's records, though the school would not specify when.
</P>
<P>
   Mallis and Goudreau hooked up seven years ago, after Goudreau's
former lover died of AIDS. They met in a restaurant, when Mallis
was 19. The two lived in a series of motels. Mallis's address on
court papers is listed as ``transient.''
</P>
<P>
   Goudreau said Mallis enjoyed watching football and wrestling,
listening to hard rock music, and especially cruising around in
Goudreau's car.
</P>
<P>
   But Mallis's court record reveals a far more volatile
personality.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he had a brief affair with a 69-year-old man in
Haverhill. A month after they moved in together, Mallis attacked
the man with a glass shard, stabbing him twice in the back and
breaking his nose, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Then, standing over the wounded older man, Mallis tortured the
man's seven cats to death, one by one, depositing the carcasses on
his terrified victim, said police.
</P>
<P>
   Attempted murder charges against him were dropped, and he spent
4 1/2 months in a Massachusetts jail for assault and cruelty to
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year came another violent outburst. Mallis was
charged with holding a mentally retarded 40-year-old drifter
hostage in a Kennebunk motel for nine days. There, he allegedly
repeatedly sexually assaulted the man, poured salad dressing on
him, and beat him with kitchen utensils, according to police. The
older man escaped and was found nervously jabbering to himself in
the motel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Mallis was released on a reduced bail of $500, on charges of
reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon, aggravated assault,
unlawful sexual conduct and two charges of gross sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he was found with knives while on a joyride. He was
arrested again. And again he was released, on the condition that he
find a permanent place to live and stay there unless he needed to
visit a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   He did none of this. Instead, one day, he allegedly showed up at
the AIDS Project, a counseling center in Portland, screaming
obscenities and threatening counselors. He was arrested again.
Frightened employees at the AIDS Project told police that Mallis
frequently harassed them, on occasion rubbing his bleeding sores on
their office equipment, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   He has been in jail since then. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
His last hope &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mallis's original trial date, in August, was postponed after he
threatened to bite or spit on court employees. York County Superior
Court Judge Andre Janelle indefinitely put off the case. Given his
declining health, the case will probably never come to trial, said
Mallis's court-appointed lawyer James R. Bushell.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Mallis's history of troublemaking, the judge
overseeing his case refuses to grant bail in order for him to be
sent to a hospital or nursing home. A second option would be to
declare him a public menace, in which case the Maine Department of
Human Services can take custody of him. Last week, it refused to do
so. The judge and DHS have not explained their reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   The only other option is to convince the judge that Mallis is
close to death. In that case, Maine law would allow him to be
transferred to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need is a definitive, authoritative opinion saying,
`This man is so ill that it's a crime to keep him in jail,' '' said
Bushell.
</P>
<P>
   Bushell requested that DHS find an AIDS specialist to examine
Mallis. Last week, the agency said it was unable to.
</P>
<P>
   Bushell is attempting to get permission to have Mallis checked
out in early October at a once-a-week AIDS clinic run at the nearby
Maine Medical Center. This is Mallis's last hope for release.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have come together and we can't seem to find a
way out of this,'' said Bushell. ``But I'd like to see him in a
hospice or a home dying with some dignity rather than all by
himself in a dark, dingy jail cell.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' is ugly. Much of that is intentional and, I guess,
for the extended amount of screen time that star Minnie Driver and
director Sally Field (yes, that Sally Field) immerse us in the life
of the least likable woman on Earth, their film deserves some kind
of admiration for sticking to its sour guns for so long.
</P>
<P>
   But it even cops out on the studied distastefulness in the end,
resulting in one of the most morally bankrupt conclusions in modern
cinema (and that's pretty bankrupt indeed). Aside from that,
``Beautiful'' is plain old creepy from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   But this tone deaf, halfhearted lampoon of beauty
pageantry-cum-misfired protest against our superficial glamour
culture has a bigger problem than any of that. It just isn't
emotionally persuasive for a second.
</P>
<P>
   We meet the insufferable Mona at age 12 (played by Colleen
Rennison), already obsessed with transcending her white trash
background via beauty contests. Though no natural cutie and
severely fashion-impaired, her single-minded determination seems
somewhat admirable, even if it does get her ripped off by a shady
consultant (Kathleen Turner in a throwaway cameo). When she makes
friends with Ruby, a dorky new girl at school, you even think that
Mona, however skewed her priorities, has some redeeming qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Once Driver takes over the role, though, the hope of any virtue
not normally associated with polished steel is quickly dashed. She
only befriended Ruby (played as a teen and adult by the always
winsome Joey Lauren Adams) because the girl could sew, and Mona
somehow sensed she was also the ultimate, enabling doormat. While
our self-made beauty goes about sabotaging her equally vicious (and
stereotypical) fellow contestants, Ruby supports their household
with a nursing job and, of course, makes all of her roommate's
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Most startlingly, Ruby pretends she's the mother of Mona's
illegitimate daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg, that
blues-beltin' Pepsi commercial kid). Most ridiculously, Mona,
between staging fake good works and endlessly strategizing her big
jump from small-town Illinois pageants to a national contest, lets
nary a sentiment slip over, despite years of living with the child
she won't acknowledge (``contest rules'' provide the thin
justification, if you were wondering).
</P>
<P>
   Now, we all know that some women are capable of abandoning their
children, that others can hate their children, and that in more
judgmental eras some have given up the tasks and title of mother
due to social and family pressures. But to live with your kid and
pretend she's not your own without a single regret or a second
thought (until, at the 11th hour, the plot requires it)? Can't buy
it for any price.

<P>
   The credited screenwriter, Jon Berstein, at least realized that
Mona's need for a tiara wasn't enough to hang a whole screenplay
on. So a murder charge is trumped up against -- who else? --
good-hearted Ruby, a vengeful TV talker (Leslie Stefanson) goes out
of her way to get the embarrassing goods on Mona, and there's even
a last-minute attempt to show the pageant process some respect as a
questionable engine of class mobility. But Field, who seems
determined more than anything to bury her ``You really like me!''
gushiness with this movie, flubs every potentially meaningful
moment.
</P>
<P>
   As for Driver, whose company co-produced ``Beautiful,'' she
gives a technically impressive and effectively scary performance.
But then, so does the Terminator -- and he was more interesting in
the second movie, when he was programmed to process at least
rudimentary human feelings. &QL;

THE WAGON YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE WANTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that eternal question we all face: When do we give up
living for the box?
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not talking life and death. I'm talking finally having
to sell that sporty two-seater or the zippy sedan for a station
wagon that will, with practicality, haul all that we have
accumulated in life _ outdoor gear, kids, pets or, dare it be
spoken, grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has just made the transition easier, though describing it
in a phrase is difficult. Has Volvo been taken out of the box, or
has the box been taken out of Volvo?
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 V70 T5 wagon, you see, is a rounded, gentle automobile
with the hauling capacity _ spacewise and powerwise _ of some
thumping SUVs. It remains rock solid in construction, but soft
exterior lines and a plush interior erase the stereotype of a
pipe-smoking, bearded gent driving a stiff but sensible box from
campus to chautauqua.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great car for the youthful (we're purposely not saying
young here) driver, offering that certain je ne c'est quoi that
says, ``Hey, I'm not old yet. Watch this baby go.''
</P>
<P>
   So fill it with your mountain climbing gear, your tents, your
fishing poles, your soccer balls, your weekend lumber. Cover its
roof with mountain bikes and kayaks. Fill its seats and cargo space
with toddlers and their diapers. Then kick back and enjoy the
sporty ride.
</P>
<P>
   That comes from the 2.3-liter 247-horsepower, inline 5-cylinder
turbocharged engine _ one of three engine options on the V70 _ that
delivers more bang than you'd expect in a station wagon, and more
than you'll find in a lot of sedans. The other engines are a
2.4-liter light-pressure turbo delivering 197 horses and a normally
aspirated 170-horse unit for those seeking the environmental high
ground with an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Enter this wonderfully rounded wagon, knowing that power will be
there for you whatever your load, and settle into the front leather
bucket seats. Legroom in vast, headroom the same, and the seats
themselves are armchair comfortable, but with stiff support up the
sides for those lateral challenges you'll face when you feel a
little sporty.
</P>
<P>
   It's billed as a five-passenger car (an optional third bench can
be installed in the rear cargo area), but more practically seats
four adults, given the hump in the middle of the rear bench seat.
Passengers back there will find good head- and legroom as well.
</P>
<P>
   This is a well-thought-out car. It has big buttons for climate
and sound control. Bins in the doors are divided into
subcompartments. The center console has two storage layers. The
glove box is divided. There are two pockets layered into the rear
of each of the front seats. And in the rear, folding out of the
floor of the cargo area, rises a grocery bag holder, winged,
netted, and bungeed to keep that yogurt and fruit from flying about
if you're feeling sporty even on the way home from shopping.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable thing about the Volvo is that, even though shorter
than European counterparts _ BMW 5 Series, the BMW X5, the Saab
9-6, or even Ford's Taurus, its cargo space is vast. Nearly 40
cubic feet behind the front seats. More than 70 cubic feet with
those seats folded down. If a full-blown, big SUV is not the car
for your, this Volvo may be. It's front-wheel drive, but if you
want it in all-wheel drive, there's the Cross Country version
hitting the market.
</P>
<P>
   Given its hauling capacity, if you plan to fill it up with
family and gear and go, you'll appreciate the turbo-charged engine.
The light-pressure turbo will give you boost when needed and you
may never even notice when it kicks in. It will likely be that
subtle. The regular turbo, this T5 was also subtle in activation,
yet distinct when the power kicked in. Aided by continuously
variable valve timing, it provided torque across a wide band of
RPMs (though the first few seconds of acceleration from a dead stop
are nothing special). But the latter is not what we're looking for
here. Solid power is, however, and the Volvo delivers that in
abundance, even while managing just over 20 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The ride can be a bit stiff, but given that you'll likely be
carrying big loads and you're handling all that power into corners,
that is a good thing. You don't need boaty body roll and dip in a
rig like this. Wouldn't want those bikes and kayaks swaying atop
the car in your pursuit of youthful exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension keeping it all in line has independent struts,
coil springs, and antiroll bar up front, and, at the rear, fully
independent multilink, also with coil springs and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Stability control _ limiting torque to spinning wheels _ and
enhanced ABS add to safer control.
</P>
<P>
   And this being Volvo, it is, of course, still built like a steel
box, with unit body construction, and airbags all around _ front,
side, and head airbags (with whiplash protection) and curtain bags
in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   This Volvo is part of a broad revolution taking place in the
auto industry today.
</P>
<P>
   Station wagons are becoming more SUV-like even as manufacturers
introduce new SUVs that address the complaints of those who say the
big beasts are dangerous, environmentally unfriendly, even
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to watch those lines blur over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we'll watch cars like the Volvo V70, the
Beemers, the Saabs, and others roam the highways offering some of
the best features of each.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch
</P>
<P>
   --The positioning of vents in the center door posts. What a fine
use of hollow, dead space. Each outer rear passenger can now direct
air flow from a shoulder-high opening.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance
</P>
<P>
   --Placement of the cell phone jack to the right of the center
console. If you're plugged in, you'll find the cord continually
getting snagged on the shifter.

 MANY MEN FINDING YOGA NOT JUST FOR WOMEN ANYMORE

<P>
   Maybe the guys finally noticed that celebrities like Kareem
Abdul-Jabber, John McEnroe and Sting were doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it's because more mainstream health clubs began
offering it alongside aerobics and Nautilus, and dropped some of
the chanting and incense-burning that aliened those who think
sweat, not spiritualism, defines a good workout.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, yoga is showing a more masculine side these
days. Men almost equal women in some classes and more strenuous
forms of yoga _ often dubbed Power Yoga as opposed to its Sanskrit
name, Ashtanga Yoga _ are soaring in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jock mentality gets put off by all the funny-sounding
names and Eastern baggage,'' said Michael Preston, a yoga teacher
at the Mt. Auburn Athletic Club in Watertown, Mass. for the past 10
years. ``But it's all changing. Yoga is becoming more mainstream
for men.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoga's reputation as a New Age feminine haven is being
challenged by an influx of middle-age male enthusiasts, recently
humbled into realizing they don't have the body of a 20-year-old.
Even younger men, often more open to Eastern-style pursuits, are
crediting yoga with giving them the agility and strength to improve
their overall athletic life _ and incidentally too, a more relaxed
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Maca, 35, said he is a better hiker and surfer because of
yoga, and he has gone far beyond caring if yoga has any public
relations woes in the male world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem if people think this is a girlie thing,'' he
said while at the Baptiste Power Yoga Institute in Cambridge,
Mass., owned by the celebrity yoga teacher, Baron Baptiste.
</P>
<P>
   So mainstream has yoga become that many men are quick to say
it's a great way to meet women, and they give exaggerated sighs of
disappointment that hordes of men now carry yoga mats.
</P>
<P>
   Construction worker Patrick McAuliffe, 45, says co-workers give
him ``funny looks'' when he takes off his hard hat and boots to
attend yoga classes. But he wonders if yoga's benefits aren't
becoming clear on the job: McAuliffe said his back is usually agile
and pain-free when lifting heavy objects, ``while the younger
workers are full of aches.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ramani Rangan, a yoga teacher for more than 20 years, said
yoga may have an image problem that crosses both genders, as many
women also scoff at an activity that can often seem cult-like.
Voice-mail greetings at some yoga centers begin with ``Namaste,'' a
Sanskrit greeting that refers to a person's internal light greeting
another person's internal light.
</P>
<P>
   While national data is scarce, it's clear Americans are flocking
to yoga in great numbers. About 10 million people participated in
yoga at least a few times each week in 1998, about double the
number in 1994, according to Yoga Journal, a trade journal for yoga
centers.
</P>
<P>
   And men appear to be the fastest growing audience for yoga. In
1994, women _ mostly urban educated females _ represented 80
percent of yoga students. Men made up about 20 percent of classes
back then, but instructors today say the male numbers have gone up
dramatically, and some classes, particularly at health clubs, have
a nearly even male-female split.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kennedy, a physical therapist at the Boston Athletic
Club, said middle-aged men _ careful to avoid the Sensitive Male
image many of them ridicule _ will often reluctantly try yoga if
it's presented as a clinical referral of sorts, a form of physical
therapy to help an ailing back or torn tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys want me to tell the yoga teacher that they're there
for a bad back,'' said Kennedy. ``It's like, `I'm only in this
class because my physical therapist made me go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kennedy said, these men get hooked on the physical and
mental benefits of this 5,000-year-old tradition from India.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga's benefits come at all ages, but physicians say adults
beyond age 30 may be helped the most because that's when they often
begin to notice the tightening of their tendons, ligaments and
muscles near their joints. The muscle tightening has largely to do
with the inactivity of adults as they get busy with jobs and
families, but also the natural loss of flexibility in supporting
tissues, just as elasticity is lost in aging skin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helene Feiler, a physician who specializes in sports
medicine, said yoga and other stretching exercises may help reverse
the tightening process that can lead to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Celtics athletic trainer Ed Lacerte said he recalled that
legendary center Robert Parish credited Eastern-style exercise,
such as tai chi, with giving him the flexiblity to stay in the game
so long. Lacerte said today's Celtics players don't seem to have an
interest in these pursuits, but ``any way you get variety'' in
stretching is a good thing for any athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Winning men over to yoga hasn't been easy. Paula Kout, a yoga
teacher hired in October 1997 by then-Chicago Bulls coach Phil
Jackson to instruct the team, confronted the male skepticism on her
first day on the job. ``It was like being in a room full of
13-year-old adolescents,'' she recalled, noting that some were
there only because Jackson threatened to fine them otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Kout said any time she would do a ``correction'' on a player,
such as touch their legs or hips to adjust a position, there would
be a roar of laughter from the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to give yoga a more mainstream feel has also been a goal
at the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Lenox, Mass., the
country's largest yoga center with about 20,000 visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Foust, its curriculum director, said in the past year,
the center has introduced new courses such as Yoga and Golf, Yoga
and Skiing, as well as Yoga and Canoeing, all of which appeal
largely to men.
</P>
<P>
   He said they are also more sensitive to the fact that yoga terms
can seem particularly alien to many Americans. For instance, the
Sanskrit term ``ujjayi'' refers to one of the main breathing
techniques in yoga. Now, he said, many teachers refer to them as
``centering breaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Few were more skeptical about yoga than Don Murray, 65, the
retired president of the union representing the Boston police
officers. He said it seemed like a passive activity meant for women
who like to meditate.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray now refers to himself playfully as a ``disciple'' of
yoga, after getting hooked in his first class three years ago at
his health club. He said yoga explains why he maintains his lean
frame of 5-feet, 11-inch and 168 pounds and runs the Boston
Marathon year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone are the days when I just put my leg on a fence, bent over
and that was my stretching,'' he said.

ASKING ABOUT GUNS NEED NOT BE RUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the fourth week of school and your first-grader has an
invitation to play with a new friend. For the first time, you don't
know the parents of a playmate. Are you going to ask, ``Is there a
gun in your home?''
</P>
<P>
   This was once a subject that rarely made a parent's radar
screen. For most of us, Columbine changed that. For Laura Hill of
Wellesley, Mass., it was something closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, a mother and daughter attending a recital in the
middle school auditorium found a loaded gun lodged in one of the
seats. It had been dropped by a Town Meeting member nearly a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Wellesley, I never thought about people owning guns
or that my child might be at a home where there was a gun. Now it's
not so easy to dismiss,'' said Hill, who has three children, ages
7, 5, and 1. Still, she has never asked a parent if there are guns
in his or her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels rude,'' she said. ``It's awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Price of Manchester, Md., has a sobering retort: ``It may
be uncomfortable to ask that question, but it's a lot more
uncomfortable to pick out a casket for your child.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, she knows firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, her 13-year-old son, John, was shot in the head
when he was playing at a neighbor's house. The 9-year-old brother
of his friend had brought out his father's gun and playfully put it
to John's head. When police searched the house, they found 10 other
guns, all legal but all easily accessible. Some, like the one that
killed John, were loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been neighbors for five years, our kids were friends,
but I never knew they kept guns,'' said Price. When John went to
the neighbor's that day, she had called to make sure they weren't
watching an R-rated video. It never occurred to her to ask about
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safe, middle-class neighborhood,'' she said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's OK to ask &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As honorary chairwoman of a national public service campaign
called ASK (Asking Saves Kids), Price hopes to normalize asking the
one question that would have saved her son's life: ``Do you have
guns in your home?'' Launched three weeks ago, the campaign is
co-sponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics and PAX, a
national movement to end gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't know for sure what's inside someone else's home, not
even a close friend's, unless you ask,'' said PAX founder Dan
Gross. He usually convinces skeptical parents about the value of
ASK when he presents this chilling statistic: 40 percent of
American households with children have guns, and 40 percent of
those guns are unlocked and loaded.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't disagree with Hill, however, that it can feel rude to
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the politics that surround this issue,'' Gross
said. ``In fact, it has nothing to do with politics. This is a
preventative safety measure, no different than making sure your
kids don't run out into the street.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier if you preface it by saying, ``I don't mean to
offend you, but I have a few safety questions I ask before my child
plays somewhere for the first time,'' said Carol Silverman
Saunders, author of ``Safe at School'' (St. Martin's).
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a red flag if a parent is defensive, offended, or
refuses to answer, said Saunders. Six years ago, when her son was
8, he came home one day saying his playmate had shown him his
father's gun. When she called, the mother said, ``This is private
family business.'' Saunders's son hasn't played there since (the
playmate is welcome at her house), and Saunders now asks about guns
when her son goes to someone's home for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   If a family says they do have guns, parents have two choices,
said Gross: politely decline the playdate (``I'm sorry, but this
makes me nervous.'') or ask about safety precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to hear,'' he said, ``is that guns are locked
and stored separately from ammunition and that children don't know
where the key is kept.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not an issue only for parents of young children. When it
comes to guns, children of every age have unique developmental
characteristics that contribute to risk, said pediatrician Howard
Spivak, chief of pediatric and adolescent medicine at the Floating
Hospital for Children at New England Medical Center in Boston. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   2- to 7-year-olds are innately curious. Not only would they be
drawn to a gun lying around but they also are uninhibited to the
point of being nosy. ``I'm never surprised to hear about a
3-year-old who opens drawers or pokes into closets, even in someone
else's house,'' Spivak said. That puts them at a high risk for
stumbling onto a handgun. In the course of regular office visits,
he always asks parents if there are guns in the home and urges them
to ask about guns at playmates' homes. As chairman of the American
Academy of Pediatrics' taskforce on violence, he urged the
organization to co-sponsor ASK.
</P>
<P>
   8- to 11-year-olds often are either in too much of a hurry or
not able to think through consequences, but they are very anxious
to imitate older kids in an effort to be more grown up. In a
culture that glamorizes gun violence, that's a dangerous
combination, said Spivak. ``A 9-year-old who knows his father keeps
a gun and knows he isn't supposed to touch it _ in fact, can tell
you he isn't supposed to touch it _ can still march over to it and
pick it up to show off to an older friend he admires,'' Spivak
said. Price speculates that's what happened the day her son died.
</P>
<P>
   12- to 15-year-olds typically crave adventure. ``It's a time for
lots of experimentation,'' said researcher Margaret Sagarese,
co-author of ``Parenting 911, How to Safeguard and Rescue Your 10-
to 15-Year-Old'' (Broadway Books). All it takes is a little
prodding from a more adventuresome peer for the child you always
trusted to search the house for the key to the gun rack, either to
prove he's not a wimp or because he (or his friend) is drawn to
dangerous activities. ``The drive to belong is so powerful that it
will override good judgment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an age when we tend to leave a child and friend
home alone together, Sagarese urged parents to ask many questions
of each other at the start of a school year and the first time new
friends hang out together. She calls it teen-proofing. For
instance: Do you keep your liquor locked? Do you monitor Internet
use? Do you keep keys to extra cars hidden?
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, your 13- to 17-year-old won't like you asking
these questions. ``He'll accuse you of not trusting him, of being
the `only' parent who calls other parents, of being over-protective
and embarrassing him,'' said Sagarese.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the line of reasoning she takes with her own children:
``My job is to take care of your life. I have to know if parents
have guns/alcohol etc. not because I don't trust you but because I
want to prevent you from having a confrontation with friends whose
judgment might not be as good as yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said that responsible gun-owners rarely take offense at
questions from other parents.
</P>
<P>
   Mary (she does not want her name used), also of Wellesley,
agreed. She has three young children and a husband who hunts. His
shotguns are kept in a locked safe in an alarmed room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be offended if someone asked (if we had guns)?'' she
asked. ``Absolutely not. I understand the motivation and I welcome
the chance to show people how careful we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also absolutely will ask the question of other parents as my
children get older. I know how real a possibility it is, that
someone might have guns. I also know that not everyone is as safe
about them as we are.'' &QL;

LANDSCAPING CAN HELP YOUR PROPERTY VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to landscaping, most true gardeners think concerns
about resale value are beside the point, like asking a fly
fisherman how much he can get per pound for his trout.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, gardens should never be sold. They should be inherited
and passed down, or endowed and open to the public. Or they should
die with the gardener, who never gets sent away to a nursing home,
but instead gets to enjoy her leafy paradise until the last mortal
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in modern suburbia, it's usually not that way. Homes
are investment commodities that do double duty as family shelters.
Even people who are deeply attached to their homes are watching
skyrocketing sales prices and thinking about cashing out and
retiring to the Bahamas on the profit. Before then, most have a
little bit of landscape tweaking to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sprucing up big time,'' said Vinny Serino, owner of
Century 21 deAN Associates Real Estate of West Peabody, Mass. ``The
way the market is now, it's crazy, and everyone wants to get every
dollar they can out of their houses. A house in my neighborhood
just sold for high six figures, a record for the town, and the
seller hired a landscaper to come and freshen up the whole yard
with new plantings and new mulch in all the beds. I don't think he
spent over $1,000. It made the house look, `Wow!' ''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to cost much to make a yard more inviting to
buyers. In fact, it shouldn't. Homeowners who spent $438-$613
prepping their front and back yards for buyers increased their
sales prices by $1,106 to $1,807, a 177 percent return on their
landscaping investment, according to statistics from HomeGain
national real estate consultants. The houses also sold faster.
</P>
<P>
   If your concern is resale value, realtors say, focus on
perfecting the ``curb appeal'' of the front yard: Tidy things up,
have a great lawn, don't do anything idiosyncratic or out of
keeping with your neighborhood, and don't spend too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landscaping has more value in a higher-end property than a
lower-end property, say over $500,000,'' said Deirdre White, a real
estate broker and appraiser with Century 21 Carol White Associates
in Boston. ``But a lawn that's been taken care of is always one of
the top 10 home improvements that boost your yield with minimal
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The perfect front lawn is so crucial to making a positive first
impression on buyers, and so useless for anything else, that one
wonders if it was invented purely for the purpose of selling real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, don't buck the trend. Hire a lawn company to seed,
fertilize, and mow (frequently) until the sale is completed. (Now
is the time, even if, or especially if, you're not selling until
spring.) An automatic sprinkler system is expected these days for
high-end houses and will pay back its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse this kind of landscaping with gardening.
Landscaping is something you hire professionals to do to make your
land more attractive, usable, and saleable. Gardening, on the other
hand, is a do-it-yourself personal passion that seldom yields
financial dividends. Few buyers will reward you for your devotion
to your vegetable patch, no matter how great the soil, your good
taste in hostas, the expense of the cultivars, your zen approach
toward Japanese moss gardening, not even if you've gotten down on
your knees and weeded with tweezers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone bought a house and the backyard was filled with
fabulous irises the old owners had cultivated, and the new owners
gave them all away to the neighbors and roto-tilled them under to
make more play room for their kids,'' recalled Maureen Kelleher, a
sales and marketing coordinator realtor with Trust of New England,
Better Homes and Gardens in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a plant collector, put it in the sale agreement that
you're taking your favorites with you.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is trees. Everyone likes them, they require little
upkeep, and they're hard to kill. The most valuable kind you can
own, in appraisal terms, is a beech.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tie up $50,000 to $70,000 for one mature cutleaf,
purple leaf, or weeping beech,'' said tree broker Rick Henkel of
Princeton Horticultural Services in New Jersey, who locates large
sought-after trees for landscape architects up and down the coast.
``High-end residential people are looking for more and more
substantial-sized trees so they don't have to wait for them to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers like to see a nice flowering specimen tree on the
front lawn and a grove of mature trees at the rear of the property
creating a woodsy privacy screen, say realtors. Although a beech
will take a lifetime to mature, Henkel said there are some trees
that take hold quite rapidly and will be effective in two to five
years, such as sugar maples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or the swamp maple selections `Red Sunset' or `October Glory'
that have great fall colors,'' he said. ``Lindens do very well,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   For fast-growing flowering specimen trees, Henkel recommends
ornamental pears, though people have turned away from the Bradford
pear because of bad experiences with storm damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newer cultivars `Cleveland select' and `aristocrat' are
much better,'' he said. ``They grow fast, have spring flowers, and
fall foliage. So do cornus kousa, halesia, and oxydendrum. Crab
apples lost popularity because they got diseases, but there are now
excellent disease-resistant ones such as Donald Wyman. Cherry trees
are very popular. And magnolias _ oh, gosh _ you can't find large
ones, they're in such demand.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have much time and you need fast screening or tall
vertical accents in a sunny spot, try ornamental grasses such as
miscanthus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mature in one season but create a large, permanent
presence that looks good even in winter,'' said Wayne Mezitt,
president of Weston Nurseries in Hopkinton.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big bucks in landscaping, though, is spent on
``hardscaping'' rather than plants. Walkways and driveways,
terraces and walls, pergolas and garden houses, pools and patios
are all considered hardscaping. The more expensive the house, the
more of these features it is expected to have.
</P>
<P>
   People are also still in love with their cars, and most won't
fault a front yard that is dominated by a very large garage and
driveway, as long as both are in good condition. Aaron M. Adler,
president of Appraisals Unlimited in Brookline, Mass., warns,
however, that swimming pools are all wet as an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two houses on the same street in (Boston) recently sold at the
same price, even though one had a pool,'' Adler said. ``That's
because you only have three months out of 12 when you can use it
here, and some people don't like the hassle of maintenance. In
fact, some buyers just fill them in and forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers with young children usually prefer space devoted to
recreation rather than garden features if the property is small,
said Carol Brenner of Carol Brenner Realty in Newton, Mass. She
suggests vertical landscape accents: ``Decorative fencing for
privacy and aesthetic purposes always pays dividends no matter what
size lot you have. Decks are always beautiful and you can decorate
them with large pots of plants without sacrificing recreational
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher believes gardens, like kitchens, are important but
reach a point of diminishing returns if too much money is spent on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll get the same money back if you spend $40,000 on a
kitchen or $100,000,'' she said. ``I am a gardener and I encourage
all my owners to add wonderful landscaping. But when you put a lot
of money into landscaping, you do not necessarily get it back. In
the 21 years I've done this, I've never had anyone say to me, `I'm
more concerned about the garden than the house.' The house always
comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUICK FIXES FOR YOUR HOME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some quick, inexpensive fixes for the landscape headed
to market.
</P>
<P>
   --Keep it neat and tidy: This is the single most important
aspect, especially for the front yard. Keep lawns immaculate,
shrubs pruned, flower beds weeded and groomed. Replenish bark mulch
and make sure any landscaping plastic is completely hidden from
view. Remove eyesores such as dead tree limbs.
</P>
<P>
   --Outdoor lighting: Though open houses take place during the
day, many serious buyers cruise by at night to check out
neighborhood ambience. In addition to increasing security,
do-it-yourself outdoor lighting kits can create evening landscape
effects inexpensively. Placing a spotlight underneath a front yard
tree so it shines up through the branches is especially effective
in winter. Buyers like front lampposts, too. But don't use
tacky-looking lights along the front walk or illuminate your yard
like Fenway Park. Take your cue from surrounding front yards.
</P>
<P>
   --Color accents: Place clusters of large, attractive outdoor
pots of seasonal flowers around the entryway and at other strategic
spots on decks and patios. Many nurseries will plant pots for you.
Or buy plastic containers of tulips in the spring, annuals in the
summer, and mums in the fall that you can set inside your
decorative pots. Keep them watered and replace them immediately
when they are past their prime. Right now is a great time to add
harvest accents such as pumpkins to your front yard. In winter,
decorate the front of the house with an attractive door wreath and
window boxes filled with cut evergreens and berries.

&HT;     STUDY SAYS CALIFORNIA HOUSING SUPPLY TO REMAIN TIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's housing supply has lagged behind
the population influx from strong immigration and blazing job
growth, a problem that will be exacerbated in the next two decades,
according to a new forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration into California will approach the high levels of the
1980s, but the rate of home building is unlikely to keep pace,
according to the forecast by the University of California at Los
Angeles. Economists from the university study the long-term
economic trends for the state and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planners and the politicians and major watchdog groups
have to sit down and work it out, starting now,'' said UCLA
economist Rajeev Dhawan, the author of the report. ``Otherwise,
there's a chance that growth will fizzle. Quality of life issues
are so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing permits in California are expected to average 187,000
per year over the next 20 years, a much slower pace compared with
the economic boom of 1985 to 1990, when building permits averaged
245,000 annually, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall is all the more acute in the San Francisco Bay
Area, the epicenter of technology growth.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the Federal Home Finance Board show that home prices
for San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose in the second quarter of
the year averaged $389,000, or 98 percent higher than the national
average during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science to figure out the problem,'' said
Stephen Levy, executive director of the Center for the Continuing
Study of the California Economy, a think tank in Palo Alto. ``The
solution is to build more housing. It's the next biggest challenge;
it's not that somebody will invest in the next wave of technology
or that we'll go into recession.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing crunch is unlikely by itself to derail California's
growth, but could create a drag on the economy if high home prices
prompt residents to leave or dissuade newcomers from taking jobs
here, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Factors adding to the dilemma include a decline in housing
starts during the early 1990s recession, the strong fiscal
incentives for local governments that favor retail over housing
developments, and the growing income gap that allows wealthier
residents to bid up prices, said Dianne Spaulding, executive
director of the San Francisco-based Non-Profit Housing Association
of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck, fighting over the scraps, landlords and
tenants,'' said Gabriel Metcalf, deputy director of the San
Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR), a public
policy think tank. ``We need to get beyond zero-sum game and
increase housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting mismatch between supply and demand means many
people will have less living space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The luxury or dream of owning a three-bedroom house with a
yard, pool and two-car garage for a family of four is an American
icon that is coming under pressure even in land-rich states like
California,'' the UCLA report states.

VAPOR BARRIERS MAKE INSULATION EVEN BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insulatian is the cheapest thing you can install in your house
to make it the most comfortable at the least cost. Fiberglass or
cellulose, and in some cases rigid materials, do indeed save you
big heating bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the be-all and end-all of saving heat; it is
important to have a vapor barrier wherever you have insulation.
And, the rule continues, vapor barriers should face the heated part
of the house, not the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Much insulation has a paper backing. This is the vapor barrier.
Anovapor barrier is polyethylene plastic. Rigid insulation is also
a vapor barrier.
</P>
<P>
   A vapor barrier stops the loss of air from the house to the
outdoors, therefore saving heat and making the insulation much more
effective. It also keeps water vapor from escaping.
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good, but how do you get a vapor barrier in
an existing wall, or on the attic floor, or on the basement ceiling
where insulation is supposed to go?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy on the attic floor; just put in backed insulation,
with the paper facing down. For a basement ceiling, just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   If there is insulation already between the joists on the attic
floor, and there is no vapor barrier, the only way to install one
is to take out the old insulation, install new insulation with
paper backing, or install polyethylene plastic, then put back the
old insulation or put in new, unbacked insulation.
</P>
<P>
   If that seems like too much, then forget it. While a vapor
barrier is good, it is not essential. Besides, the ceilings of
rooms below are painted, and most paints are vapor barriers of
varying degrees of effectiveness, so you do have some protection
from loss of air. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Yes, but in the walls? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, here's the biggest question: What do you do about walls?
Where insulation is blown in in old houses, there is no vapor
barrier and it is impossible to install one without tearing out the
walls, and let's not get into that chore.
</P>
<P>
   Never fear. Most wall paints are vapor barriers, and so are
vinyl-coated wallpapers and Walltex-Type coverings.
</P>
<P>
   What if you make the house too tight with all those vapor
barriers? Couldn't vapor and other pollutants build up in the house
where it has no place to go?
</P>
<P>
   That is impossible in an old house. You can do a lot in an old
house, but you cannot tighten it up that much without taking it
apart and rebuilding it.
</P>
<P>
   New houses are another matter. They can be built so tight that
you save a bundle in heating and air conditioning, but pay the
price by too much water vapor and other pollutants indoors. Water
vapor is a big hazard because it can condense inside the house into
water, and mold can grow.
</P>
<P>
   Also, water vapor buildup can peel paint right off the outdoor
siding. That is a common problem in New England and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   So, builders have developed an air-to-air heat exchanger, which
ventilates the house, releasing the vapor and other pollutants,
without losing heat.
</P>
<P>
   That solved, there are a couple of other things to consider when
insulating the house and making it tight and comfortable and cheap
to heat. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Windows important, too &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of those things is windows, which can be a major heat loss.
Doors, reasonably tight and with storms, are less important because
they constitute such a small area (less than 5 percent) of your
house. The point is, there is less urgency to run out and buy one
or more steel insulated doors or any other kind.
</P>
<P>
   You may not have to run out to buy new windows, either. If your
ancient windows are weatherstripped, realatively tight and with
effecient storm windows, there is little need for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But if for any reason you want new windows, consider replacing
just the sash, the movable parts. In a double hung window, the
sashes are the two pieces that slide up and down. In a casement
window, the sash is that part of the window that opens like a door.
</P>
<P>
   Most replacement companies install just the sash, avoiding
removal of the frame and casing, which do not need replacing
anyway. This can be done reasonably, at $150 to $250 per window.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to go with even less investment is to replace storm
windows with efficient ones. Such storms cost abut $100 each;
anything less expensive is not very efficient. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ventilate the attic . . . &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, now you really are snug as the proverbial bug. Anything
else?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes: ventilation. It has nothing to do with keeping the
house warm and saving fuel, but does help reduce and prevent
condensation of moisture anywhere indoors or out. Condensation is
not good, and especially on insulation, because water can destroy
insulation very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The most important areas for ventilation are the attic and
basement, where vents can be installed. In the attic, the best
vents are ridge vents that go along the entire length of the roof
ridge, and soffit vents, continuous two-inch-wide vents going the
full length of all soffits. The soffits, of course, are the under
parts of the roof overhang. If there is no overhang, you can
install ventilated drip edges.
</P>
<P>
   These vents are better than powered fans, and do more than just
pull out excessive water vapor. They also keep the attic cool in
summer and can be a major prevention of the dreaded ice dams of
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Attic vents should be left open at all times. &QL; 
 &QL; 
. . . and the basement, too &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ventilating the basement is important in summer, to remove
excessive water vapor and eliminate that dank, musty smell we are
so familiar with. Keep windows open, screen and secure them from
forced entry. If there are no windows, install vents. They can be
left open from April to October, closed in winter.
</P>
<P>
   One more place where ventilation is important to eliminate
condensation, is in cathedral ceilings, and other areas where there
is no attic above the living space.
</P>
<P>
   The ventilation is provided by a one-inch-thick air space
between insulation of a cathedral ceiling and the roof. This air
space must have moving air, so there must be vents at the top and
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Most new houses with cathedral ceilings have this air space, so
it should be of no concern to the homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   If you are building or installing a cathedal ceiling in an old
house, the air space is not just desired, it is essential.
</P>
<P>
   OK, your work is cut out for you. Let's do it.

&HT;     CLIMBING THE LADDER MAY MEAN OVERTAKING THE BOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Peters knows exactly what he doesn't want
his epitaph to say: ``He woulda done some really cool stuff, but
his boss wouldn't let him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely believe that the biggest waste of time is selling
ideas up the chain of command,'' the best-selling business author
said recently. ``Anybody who ever made it into the history books
didn't ask their boss for permission to do a damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Inept management and how to get around it were two themes hit
repeatedly by Peters, the author of ``In Search of Excellence'' and
many other business books, during a six-hour program that was part
of San Francisco State University's Lessons in Leadership series.
He said managers of many major businesses are out of touch when it
comes to competing in the Internet economy and expanding customer
base.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said many businesses are particularly clueless when it
comes to satisfying the largest economy on Earth: American women.
He also believes women will lead most companies within 20 years,
partly because so many male managers love rules and a tough chain
of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are crazy times and you have to be able to do 11 things
at a time,'' he said. ``And guys can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Women traditionally have been stronger than men at such things
as forming relationships, using intuition and not being threatened
by strong people, Peters said, and those are all qualities that
leaders need.
</P>
<P>
   He said companies often have an inadvertent form of corporate
suicide when they try to change themselves incrementally. That
makes it too easy for fresh, eager competitors to wipe them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ain't blowin' stuff up, then you ain't gonna create
stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peters pointed to the merger of NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C.,
and Bank of America of San Francisco. He said both companies were
already falling behind competitors in terms of innovation, and the
merger simply means they will spend years trying to combine two
out-of-date systems when they should be putting the energy into
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, Cisco Systems often handles mergers
adeptly, buying smaller companies with talented engineers and a
next-generation product. Cisco is buying talent, even if it costs
$3 million per engineer.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to how the European and U.S. economies changed from
1980 through 1998. The Europeans had few layoffs and added about 4
million jobs, mostly in government.
</P>
<P>
   During that same period, the United States wiped out 44 million
jobs. But, Peters quickly pointed out, it also created 73 million
jobs, for a net gain of 29 million _ more than seven times as many
new jobs as in Europe. He said all those jobs couldn't have been
added if companies weren't willing to lay off people and
restructure.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes workers who are ready for dramatic change are stuck
with bosses who are incrementalists. What do you do then? Peters
offers two suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Never accept an assignment as given.''
</P>
<P>
   There are usually ways to change it so that it accomplishes what
the company wants _ or at least most of it _ while allowing the
worker to feel challenged and innovative.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Create a personal University of Weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters calls it `F2F (freak to freak),'' hooking up with a peer
or someone else in the company who shares your vision. He said it's
often better if that person is as far away geographically as
possible, so that bosses are less likely to know what is going on
until you begin taking action.
</P>
<P>
   He said workers need to create or change projects so that they
fit into the category of ``wow!'' They need to find projects that
excite them, whether it's with their current company, a competitor
or on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use words like `wow,' you will look at the world
through a different lens than if you use less passionate words,''
Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses often eliminate the chance for exciting projects because
they are so preoccupied with costs, he said. They don't realize how
much potential there can be if they have enthusiastic workers doing
exciting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Workers need to look at potential ``wow'' projects and think
about which ones will make a difference, and which ones will
involve raving fans _ people who share the enthusiasm for your idea
or work. They should talk about the idea with others who feel
passionately about it, then reduce it to five bullet points so it
comes into clear focus.
</P>
<P>
   Peters also said it's important for the workers to believe that
their projects are beautiful, not just functional. ``That's the
problem with most of them: They're competent, but they aren't
beautiful.''

JOHNSON BACK WHERE HE WANTS TO BE: IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A lion without courage, a bee without its
sting, a boa that couldn't constrict . . . Ted Johnson without his
ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Johnson thought it was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel normal again,'' he said. ``My body is
starting to react the way it used to. My technique still needs
work, but physically I'm fine. I feel like I'm getting back up to
the speed of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And the toughness.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks back, when he was knocked on his rear 2 yards
down the field, Johnson didn't feel right. A couple of hits like
that got his competitive juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing to me when something like that happens,''
said Johnson. ``I'm known for being tough and aggressive and
getting the upper hand that way. That's my whole game. If I'm weak
in that area it affects the rest of it. I won't be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   After two torn biceps tendons, the mind game of `Will it happen
again?' has finally left him. He no longer thinks if he reaches
back to tackle a ballcarrier his season will be over. There's no
time to think about that when your team is 0-4 and you're facing
one of the best running games and offensive lines in football
Sunday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   What a time for the ferocity to return. It couldn't have come
back at a better time for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell by watching Ted that he made a huge leap in
that game (last) Sunday,'' said tackle Chad Eaton. ``When Ted is
playing that way he makes everyone around him better. The rest of
us feed off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Johnson is back to his old self. One of
the things he is still getting used to is not calling the defensive
plays. That chore has fallen to Tedy Bruschi because Johnson missed
all of training camp and someone with experience, Bruschi, had to
take over.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the challenge of keeping up with Bill Belichick's
many defensive sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill changes them up every week,'' said Johnson. ``Sometimes I
find myself thinking about where I'm going to line up and thinking
about the technique I need to use. What I'm trying to guard against
is having all that affect my aggressiveness out there. Because it
can if you let it. You get so worried about being in the right
place and not making a mistake that you forget about what it is
that defines you as a player. I never want to lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd better not lose that. If he does the Patriots defense might
crumble. Stopping the run is critical to whether the Patriots will
be able to contain the high-powered Denver offense. The Patriots
know that Broncos quarterback Brian Griese has a shoulder problem
and it may affect his attempts to get the ball downfield to
receivers Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the entire team is focusing on getting one win,`` said
Johnson. ``We have to look at who we're playing, but not get caught
up in where we're playing or that it's hard to win where we're
playing. That's not even entering our minds right now. We all have
to do everything a little better. I know people are on our offense
right now, but if the defense can make some plays and help our
offense get to a place they need to be . . . that's the way we have
to approach it. I don't think anyone in this room has said we'll
never make it now. We're just not thinking that way. Nobody here is
demoralized like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson began his upswing two weeks ago against the Vikings when
he made 10 tackles. He backed it up last week with seven tackles
and a half-sack against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's finally reached the point where he's in game shape
and no longer has to motion to the sideline to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could get better at taking on blockers,'' said
Johnson, who in Belichick's one-gap system often is up against
guards. ``Sometimes I don't have the leverage that I need to shed
someone. I think that's the kind of stuff I would have gotten
accustomed to in training camp, but I didn't have training camp
(because of a pulled hamstring). I had to learn the stuff early in
the season, and I think now I'm making gradual improvement. Each
week I feel a little more comfortable with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said, ``Ted's done well in making up for lost time.
He's worked hard. From the Tampa Bay game on he hasn't missed any
practice time. I don't think he made as dramatic a leap from the
week before to last week as some would think. I think it's been a
gradual improvement and that's what you hope for from someone who
missed so much of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has missed a lot of time the past two seasons, but now
that he's been hit a few times and, in Belichick's words, has seen
``how fast the treadmill is turning,'' Johnson appears up to the
task. The ferocity has returned. And Johnson isn't planning on
giving it up anytime soon.

   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ When Al Gore picked Joe Lieberman as his
running mate, Republican Barry Shapiro's Jewish mother called him
from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   She assumed her son at last might be ready to switch loyalties
and vote Democratic, the party of the household that raised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Shapiro, a chiropractor. ``I'm not voting for a
religion. I think that's a bad way to make our decisions when we
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Shapiro said, he felt pride and ``a very warm spot in my
heart'' when Gore chose Lieberman, the Jewish senator from
Connecticut. But Shapiro is sticking with his candidates,
Republican George W. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   And so Shapiro was on hand to enthusiastically applaud Bush as
the Texas governor made a recent trip through Florida, a crucial
swing state where 6 percent of the electorate is Jewish, a group
that traditionally votes in large numbers, magnifying their impact
in close races.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish voters tend to favor Democratic presidential candidates
in ordinary circumstances. With history's first Jewish vice
presidential nominee on his ticket, Al Gore's support among Jews is
expected to go through the roof on Election Day. But it won't be
100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish Republicans remain committed to Bush and Cheney.
They agree with their political views about less government and
lower taxes, believe the pair will be stronger defenders of
Israel's security, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that has to be asked is, who is better to protect
Israel?'' said Ned Siegel, a Boca Raton real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel believes the answer is Bush. For example, Siegel said, he
is convinced that Bush, as president, would quickly move the U.S.
embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a specific desire of
Israeli and American Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish Republicans say they are taking flak from friends
and relatives for not swinging behind the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their own test of loyalty,'' Siegel observed.
``People say, `How can you call yourself a Jew and not support
Lieberman?' Passions run high. ``I'm as happy as anyone else that
Lieberman was nominated for vice president. But I'm voting for a
president, not a vice president. We'd all have a bigger dilemma if
Lieberman was running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that Jews are too closely identified with the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a good thing for all the Jewish people to
be in one party or the other,'' said Peter Sachs, a Boca Raton
attorney. ``If we are all in one party, there is a tendency to take
people for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Swarzman, a Tampa real estate agent, said he has great
respect for Lieberman, but ``it's not a reason why those of us with
other political beliefs need to run and vote for him, just because
he's Jewish. It doesn't help us if Jews were to desert the
Republican ticket just because Lieberman is on the Democratic
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush backer John Kislak, a Miami banker, hailed Lieberman's
nomination as ``a great day for Jews'' because it meant that
professional politicians ``believe anti-Semitism is gone in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kislak finds ``mildly offensive'' the idea that he might
vote for somebody ``just because he is a Jew, the same as I'd find
it offensive to vote for somebody because they were Hispanic or
black or any other such characteristic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tate, a Dade County developer, said he was ``pleased,
proud and happy that a perceived barrier was eliminated'' with
Lieberman's nomination _ but he's voting Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must vote for the individual who best represents what you
want to see achieved in a presidency,'' Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in lower taxes, because it stimulates the
economy, and I believe in less government rather than more, and I
believe that education and health care are better handled by states
than by the federal government, where it would cost considerably
more and be done with far less efficiency.'' Tate said he also
prefers Bush's proposals for school vouchers and Social Security
reform.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, traveled to Israel in 1998 with Betty
Sembler and her husband, Mel, a former U.S. ambassador to Australia
who is now finance chairman for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was a deeply spiritual experience, said Betty Sembler, and
Bush's commitment to Israel is genuine. ``I watched his heart and I
watched his head,and he knew what he was looking at,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Sembler approves of Lieberman. She thinks his nomination
marks a ``coming of age'' for Jews in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to picking a president, she said, ``I have a
different standard. I'm an American first and foremost. I'm a Jew
second, and I'm a Republican third.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists concede that they will lose the Jewish
vote heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan did well in the Jewish community (about 40 percent),
but we really haven't done well since then,'' said Bush adviser
Charles Black, who agreed that Lieberman's role will push support
for the Democratic ticket even higher. And Republican pollster
Frank Luntz noted that ``this will be the third election in a row
when Democrats will exceed this traditional Jewish vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Republicans are hoping to hold the votes of Jews
like Leonard Kleinman, a Tampa attorney, who voted for Bob Dole in
1992. But Kleinman is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for the Bush family,'' Kleinman said.
``On the other hand, I have to look where the interests of Israel
will be better served, and I haven't made up my mind on that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a complicated calculation in the Jewish community, Kleinman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of questions come into play. Would Gore and Lieberman
be perceived as being elected by Jews and therefore bend over
backwards on Middle East policy to avoid being seen as captured by
the Jewish vote? The buzz goes both ways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of Republican Jews will cross over and vote for
the Lieberman-Gore ticket. On the other hand, a lot of Democratic
Jews are not sure America is ready for a Jew to be in that position
and will vote for the Bush-Cheney ticket to avoid backlash
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do Jewish voters generally prefer Democratic candidates?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to sleep at night and I wonder the same thing,'' said
Swarzman. ``I think Jews are uninformed and don't worry as much
about Israel as they used to.''

&HT;     BE CAREFUL HOW YOU CRITICIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nobody likes criticism, but sometimes it has to
be given, for the good of both the individual and the organization.
Good bosses critique employees regularly, mixing praise with
suggestions for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the person you want to criticize is a peer instead
of a subordinate?
</P>
<P>
   If workplaces came with a flashing yellow light, you would see
one about now. The best thing you could do is grab it and put it in
your mouth until the mood passes.
</P>
<P>
   You need to use extreme caution before criticizing a peer,
because the person most likely to get wounded is you. Still, there
are times when it has to be done, for the sake of your career, the
sake of the company or maybe even for the sake of the person being
criticized. Before you say anything, though, ask yourself these
questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Is criticism part of the culture?
</P>
<P>
   College newspapers often have staff meetings where they critique
each edition, with advisers and everyone else offering praise and
criticism for specific stories. It's all done in the open, and
students get used to it after a while.
</P>
<P>
   In those circumstances, the newspaper is encouraging peers to
criticize one another. But even then, the wrong kind of criticism
can backfire. A nasty comment about a one-time event _ ``that story
stunk'' _ causes embarrassment and resentment, but a constructive
suggestion about how the story could have been better is often
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   In another type of corporate culture, some managers just don't
listen to anything employees have to say. Maybe they say they will
listen, but all they do is stonewall every suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   If your company is like that, don't make the criticism. You are
taking a huge risk without any chance of being rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   _ Should you involve the boss?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be seen as a back-stabber or tattletale if you go
running to the boss to resolve conflicts. Have you at least tried
to discuss the problem calmly with your co-worker? Have you checked
to see whether other peers have faced the same problem and managed
to resolve it?
</P>
<P>
   Once the boss gets involved, you are escalating the conflict.
You have made it a lot harder for your peer to just shrug, say
``OK, sure,'' and forget about the whole thing the next day.
</P>
<P>
   _ What do you hope to gain?
</P>
<P>
   Never criticize just for the sake of criticism. If someone is
driving you crazy, complain to a friend or a counselor or someone
else away from your office. Don't criticize a co-worker within the
office unless you have something substantial to gain.
</P>
<P>
   Are you part of a team, so that his performance reflects on you
and limits your chance for a raise or promotion? Do you have to
work longer hours because of his incompetence? Is he driving you so
crazy that you are ready to leave the company?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can ease the situation by thinking a couple of moves
ahead. If your colleague is always making your team late, don't
wait until you are missing the deadline to speak up or it will
sound like finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, give the boss an upbeat update a couple of days before
your deadline: ``The project is going great. As soon as we get the
research from Tom, we'll be all done.'' You are not criticizing Tom
because no mistake has been made, but you are letting the boss know
where the potential problem lies.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure, too, that you are not using your colleague as a
scapegoat. If your pay is tied to his performance, maybe you ought
to be arguing that the company has a pretty stupid policy instead
of faulting your co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you have an accurate picture?
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of jobs, it's easy to think that you are a better
worker than you are because there aren't really any measurable
standards of performance. If you don't make sure your own
performance is solid before you go running to management, the whole
thing is liable to blow up in your face.
</P>
<P>
   You also need to understand your colleague's circumstances.
Maybe he has to answer to three departments, and management has
told him to give yours the short end. Make sure you have identified
the right target before you fire away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can you phrase it another way?
</P>
<P>
   Think about how you would feel if someone made the same
criticism of you. Would you think it was a cheap shot?
</P>
<P>
   If you are talking to the person directly, you will get better
results if you say something like, ``Have you thought about doing
it this way?'' rather than pointing out weaknesses. Don't complain
unless you can suggest a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the best way is to throw it in management's lap.
Rather than criticizing one of your techies, simply say, ``We'd be
a lot more productive if we had better technical support. All these
crashes are killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   For all you know, the techie might even agree with you. Maybe
he's been trying to get the company to upgrade its system, but
management has been blowing him off.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ignore the idea of damning someone with faint praise,
either. If you have three co-workers and you frequently praise the
other two, only a dolt of a boss will fail to get the message.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are you usually upbeat?
</P>
<P>
   If you complain once a year, it will get a lot more attention
than if you complain once a day. If you offer sincere praise from
time to time, the criticism also will carry more weight.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time for the moment of criticism, though, don't be
overly positive. Be understanding and do what you can to soften the
blow, but don't let the message get lost amid jokes, praise and
chatter. Do whatever you can to make the situation right, but make
sure it's clear there is a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If your criticism doesn't solve the problem, it will
probably add to it. Proceed with caution.

THIS PAIR OF ENDINGS IN NEED OF A REWRITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ This was not the way it was supposed to end for either
man. Carl Everett on crutches, unable to play. Pedro Martinez on
ice, with nothing left to pitch for.
</P>
<P>
   For both, so much accomplished. And yet, in terms of what both
players say matters most to them, so little achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no drive, you have no push,'' Martinez said,
explaining why there is no longer cause for him to test the limits
of his marvelous arm and swizzle-stick body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to be going home, period, that's what's
disappointing,'' said Everett, who will accompany the team this
weekend to Tampa Bay, but will not see action after crumpling to
the ground Tuesday because of a tendon injury (peroneal tendon
subluxation) in his left ankle. ``I really don't have any personal
glory in going home. My whole thing is to get to the postseason, so
the entire season is a flop for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put up numbers, but if you don't go to the postseason
it means nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   While manager Jimy Williams admitted Tuesday that the prospect
of another rumble against the Devil Rays entered into the Sox'
thinking about whether Martinez would take his last turn in the
season finale Sunday, Martinez said that was only incidental to his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I wouldn't pitch against anybody,'' said Martinez, whose
five scoreless innings against the White Sox Tuesday put the
finishing touches on a season (18-6, 1.74 ERA, 284 strikeouts) that
will be rewarded with his third Cy Young Award, including the last
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be anybody. I don't really want to get into it (with
the Devil Rays). I'm not scared of going out there, but I don't
have anything to prove. What I had to prove, I proved it that day
to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect those players, even Gerald Williams, for what he
did. It's just part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That might come as a surprise to Dan Duquette, who labeled the
Devil Rays outfielder a ``thug'' for charging Martinez after he hit
Williams with a pitch leading off the game in Tropicana Field Aug.
29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just won't pitch,'' Martinez said, ``because I need to rest
more than I need to pitch that game.''
</P>
<P>
   While X-rays on his ankle were negative, Everett won't be taking
any more turns at the plate, either, after he took just a couple of
steps out of the batter's box Tuesday before falling while running
out a ground ball to short.
</P>
<P>
   He should have extra time to spend on the team dinner he is
planning to throw at a Tampa restaurant this weekend, though it
remains to be seen if the no-shows outnumber those who make use of
their invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Everett may have mixed his metaphors, but his message in an
interview with John Reyes, a 74-year-old Chicago radio personality,
had not strayed off course from what he has been saying in the last
sorry days of his first season in a Sox uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have rattled some feathers in this clubhouse,'' Everett told
Reyes, ``by speaking my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Another comment, made to a group of Boston reporters, probably
will not boost attendance at his party:
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been others who have spoken out,'' he said, ``that
probably shouldn't have spoken out without putting a name on it.
Those people, if you're going to say something, make sure your name
goes behind it. Only a coward runs and hides behind something.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone says something derogatory toward someone and
can't put their name behind it, then he's a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Everett, who statistically did about all the Sox
expected when they traded for him: .300 average, 34 home runs, 70
extra-base hits, 108 RBIs in 137 games. He gave us advance warning
of what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why people change for other people,'' Everett was
quoted as saying in a Globe (sorry Carl, that paper) story April
11. ``If you don't like me for myself, I don't care. The guy I'm
going to give you is me, not somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's ankle may be sore, but his persecution complex remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should sum up the whole season, all the criticism has
been toward me,'' said Everett, who won't be calling Morrissey
Boulevard any time soon to place a subscription order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything said about me was a lie,'' he said. ``I'll always
stand behind that.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's something impossible to refute, regardless of whose
newsprint it appears on:
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months of the season Everett didn't hit close
to .300. He batted .262 with 3 home runs and 7 RBIs in a July
shortened by his 10-game suspension for bumping umpire Ron Kulpa.
He hit .275 with 6 home runs and 23 RBIs in August. And in just 74
at-bats in September, a month interrupted by a quadriceps injury
and now short-circuited by the ankle injury, Everett batted just
.270 with 2 home runs and 10 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He hit 20 home runs in his first 49 games, 14 in his last 88. He
hit .329 with 24 homers and 69 RBIs before the break, .261 with 10
home runs and 39 RBIs after the break.
</P>
<P>
   And that's with Nomar Garciaparra, about to win his second
straight batting title, hitting behind him.
</P>
<P>
   If the bottom line is productivity, as his general manager
famously said last week, then maybe Everett should be the next one
asked to explain himself at lunch to CEO John Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Martinez, in an act of self-preservation at least as
sensible as skipping the Devil Rays, is steering clear of this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my little world,'' Martinez said. ``I don't stick my
nose out of it. I let Jimy do his job. I let my teammates do their
job. I help them go through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't stick my nose where it doesn't belong. I just keep
myself in my little world right here. If I talk, I talk to my
neighbor Ramon.''

&HT;     LEFTOVER POTATOES CAN SPROUT INTO ANOTHER MEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hash browns do not have to come from the frozen
food section. Nor do they have to be time-consuming to make. Hash
browns, those wonderful breakfast potatoes, can be made quite
easily from a few leftover potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chef's trick that's probably as old as dining out. Take
leftover potatoes and make them into another dish. It's also a good
way to use up some of those potatoes that are starting to age past
their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Got extra mashers? Make potato cakes, or duchesse potatoes or
shepherd's pie, or potato croquettes.
</P>
<P>
   Using leftover potatoes is limited only by your imagination.
But, there are a few basics to learn about potatoes first.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes generally are divided into two groups: waxy and
starchy. Waxy potatoes include red-skinned potatoes, white
potatoes, blue potatoes, fingerlings and Yukon Golds. Starchy
potatoes include russets, also sold as ``Idaho'' or ``baking''
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Starchy potatoes are the best ones for mashed potatoes and for
baked potatoes. Their high-starch, low-sugar, low-moisture content
makes them cook up light, dry and mealy in texture, writes Wayne
Gisslen in ``Le Cordon Bleu Professional Cooking'' (Wiley, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Waxy potatoes, on the other hand, retain more moisture during
cooking and hold their shape well. Use these for parsleyed
potatoes, potato salads or other dishes where you'll be serving the
potatoes cut into chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever kind of potato you're using, look for spuds that are
firm and smooth. Avoid those that are soft, shriveled or have green
areas. Green patches, which have a bitter flavor, develop on
potatoes that have been stored improperly. Also avoid potatoes that
are sprouted as they are high in sugar. Instead, look for potatoes
with shallow eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking potatoes is a basic process, but you'll be surprised at
how much you don't know that could improve the results. Here are
several success tips gleaned from culinary textbooks:
</P>
<P>
   Baking:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scrub the potatoes and prick them with a fork before cooking,
but don't wrap them in foil. Foil-wrapping potatoes steams them
instead of baking them, a process not recommended with starchy
potatoes such as russets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potatoes are quite beautiful but if you must hide them under a
layer of foil, wrap them just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you desire a crisp skin, rub the potato lightly with oil
before baking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bake at 400 degrees for about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling:
</P>
<P>
   _ Peel and cut potatoes into uniform chunks so they will cook
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start potatoes in a pot of cold water since this also allows
for more even cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring the potatoes to a boil, lower the heat and let simmer
until tender.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not cool potatoes in cold water, as they will become soggy.
</P>
<P>
   Mashing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drain and allow the potatoes to steam dry in a colander or
return to pan and heat over the stove for a few minutes to dry for
fluffy potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heat your mashing or ricing tools by running them under hot
water to avoid cooling the potatoes and making them gummy.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the same reason, heat any milk, cream or butter prior to
adding them to the potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the potatoes as desired and then if there are leftovers,
use one of the recipes here to make a second potato dish.

&HT;     NO MEDAL FOR NBC'S HANDLING OF THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest problem with these four-season Olympics
(summer-into-fall in the United States, winter-into-spring in
Australia) hasn't been what NBC has televised.
</P>
<P>
   No, the biggest setback for NBC has been what the other
networks, and cable outlets, and Internet sites, haven't shown. And
that's still NBC's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Sydney Games, NBC made a strategic decision: All
441.5 hours of programming on the network and on its cable sisters
CNBC and MSNBC would be on tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   With a record 15- to 18-hour time difference between the host
city and the United States, the network knew that none of the prime
events would fall into prime time here. (Previously, the biggest
gap was 14 to 17 hours for the 1998 Nagano Winter Games and the
1988 Seoul Summer Olympics.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a business decision, and certainly a debatable one. It
makes sense to keep the marquee events in the time slot with the
highest viewership, but the network could have gained by showing
even a smattering of lesser events as they happened.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the network's biggest gaffe. This is: Despite the
fact that NBC paid more than $700 million for the right to
broadcast these Olympics, it should be giving some of the Games'
footage to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Free. Gratis. As in, ``It's on us, pal.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would go against standard practice and all business
sense. But these Games _ held so far away, in the Southern
Hemisphere for the first time in 44 years, and pushing into the NFL
season and baseball's pennant chase _ aren't the norm.
</P>
<P>
   In paying the princely sum for the broadcast rights, NBC secured
the right to all moving pictures from these Australian Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated: Until it airs on NBC or its cable brethren _ and
even then only after the end of the broadcast day _ nobody else can
use footage, not even NBC affiliates. And even if all those
criteria are met, you can air only six minutes in a given day.
</P>
<P>
   As anybody in television news will tell you, if you don't have
the pictures, you don't have the story.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures that are 24 hours or more old are simply old news,
especially in the rapid-response Information Age. As a result, most
televised Olympic reports are nothing more than the winners, the
scores and the medal count against a solid backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   But if NBC allowed other outlets to show snippets of some of the
action _ 15 to 20 seconds, tops _ national and local sports anchors
would have the ``art'' they need to tell a more in-depth story.
</P>
<P>
   NBC then would be the beneficiary of something that's been
missing from these Games, something that's been turned into a
four-letter word at that network: buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter made a spectacular dunk the other night against
France. Have you seen it? Neither have I. Had you seen it on the
nightly news or sports wrap, you'd be drooling to see it again when
it (eventually) airs on NBC.

 ON MOUNT WASHINGTON, `LOOK OUT, BELOW!'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mount Washington has always been a place of wonderful personal
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   I've been atop, geared with crampons and ice axe, when the winds
topped 100 miles per hour and exposed flesh froze instantly. Skied
the precipitous face of Tuckerman Ravine. Gulped water to avoid
dehydration in a hot summer climb out of Great Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Was I ever afraid on the mountain? Only once _ riding in a car,
driven by someone else, as it negotiated the steeps and switchbacks
of the Mount Washington Auto Road. Now there's an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   And it's an adventure that, foliage season upon us, many New
Englanders and vistors from away will attempt (weather permitting,
since it has been known to snow up there in the fall) in the weeks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things you ought to know before you go.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen the bumper stickers that read, ``THIS CAR
CLIMBED MOUNT WASHINGTON.'' To that, I say big deal. They ought to
read, ``THIS CAR GOT DOWN MOUNT WASHINGTON.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, with modern engines and better cooling systems,
overheating on the way up is not the threat it once was. Instead,
the dangers lurk in the descent, where the wrong transmission, bad
brakes, poor driving technique, or too heavy a load can lead to
dangerous runaways.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who run the Auto Road do all they can to protect you.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the bottom warns that it is a steep, narrow mountain
road _ WITHOUT GUARDRAILS. Believe me, round a hairpin turn looking
right over the edge of an unguarded shoulder _ looking off into the
sky or down onto rocks above treeline _ and you might not feel
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people that if they have a fear of heights, they might
not enjoy the experience,'' says Howie Weymms, general manager of
the Auto Road.
</P>
<P>
   They give you a pamphlet telling you how to drive the road _
note especially the part about using a low gear rather than your
brakes _ and they check your car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your average Sunday drive,'' Weymms says is the
standard warning.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, there have been only two fatal wrecks in the history
of the road _ opened as the Carriage Road in 1861, first climbed by
auto in 1899 by an appropriately named Locomobile.
</P>
<P>
   The first was in 1880, when a drunk stage coach driver let his
team get away from him and a passenger was killed. Now there's a
refrain to echo down the ages: Don't drink and drive.
</P>
<P>
   The second was in 1984 when a Jeep Cherokee lost its brakes and
the driver tried to run out the journey to the flat fields at the
base. He hit the last tree on the way down and a passenger was
killed. See what I mean about being a passenger in a vehicle driven
by someone else. There's a pattern there.
</P>
<P>
   Running out failed brakes is not a good thing. If it happens to
you, drive onto an upslope off the side of the road, or dump your
car in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think you're an expert so you don't need to pay
attention to the advice of those who know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who thinks they're the greatest driver in the world
isn't,'' says Weymms.
</P>
<P>
   So you've been warned. But what about your car/van/truck/SUV?
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Road folks will check it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the car not from a mechanical standpoint, but from
the make and model,'' according to Weymms.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a car whose low/first-gear setting won't stay in
that gear on the way down _ that is automatically shifts out as you
gain speed _ and forces you to rely on your brakes, that car won't
be allowed to make the climb.
</P>
<P>
   Cars on this list include models from Honda, Saturn, Acura, and
Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, in fact, has quietly negotiated a deal with the Auto Road
management under which Honda pays for Honda owners denied access to
the Auto Road to ride up in tour vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Vans are suspect, mostly because of how much weight in people
and and gear they carry. Any pre-1996 Caravan, for instance, cannot
carry more than 600 pounds combined because Auto Road workers have
learned they overheat on the way up and burn up their brakes on the
way down.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs are also scrutinized _ because of their size, weight and
carrying capacities, and because of the attitudes of their drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as on the highways, many of these drivers feel privileged
and invulnerable. They forget that 7,000 runaway-pounds is 7,000
runaway pounds of deadly steel. A boulder or tree does not know
that that was a Chevy Suburban that just smacked it.
</P>
<P>
   Many SUV drivers, confident in their equipment, also have no
idea how to use that equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Waymms says, ``It's amazing how many people come out of the
cities in their SUVs who don't even understand their basic
mechanical gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto Road workers have been known to have to explain to some of
these folks how to shift their SUVs into low range, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   If you show up with too much weight packed into your vehicle,
there are secure lockers at the base of the Auto Road to offload
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't believe us when we tell them that 150 pounds
makes a big difference, but it does,'' says Weymms.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the rules, use common sense, and you won't end up like
the Canadian couple who, in 1984, lost their brakes about a mile
above the toll house and tried to ride it out. They went through
the toll area approaching 60 miles per hour, crossed a field even
as they avoided a crowd at the bottom, leaped a river and landed on
the bank. Amazingly, there were no major injuries.

GORE BIG ON BASHING BIG BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We found out this week that one of our kids needs braces, which
means that over the next year we will have to shell out big money
for orthodontia.
</P>
<P>
   We could have blamed the whole thing on bad luck or bad genes.
But if we were Al Gore, we would have taken a different tack. We
would have accused the orthodonist of price gouging, making
excessive profits, and being in cahoots with ``big dentistry'' or
``big teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get us wrong: We basically like Al Gore. We think he's
smart, capable, and probably wouldn't be a bad president.
</P>
<P>
   But as business columnists, with some faith in the free market,
we are having more and more trouble listening to Gore's attacks on
business. They strike us as disingenuous, bordering on dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence: Gore's recent attack on oil companies
(``big oil'' in Gorespeak). In a discussion of his energy policies,
Gore this week noted that oil company profits have skyrocketed, and
he called on big oil to stop ``profiteering.''
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new for the vice president. In the spring, when
gasoline prices became an issue, he accused big oil of ``gouging''
consumers and called on the Federal Trade Commission to
investigate. This week, he took the rhetoric to a new level. ``I
will work for the day when we are free forever of the dominance of
big oil and foreign oil,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in Gore's remarks is the idea that the oil companies
have the power to drive up prices. But do they? If so, how do you
explain the fact that oil prices have been low for most of the past
15 years and that only two years ago they were at their lowest
point, adjusted for inflation, since World War II?
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that oil profits have soared this year, longer
term they are nothing to write home about. The same can be said of
oil stock prices. Over the past five years, the Amex oil index, a
sampling of oil stocks, has returned 106 percent, compared to 180
percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   And what was Gore thinking when he pledged to end our dependence
on big oil and foreign oil? The US gets 50 percent of its oil from
overseas, most of it delivered by big oil companies. Does Gore know
someome small and domestic who is going to take up the slack?
</P>
<P>
   HMOs are another favorite Gore target. In a recent speech on
Medicare, Gore said, ``The HMOs and insurance companies want to
measure your health and well-being on a spread sheet.'' He
routinely denounces ``bean counters'' making medical decisions, and
this week he vowed to crack down on HMOs that leave the Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a point here. Some HMOs have set up too many barriers
to care. But many of the worst abuses have either been corrected by
the industry or by state legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem in health care today is cost. Insurance
premiums are going up at a double-digit clip. Beating up on HMOs
and threatening them with penalties isn't going to solve the
problem. If we outlawed all HMOs tomorrow, someone would still have
to grapple with the tough choices involved in keeping health care
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for that sort of nuanced argument from Gore about
HMOs. Or about prescription drug companies, for that matter. Gore's
Web site is full of boasts about how he has stood up to the big
pharmaceutical companies, which charge ``absurdly high prices'' and
make excessive profits.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies do charge a lot. They are also very profitable.
But big profits _ Gore nothwithstanding _ actually play a vital
role in our economy. ``Profits are a reward for risk-taking and for
making the right decisions,'' said Nicholas Perna, an economic
consultant based in Connecticut. ``They are also an enticement for
taking future risks.''
</P>
<P>
   America can cut drug company profits _ maybe we will have to _
but if we do, we have to accept the fact that the drug companies
will take fewer risks and produce fewer drugs. In a capitalist
society, money and talent flow to where the rewards are greatest.
That's true in Hollywood, on the Internet, and in the
pharmaceutical business.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gore's cartoonish view of big business does a
disservice both to him and to the American people. He knows life is
more complicated than he's letting on, and so do the rest of us.
With just six weeks left until Election Day, it would be nice to
hear Gore talk to us as if we were 21st century sophisticates, not
19th century farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it would be more than nice. It would be big.

at Sunday night's Closing Ceremony, we talk with Gianna
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, head of the Athens Organizing Committee and
the first woman to hold such a position. The Greeks have been under
fire from the IOC for not being organized. We talk to her about how
they are coping and what they've learned from Sydney and Atlanta.

medal, but she didn't get to share the experience with anyone.
Venus Williams, winner of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open earlier this

   FLORIDA-TITLE _ Down on their luck, some Florida residents head
to car title loan shops for a bit of cash. They surrender their
vehicle title to receive as little as $500. Then they're hit with
yearly interest of 264 percent. Like other borrowers throughout the
South, the object of their ire is Atlanta-based Title Loans of
America, one of the largest so-called ``fringe lending''
institutions in the country. Published reports say the owner, an
attorney in South Florida who owns a Miami restaurant, has ties to
organized crime. Title loans, say Florida Attorney General Bob
Butterworth, are nothing but legal loan sharking. (Manuel, The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-INSURANCE _ WASHINGTON Nearly 2 million previously
uninsured Americans gained health-care coverage last year, the
first time in 12 years that the number of people without health
insurance dropped. Analysts point to the country's low jobless rate
and broader health coverage plans by employers as contributing to
the turnaround. Still, the number of uninsured Americans,
particularly among the poor, remained high. The number of people
without health insurance declined by 1.7 million between 1998 and
1999, from 44.3 million to 42.6 million. (Holmes, Cox News
Service). 25.

legal case against Firestone Tires. Rowe Brogdon represents the
family of a college football player who died after a blowout on
I-95. Their lawsuit was settled after Brogdon found a Firestone
engineer who knew of the tire problems. We also have a copy of the
whistleblower's deposition. (Chapman, Atlanta

Bond? Then why did Justice Department let him walk? Something is
horribly wrong here. (Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Hard to believe, but the chief justice of the
United States, of all people, is pushing to return bribery to the
federal judicial system. No less than William H. Rehnquist himself
is asking Congress to scrap the 1989 ban on honoraria for Supreme
Court justices and most other federal jurists. And what is more, he
has support for this curious notion from some substantial part of
the GOP caucus. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY.

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ We all know people like
that. You know, those whose elevator doesn't go all the way to the
top floor. The ones who are fry or two short of a Happy Meal. Folks
whose motor is running but they can't get it out of Park. When it
comes to the colloquial put-down, we take to it like, well, a hog
to slop. I received an e-mail the other day that purports to be
``actual employee performance evaluations in a large U.S.
corporation.'' More than likely, the list is from the imagination
of someone with too much time on his hands, but they do have a ring
of truth that is all too familiar: (Ernest Murray is managing
editor of The Lufkin Daily News) EDS: Embargoed for Sunday. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Fall is finally here,
though rain is still playing hide-and-seek, meaning the
temperatures are tolerable, but the land is still ridiculously dry
even with a few showers. Forest fires are still a fact of life, and
anybody who is dumb enough to burn outdoors or chunk a cigarette
out a car window ought to be horsewhipped.(Gary Borders is editor
and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EDS: EMBARGOED
for Sunday. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Unwrap an arm's length of cotton
gauze, wad it in your mouth and experience what too many health
educators say they feel. When the subject is sex education. It
comes out ``sez nextonuthin.'' That's precisely what many
policy-makers want. Next to nothing. Clarification: Next to
nothing, they want full-throated advisories against it. It? You
know. It. Do I have to spell it out? S-E-X. (John Young is opinion
page editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   WEBMD _ WebMD Corp., the biggest Internet company linking
insurers, doctors and patients, will cut 1,100 jobs as it
eliminates overlap resulting from acquisitions. WebMD will take a
pretax charge of $35 million to $45 million in the third quarter,
the company said in a press release. WebMD has said it would close
offices, spend less on marketing and technology and cut jobs and
products to get rid of duplications. (Miller, Atlanta

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ The number of hybrid-fuel vehicles

</P>
<P>
   A hybrid is a vehicle that has more than one power source _ in
this case, a 44-horsepower electric motor and a 70-horsepower,
inline, four-cylinder gasoline motor. The newcomer, joining Honda's
Insight in the market place, is Toyota's Prius (pronounced pre-us).

   THE-MECHANIC _ ATLANTA _ The question of whether to clean the
``self-cleaning'' Multec fuel injectors on a 1990 Camaro _ broached
by R.P Borsody last week _ prompted me to delve into an area for
which I thought I had a definitive answer. However, my research of
real-world conditions revealed, as is often the case, that the
factory information I have believed to be gospel contains some
discrepancies. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   ABORTION-DRUG _ Manufacturing, distribution and legal troubles
have bogged down the process, but the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is scheduled to approve mifepristone (ru486) _ with
some potential restrictions _ by Sept. 30. How easy will it be to
obtain the drug in Atlanta, will some doctors refuse to prescribe
it, what will it cost, including costs of followup ultrasound, what
do local antiabortion groups plan to do, if anything, what does
that mean for abortion clinics? We'll answer those questions.

   AIDS-CONFERENCE _ ATLANTA _ She struggles to put her fear into
words, but Mardis Andrews knows perhaps better than anyone what the
AIDS epidemic means to her and her children, an 11-year-old
daughter and a baby not yet born. ``I feel like I'm in a world
different from everybody else,'' the 33-year-old Atlanta mother
said. Truth is, Mardis Andrews isn't. She has never been. In
Georgia, 82 percent of women with AIDS are African-American, just
like her. And African-American children represent 62 percent of all
new HIV-AIDS cases in the United States, just like her daughter.
But if these numbers are lost on Andrews, they weigh heavy and wide
on the 3,300 representatives from HIV/AIDS advocacy groups and
service providers who are expected to meet here Sunday through
Wednesday for the U.S. Conference on AIDS. (Staples, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When Napster Inc. goes back to court this week,
singer-guitarist Nial McGaughey won't be among the many musicians
cheering for the judges to put the online music site out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey and his heavy-metal band, 3D House of Beef, estimate
they reach thousands of listeners each day through Napster and
similar Internet sites, people they wouldn't be able to reach any
other way.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Oakland, Calif., band doesn't make any money letting
online listeners swap songs such as ``White Hog Slaughter'' and
``Heard You Were Dead'' for free, but the exposure certainly
results in some CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``When music gets played on the radio, isn't (that) giving it
away?'' McGaughey, 31, wrote in an e-mail interview. ``What about
when it gets played at clubs?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course that's not what other, more established musicians and
the major record labels behind them say. Backed by the powerful
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and musicians such
as Metallica and rapper Dr. Dre, major record labels have sued
Napster and competitor MP3.com Inc., claiming the companies'
infringement of music copyrights cost them billions in lost
profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco is scheduled to hear Napster's appeal of an injunction
that would put it out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of this case and similar lawsuits, the
business of making, distributing and buying music is going to be
different in many ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for musicians. Little-known bands like
McGaughey's can distribute their music over the Internet _ with or
without Napster and MP3.com _ on their own, bypassing record
companies that have traditionally been the mainstay of the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Better-known musicians have to operate in the knowledge that any
fan with a computer and Internet access no longer has to pay to
hear their music. Some are taking the offensive. To thwart piracy,
the Canadian band Barenaked Ladies recently flooded the Internet
with fake songs that contained little more than marketing pitches
for its newest album.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for the record companies. Not long ago, artists
who wanted to make it big had to sign with a major label, and
listeners had to buy it from the label. Now recording companies,
their grip on artists loosening, are scrambling to implement their
own Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for listeners. Last year, ``MP3,'' the format
used to compress and move music files on line, replaced ``sex'' as
the most searched-for term on the Internet. Even if Napster and
MP3.com disappear, other software programs _ Gnutella and Rapster
are two of the most popular _ will let people go on exchanging
music easily.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't downloaded any music yet, you probably will when
faster Internet connections make it much easier. And even if you
can't imagine listening to listen to music on your computer instead
of your stereo, you may have already heard some music over the
Internet. Some retailers and radio stations use downloaded music in
their stores and on their late-night broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for the Internet companies. Once a small band of
self-professed renegades, online music companies are getting
legitimate or changing the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   When Walmart.com launches a downloadable music service early
next year, it will do so with licensing agreements in hand from
major record labels. Even MP3.Com, which once slammed the major
labels as irrelevant, now has licensing deals with four of them.
Like other online music companies, MP3.com also is pushing into new
markets, such as selling monthly subscriptions to non-stop music
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's a lot of controversy, but the controversy is
about different legal issues, it's not about the opportunities,''
MP3.com Chairman Michael Roberston said in a recent interview.
``The bottom line is that delivering music digitally is so
efficient that it's going to revolutionize everything.''
</P>
<P>
   History replays itself
</P>
<P>
   Of course, technology has been revolutionizing the music
industry almost since the first recording. And usually, there has
been plenty of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, in radio's heyday, many record companies
refused to allow stations to broadcast their music. That's why some
radio networks started their own shows and did live broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies ``were afraid people wouldn't buy records any
more if they could hear the music for free,'' explained Emory
University sociology professor Tim Dowd, echoing the complaints of
modern-day recording executives about Napster and MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies continued to be stingy with their music up
until 1942, when Capitol Records broke from the pack and declared
that radio play actually helped its sales, Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Later home recording drew the ire of the big labels _ first
cassettes, then digital audio tapes, and now CD ``burners.'' The
industry says it loses $1.5 billion or more a year to home taping.
</P>
<P>
   At least when it came to cassettes, the record labels were
right. ``The record companies went into a big slump'' in late
1970s, Dowd said. ``One of the things that pulled them out was the
CD, which gave them a new form of recording that cassettes couldn't
rival.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with MP3 is that the masses, with the help of the
Internet, learned how to use it before the recording companies did.
</P>
<P>
   The technology actually has its roots not in music, but in
television. In 1992, a contract research group in Germany that was
searching for ways improve the sound of high-definition television
broadcasts discovered how to compress audio files. The technology
became a standard of the Moving Picture Experts Group known as MPEG
1 Layer 3, or later, MP3.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Robertson, a former computer advice columnist who
had started several other companies with little success, founded
MP3.com Inc. here in March 1998, computer and music enthusiasts
around the world were already swapping MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford University, in a harbinger of what was to come, a
student put more than 100 songs on a Web server and an estimated
2,000 people a day logged on to download free tunes, clogging the
university's Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's company was the first to make a sizeable business
out of housing and downloading songs. But even though MP3.com had
thousands of songs available on line (today it claims more than
600,000), big record labels paid little public attention to the
company, largely because most of the artists were little-known
bands.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, MP3 technology got the recording industry's
attention in a big way. Diamond Multimedia Inc. introduced a
portable MP3 player that could play downloaded music like a
Walkman. The RIAA filed suit seeking to keep Diamond from releasing
its Rio player, but it failed. Rio's popularity soared.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, the RIAA would try again to stop the
spread of MP3 music. This time, they focused on a 19-year-old
Northeastern University dropout named Shawn Fanning.
</P>
<P>
   Buying time
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, Fanning moved to the heart of technology,
Silicon Valley, to commercialize a revolutionary new file exchange
software program he wrote to help him and his friends exchange MP3
files. The nappy-haired teen reportedly used one of his own
nicknames in calling his company Napster Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is a file-sharing site that lets users find and download
music that's stored on other users' computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   It dramatically widened the sources for music files beyond those
on the MP3.com site. MP3.com says visitors to its site are simply
accessing music from CDs they already own, but record companies
claim the music files ar illegal copies that MP3.com made and
stored on its servers, and that many of its users are otherwise
sharing music that they don't own.
</P>
<P>
   Napster became an overnight sensation. With it, anybody with
Internet access and a CD-ROM drive can exchange digitized music,
whether it's copyrighted or not. The file trading software became
so popular at colleges and universities that it clogged Internet
systems and shut down servers. Fanning became something of a pop
idol, even getting a spot on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies got angry.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, the RIAA and 17 major labels filed suit
against Napster, claiming its 20 million users cost them more than
$700 million in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the recording industry's five biggest labels also
sued MP3.com. All but one of those has settled, but damages from
the still-pending suit by Universal Music Group could cost MP3.com
$118 million or more. A judge is scheduled to decide final damages
in the MP3.com case next month.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the record labels claimed the companies violated
copyrights held by them and their artists.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the record companies filed suit,
according to some critics. They simply wanted to buy some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about trying to slow it down,'' said Heath Terry, who
follows Internet trends for the Credit Suisse First Boston
investment banking firm, which was the lead underwriter in
MP3.com's July 1999 initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recording industry right now is terrified,'' he said.
``They just want everybody to stop and give them time to figure it
out, and they're going to throw up whatever roadblock they can to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes, fast and slow
</P>
<P>
   So far, the roadblocks seem to be working, and the record
companies have used their time wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Since filing their suits against Napster and MP3.com, nearly
every major record label has started a major Internet initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group
announced they would develop an online subscription-based music
service. In July, EMI Group started offering 100 digital albums for
sale through online retailers. In September, Warner Music Group
announced plans to put more than 1,000 albums for sale on the
Internet beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Napster and MP3.com, where thousands of tunes can
be downloaded daily (and for free), the music industry's offerings
are paltry. And industry executives admit they have been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated process,'' said RIAA spokesman Doug Curry.
``It's much easier for someone to upload thousands of CDs and put
them online for free as opposed to changing 60 years of a large
industry's practices overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians and Internet companies are changing virtually
overnight, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bands Primitive Radio Gods and Arrested Development
recently agreed to pre-release songs from upcoming CDs on Napster
to generate interest in the new discs. Popular California punk band
Offspring last month announced it would post its entire new CD on
the Internet, but later reneged under pressure from their recording
label, Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists may soon start using the recording labels'
newfound vulnerability as leverage when negotiating contracts or
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will in fact kind of create a free agency for the artist if
the Internet becomes a safer place for the artist to be,'' said
talent agent Ron Stone, who represents musicians including Bonnie
Raitt, Ziggy Marley and Tracy Chapman. ``There are going to be some
artists ... who will use the Internet to create new relationships
with record companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the organizers of a group called Artists Against
Piracy, Stone detests Napster and other online companies that don't
pay royalties to musicians. But he, and many of the musicians he
represents, aren't opposed to digital distribution of music _ as
long as they get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to Napster technology, we're opposed to the
Napster business model,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some online music companies are, in fact, changing their
business models.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com recently launched subscription channels that let
subscribers listen to nonstop classical or children's tunes, much
like digital cable music channels, for a monthly fee. Its new
retail business already has about 100 stores and restaurants as
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to pay, we'll write the check and we'll move on,''
MP3.com's Robertson said, referring to the possibility of costly
damages in its lawsuit. ``Technology marches forward. And as we're
a technology company, we must seize the opportunities as they come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   None of what the companies are doing really matters to music
fans like 21-year-old Juan Pieterse, a third-year college student
in South Africa. Pieterse claims he hasn't bought a CD in two
years, but he has downloaded countless tunes over the Internet
using Napster and other services.
</P>
<P>
   If Napster gets shut down this week, he'll likely just go to
another file-sharing system, such as Gnutella, to get free copies
of songs from favorite bands like Metallica, REM and Offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, one does not need to be a rocket scientist to
download or upload illegal copies of songs,'' Pieterse wrote in an
e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pieterse is the kind of music listener that the major record
labels fear most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who will purchase CDs in the future,'' he
wrote, ``are people who don't have portable MP3 players or PCs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Movie theater chains, their backs against the wall financially,
are starting to resort to revenue-raising measures they would not
even have considered a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With ticket and popcorn prices already high, the chains are
inserting television-style advertisements before the previews of
coming attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, only one movie theater chain in Greater Boston
was experimenting with commercials, while other chains said they
were dead set against the ads. Now all major chains are either
running commercials or preparing to run them.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for GC Cos. of Chestnut Hill, Mass., owner of the
General Cinema chain of theaters, said the high-quality ads are
popular with moviegoers and bring in badly needed revenue that
keeps ticket prices stable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story three years ago, before the company got
into financial trouble that has led it to warn it might have to
seek bankruptcy protection. ``We're moviegoers here,'' a company
spokesman said at the time. ``The type of commercial you find on TV
is inconsistent with the moviegoing entertainment experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which are unpopular with a vocal minority of
moviegoers, are one example of what theater chains are doing to
survive a financial downturn that has them drowning in red ink,
with stock prices at record lows.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the nation's top chains have already filed for
bankruptcy protection: Carmike Cinemas of Columbus, Ga.; United
Artists Theater Co. of Denver; and the Edwards Theater Circuit Inc.
of Newport Beach, Calif. GC Cos. and Regal Cinemas of Knoxville,
Tenn., may soon be following suit, unless their creditors provide
some relief.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Cineplex Entertainment of New York is also in trouble. It
lost $51.39 million in its most recent fiscal year and another $31
million in its most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The financial problems at movie-theater chains are largely due
to overbuilding, with too many screens with too few eyeballs
watching them.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and 1990s, theater chains went on a building
binge. Nervous about losing customers to cable, VHS, DVD, and
satellite, they started putting up theaters with the consumer in
mind. They borrowed heavily to construct expensive new megaplexes
with much bigger screens, stadium-style seating, plush seats, and
great sound.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy kept consumers coming out to the movies, but not
enough of them to support all the new screens. Between 1990 and
1999, the number of indoor movie screens in the country jumped
nearly 59 percent, but the number of people going to the movies
failed to keep pace, increasing only 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, chains made the mistake of opening duelling
megaplexes within spitting distance of each other. It almost
happened in Massachusetts. Hoyts Cinemas and National Amusements'
Showcase Cinemas both planned to build 16-screen complexes less
than a mile from each other along the Randolph-Stoughton line,
towns just outside Boston, until Hoyts came to its senses and
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that customers love the new megaplexes. The
movie palaces have attracted moviegoers in record numbers, many of
them driving longer and longer distances. But with the overall
movie audience growing only slightly or not at all, it's been a
game of PacMan run amok.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say US theater chains need to eliminate about 8,000
screens to return the industry to profitability, but that won't be
easy. Many chains are locked into expensive long-term leases.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing last week that raised the possibility of bankruptcy,
General Cinema said its profits have been hurt by its inability to
terminate leases on acceptable terms. It has closed nine theaters
with 42 screens during the last nine months, paying out $5.7
million to terminate leases. Yet it owes another $6.8 million for
early lease terminations and still expects to make nearly $80
million in lease payments this year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for National Amusements of Dedham, Mss. said the
chain is faring better than many of its competitors because the
company leases less than 10 percent of its properties.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership gives the chain much greater flexiblity. For example,
an unprofitable four-screen theater in Worcester, Mass. was shut
down two years ago and is now being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters make more money on a film the longer it stays in a
theater. But with megaplexes showing some movies on two or more
screens, films tend to make their money quickly and then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   As theater chains retrench, consumers probably won't like what
they see. Ticket and concession-stand prices are already high and
likely to head higher. The average ticket price nationally
increased 8 percent last year. General Cinema raised prices twice
in the last year; its new Fenway cinema is charging $9 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, running television-style commercials seems almost
painless, because there are no expenses involved and advertisers
such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, BMW, and Nike are eager to tap the prized
young demographic. Hoyts, Loews, and General Cinema are already
running the ads, and National Amusements has dropped its opposition
and plans to start soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ads don't interrupt the movie, some consumers
resent seeing them when they are paying $8 to $9 for a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   David Daugman said he was outraged when he had to sit through
three commercials while waiting to watch a movie at a Loews theater
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no objection to ads on free radio or television, but I
do object in the strongest possible terms to paying to see a movie
and having no choice in also sitting through ads,'' he said. ``This
may just be a test or an experiment to gauge our reaction, if any,
to this travesty. I, for one, will not tolerate it.''

</P>
<P>
   When Walmart.com launches a downloadable music service early
next year, it will do so with licensing agreements in hand from
major record labels. Even MP3.Com, which once slammed the major
labels as irrelevant, now has licensing deals with four of them.
Like other online music companies, MP3.com also is pushing into new
markets, such as selling monthly subscriptions to non-stop music
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's a lot of controversy, but the controversy is
about different legal issues, it's not about the opportunities,''
MP3.com Chairman Michael Roberston said in a recent interview.
``The bottom line is that delivering music digitally is so
efficient that it's going to revolutionize everything.''
</P>
<P>
   History replays itself
</P>
<P>
   Of course, technology has been revolutionizing the music
industry almost since the first recording. And usually, there has
been plenty of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, in radio's heyday, many record companies
refused to allow stations to broadcast their music. That's why some
radio networks started their own shows and did live broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies ``were afraid people wouldn't buy records any
more if they could hear the music for free,'' explained Emory
University sociology professor Tim Dowd, echoing the complaints of
modern-day recording executives about Napster and MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies continued to be stingy with their music up
until 1942, when Capitol Records broke from the pack and declared
that radio play actually helped its sales, Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Later home recording drew the ire of the big labels _ first
cassettes, then digital audio tapes, and now CD ``burners.'' The
industry says it loses $1.5 billion or more a year to home taping.
</P>
<P>
   At least when it came to cassettes, the record labels were
right. ``The record companies went into a big slump'' in late
1970s, Dowd said. ``One of the things that pulled them out was the
CD, which gave them a new form of recording that cassettes couldn't
rival.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with MP3 is that the masses, with the help of the
Internet, learned how to use it before the recording companies did.
</P>
<P>
   The technology actually has its roots not in music, but in
television. In 1992, a contract research group in Germany that was
searching for ways improve the sound of high-definition television
broadcasts discovered how to compress audio files. The technology
became a standard of the Moving Picture Experts Group known as MPEG
1 Layer 3, or later, MP3.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Robertson, a former computer advice columnist who
had started several other companies with little success, founded
MP3.com Inc. here in March 1998, computer and music enthusiasts
around the world were already swapping MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford University, in a harbinger of what was to come, a
student put more than 100 songs on a Web server and an estimated
2,000 people a day logged on to download free tunes, clogging the
university's Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's company was the first to make a sizeable business
out of housing and downloading songs. But even though MP3.com had
thousands of songs available on line (today it claims more than
600,000), big record labels paid little public attention to the
company, largely because most of the artists were little-known
bands.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, MP3 technology got the recording industry's
attention in a big way. Diamond Multimedia Inc. introduced a
portable MP3 player that could play downloaded music like a
Walkman. The RIAA filed suit seeking to keep Diamond from releasing
its Rio player, but it failed. Rio's popularity soared.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, the RIAA would try again to stop the
spread of MP3 music. This time, they focused on a 19-year-old
Northeastern University dropout named Shawn Fanning.
</P>
<P>
   Buying time
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, Fanning moved to the heart of technology,
Silicon Valley, to commercialize a revolutionary new file exchange
software program he wrote to help him and his friends exchange MP3
files. The nappy-haired teen reportedly used one of his own
nicknames in calling his company Napster Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is a file-sharing site that lets users find and download
music that's stored on other users' computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   It dramatically widened the sources for music files beyond those
on the MP3.com site. MP3.com says visitors to its site are simply
accessing music from CDs they already own, but record companies
claim the music files are illegal copies that MP3.com made and
stored on its servers, and that many of its users are otherwise
sharing music that they don't own.
</P>
<P>
   Napster became an overnight sensation. With it, anybody with
Internet access and a CD-ROM drive can exchange digitized music,
whether it's copyrighted or not. The file trading software became
so popular at colleges and universities that it clogged Internet
systems and shut down servers. Fanning became something of a pop
idol, even getting a spot on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies got angry.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, the RIAA and 17 major labels filed suit
against Napster, claiming its 20 million users cost them more than
$700 million in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the recording industry's five biggest labels also
sued MP3.com. All but one of those has settled, but damages from
the still-pending suit by Universal Music Group could cost MP3.com
$118 million or more. A judge is scheduled to decide final damages
in the MP3.com case next month.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the record labels claimed the companies violated
copyrights held by them and their artists.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the record companies filed suit,
according to some critics. They simply wanted to buy some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about trying to slow it down,'' said Heath Terry, who
follows Internet trends for the Credit Suisse First Boston
investment banking firm, which was the lead underwriter in
MP3.com's July 1999 initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recording industry right now is terrified,'' he said.
``They just want everybody to stop and give them time to figure it
out, and they're going to throw up whatever roadblock they can to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes, fast and slow
</P>
<P>
   So far, the roadblocks seem to be working, and the record
companies have used their time wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Since filing their suits against Napster and MP3.com, nearly
every major record label has started a major Internet initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group
announced they would develop an online subscription-based music
service. In July, EMI Group started offering 100 digital albums for
sale through online retailers. In September, Warner Music Group
announced plans to put more than 1,000 albums for sale on the
Internet beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Napster and MP3.com, where thousands of tunes can
be downloaded daily (and for free), the music industry's offerings
are paltry. And industry executives admit they have been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated process,'' said RIAA spokesman Doug Curry.
``It's much easier for someone to upload thousands of CDs and put
them online for free as opposed to changing 60 years of a large
industry's practices overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians and Internet companies are changing virtually
overnight, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bands Primitive Radio Gods and Arrested Development
recently agreed to pre-release songs from upcoming CDs on Napster
to generate interest in the new discs. Popular California punk band
Offspring last month announced it would post its entire new CD on
the Internet, but later reneged under pressure from their recording
label, Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists may soon start using the recording labels'
newfound vulnerability as leverage when negotiating contracts or
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will in fact kind of create a free agency for the artist if
the Internet becomes a safer place for the artist to be,'' said
talent agent Ron Stone, who represents musicians including Bonnie
Raitt, Ziggy Marley and Tracy Chapman. ``There are going to be some
artists ... who will use the Internet to create new relationships
with record companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the organizers of a group called Artists Against
Piracy, Stone detests Napster and other online companies that don't
pay royalties to musicians. But he, and many of the musicians he
represents, aren't opposed to digital distribution of music _ as
long as they get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to Napster technology, we're opposed to the
Napster business model,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some online music companies are, in fact, changing their
business models.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com recently launched subscription channels that let
subscribers listen to nonstop classical or children's tunes, much
like digital cable music channels, for a monthly fee. Its new
retail business already has about 100 stores and restaurants as
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to pay, we'll write the check and we'll move on,''
MP3.com's Robertson said, referring to the possibility of costly
damages in its lawsuit. ``Technology marches forward. And as we're
a technology company, we must seize the opportunities as they come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   None of what the companies are doing really matters to music
fans like 21-year-old Juan Pieterse, a third-year college student
in South Africa. Pieterse claims he hasn't bought a CD in two
years, but he has downloaded countless tunes over the Internet
using Napster and other services.
</P>
<P>
   If Napster gets shut down this week, he'll likely just go to
another file-sharing system, such as Gnutella, to get free copies
of songs from favorite bands like Metallica, REM and Offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, one does not need to be a rocket scientist to
download or upload illegal copies of songs,'' Pieterse wrote in an
e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pieterse is the kind of music listener that the major record
labels fear most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who will purchase CDs in the future,'' he
wrote, ``are people who don't have portable MP3 players or PCs.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seiji Ozawa settled a little carefully into a corner of
the couch in the conductor's green room in Symphony Hall Tuesday.
The conductor is back in Boston, eager to launch the season-long
100th anniversary celebration of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's
great home.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, he returned to the hall he first entered in 1968
to lead a performance of Beethoven's ``Missa Solemnis,'' the same
work the orchestra chose for the Hall's opening night on Oct. 15,
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa seemed satisfied with the progress of rehearsals, with the
condition of the orchestra, the promise and accomplishment of new
players, and the seriousness of purpose with which the Tanglewood
Festival Chorus has prepared the work.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa first conducted the ``Missa Solemnis'' 30 years ago, for
the opening of the NHK Orchestra's hall in Tokyo; his most recent
performance, last season, was also in Japan. He was so happy with
the soprano, Emiko Suga, that he engaged her for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Missa Solemnis is a very difficult piece, something very
strong and raw _ it doesn't have much to do with conventional
religion. The music insists, and Beethoven had something important
he wanted to say, very urgently.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's season includes two major premieres, the Second Symphony
by John Corigliano in November and ``The Map,'' ``a multi-media
concerto for cello and orchestra'' in February. Neither score has
come in yet, which makes Ozawa a little nervous. But the
Corigliano, a 35-minute work for strings, harp and percussion is
reportedly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa will also conduct a revised version of the Cello Concerto
that John Williams wrote for Yo-Yo Ma and the opening of Seiji
Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood. ``This is a very complicated piece,''
Ozawa says, ``and very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly happy to present the first local performances
of the late Toru Takemitsu's ``From me flows what you call Time''
in the second week of the season. This work was premiered by the
Boston Symphony in New York a decade ago, but there was no Boston
peformance because the piece had been jointly commissioned by
Carnegie Hall and Suntory Hall in Tokyo, and Carnegie Hall
naturally insisted on the premiere. One of Ozawa's closest musical
friendships was with Takemitsu, and the composer's widow and
daughter are flying to Boston for the performances. ``This piece
will sound wonderful in Symphony Hall,'' Ozawa says.
</P>
<P>
   Another Japanese artist that Ozawa will introduce in December is
the pianist Momo Kodama, who will play Tchaikovsky's First
Concerto. ``She is the sister-in-law of the conductor Kent Nagano,
and a very unusual and sensitive artist who lives in Paris now. I
have done the Tchaikovsky with her before, and her interpretation
is completely different and full of lightness.''
</P>
<P>
   In April and May, Ozawa returns for a Beethoven Piano Concerto
cycle with Alfred Brendel and his first performance, believe it or
not, of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, a work indelibly associated
with his mentor, Leonard Bernstein (whose famous recording with the
New York Philharmonic was made in Symphony Hall). ``I was supposed
to conduct the Shostakovich before, but after I heard Slava
(Rostropovich) do it with the National Symphony on tour in Symphony
Hall, I gave it up. The other piece I gave up was Debussy's `Jeux,'
which is the only major piece by Debussy I have never conducted,
but after I heard Pierre Boulez conduct it, I decided to stay
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendel has been a favorite colleague for 35 years. ``Herbert
von Karajan insisted that I make my debut at the Salzburg Festival
in 1964 or 1965, and Brendel played the Brahms Second Concerto _ he
was making his Salzburg Festival debut, too. We have played the
Beethoven concertos at Tanglewood and in Japan. He is wonderful in
the way he finds the character of each piece; each of the Beethoven
concertos has a fantasy life. This is something very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa was last in the local news when he played the Good
Samaritan after the final performance of Verdi's ``Falstaff'' at
the Tanglewood Music Center. He was driving to his West Stockbridge
home after the performance and stopped to assist a driver whose car
was halfway off the road. He now thinks that during the incident he
may have pulled something in his back which is still bothering him
_ that's why he settled a little gingerly into position.
</P>
<P>
   There was no rest for Ozawa after his Tanglewood season. He went
directly to Japan to preside over the ninth annual Saito Kinen
Festival, where he led performances of Bach's B-Minor Mass with
several of the same soloists who will perform the work with him
here in February.
</P>
<P>
   There was no opera at Saito Kinen this season, but earlier this
year, Ozawa had led performances of Mozart's ``The Marriage of
Figaro'' in Japan with an important international cast and an
orchestra of the best young Japanese players. ``Robert Mann, who
led the Juilliard Quartet for 50 years, has been coming to Japan to
work with young string players on quartets, and this is an
outgrowth of that. I think playing opera with very good singers is
the best training for young musicians. We proved this at
Tanglewood, where all the good things about the Tanglewood Music
Center came out _ the talent and energy of the singers and the
instrumentalists. The experience was really wonderful. This kind of
experience is particularly important in Japan, where young
musicians have acquired a tremendous technique but sometimes are
afraid of involvement. Opera is so clear in the emotions that it is
good for musicians like these. Next, we will do `Cosi fan tutte'
and `Don Giovanni' with singers like Bryn Terfel.''
</P>
<P>
   After three days off following Saito Kinen, Ozawa traveled to
China to meet up with his old friend Mstislav Rostropovich.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa and Rostropovich have collaborated for decades on the
world's great concert stages. Less well-known are the regular
``caravans'' they undertake to bring music to underserved regions
of Japan and Russia. The musicians travel by bus and truck to
remote sites; the sides of the truck are lowered to create a
concert platform.
</P>
<P>
   The recent China trip came about because the BSO's
long-anticipated return last year was cancelled because of an
international crisis. Ozawa went on alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so impressed by the level of the music students that I
called up Slava and asked him to come with me this year to Shanghai
and Beijing for rehearsals, master classes, and performances. He
worked very hard _ he played both a Haydn Concerto and the Dvorak
Concerto. We rehearsed and gave two concerts in both cities, and
all of them were free. The orchestras played very well, and we were
very happy _ and he found three excellent cellists. Our next
caravan is in August, 2002, and we hope the cellists will come with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa was born in Hoten, Manchuria in 1935 and spent his
childhood years in Beijing. His mother, now 92, insisted on joining
him for this recent trip to Beijing. ``We went back to see the
house where I grew up. Once my brother borrowed a pistol from a
military policeman who was courting our maid and shot three holes
in the entranceway, and they are still there!''
</P>
<P>
   The Symphony Hall centennial found Ozawa in a reminiscent mood
about his introduction to the building. He came to conduct the BSO
in Boston for the first time in 1968 _ the program included
Bernstein's ``Age of Anxiety'' and the second suite from Ravel's
``Daphnis and Chloe.'' He remembers how he profited from the advice
of his mentor, former music director Charles Munch. ``It was the
last time I saw him. He heard the rehearsal and helped me with the
flute solo accompaniment _ I think I had a problem!''
</P>
<P>
   In the BSO's forthcoming coffee table book ``Symphony Hall: The
First Hundred Years,'' Ozawa's remarks about the hall at a press
conference last April are quoted. ``Nothing prepared me for the
sound of the Boston Symphony _ so warm and clear, and effortless. I
am convinced that what we know as the `Boston Symphony sound' has
been created by these acoustics. The orchestra never has to force
or push. The sound just flies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa recalled the first time he conducted there. He and his
wife Vera were staying at the Eliot Hotel because it would accept
the family Yorkshire terrier. ``They told me I could walk to the
hall _ it was winter, dark and cold, and the neighborhood was not
so good back then. There were terrible Chinese restaurants. And
when I arrived here there was no sign on the big brick building,
and it didn't even look like a concert hall. But I walked inside,
and there was Symphony Hall . . .''

RANDALL IS AS SPENSER DOES, BUT NOT AS WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Perish Twice 
By Robert B. Parker 
Putnam, 265 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunny Randall is not just Spenser in drag, wearing low boots and
the latest in cropped pants, black, and a black sweater with a
scoop neck and some nice silver jewelry, her natural blond hair
newly highlighted by the hairdresser. One can hardly imagine
Spenser saying ``eek'' the way Sunny does when someone lights up a
cigarette. Unlike Spenser, Sunny says she doesn't read poetry _ but
she does remember some, and quote it. Spenser probably wouldn't
wear coral tights and cutting-edge sneakers to the gym, the way
Sunny does.
</P>
<P>
   These differences apart, Sunny does sound pretty much like her
creator's most celebrated creation _ and now, not 25 years ago,
when he was her age. She thinks like Spenser, alternates
sensitivity and wisecracks like Spenser: ``I tried the derringer in
my bra. It was too heavy, it interfered with the bra's primary
duty, and it made me look like I was carrying a concealed
unicorn.'' She lavishes pages of sloppy wet kisses on a dog, like
Spenser, and acts on a code of honor, like Spenser.
</P>
<P>
   In Robert B. Parker's ``Perish Twice,'' Sunny is dismissed from
a case 60 pages into the book, but of course she won't give up _
she has to find out what has happened, and why someone has been
murdered, even though the police have officially closed the case
and she is no longer being paid. Sunny seems peculiarly
uninterested in money.
</P>
<P>
   The case is a messy one. Sunny has been approached by a militant
lesbian feminist named Mary Lou Goddard who believes she is being
stalked.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mary Lou knows she's being stalked, and who is stalking
her, and why _ though she does not choose to share this information
with Sunny. She just wants protection, which Sunny supplies. Before
long, a woman who resembles Mary Lou and works in her office is
murdered, and Sunny has been called off the case, in part because
she knows more than Mary Lou wants her to _ but not enough to make
sense of the events or of the cast of characters, which includes a
loser named Lawrence B. Reeves, vice lord Tony Marcus, superpimp
Jermaine Lister, the jittery shooter Ty-Bop, a nice whore named
Jewell, and a mysterious creature named Natalie who looks stylish
and speaks with elegance when she isn't screaming. Jewell has a
habit, and as she scans the street for the candy man, Sunny sagely
observes that she is waiting for Godot.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny devotes about a third of her time in ``Perish Twice'' to
these people and the tangle of their sex lives. Another third goes
to her hopelessly out-of-it sister Elizabeth and her messed-up sex
life. And the rest goes to sisterly conversations over white wine
with her best friend Julie, the therapist, who is determined to
mess up her own sex life.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much about Sunny's sex life, but her ex-husband, the
straight member of an Irish mob family, is still around; they have
dinner once a week and sometimes sleep together.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny manages to sort out the main case, with a little help from
her friends, including the gay bistro owner and karate expert
Spike; her ex-husband and his family; and a police officer familiar
from the Spenser series. For a feisty protofeminist, Sunny is
perhaps a little too dependent on her friends _ she manages to
assemble a lot of information but cannot see the patterns,
meanwhile placing herself in the kind of physical danger that
requires gallant male protection. Meanwhile Elizabeth and Julie
tediously muddle through to somewhat more sensible destinies than
the ones they seem to be headed for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perish Twice'' has a big theme: It's about sex, and how sex
intersects both with love and with hate, with fire and with ice, to
quote a poem by Robert Frost that Julie shares with Sunny. Parker
has engaged this theme before, more effectively. Here he has
trouble focusing. All the familiar mannerisms appear _ the
restaurants, the local traffic patterns, the awfulness of
pretentious people, and the fundamental decency of the little guy
and of the whore with the heart of gold; the Boston brand names _
but the energy level is low. The mystery, such as it is, is solved,
not settled, and self-knowledge seems more elusive than ever. It
would be nice to think that was the point, but as early as her
second adventure, much of which repeats her first, Parker seems
tired of Sunny, and it's hard not to share the feeling.

FACTORING IN BILL O'REILLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Rodney Dangerfield, Bill O'Reilly gets no respect. At least
among mainstream media poobahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the hottest news show in the country, and now I have
the hottest book in the country, and I can't get on these shows,''
says the host of Fox News Channel's ``The O'Reilly Factor,''
complaining that some influential TV outlets are ignoring his book
tour because ``I'm a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his claims, well, he is hot. Nielsen numbers _ comparing
August 1999 ratings to August 2000 ratings _ show ``The O'Reilly
Factor'' still trails CNN rival Larry King's show by more than a 2
to 1 ratio. But while King's audience has dropped by nearly 20
percent in that period, O'Reilly's viewership has grown by nearly
50 percent. And his new book _ unsurprisingly titled ``The O'Reilly
Factor: The Good, the Bad, and the Completely Ridiculous in
American Life'' _ is a lofty number seven on The New York Times
bestseller list. That news may be leavened, however, by the fact
that it is still three places behind psychic Sylvia Browne's
``guided tour of the afterlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the success of a book that claims to deliver the
straight skinny on America's fundamental truths, O'Reilly goes into
full Frank Capra mode. ``People believe what I'm saying is true,''
he says in an interview. ``And I trust the folks.'' (Or, as he
writes in the book: ``I will get to the pith quickly and
undiplomatically _ even if the pith piths you off.'')
</P>
<P>
   For much of his career, O'Reilly was a conventional journalist,
working in local TV news, at CBS and ABC, and spending a lot of
time in tweedy, tradition-bound Boston. He attended Boston
University, worked at WCVB-TV (Channel 5) and WHDH-TV (Channel 7),
and developed the idea for his current show while getting a
master's degree from Harvard, where he landed after leaving his gig
as host of ``Inside Edition.'' In his book, O'Reilly conveniently
describes `Inside Edition'' as a forerunner of such shows as
``Dateline'' and ``48 Hours,'' instead of as a kissin' cousin of
such tabloid fare as ``Current Affair'' or ``Hard Copy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we did Madonna and Michael Jackson'' on ``Inside
Edition,'' he admits. ``Because you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly says Fox News chairman Roger Ailes bought the concept
of ``The O'Reilly Factor'' without even hearing the details.
(``Ailes just stays out of my way,'' he adds.) And today, its
feisty star is a poster boy for the Fox News Channel, where growing
ratings recently inspired a New York Times story.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it's easier to define the Fox News Channel by what
it's against than what it is. Its clever slogan, ``We Report, You
Decide,'' reflects its self-proclaimed niche as the antidote to
pervasive liberal bias in the media. When asked to expound on that
issue, O'Reilly turns diplomatic, suggesting the problem with other
networks is ``more censorship than bias.'' But he offers other
vocal criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with television news in the year 2000 is that it's
no longer necessary,'' he says. ``The network chiefs don't
understand that . . . It's over for the Establishment, that's for
sure. It's like the last days of Pompeii.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks' philosophy is that we're going to decide what
information is important,'' he continues. At Fox News Channel,
``we're not gonna do that. We're going to give you all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the words of a committed populist and
anti-gatekeeper journalist. Until you ask O'Reilly to define his
role. ``I'm an analyst,'' he says crisply. ``I look at the news of
the day, and I figure out what's more relevant to people, and I try
to bring out the real truth of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it must be working. As the never immodest O'Reilly is proud
to proclaim, the show generates 10,000 letters a week or ``more
than Oprah Winfrey.''
</P>
<P>
   So who needs the adulation of the mainstream media?

FARCE IN THE COURTROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week after the second Reggie Lewis trial ended in a verdict
against his widow last May, attorney Neil Rossman had a talk with
his client, Donna Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict that Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. was not culpable in
the death of the former Celtics captain Reggie Lewis was likely
final, he told her. There were no legal grounds for an appeal. They
had received a fair trial; they had simply lost.
</P>
<P>
   When Harris-Lewis told Rossman she intended to appeal the
verdict regardless of his opinion, he asked her what she thought
her grounds might be.
</P>
<P>
   She informed him that she was going to appeal based on the
racial makeup of the jury, as well as the fact that Judge Thayer
Fremont-Smith had refused to have portions of the transcript read
back to the jury. Rossman said those were not grounds for appeal
and that he would not represent her. He was particularly
uncomfortable with the idea that race would be the foundation of
her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rosssman's refusal to handle what he correctly branded an
``intellectually bankrupt'' appeal landed him in a strange position
this week, unfamiliar even for someone who has spent close to 29
years in courtrooms, as he has.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the stand in Suffolk Superior Court testifying under
oath, every shred of the time-honored bond between attorney and
client breached. Harris-Lewis is pursuing a third trial. Rossman
stands accused, in effect, of not protecting his client's rights,
by allowing Mudge's motion for a dismissal of the appeal to go
unchallenged. Under questioning from his former adversary, William
J. Dailey Jr., and his onetime client's new lawyer, Pamela
Harris-Daley, Rossman insisted that he was not at fault for the
failure to contest the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was a joke. Around and around the lawyers went on
matters of legal minutiae _ when memos were sent, when faxes were
sent, even whether a filing by Mudge had been faxed with a cover
letter, or without. It had little to do with law and nothing to do
with justice. It was all about how to work the system, how to get
another roll of the dice.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours on the witness stand, Rossman talked with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fair trial and an attentive jury and I tried the case
that I wanted to try,'' Rossman said. ``It was just a (complicated)
case and we couldn't convince that jury that our position was the
correct position. It had nothing to do with race. It has to do with
medicine and medical testimony. Another jury could have come out
with another conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was telling Harris-Lewis he would not handle her
appeal, Rossman told her something else.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told her she could always find a lawyer to take
$100,000 of her money, go through the trial record, and tell her
there were no grounds for appeal. Or to write a brief for an appeal
going nowhere. Some lawyer would gladly take advantage of her. He
urged her instead to think of her reputation, her two children, and
the Reggie Lewis Foundation. He scheduled two meetings to try to
prevail on her, in person, to finally let it go. Harris-Lewis, he
testified, canceled both. Too bad. It was good advice.
</P>
<P>
   This case was tragic, then it was just sad. Now it has entered
the realm of farce. It has been tried and retried, and the
consensus of those who watched it was that Harris-Lewis enjoyed
stellar representation in the second trial in particular. Two
juries have failed to conclude that Mudge's care killed Lewis.
That's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, as Harris-Daley was claiming to find deep meaning
in yet another irrelevant piece of correspondence, she came
uncomfortably close to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Rossman, glasses perched atop his forehead, objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're making me dizzy,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   After two trials, two verdicts, and the prospect of more to
come, Rossman could have been speaking for a lot of us.

ROMANIAN GYMNAST'S APPEAL IS REJECTED BY IOC COURT OF ARBITRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Andreea Raducan still cannot believe her
gold medal for winning the gymnastics individual all-around
competition was stripped from her for taking a cold medication that
contained a substance banned by the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And even Thursday, as the Court of Arbitration upheld the IOC's
decision, the 16-year-old continued to be mystified that taking an
over-the-counter drug, pseudoephedrine, that was administered by
the Romanian team doctor, could result in such a drastic outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took an innocent pill because I wasn't feeling well,'' she
said through a translator. ``It didn't help me to compete but gave
me some dizziness that impeded my competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed,'' she added. ``It's not for me to judge the
decision, but I am convinced and my heart is at peace that I did
everything right and competed fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan won the all-around event on September 21, but a
subsequent urine sample detected traces of pseudoephedrine, leading
the IOC to take back her gold medal. On Wednesday, the Court of
Arbitration heard her appeal during a 4{-hour hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member panel acknowledged that pseudoephedrine did not
enhance Raducan's performance, but ruled that the positive drug
offense violated the Olympic anti-doping code.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strict liability test must thus be applied,'' the court said
in a brief opinion, ``the consequence being automatic
disqualification as a matter of law and in fairness to all other
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The court held that the ``presence of a prohibited substance in
a competitor's bodily fluid'' is the threshold issue, not whether
Raducan intended to ``ingest the prohibited substance.'' As a
result, it said, the anti-doping code ``must be enforced without
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who defended Raducan at the hearing sought an exception to
the zero-tolerance policy, precisely because there was no sinister
intent and because of her confidence that her doctor would not give
her a banned substance. But to the court, ignorance of the code was
not a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Comaneci, who won three gold medals in the 1976 Summer
Olympics, including one in the individual all-around event, said,
``It's difficult for me to explain to her that she is innocent but
she's having the medal taken from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ion Tiriac, the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee,
criticized the court of arbitration for being less interested in
the law than it should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed it was a court of law and nothing about
sports and it would look at every case for its merits where
somebody has to be proved guilty beyond any other doubt,
particularly with this case,'' he said. ``We're talking about
aspirin, not drugs.'' Regarding the IOC, he said, ``They don't have
the courage to say in this case they might have been mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiriac said he will resign his position rather than enforce
against Raducan his blanket policy of banning for life all Romanian
athletes from competing in the Olympics if they test positive for
drugs. ``I could not look her in the eyes and for an aspirin ban
her for life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiriac defended the doctor who gave Raducan the medication yet
blamed him for his apparent ignorance about the banned substance.
The doctor, Ioachin Oana, was expelled for the remainder of the
Summer Games and banned from the 2002 Winter and 2004 Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man, but he will be the devil from now on,''
Tiriac said. ``He does his best, but he uses what's on hand.. He's
experienced but not really Olympic-experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiriac added: ``He didn't study every cold remedy, but may have
known it was on the banned list.''
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiaries of the revocation of Raducan's gold medal were
her Romanian teammates: Simona Amanar moved up from the silver, and
Maria Olaru swapped bronze for silver. The fourth-place finisher
Liu Xuan of China gets the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the medal doesn't mean anything,'' Amanar said. ``I'm
going to accept it because it belongs to Romania. But I didn't win
it. The Olympic champion that day was Andreea, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Raducan lost the all-around gold, she was allowed to
keep the gold she won as part of the team competition and the
silver medal she won in the vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole dream in my life was to come to the Olympics and
maybe win a medal,'' Raducan said. ``I did that. But life goes on
and I just have to get over this as soon as I can. We did a good
job here. I lost a medal, maybe, but in my soul, I know it was my
place.''

A BIT ON DRILL BITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You have written about a new drill bit for drilling ceramic
tile and glass. Could such a bit be used to drill a hole in a
ceramic soap dish that is much thicker than tile, to allow
drainage?
</P>
<P>
   JASON ALBANO, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. In a word, yes. You don't have to use that special bit (made
by Black &AMP; Decker) either, but it will not hurt. The main secret to
success is to go slow and easy. Use a variable-speed drill and take
your time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a number of pressboard shelves that are giving off
formaldehyde. I replaced most of them with wood, but I can't get to
some of them to replace them. What can I use to seal in that
formaldehyde?
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS EVANS, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Prime the pressboard shelves on all surfaces with an
oil-based interior primer, and finish with a latex enamel or latex
eggshell finish paint. Or, use two coats of an oil-based
polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the books: A fungus, similar to mold or even an
evil mushroom, one that lurks in wood and bark mulch, fires a spore
as high as 15 feet, making a dark spot on your siding, all
resistant to bleach.
</P>
<P>
   That is what H.L. of Newton, Mass. had when he called the
handyman with a fervent ``Help!''
</P>
<P>
   H.L. found out about the spore from the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society, which put him in touch with scientists at
Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus is called, not surprisingly, the artillery fungus,
and is common on both the east and west coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The spores not only make a mess on house siding, but they are
resistant to bleach and virtually impossible to remove. Actually,
soaking with detergent, and scrubbing, and scraping, and sanding
will eventually remove them. Untreated, they can live up to 10 or
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure, but there is a way to prevent future
bombardments. H.L. simply removed all the mulch and replaced it
with black plastic and crushed stone.
</P>
<P>
   -------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new house has four bathrooms with top-of-the-line
fixtures. In some sinks, I get a smell of rotten eggs when I turn
on the cold water. After a short time, it stops. How can I elminate
that odor?D.L., Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The odor is caused by hydrgen sulphide dissolved in the
water. It may be occurring naturally or could be due to a buildup
of bacteria. Sometimes aeration will help; that is what you did
when you turned on the water and let it run. Sometimes you may need
special filters; consult your local water department for advice.
Sometimes the water, especially if it is well water, will need
chlorination.
</P>
<P>
   If it is from a bacterial buildup, it may be due to a dirty
filter, which could be replaced. Check the faucet aerator, too, the
gizmo that screws on the end of the tap. Filters and aerators can
collect a lot of bacteria. Replace filters as necessary. Unscrew
the aerator, take out the gaskets and washers, clean them
thoroughly, and put everything back together. A new house should
not have dirty filters or blocked aerators, but that depends on
what is meant by ``new.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My baseboard heating fins are very dirty, caked with crud and
dusty. Is there an outfit that could clean them, for a fee? The
fins are under a removable metal cover.
</P>
<P>
   M.E.K., Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Hmm. There are plenty of duct cleaners for hot-air ducts out
there; that has been all the rage in the past 10 years or so. But I
have never heard of fin cleaners. Fins should be cleaned because
when they get caked up, they lose a great deal of their efficiency.
You might call a duct cleaner to see if he could do the fins, but
that would require different tools.
</P>
<P>
   So, it may boil down to cleaning your own fins. Use a soft brush
on your vacuum to remove loose dust. Then you may have to scrape
between the fins with a dull knife or even an old credit card,
being careful not to bend the fins. After scraping, use the vacuum
again to pick up the spillage.
</P>
<P>
   If you can develop a fast, efficient way to clean the fins
safely, you could start your own fin-cleaning business.

HOW TO REALLY MAKE A ROOM SPARKLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine yourself a dot-com millionaire living in a stylin' loft
with soaring windows. What do you cover them with? Chintz, perhaps?
Too much like mother. Moire? Too much like grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   How about fiber optics? Very motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss company, Creation Baumann, has launched a line of
``cyber fabrics,'' wall-sized mesh and cotton panels entwined with
state-of-the art touches like strands of copper and aluminum,
metallic paper, and even razor-thin fiber optic cables that glow
blue when the panel is plugged in. They're aimed at
design-conscious techies who want the most modern touches in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Gen X computer kids who have their parents' antiques
passed down to them, but want to jazz them up with something very
new,'' said Julie Mullin, manager of Furn &AMP; Co. at the Boston
Design Center, ``something they know they're not going to see
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-foot panels are used as curtains, duvet covers, room
dividers, motorized screens, and shower curtains. The copper and
aluminum mix combines with flexible mesh to give the fabrics a
crinkly texture and shimmery glow. A balloon shade made from the
pliable fabric is not raised by string to let in the sunshine, but
scrunched into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Stiffer metallic papers (also being used on fashion runways for
jackets a la Judy Jetson) are two-toned (think silver and copper)
with high sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Laser technology is used to cut out girly swirls on one white
cotton panel, a new twist on the lacy eyelet of old, and to create
lifelike and boldly colored flowers, vegetables, and cutlery on
another.
</P>
<P>
   One white panel is bedecked in plastic butterflies, beetles, and
blades of grass that glow in the dark once they're exposed to
light.
</P>
<P>
   The piece de resistance, though, is a two-sided white mesh panel
that looks like a bridal veil. Yards and yards of transparent fiber
optics are sandwiched between the layers, all with twinkling blue
lights at their tips, forming the shapes of the constellations.
Clear glass orbs, made by the glassmasters of Murano, Italy, are
sewn on randomly to intensify the sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a German bride who wanted her train to light up the
night sky when she walked down the aisle, (and had a battery pack
tucked into her gown to pull it off), the ethereal panel evokes the
heavens and has a price tag that's sky high: $1,559.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said a Saudi Arabian prince recently purchased two of the
panels to hang from the black ceiling of his media room, so it
would glitter with the magic of night. Local royalty, however, have
been slower in placing their orders, Mullin said, because ``Boston
is still pretty traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Creation Baumann sells only to the trade, and Furn &AMP; Co. is the
only design shop in Boston carrying the fabrics. So, anyone
interested in seeing or purchasing the fabrics must work through a
designer or decorator.

BEFORE GETTING COZY, CHECK THE CHIMNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lynette Smith and Richard Bohmer were house hunting last
year, finding a home with a fireplace or two was a top priority.
Originally from New Zealand, the Smiths heated their previous homes
by burning wood in the fireplace, and wanted the same ambiance and
warmth in their American abode.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally purchased a 50-year-old Cape with two
fireplaces in Wellesley, Mass., they immediately scheduled a
chimney sweep, and last week had a second inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some friends had a fire in their chimney that wasn't major,
but it left us with a healthy respect for fire,'' Smith said. ``We
sit in front of the fire almost every night reading stories to the
kids and we want to be sure it's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, when homeowners' fancies turn to cozying up
by the hearth, fire-protection specialists warn they should cozy up
to a chimney sweep first and make certain the fireplace flues have
not accumulated a dangerous layer of creosote, a wood and smoke
residue that clings to the inside of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   If left untreated for too long, creosote can combust and cause
serious damage. According to the National Fire Protection Agency in
Quincy, Mass., there were 9,900 chimney fires in the United States
in 1997 (the most recent data available), causing eight deaths and
$57.7 million in property losses.
</P>
<P>
   There were 132 chimney fires in Massachusetts in 1998, resulting
in four injuries, according to the state fire marshal's office.
Thirty-six percent of those fires were caused by creosote buildup
and lack of chimney maintenance, according to the office.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Dubay, a fire-protection engineer with the NFP, said
the agency recommends chimneys be inspected annually for creosote
as well as cracks in the lining, nests, animals, leaks, and other
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are actively using your chimney for burning wood or
coal, you must have it inspected once a year,'' he said. ``That
also goes for wood-burning stoves. An inspection will quickly tell
you whether you have problems before you start your first fire of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   He said homeowners should invest in caps for their chimneys to
prevent debris and critters from getting inside, and keep the
dampers closed when the fireplace is not in use. He warned that
when a fire is burning, all household materials should be kept at
least 3 feet from the flames. He said screens or glass doors should
be used to block sparks from jumping out of the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not complicated stuff,'' Dubay said. ``The average
homeowner uses their fireplace for romance, not heating, so we're
not talking about extreme fires. But caution should always be
used.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are several self-cleaning tools on the market,
Dubay recommended that homeowners hire a professional chimney sweep
company rather than attempt the sooty task themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Bill Heffernan, owner of Master Chimney Sweepers in
Natick, Mass., acknowledged that chimney sweeping is dirty work,
but only for the chimney sweep. He said that his workers take great
care to set down drop cloths, use industrial vacuums, and not touch
anything once they are inside the home.
</P>
<P>
   The job is still generally done the old-fashioned way, from the
firebox up, not the top of the chimney down, with long brushes for
scraping and flexible mirrors and lights for examining every
crevice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people telling us all the time they didn't want to call
a chimney sweep because they thought we'd ruin the carpet,'' he
said. ``People shouldn't fear their homes getting dirty. That's as
important to us as anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan said people whose chimneys are more than 20 years old
should be extra vigilant about keeping them clean and clear, since
age and deterioration go hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
   He and Dubay also recommended an annual inspection of the
furnace flue to make sure it is venting properly. Clogging or
damage could lead to carbon monoxide leakage, and poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   While the chimney-sweeping process has remained relatively
unchanged for centuries (Charles Dickens' street scenes leap to
mind), there are some new products and technologies available.
ChimScan is a specially designed video camera some professionals
send up into the chimney for a closer view of the flue. Typically,
there is no extra charge for the use of ChimScan, but homeowners
are advised to inquire first.

   New to the market this season is the Sweeping Log, a mineral
compound made by Securiflame that you sprinkle onto a wood fire. It
promises to reduce and shake loose deposits of tar and creosote
from inside the chimney. It is not intended to be used in place of
an inspection by a professional, said Sweeping Log spokeswoman
Suzanne Hart, but ``in conjunction with'' one. It is available only
on the Internet at www.sweepinglog.com for $24.95 per log.
</P>
<P>
   Dubay said the best way to find a reliable chimney sweep is to
ask friends or call your local fire department for referrals.
Heffernan, who charges $169 for cleaning one flue, said consumers
should look for sweeps who are accredited by the Chimney Safety
Institute of America.

THERE'S NO `FIGHT' TO IT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shopworn hallmarks of the girls-in-sports genre are easily
recognizable: a social-misfit tomboy; authority figures who at
first resist, but then cave in and allow her to suit up; a romance
with a male teammate or rival; and ultimate redemption, usually
shot in sensuous slow-motion. Heck, at some point, you can usually
even expect a grizzled old man to stand up and say something like,
``A girl? No stinkin' girl can play (fill in the sport).''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Karyn Kusama's ``Girlfight'' _ about a Latina
high school senior from Brooklyn who wants to box _ has all these
cliches and more, including a few even hokier ones about an abusive
dad, an unsupportive best friend, and a leggy looker who wants to
make our girl's boyfriend her own. But what makes ``Girlfight''
such a chore to watch is that it isn't content to wallow in its own
shamelessness; indeed, anyone who has gorged on such late-night USA
Network classics as ``The Next Karate Kid'' (the movie Hilary Swank
made before ``Boys Don't Cry'') or the Helen Hunt TV movie
``Quarterback Princess,'' can only sit back and wonder: Does the
director really expect us to take this stuff seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how she does. From the first shot _ a close-up of star
Michelle Rodriguez's face, eyeballs rolled up in their sockets _
this picture is as serious (and as dreary) as a heart attack. Diana
(Rodriguez), on the verge of expulsion at school for all the fights
she's been in, sees a possible outlet in the boxing club where her
younger brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) trains. Without telling her
father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), she starts scraping together the
money for lessons _ at first resistant to the challenges, and then
welcoming them, and then, well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a stronger director could have given this material a lift.
Kusama certainly can't. Her camera is either stationary and poised
in medium shot, or herky-jerky and in the characters' faces _ but
there's no rhyme or reason to any of her shooting choices. The
screenplay is a bigger problem. Written in flat declarative
sentences that the actors don't have the skill to lend any texture
to, it gives the film the feel of a seventh-grade stage production
in the early stages of rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Kasuma also wastes the potentially rich milieu of Brooklyn's
inner-city teen-age Latino community. She almost seems afraid to
explore these kids' music, their dress and particularly their
sexuality _ the movie comes up with more excuses for Diana and her
boxer boyfriend Adrian (Santiago Douglas) not to have sex than a
Hayes Code-bound 1940s screwball comedy. Newcomer Rodriguez, who's
in almost every scene, seems closed-off and tentative _ you feel
the lack of confidence in her line readings and even her physical
movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight'' shared the Grand Jury Prize (with Kenneth
Lonergan's soon-to-be-released ``You Can Count On Me'') at this
year's Sundance Film Festival. Such laurels should suggest great
promise _ until you remember that previous winners have included
the overwrought prison-poetry melodrama ``Slam,'' and the
featherweight crowd-pleaser ``The Brothers McMullen.'' I know
American independent filmmaking is supposed to give
underrepresentated racial and ethnic groups a voice in our
hegemonic film culture. But after seeing enough badly calculated,
badly made films, one has to ask: Is it really worth speaking up
when your voice sounds exactly the same as what we've been hearing
at the movies for decades?

THE CLICHE ZONE: PREACHY `TITANS' DROPS THE BALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its cast of bland-faced, buff-bodied young actors, its
shimmeringly photographed Southern landscapes, and a tendency to
resolve racial conflicts with pithy two-sentence speeches that
sound as if they were written by ad-copy men, ``Remember the
Titans'' is certainly something to behold _ it's like a filmed
adaptation of the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch catalog, except this catalog
has, like, really weighty themes, dude.
</P>
<P>
   In this football melodrama set in Virginia during a team's first
season of school desegregation, Denzel Washington plays an
African-American coach trying to integrate black and white players
who want nothing to do with one another. In other words, sanctimony
and sentimentality battle it out for two hours before finally
declaring a draw. (The only loser is the audience.)
</P>
<P>
   One senses trouble even before the first frame, when the logo
for Walt Disney Pictures appears on the screen. Do we really need
civics lessons from Mickey Mouse and Co.? It's not just that Disney
has displayed its own share of racial insensitivity over the years,
particularly in its cartoons like ``Song of the South,'' ``Dumbo,''
and ``Aladdin.'' It's that the Disney logo implies something
starched, uncomplicated and uplifting _ everything the issue of
school desegregation is not.
</P>
<P>
   So here we have a racial-conflict movie that paints everything
in the broadest and most obvious terms imaginable. Coach Boone
(Washington), relocated to Virginia from South Carolina and the
just-named head coach of the T.C. Williams High Titans football
team, is prickly, difficult and demanding _ but all in the service
of making his black and white charges come together as a team. Bill
Yoast (Will Patton), the white coach in line for the promotion that
went to Boone, harbors resentment, and maybe even racism _ but he
will come to respect Boone's integrity and commitment. The players,
black and white, are all stubborn and suspicious, but that's only
because they haven't had a chance to learn about one another. Once
they do, they can teach the disgruntled citizenry of Alexandria
that skin color doesn't matter _ it's what's inside a person that
matters most.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew the American racial divide could be so easily bridged?
Let's all link arms and sing ``Kum-Bah-Yah.'' (There is,
incidentally, much group singing of Motown classics on the part of
the football team, all of it cringe-inducing.) But before we get
too excited, let us ask this: Do the filmmakers think they're doing
anyone a service? The PG rating suggests that ``Titans'' is being
targeted at younger kids, but I imagine even the most naive will
sense something fishy about this picture's formulations: that
blacks and whites can find common ground by making ``Yo' mama''
jokes; that only the whites in the film would have trouble
accepting integrated schools and busing; that deep-rooted
prejudices can be assuaged by Washington periodically silencing
everyone and gravely intoning things like, ``If we don't come
together, right here, on this hallowed ground, we, too, will be
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest I've made ``Remember the Titans'' sound overly didactic,
rest assured that the film has also been conceived as cynically as
all of producer Jerry (''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' ``Armageddon'')
Bruckheimer's other films _ with the grandstanding interrupted
regularly with lots and lots of crowd-pleasing slop. The film
purports to be based on a true story _ but I don't think real life
often fits into the regularly repeated patterns on display here.
The boys engage in kooky antics; Washington pontificates; the team
almost loses but ultimately pulls out a victory. The only variation
is a final-act, tear-jerky twist that you can see coming about a
half-hour away.
</P>
<P>
   There is a great deal of talent behind ``Remember the Titans,''
but, frankly, they all should be ashamed of themselves. The
extraordinary cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (''Interview With
the Vampire,'' ``Henry &AMP; June,'' ``Hope and Glory'') shoots every
frame of ``Titans'' like a dream. But the pretty picture-making
makes no sense in the context of the gritty drama that's supposed
to be unfolding. The director, Boaz Yakin, has done some sharp,
original work himself (''Fresh,'' ``A Price Above Rubies''), but
his directing here seems to involve standing out of the way as the
script's melodrama plays out.
</P>
<P>
   And what is going on with Denzel Washington? This vital,
immensely talented actor has been playing virtually the same part
for the past 15 years _ a proud, blustery African-American who must
instruct whites with his upstanding behavior. At times he is
brilliant, as in last year's ``The Hurricane.'' But Washington long
ago gave up trying to challenge himself; and when he's on
autopilot, as he is here, the sight of him huffing, puffing and
threatening to blow everyone's house down is exasperating. Like
everything else about ``Remember the Titans,'' he's all hot (and
exceedingly stale) air.
</P>

KAZAKHSTAN'S BOXERS FIGHT IN ONE DIRECTION _ FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union
sent settlers to the ``virgin lands'' of the Kazakh Soviet
Socialist Republic, a landlocked area roughly four times the size
of Texas just northwest of China. The newcomers, who were mostly
Russians, brought with them the lessons of a centralized sports
system, and in the sport of boxing, a specific technique.
</P>
<P>
   It was an upright, rigid style, and standoffish with an emphasis
on shrewd ring maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Nurgali Safiullin, an Olympic boxing coach of Kazakhstan,
a country formed after the breakup of the Soviet Union, said
Thursday: ``It's our thinking that battles should be won nose to
nose. It's close combat. We don't like to rely on judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kazakhstani people originated from a very warrior tribe, the
Kipchaki. They've always been fighters. They know how to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 2000 Sydney Games, Kazakhstan is proving its point. A
nation of 14 million _ ``There used to be 2 million more, but a lot
of Russians have gone back since the Soviet breakup,'' Safiullin
said _ it has four fighters in the medal round of the boxing
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in other terms, a country with a population approximately
equal to that of Florida has as many fighters in the medal round as
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting; our four fighters have already gotten
telegrams from our president,'' Safiullin said. ``The telegram
read, `Fight to the end.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is other motivation. Any Kazakh fighter winning a gold
medal will receive the equivalent of $100,000 from the government,
Safiullin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our men will fight hard anyway,'' Safiullin said. ``It's the
only way they know.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighters of Kazakhstan _ where 35 percent of the people live
below the poverty level (about $40 a month) and the average life
expectancy of males is 58 years _ fight with an uncompromising
relentlessness that has made them crowd favorites at the Sydney
boxing tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Kazakhs fight in one direction, forward, and will walk
through dozens of stiff punches to throw their own from close
range. Of their four fighters competing in Friday's semifinals, the
featherweight Bekzat Sattarkhanov is a student, the flyweight Bulat
Jumadilov and the middleweight Yermakhan Ibraimov are police
officers, and the superheavyweight Mukhtarkhan Dildabekov is in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   While they are resolutely aggressive, the four are thinking
fighters with good footwork. Their defense is solid since they hold
their hands high, a technique learned under the Soviet system,
Safiullin said. But they are hardly alike.
</P>
<P>
   Jumadilov, 27, said he liked to drive fast cars and considered
Muhammad Ali his favorite athlete. In the ring, he has fast hands
and scores points with punches in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about superstitions, Jumadilov, the flyweight world
champion, answered, ``Before competitions, I don't like to talk to
stupid people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibraimov, 28, lists Mike Tyson as his favorite athlete because
Tyson is ``a boxer who doesn't like to lose.'' Ibraimov fights as
if he hates to lose, too. On Wednesday, he upset Cuba's Juan
Hernandez, a reigning world champion. Ibraimov neutralized
Hernandez's power and had the 31-year-old Hernandez, a three-time
Olympian and silver medalist four years ago, suddenly looking very
old.
</P>
<P>
   After his victory, Ibraimov joined the several dozen Kazakh
rooters and officials in the grandstand. His countrymen took turns
having their picture taken with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are national heroes,'' Safiullin said through a
translator. ``Our boxing program is the only national sports
program that is totally supported by the government. Even during
the breakup of the Soviet Union, because of our past successes the
government didn't let it fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan has vast untapped fossil fuel resources as well as
reserves of minerals and metals, but market reform has been slow
and the process by which licenses are awarded to Western companies
by the ruling elite is murky. Once the home of defense industries
and test ranges, its radioactive and toxic chemical sites pose
significant pollution problems. There are significant ethnic and
religious differences because natives of the old Kazakh republic _
predominantly Muslim _ now outnumber the Russian immigrants when
the opposite was true 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the national boxing program flourishes,
Safiullin said, with some challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is ever perfect anywhere,'' he said. ``There are
always some problems, but we get sponsors and things are going
well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the worldwide boxing community, Kazakhstan's presence
continues to grow with its boxing leaders serving as high-ranking
members of the Amateur International Boxing Association, the body
that governs Olympic boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan's success in Sydney has the American coach, Tom
Mustin, trying to get the Kazakh fighters to come to the United
States for a dual meet next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to learn from them,'' Mustin said. ``They're
extra strong; they know how to brawl and roughhouse. They must do
neck exercises because punches don't seem to affect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan won a gold, a silver and two bronze medals at the
1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do better this time,'' Safiullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Told that the U.S. coach wondered what exercises his team does
to withstand the torrent of punches they customarily see, Safiullin
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him they go back centuries,'' he said.

WILLIAMS SISTERS ADD OLYMPIC DOUBLES CROWN TO A GOLDEN YEAR OF
SUCCESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Russia, Netherlands)   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Just 24 hours after Venus Williams won a
gold medal in singles, she joined her sister, Serena, to take the
gold for America in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competition is over,'' Venus Williams said. ``We can't do
anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, Venus and Serena Williams created the buzz
of the tournament. Without them, the draw would have come up short
in style, flair and name value. Unlike Martina Hingis and others,
the Williams sisters didn't consider playing for their country too
taxing on their schedule. Instead, they embraced the opportunity
and found joy in the Olympic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Upon match point, Venus and Serena Williams tossed their rackets
in the air, wrapped their arms around each other at the service
line and hugged all the way to the net, where they greeted Miriam
Oremans and Kristie Boogert, the Dutch pair they dismissed in 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is almost bigger than singles,'' Venus Williams
said. ``It's right up there because I have this victory with
Serena, my sister, my family member, my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, they left Oremans and Boogert all but pockmarked from
the Williams' mortar shots during the 6-1, 6-1 U.S. victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been fantastic here,'' Serena Williams said. ``Just to
win the gold medal, it has been a great thing for me and my family.
We've worked so hard. It's great for everyone, for the whole U.S.
team.''
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Coach Billie Jean King assembled the women's team, the
plan was to sweep the singles, as well as doubles. If Lindsay
Davenport hadn't injured her foot, the United States might have
delivered. As it was, Monica Seles won the bronze for the United
States only after losing to Venus Williams in the semifinals,
leaving only the silver in singles up for grabs. Russia's Elena
Dementieva gladly grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   In the background of the Williams sisters, the Russians were
quietly asserting themselves as a world power in tennis. Although
Marat Safin made an early exit in the men's draw, Dementieva backed
up her coming out party at the U.S. Open with an encore at the
Olympics. And although the men's draw was more threadbare of stars
than the women's side, Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov found inspiration
from the sight of his country's flag and came up with a gold medal
Thursday in one of the best matches of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   By devouring short balls with swinging forehand winners, leaning
on his big serve when faced with disaster, and being patient in the
heat of every intense baseline rally, Kafelnikov outlasted Tommy
Haas of Germany, 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I lost the fourth set today, I talked to myself,''
Kafelnikov said. ``I said, `You have come all the way here to play
the final match in the Olympics. If you lose the match, you are
going to regret it the rest of your life.' And that's what kept me
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any shame in taking a silver back to Russia _ which
Kafelnikov was reminded of in a pre-match telephone conversation
with his wife, Mascha, and children _ but he was inspired by the
moment to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters felt the same way. For almost two weeks,
they weren't individuals but part of a team. They weren't being
guided by their parents, but being coached by King and assistant
Zina Garrison. As a result, there were some tweaks made in the
Williams sisters' technique. Their volleys were sharper and their
doubles movement was more synchronized.
</P>
<P>
   ``They listen very well,'' said King, who, along with Garrison,
may continue some spot coaching of the sisters. ``They really want
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, they are close to invincible. Any better, and the
Williams sisters would be unbeatable. As their Olympic competition
ended, Venus Williams' singles winning streak stood at 32; and the
sisters had won 33 of 34 doubles matches. Putting her name down in
history, Venus Williams also became the first woman to win gold
medals in the singles and doubles since Helen Wills in 1924. Tennis
rejoined the Olympic program in 1988, after an absence of 56 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are right now is just good,'' Venus Williams said.
``We have done everything we could at the Olympics. When we
compete, we do all that we can. Even if it's a bad decision, we
give it 110 percent. Right now, we are in a really good place.''

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: SAME SOB STORY, DIFFERENT SOBBER 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ If you had put it to a vote, polled the
Olympic community, I suspect it would have been a landslide
Slobodan Milosevic couldn't ignore. By the time it was announced
Thursday that Andreea Raducan wasn't getting her gold medal back,
people just wished the cute little gymnast could wipe away the
tears and go home happily to Romania to claim her $30,000 victory
prize.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before Ion Tiriac apologized for English that is
``not Shakespearean,'' and played host to an Oprah-like panel that
included the victimized Raducan and the Romanian gymnastic
matriarch, Nadia Comaneci.
</P>
<P>
   ``An aspirin is doping?'' said Tiriac, the whiskered president
of the Romanian Olympic Committee. ``OK, we are machines. We have
to act like machines.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-time career guide for Boris Becker has always been an
entertaining fellow, dramatic and bold with his pronunciations.
Just recently, back in more familiar territory, he reportedly said,
on the eve of Marat Safin's blowout of Pete Sampras in the U.S.
Open final: ``Sampras is out of gas. His tank is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic sport of doping is apparently more difficult to
handicap. With expectation growing that common sense and plain
sentiment would prevail, the opposite occurred. Tiriac apparently
believed he had successfully argued Raducan's case in a Wednesday
hearing. But before the Romanians gave Thursday's public defense,
an unsmiling bureaucrat from the International Court of Arbitration
for Sport read a statement that said, in effect: Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   And no questions from the news media would be answered either.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cold ending, no pun intended, leaving Raducan to seek
comfort in the arms of Comaneci, star of the 1976 Montreal Games.
Tiriac, meanwhile, lamented that the International Olympic
Committee, besieged as it is with drug scandals here, ``didn't have
the courage, in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, given the imagery of a weepy 4-foot-10-inch, 82-pound
pixie, the IOC demonstrated an intrepid resolve that was sure to
bring it additional scorn. Especially after its own inadvisable
assertion that Raducan had done nothing wrong by accepting a cold
pill from a team doctor that contained a banned substance,
pseudoephedrine, before the all-around event swept by the Romanians
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely as it seems that some competitive advantage was being
sought, what qualifies the IOC to know beyond a doubt what the
Romanians were up to? The same day Tiriac was appealing the Raducan
decision, the International Amateur Athletic Federation was
scoffing at C.J. Hunter's explanation for why he tested positive
for the anabolic steroid nandrolone last July. It was pretty much
the same sob story: He took a dietary supplement without knowing
what was in it.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been some Romanian weight lifter in the position
Raducan was in, would anyone have cared at all?
</P>
<P>
   All of these sports have their own peculiar cultures. Female
gymnasts don't bulk up, for obvious reasons, but most of them look
no more natural than the weight lifters. And that's usually the
problem with these cases, how they are defended, adjudicated and
publicly digested. Few of us know what the stimulants and drugs
even do, and at what levels they become significant. No one ever
knows for certain what the athletes were thinking, and sometimes,
neither do they.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Tom Gugliotta, the Phoenix Suns' forward, had a
seizure on the team bus last season? He went on television the
following week and said he had taken a supplement that had been
recommended by a friend. Why did he take it? He couldn't say. What
was it supposed to do for him? He didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Tiriac knew little about the particulars of this story, only
that he ``couldn't look himself in the mirror'' if he hadn't fought
to get Raducan's medal returned. After vowing to suspend any
Romanian doper for life and claiming everyone on the Olympic team
was tested before the Games, he may wish to comb his hair with his
eyes closed. Two Romanian weight lifters were thrown out last week
and its world-record holder in the hammer throw, Mihaela Melinte,
was pulled off the field Wednesday for failing an IAAF test last
June.
</P>
<P>
   According to the track federation, the Romanians were informed
of the test two days earlier, and did nothing. You might say
Tiriac's track record doesn't exactly support his outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years ago, an American swimmer, 16-year-old Rick
DeMont, was stripped of his 400-meter freestyle medal in Munich,
after taking an asthma medication that contained a banned
substance. DeMont wound up suing the U.S. Olympic Committee for
breach of fiduciary duty. Considering the tragedy of those
Olympics, the slaying of 11 Israeli athletes by terrorists,
DeMont's case was not exactly cause for international dishonor.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this one, no matter how frail and sad-eyed the tiny
gymnast looked, sitting with her hands folded Thursday, as she
explained, ``I've done nothing wrong.'' It's entirely possible she
didn't, but then, who can definitively say that Hunter willfully
took the steroids he is accused of taking?
</P>
<P>
   Tiriac's little show Thursday came off no less contrived than
Hunter's. He said Raducan, who turns 17 Saturday, would get her
$30,000 prize. The Romanian who backed into the gold, Simona
Amanar, said she was accepting the medal because ``it belongs to
Romania. The winner that day was Andreea, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Amanar should give Raducan back the medal when they get
home, and leave it at that. As Tom Hanks said, there's no crying in
the uneven parallel bars.

   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ President-elect Vicente Fox

unsolved mysteries. What became of billions of dollars spent

   BRITAIN-POLITICS (London) _ Tony Blair's law-and-order program

   HEALTH-INSURE (Washington) _ The number of Americans without
health insurance declined substantially last year, to 42.6 million,
reversing a 12-year trend. The number of uninsured had been growing

on his main store. Six major grocery chains, including Kroger and
Wal-Mart, are refusing to sell his sauce, and residents are either
infuriated or pleased, depending on their politics. Bessinger says

   CHENEYS (Dateline TK) _ As campaign props, political spouses and
children have long held a place somewhere beside red, white and
blue bunting, yard signs, buttons and balloons. But this year,
perhaps more than most, presidential politics is a family affair.
There was Laura Bush at the Republican convention. There was the
little matter of that kiss that Al Gore planted on his wife,
Tipper, at the Democratic National Convention. But the hardest
working family in this election cycle may be that of the Republican
vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney. By Michael Cooper.

commercialism. By Mark Landler.

CUBAN BOXERS BACK ON COURSE AFTER EARLY SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The evening did not start out well for the
celebrated Cuban boxing team Thursday when their light flyweight
Maikro Romero lost a controversial decision to Brahim Asloum of
France. It was the fifth consecutive defeat for a Cuban boxer in
the Olympic tournament going back to Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's coach, Alcides Sagarra, who a month ago had suggested
that his team could medal in all 12 weight classifications, waved
his hands disdainfully at the judges when the Romero decision was
announced, then stormed from the ring with a few angry shouts.
</P>
<P>
   But less than 30 minutes later, Sagarra was escorting his
bantamweight Guillermo Rigondeaux into the same ring. Rigondeaux
would dominate the American Clarence Vinson, winning easily on
points, 18-6. It began a streak of four successive victories for
the Cubans, the last another comfortable victory for the
heavyweight Felix Savon.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cubans have four boxers, including the lightweight Mario
Kindelan and the middleweight Jorge Gutierrez, fighting for gold
medals Saturday. Diogenes Luna, a light welterweight, will try to
make it five Cubans in the finals when he faces the American
Ricardo Williams Jr. on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson was never in Thursday night's fight, being beaten to the
punch by the fluid, powerful Rigondeaux from the earliest moments
of the bout. Rigondeaux, who fights left-handed, is 4 inches taller
than the 5-foot-2-inch Vinson and used his reach and graceful
footwork to ward off Vinson's many advances and to score
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mustin, the U.S. coach, said Vinson has always had trouble
against left-handed fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this guy was strong and moved great side to side,'' Mustin
said of Rigondeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson will win a bronze medal because the losers of both
semifinals are awarded bronze medals in boxing. Vinson fought with
heart, as he kept trying to force the attack against Rigondeaux
even though he trailed by several points. But Vinson could not
routinely get close enough to his target, and Rigondeaux has a
mighty left hand he knows how to use. Rigondeaux stopped Vinson for
a count of 8 with one straight left hand to the face in the third
round, and he knocked Vinson down a few moments later with another
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little flat today and he fought very well,'' said
Vinson, who now plans to turn professional. ``He was a better
fighter today. You win some; you lose some. I'll take the bitter
with the sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Savon advanced easily, though he didn't look sharp in his 14-8
victory on points against Germany's Sebastian Kober. Savon even
briefly trailed during the fight's first round, but he rallied to
build a cushy lead. But even the slower, plodding Kober was able to
hit Savon.
</P>
<P>
   Savon, 33, will be a favorite to win his third gold medal
Saturday when he faces Sultanahmed Ibzagimov of Russia, who
defeated Vladimir Tchantouria of Georgia. The Ibzagimov-Tchantouria
bout had the Sydney crowd alternately booing, hooting and laughing,
it was so comically slapstick. The two wrestled each other to the
canvas at one point and spent four rounds otherwise wildly missing
with clumsy punches.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, Savon would become the second boxer to win three
Olympic gold medals in one weight class, equaling his countryman
Teofilo Stevenson's mark.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Williams, the Americans Jermain Taylor and Ricardo
Juarez fight in Friday night semifinal bouts. &QL;

   At 32, Tony Hawk could be considered the elder statesman of

his home in Carlsbad, Calif. ``As I grew up in the '80s and skated
into my 20s, I felt I kept improving at it. Suddenly, (pro skaters
my age) realized we were pushing the age limit boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the aerial boundaries, too. Last year, Hawk made
skateboarding history when he sank his claws into the world's first
``900'' _ a two-and-a-half midair rotation above a plywood ramp. It
would be just another dizzying exclamation point in Hawk's 20 years
as a pro skater, a run that includes more than 80 original skating
tricks and 70-plus major contest victories.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ``Michael Jordan of skateboarding'' is once again
soaring to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Though retired from competition, Hawk still sees plenty of
airtime at world-touring exhibitions, most courtesy of ESPN's
popular ``X Games.'' He recently released an upbeat biography,
``Hawk: Occupation: Skateboarder'' (Regan Books, $23). And now
everybody can fly like a Hawk in ``Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2,''
Activision's highly-anticipated video game sequel that just aired
onto store shelves this week .
</P>
<P>
   So in case you thought the up-and-down world of skateboarding
was in the midst of another tailspin, take it from the non-sport's
ultimate ambassador: As long as it sticks to its subculture roots,
skating will always have plenty of fans eager to hop on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that (skating) attitude has changed at all,''
Hawk said. ``I'd like to think that has been appreciated most. If
you don't want to worry about teams or practice schedules, here's
something you can do at your own pace and on your own terms. An
activity like skateboarding is exactly what some people are looking
for but never knew it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawk's video games have certainly filled the ranks with the
newly converted. Last year's critically lauded ``Tony Hawk's Pro
Skater'' was one of the best-selling PlayStation game console
titles ever. The new ``Pro Skater 2'' sports even more intense
skater graphics, dead-on trick capabilities and enough high-rolling
terrain to amaze hardcore skaters and cursory fans alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us only anticipated the game to be popular among
skaters,'' Hawk said. ``We didn't think this would be a platform
for all kinds of video gamers. It was a great surprise, and has
helped to bring recognition to skating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, all these kids are experts at tricks and
difficulties and names,'' he said, ``which has always been one of
the hardest things for people to understand. They don't realize how
technical it is, and now (through the video games) they can see
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Pro Skater'' games aren't the only action-packed
Cliffs Notes for non-skaters. Since 1995, ESPN's ``X Games'' have
entertained and educated more armchair fans in the delicate nuances
of an ollie (popping the board's tail or nose while riding to
``hop'' into the air) and skating's other complex maneuvers, which
often make gymnastics look like a dull game of Twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The `X Games') have become a lot truer to representing
skating to how we approach it,'' Hawk said. ``The first year, it
was how `they' see `us.' Now, it's much more about what we want to
convey and how do we want to convey ourselves. I think through that
skewed programming in the beginning, the attitude and passion
shined through. Now they appreciate our opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   And that opinion has long been that skateboarding is about
having fun, not winning trophies. Even a self-professed competitor
like Hawk admits that the only guy on the ramp he ever really
fought against was himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking at skating in general, there are so many
skaters who never compete and are successful,'' said Hawk, citing
skating greats such as Steve Caballero, Eric Koston and Rodney
Mullen (who are all featured in ``Pro Skater 2''). ``They perform,
but not in a competition arena. That's never really been an issue
in skating.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, Hawk focuses his self-improvement skills toward
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   The father of two sons (Riley, 7, and Spencer, 18 months), Hawk
said that his hectic touring schedule is sometimes tough on his
children and his wife Erin, 28. Still, the family doesn't fault him
for spreading the gospel of skateboarding as a noncompetitive means
of self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's a fun job and Hawk still excels at it _ whether
it's on his board, in a book or on a video game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure skating will improve and may get bigger,'' he
predicted. ``But even if it doesn't grow there's now a foundation.
It's going to have much more longevity.''

   ABORTION-PILL (Washington) _ The government's approval of the
abortion pill RU-486 is hailed by pro-choice advocates and

allow women to end their pregnancies privately at home, but
opponents predict few gynecologists will prescribe the pill. By

   CAMPAIGN-ROUNDUP _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President
Al Gore trade shots on who would be the better long-term custodian
of the nation's economy. At a rally in Green Bay, Wis., Bush paints
Gore as a big spender who would jeopardize budget surpluses. In
Washington, Gore says Bush's proposed tax cuts would give ``too

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The myth is now frozen that the way
to woo female voters is to master the art of the smooch and chatter
about silly things like peanut butter sandwiches, as Al Gore and
George W. Bush are doing. The myth is as misleading as it is
patronizing. Women don't vote for president solely out of emotion
any more than men vote entirely by intellect. In any case we are
not a monolith. All the political talk about how to get the female
vote is just that _ talk. By MARIANNE MEANS.

   DEBATES (Washington) _ In the first of the presidential debates
Tuesday night, George W. Bush hopes to bolster his aw-shucks appeal
with detailed knowledge of the issues while Al Gore tries to
connect personally with TV-viewers and avoid policy-wonk preaching.
The two are squaring off in the first of three showdowns that could
sway the outcome of the closest presidential election in 20 years.
By STEWART M. POWELL

   EDUCATION-ELECTION (Washington) _ Al Gore and George W. Bush are
knocking themselves out trying to one-up the other on education, an
issue at the top of voters' concerns. Each would dramatically boost
federal education spending, and each has a plan to raise student
achievement, but they are polar opposites on the controversial idea
of vouchers. We compare and contrast the two candidates' plans. By

   PEARL-HARBOR (Washington) _ Congress appears poised to exonerate
the U.S. commanders at Pearl Harbor at the time of the surprise

Gen. Walter Short of blame for the disaster, saying both officers

<P>
   Some classic dishes, such as caramel apples, sticky buns and
creme brulee, rely on caramelization for their complex flavors.
Newer dishes also make use of the technique.
</P>
<P>
   MICROWAVE CARAMEL
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 3/4 cup)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   4 or 5 drops lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon water, if needed
</P>
<P>
   Place sugar in a 2-cup glass measure. Add corn syrup and lemon
juice. Stir until no white patches of dry sugar remain. Add a
tablespoon of water if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Place the dampened sugar in the microwave and cook, on high
power, until bubbles start piling on top of each other; time will
depend on the amount of sugar and the power of the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   The second you see a color change begin to occur _ melted sugar
turning to pale tan _ be on the alert. let the color darken only
slightly, them remove caramel from oven and let stand. Caramel will
continue to darken. If the mixture does not get as dark as desired,
microwave on high for 10 seconds more, then let stand again.
</P>
<P>
   Uses: Pour the caramel in ramekins and swirl to coat evenly to
use as the base for flan. Spoon on top of baked, chilled creme
brulee and swirl to make a seamless topping. Use it to coat the
bottom of a baking dish and then bake your favorite bread pudding
recipe in the dish. Pour into muffin cups then top with
refrigerator biscuits cut into pieces. Bake as directed on package.
Remove from oven, let cool 5 minutes then invert onto a serving
plate for fast sticky buns.

</P>
<P>
   10 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1 quart heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Sugar for topping
</P>
<P>
   Line a baking pan, large enough to hold 8 ramekins or flameproof
custard cups, with a dish towel. Set a kettle of water on to boil.
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Beat egg yolks thoroughly. Add cream, vanilla and sugar and
whisk until well combined. Pour custard mixture into ramekins and
place in prepared baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Place baking on rack in center of oven. Pour boiling water into
baking pan until the water comes halfway up the sides of the
ramekins. Cover baking pan with foil and punch holes in foil to
allow the steam to escape. Bake until a spot about the size of a
quarter is still wiggly in the center of each custard, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove ramekins from water bath and let cool. Refrigerate until
thoroughly chilled.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, heat broiler. Sprinkle the top of each
custard very lightly with granulated sugar. (We sifted the sugar
through a fine mesh strainer onto the custards to remove any
lumps).
</P>
<P>
   Place custards on a sheet pan under broiler. Broil just long
enough to caramelize sugar, 1 to 2 minutes, watching closely to
make sure the sugar doesn't burn.

   UNION SQUARE CAFE'S CARAMEL BANANA TART
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 6)
</P>
<P>
   CRUST:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   BANANA TOPPING:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   4 large, ripe bananas, thinly sliced on the diagonal
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped macadamia nuts (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla ice cream, optional
</P>
<P>
   CRUST:
</P>
<P>
   Beat the butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer. Beat
in the egg yolk, vanilla, salt and blend well. Add the flour and
beat until moist clumps begin to form. Press the dough with your
hands into the bottom of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
Pierce with a fork in a few places, about 2 inches apart.
Refrigerate 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 450, Bake crust until golden, 15 minutes. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   TOPPING:
</P>
<P>
   Place a large baking pan half filled with cold water and ice
cubes next to the stove. Combine 1/2 cup of the sugar, the corn
syrup, and 1 tablespoon of the melted butter in a small saucepan
over medium heat. Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves and it
comes to a boil. Boil the mixture, without stirring but swirling
the pan occasionally so that it brown evenly, until it turns a
medium amber color, 7 minutes. Place the pan in the ice water to
prevent further cooking and to cool it to lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Arrange the banana slices,
overlapping them slightly, in a concentric circle beginning at the
crust edge and working your way in so that the crust is completely
covered. Brush the remaining tablespoon of butter over the bananas
and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar. Bake until the
tart is just warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Rewarm the caramel
topping over low heat, stirring occasionally. Remove the tart from
the oven. Dip a spoon into the caramel and drizzle it back and
forth in squiggly lines over the bananas. Remove the pan bottom and
place the tart on a platter. Scatter nuts over top and serve.

   In between flea markets and football games, the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena has set Oct. 15 aside for the fifth annual Susan G. Komen
Breast Cancer Foundation's Race for the Cure. The 5K run/fitness
walk event is sponsored by JC Penney stores and begins at 8:30 a.m.
The Komen Race for the Cure was founded in 1982 and is held
annually in 95 cities across the country so there's a bit of
competition. Los Angeles raised $800,000 last year. For more
information, call (626) 577-2700.

   In the news less than breast cancer, but expected to kill
187,000 people this year, is pancreatic cancer. On Sunday, 1,500
people are expected to run for this cause in the FILA City
Challenge 5K/10K Race and Kiddie 1K Run. The morning activities
will also include exercise warmups, entertainment and a sponsor
expo fair. Funds raised at the event will benefit the Ronald S.
Hirshberg Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at UCLA. The race
begins at 8:30 a.m. at Veterans Administration Grounds, 11000
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. All participating children will
receive blue ribbons and T-shirts. For more information, call (310)
472-6310 or visit www.pancreatic.org. &QL;

Ultimate Drive for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, a
national ongoing event for breast cancer research, where
participants can test drive the vehicle of their choice -- from the
swift M3 line to the luxurious 7-series -- on a 10- to 12-mile

TRUCKS USE RECALLED TIRE TYPE AS SPARES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KELLY MELHART 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Firestone tires being used as spares on Ford's new Ranger Edge
pickups are identical, except for some markings, to the model
recalled last month after being linked to fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone officials emphasized Wednesday that the spare
tires are safe if used at speeds of less than 50 mph and distances
of less than 50 miles. The Firestone ATX tires are embossed with
the words ``temporary only'' and ``Max speed 50 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary tires are not part of the recall, Ford and
Firestone officials said Wednesday. But other than the warnings,
the spares are identical to the recalled tires, said Joe Quinn,
Firestone spokesman in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Various dealers in Fort Worth-Dallas, apparently confused by
information from Ford, are handling the tire recalls differently,
they said. Some are replacing the spares, and others are not.
</P>
<P>
   The tires were found as spares on eight new Ranger Edge pickups
during a spot-check of dealerships Wednesday in the Metroplex.
Dealership managers said the pickups arrived from assembly plants
with the ATX spares.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary tires have been standard equipment on Ranger
trucks for at least a year, Ford spokesman Mike Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not the same as recall tires,'' Vaughn said from his
Detroit office. ``They are designed for temporary use to get you to
a repair facility to get the tire fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Wednesday that they were talking to
Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford Motor Co. about the tires after
learning about them from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. They said
they could not make a statement. The administration has received no
complaints about the temporary tires, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rolls, a Maryland resident who founded Tire Action Group to
try to persuade Firestone to recall all ATX and Wilderness tires,
said the spares should be recalled until more questions are
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a flat tire and you put on a spare, and then your life
is riding around on a spare,'' said Rolls, who founded the group
after his Ford Explorer tires, which were not part of the recall,
began to fail. ``All these ATX and Wilderness tires ought to go.
Everyone who is riding around on them is riding around on four
tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not have specific reports about the quality of
Ranger spare tires, Rolls said he has heard from drivers of other
Ford vehicles whose spares are ``failing with less than 300 miles
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth resident Tom Shafer insisted on five replacement
tires for his 2001 Ranger Edge after he found an ATX temporary tire
beneath the truck bed Tuesday night. Shafer said he matched the
code on his spare to the P235/75R15 code on the recalled ATX tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone officials said the 15-inch tires marked
``temporary'' are not part of the recall, regardless of the code.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, who bought the truck Sept. 15, said that doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a spare until a tire blows, then where is it?'' he
said. ``This is not about me, it's about (Ford's) president on
national TV saying his company is doing everything in its power to
ensure the safety of its customers _ his words, not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafer's five Firestone tires were replaced with those of a
competitor Wednesday at the Five Star Ford dealership in North
Richland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The P235/75R15 radial ATX tire is one of three Firestone tire
types recalled by the company Aug. 9 after reports that their tread
peels off while the vehicle is traveling. The safety administration
is investigating reports of 101 deaths and more than 400 injuries
linked to tire problems.
</P>
<P>
   Other problem tires are the Wilderness AT types produced at the
company's Decatur, Ill., plant and all of the standard P235/75R15
radial ATX II types.
</P>
<P>
   Federal standards differ for regular tires and spares.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the standard ATX tires and the temporary
ones is how they are tested and how they are expected to be used,
Firestone spokesman Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident in our tires, and we believe temporary
tires, if used properly, will be safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone spare tire guidelines include driving less than 50 mph
and less than 50 miles, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary spares are exactly what they say they are. They are
what you use when you have a flat,'' Ford spokesman Vaughn said.
``The tread separations, apparently they happen at higher mileages
and higher speeds and higher temperatures. All of those seem to be
aggravating factors. This is a temporary spare meant to be used at
a lower speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Recall literature from Ford has conflicting information. Some
advertisements state that all Firestone ATX and ATX II tires with
the P235/75R15 designation are affected, but some brochures state
that the temporary tires are not included in the recall regardless
of the designation. So some dealerships and tire retailers swap
spares, and others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's on the recall list, it's being recalled,'' said Tim
Barnette, service manager for Texas Motors Ford in west Fort Worth.
``There's no documentation I have that says they (spare tires) are
not part of the recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wilson, finance director at Westway Ford, said the
dealership had replaced numerous spare tires at customers'
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have checked them all,'' he said. ``If they've been in the
recall, we've replaced them. We've had hundreds of calls. I'd like
to be able to replace every Firestone out there, but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson said he was not sure whether the Ranger spare tire is
subject to the recall.
</P>
<P>
   He said a portion of the Ford recall notice states that the
Firestone Wilderness AT tire must have ``DOT VDHL'' on the sidewall
to be subject to the recall. He said he believed that the ATX and
ATX II models also needed those markings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it has that number, it's in the recall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Ford and Firestone officials have said that the ``DOT
VDHL'' marking applies only to the Wilderness AT model.
</P>
<P>
   In North Richland Hills, Five-Star Ford general manager Gary
Brophy cited a Ford internal memo that states that the temporary
tires are not part of the recall, although all other ATX and ATX II
tires with the P235/75R15 designation are. Brophy said his
dealership replaced Shafer's tires to allay his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Black, service director at Grand Prairie Ford, said he
does not believe that there is a problem with ATX temporary tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as any different than putting a doughnut
(spare) on a Taurus,'' Black said. ``This is completely different
than a main service tire. This is for emergency use only.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to warnings on temporary tires, the owner's manual
also spells out how they should be used, Black said.

&HT;     STUDY REVEALS PROMISING TREATMENT FOR AIDS VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A promising new avenue of research into the AIDS
virus is getting a boost from a study of newly infected patients,
some of whom were able to fight off the infection much better after
an initial course of standard drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, is
considered a ``proof of principle,'' that it may be possible to
intervene early to help people stay well for long periods without
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to mimic the immune systems of so-called long-term
nonprogressors _ that handful of individuals worldwide who have
lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for as long as
two decades without getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital followed eight
people who had been put on highly active anti-retroviral therapy
within six months of becoming infected.
</P>
<P>
   In five cases, the subjects were able to later go off the
often-toxic drugs, and their immune systems have been able to fend
off the virus far better than expected. In the study, the subjects
were followed from eight to 11 months after stopping drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that all eight patients had increased levels
of immune cells that specifically fight off HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is proof of principle _ that at least under some
circumstances we can induce the immune system to get the upper hand
on the virus,'' said Bruce Walker, director of the Partners AIDS
Research Center at the Massachusetts General and senior author of
the study.
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge, he said, is to develop a therapy for people
who have been infected for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts are under way, both in Walker's lab and elsewhere.
Jay Levy of the AIDS Research Institute at the University of
California at San Francisco has been studying the use of the
cancer-fighting drug interleukin-2, which is known to stimulate
immune cells. He is also about to launch studies using particles of
HIV injected into the system that would act like a vaccine,
prodding the body to respond to the invading virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the major impact of this story is that it indicates if
we could get the immune system rallied to recognize the virus, then
we could avoid using these (anti-retroviral) drugs,'' Levy said.
``It's going to encourage a lot more people to look at the immune
system'' for answers to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction
in which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to
serious infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual
contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he believes the early drug therapy gives the body a
chance to recognize the virus and gear up to fight it before it can
overwhelm and begin to destroy the immune system, which eventually
leads to full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why Walker said it is important to diagnose
HIV infection as quickly as possible. People who have picked up the
virus recently usually experience flu-like symptoms weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   There has been controversy of late over whether it is a good
idea to put newly infected people on drugs right away. Many believe
it could hurt the patient because the medications inevitably begin
to fail, leaving them stranded with few options left.
</P>
<P>
   The new study suggests early drug therapy may have a worthwhile
effect, and it may not be necessary to continue it indefinitely.
But the study is quite small and the follow-up covers less than a
year, so it is impossible to use it as a guide for day-to-day
treatment, at least for now.

A NEW `ROCKY' ROAD: A CULT CLASSIC RE-EMERGES ON DVD 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide and black-and-white photo of Tim Curry in a
scene from ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    Ready to do the Time Warp again?
 &HT;    ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' the sci-fi/horror/musical
saga that just won't die _ it continues to pack them in as a bit of
midnight madness at movie theaters across America, while the
original stage version, ``The Rocky Horror Show,'' is still running
in England and about to reopen in New York on Oct. 20 _ celebrates
its 25th anniversary with a just-released DVD special edition
loaded with goodies.
 &HT;    And, sitting in his London home, creator/co-star Richard O'Brien
admits to being semi-confounded by ``Rocky Horror's'' durability.
 &HT;    ``The longevity, both on stage and on screen, has to do with the
fact that the story locked into a fairy tale,'' says O'Brien, who
wrote book, music and lyrics for both play and film, as well as
playing the butler/handyman Riff Raff in both incarnations and in
``Shock Treatment,'' the lamentable 1981 big-screen follow-up.
 &HT;    ``On the surface, it's just a trashy, campy, fun night out,'' he
says, ``but, unlike a Chinese meal, you don't leave it thinking,
`Well, that was all right, but it hasn't satisfied on a deeper
level.'
 &HT;    ``I think `Rocky' satisfies on a much more subliminal level, if
you will,'' O'Brien says. ``It's a variation on a well-known fairy
tale, `Babes in the Woods,' which itself was a retelling of the
fall in the Garden of Eden. You don't necessarily think about that,
but because it somehow pleases on that secondary level, it enables
you to go back again and again and to relive the story.
 &HT;    ``I may be completely on the wrong track, and I may be being
exceptionally pretentious and pseudo with that interpretation,'' he
adds with a laugh, ``but it's my best guess.''
 &HT;    Now 58, O'Brien didn't set out to make a classic, way back when.
He simply wanted to entertain people with the travails of recently
engaged innocents Janet (Susan Sarandon) and Brad (Barry Bostwick),
who _ after their car breaks down near an eerie castle _ nearly
succumb to the outrageous charms of decadent alien transvestite Dr.
Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) and the quirky guests from the galaxy
Transylvania who've gathered at the castle for an annual
convention.
 &HT;    Savaged by critics, the film bombed upon its release in 1975.
Nonetheless it became a phenomenon, with participants at midnight
showings dressing up and performing as the characters, tossing
rice, opening umbrellas, tossing rolls of toilet paper, dancing to
``The Time Warp'' and talking back to the screen at appropriate
moments.
 &HT;    When the midnight-movie craze began to fade, ``Rocky Horror''
made the leap to video. And now, via Twentieth Century Fox Home
Entertainment, it's on DVD. The special edition restores the
production number ``Superheroes,'' cut from the American release,
and counts among its extras assorted outtakes, alternate credits
sequences, a subtitle track, footage of an audience performing in a
movie theater, rarely seen photos, a trivia quiz and another
deleted song, ``Once in a While.''
 &HT;    ``I've not seen the DVD,'' O'Brien confesses. ``I watched the
movie and did a little commentary for it, and I know about the
extras. But I'm a technophobe and a Luddite, so DVD will probably
not see its way into my house.
 &HT;    ``The DVD is not my ball game,'' the actor/writer says. ``That's
the producers' and the film company's journey, not mine. My journey
is to get on with my life, really, not to repackage something from
the past.
 &HT;    ``I'm delighted it's been done, but it's really nothing to do
with me.''
 &HT;    Which is not to say that O'Brien _ whose other acting credits
include ``Flash Gordon,'' ``Dark City'' and the upcoming fantasy
film ``Dungeons &AMP; Dragons,'' with Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch _
wishes to forget ``Rocky Horror.'' In fact, he's currently penning
a stage sequel, and comes to this interview straight from the house
of Richard Hartley, musical director on the original ``Rocky Horror
Show'' on stage.
 &HT;    ``We're quite happy with the first act, musically, and with the
linear journey it takes,'' O'Brien says. ``I was up to the third or
fourth song in the second act, but I'm going to have to throw those
songs away and write a new second act _ we came up with a much
better idea for it, and I'll have to work on that.
 &HT;    ``We don't have a title yet, but we'll be revisiting old
characters, which should be fun.''
 &HT;    Hot patootie!

 &HT;    INTERNET SPURS YOUTH INVOLVEMENT IN ELECTORAL PROCESS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 1
 &HT;    By MEGAN K. DOYLE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After working a 13 hour day, Alexis Rice spends
another four hours on her computer working toward her real goal _
involving today's youth in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 22, launched a non-profit, non-partisan Web site in July
aimed at educating young people about the upcoming presidential
election: www.generationvote.com.
</P>
<P>
   A native of West Palm Beach, Fla., Rice and a handful of other
founders rely on a nationwide network of young volunteers to
provide articles and opinion columns about the major issues in the
2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to educate, motivate and encourage young people to
become politically active,'' Rice said. ``I started this site
because I felt that there was nothing out there, as far as
political news goes, that spoke specifically to young voters. I
didn't see anything for my generation, to give them information
about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rice, the reasons for using the Internet to reach today's
youth are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most young people have fast, easily available connections to
the Internet through their schools or jobs,'' Rice said. ``They're
used to using it for research, for fun, for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice began thinking about the site in March. She sent e-mails
and press releases to young activist groups and colleges across the
country. She posted information about her idea on the Web, looking
for people to help with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most sites spend hundreds of thousands on design,'' Rice said.
``We're not funded by any corporation, we're just young people
encouraging youth to go out and vote. So we had to find designers
and writers who believed in the project and would work for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that generationvote.com is operational, staffers spend their
weekends and evenings keeping it updated. The Web is the one place
Rice said she can make a difference for youth voters.
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. Since the 1996 election, many organizations
have gone to the Internet to reach young people.
</P>
<P>
   Even the presidential candidates are going on-line in efforts to
grab the youth vote. Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore offer pages on their campaign Web sites aimed at
today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's site, www.georgewbush.com, features pages where children
and college students can learn about the election and get involved
in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is more central to young voters today than in any
previous election,'' said Tucker Eskew, senior communications
advisor for the Bush-Cheney campaign. ``It's absolute political
dynamite for young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's site, www.algore2000.com, includes pages that encourage
children, college students, and young professionals to participate
in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young voters are Internet savvy,'' said Jano Cabrera, deputy
national spokesman for the Gore-Lieberman campaign. ``If they have
a question on a particular issue, they go to the Web site. If they
can't find the answer, they know they can ask the question on-line
and they'll get an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns said the amount of information available on the
Web will have a substantial impact on this and future elections.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based information already has affected some voters.
According to a 1998 study by the Pew Research Center, 34 percent of
people who used the Web for political purposes said their vote in
1998 was influenced by information they found on the Internet.
Another Pew study found that Americans under 30 are half as likely
to use the Internet for election news as a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites see the Internet as a way to make the voting process
more accessible to today's youth. Through a partnership with
www.election.com, visitors to generationvote.com can register to
vote and request an absentee ballot on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Election.com has registered more than 300,000 people to vote
from their Web site through such partnerships, including one with
the American Association of Retired Persons, a group whose members
are 50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Election.com also seeks to make lifelong voters out of today's
students through a program called Youth-e-Vote. The program works
with elementary and secondary schools to educate students about
issues and candidates, then urges the students to vote on-line a
week before the national election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are the future of this country,'' said Julia
Glidden, vice president of public affairs at election.com. ``If
they're not engaged politically, we will all suffer.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Kids Voting USA is another organization trying to encourage
involvement in the electoral process. Kids Voting USA urges parents
to take their children to the polls on Election Day. Formed in
1991, the organization just went on-line a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it as an opportunity to reach more people than we could
otherwise, especially because our program is so grass-roots
(oriented) and located in very specific areas,'' said Paula Case,
public relations coordinator at Kids Voting USA.
</P>
<P>
   The organization prepares children to vote through specific
civics courses taught in participating schools. Case cited the
ability to create an on-line curriculum that would be accessible
only to teachers as another major advantage of the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Kids Voting USA has seen some success. In 1996, Kids Voting
communities in Kansas had an 8 percent higher rate of turnout among
first-time voters than non-participating communities, according to
the Kansas secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   Rock the Vote, a group dedicated to helping young people change
their communities, has also used the Internet to increase its
effectiveness. As a non-profit group, the organization finds it
easier to get its message out on the Web than through traditional
media where it has to rely on free advertising space and public
service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is a place where young people can ``go a little
further'' by registering to vote, finding information about the
issues or speaking out on bulletin boards, according to Alison
Byrne Fields, creative director and chief strategist for Rock the
Vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the site, we get a lot of simple questions from young
people that maybe they're hesitant to ask for fear of looking
stupid, such as how to register to vote,'' Byrne Fields (CQ) said.
``The Web site enables them to do this anonymously.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of young people who don't vote cite unfamiliarity
with the candidates as the reason, according to a survey released
Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people feel uninformed and don't always feel that the
information out there is for them, but they feel a greater sense of
ownership over the Web,'' Byrne Fields (CQ) said. ``I think it
breaks down a lot of barriers for them. I think they know the Rock
the Vote site is for them, that it's a young people's site.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said her struggle to create a young people's site has
already proven successful, as more and more young people volunteer
to write for the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were nights in the beginning working until three a.m.
when I had to be at work by nine, but it was worth it,'' Rice said.
``I can't think of anything better to do with my time.''

 &HT;    INTERNET SPURS YOUTH INVOLVEMENT IN ELECTORAL PROCESS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 1
 &HT;    By MEGAN K. DOYLE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After working a 13 hour day, Alexis Rice spends
another four hours on her computer working toward her real goal _
involving today's youth in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 22, launched a non-profit, non-partisan Web site in July
aimed at educating young people about the upcoming presidential
election: www.generationvote.com.
</P>
<P>
   A native of West Palm Beach, Fla., Rice and a handful of other
founders rely on a nationwide network of young volunteers to
provide articles and opinion columns about the major issues in the
2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to educate, motivate and encourage young people to
become politically active,'' Rice said. ``I started this site
because I felt that there was nothing out there, as far as
political news goes, that spoke specifically to young voters. I
didn't see anything for my generation, to give them information
about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rice, the reasons for using the Internet to reach today's
youth are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most young people have fast, easily available connections to
the Internet through their schools or jobs,'' Rice said. ``They're
used to using it for research, for fun, for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice began thinking about the site in March. She sent e-mails
and press releases to young activist groups and colleges across the
country. She posted information about her idea on the Web, looking
for people to help with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most sites spend hundreds of thousands on design,'' Rice said.
``We're not funded by any corporation, we're just young people
encouraging youth to go out and vote. So we had to find designers
and writers who believed in the project and would work for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that generationvote.com is operational, staffers spend their
weekends and evenings keeping it updated. The Web is the one place
Rice said she can make a difference for youth voters.
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. Since the 1996 election, many organizations
have gone to the Internet to reach young people.
</P>
<P>
   Even the presidential candidates are going on-line in efforts to
grab the youth vote. Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore offer pages on their campaign Web sites aimed at
today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's site, www.georgewbush.com, features pages where children
and college students can learn about the election and get involved
in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is more central to young voters today than in any
previous election,'' said Tucker Eskew, senior communications
advisor for the Bush-Cheney campaign. ``It's absolute political
dynamite for young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's site, www.algore2000.com, includes pages that encourage
children, college students, and young professionals to participate
in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young voters are Internet savvy,'' said Jano Cabrera, deputy
national spokesman for the Gore-Lieberman campaign. ``If they have
a question on a particular issue, they go to the Web site. If they
can't find the answer, they know they can ask the question on-line
and they'll get an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns said the amount of information available on the
Web will have a substantial impact on this and future elections.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based information already has affected some voters.
According to a 1998 study by the Pew Research Center, 34 percent of
people who used the Web for political purposes said their vote in
1998 was influenced by information they found on the Internet.
Another Pew study found that Americans under 30 are half as likely
to use the Internet for election news as a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites see the Internet as a way to make the voting process
more accessible to today's youth. Through a partnership with
www.election.com, visitors to generationvote.com can register to
vote and request an absentee ballot on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Election.com has registered more than 300,000 people to vote
from their Web site through such partnerships, including one with
the American Association of Retired Persons, a group whose members
are 50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Election.com also seeks to make lifelong voters out of today's
students through a program called Youth-e-Vote. The program works
with elementary and secondary schools to educate students about
issues and candidates, then urges the students to vote on-line a
week before the national election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are the future of this country,'' said Julia
Glidden, vice president of public affairs at election.com. ``If
they're not engaged politically, we will all suffer.''

</P>
<P>
   Kids Voting USA is another organization trying to encourage
involvement in the electoral process. Kids Voting USA urges parents
to take their children to the polls on Election Day. Formed in
1991, the organization just went on-line a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it as an opportunity to reach more people than we could
otherwise, especially because our program is so grass-roots
(oriented) and located in very specific areas,'' said Paula Case,
public relations coordinator at Kids Voting USA.
</P>
<P>
   The organization prepares children to vote through specific
civics courses taught in participating schools. Case cited the
ability to create an on-line curriculum that would be accessible
only to teachers as another major advantage of the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Kids Voting USA has seen some success. In 1996, Kids Voting
communities in Kansas had an 8 percent higher rate of turnout among
first-time voters than non-participating communities, according to
the Kansas secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   Rock the Vote, a group dedicated to helping young people change
their communities, has also used the Internet to increase its
effectiveness. As a non-profit group, the organization finds it
easier to get its message out on the Web than through traditional
media where it has to rely on free advertising space and public
service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is a place where young people can ``go a little
further'' by registering to vote, finding information about the
issues or speaking out on bulletin boards, according to Alison
Byrne Fields, creative director and chief strategist for Rock the
Vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the site, we get a lot of simple questions from young
people that maybe they're hesitant to ask for fear of looking
stupid, such as how to register to vote,'' Byrne Fields (CQ) said.
``The Web site enables them to do this anonymously.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of young people who don't vote cite unfamiliarity
with the candidates as the reason, according to a survey released
Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1989, I bought a voiceprint lock for $1,500 and had it
installed on the front door of my condominium. The device was the
size of a shoe box, with a keypad on the front and a four-digit red
LED readout.
 &HT;    To get into my house I would simply enter my code (9) and say my
password (``airplane''). A moment later, the door would unlock.
 &HT;    The system worked pretty well, but it wouldn't let me into my
house during a loud thunderstorm or, ironically, when an airplane
was passing overhead.
 &HT;    When I sold the condo, the new owners painted over the
voiceprint reader and installed a more familiar, keyhole lock.
 &HT;    A decade later, computerized biometrics _ systems that read your
body measurements or patterns such as fingerprints, voiceprints,
iris prints or facial features _ has finally come of age.
 &HT;    For example, the U.S. Army is building a huge biometric database
intended to simplify everything from salary payments to military
security. Banks are experimenting with iris scanners as a way to
replace ATM cards and numerical pass codes.
 &HT;    As a result, the $60 million commercial biometrics market is
expected to grow tenfold in the next three years.
 &HT;    Fingerprints, which are by far the best-established biometric
markers, have thoroughly proven their worth in the world of law
enforcement. More than a hundred years ago, police in Argentina
began recording fingerprints left at a crime scene to identify
suspects. The idea quickly spread.
 &HT;    Throughout the 20th century, U.S. police departments and the FBI
compiled ''10-print cards'' from suspects and lifted samples of
fingerprints from crime scenes.
 &HT;    But as these files grew larger and larger they became less and
less useful, because searching for a match was manual. By the
mid-1980s it would have taken a single worker more than 33 years to
search the U.S. Department of Justice's 300,000 fingerprint cards
for a match, according to a 1987 department report.
 &HT;    Computerized fingerprint systems fundamentally changed the
rules. As police departments scanned fingerprint cards and latent
prints from crime scenes into their computers, the computers
rapidly found matches and solved crimes that had been given up as
hopeless.
 &HT;    Now electronic fingerprinting is catching on in the office.
 &HT;    ``The biggest applications are the `log in' process,'' says
William H. Saito, president and CEO of I/O Software, a California
firm that sells software for fingerprint and face recognition
systems.
 &HT;    Instead of having employees remember dozens of passwords for
different computer systems, companies are using biometric systems
to implement ``single sign-on,'' Saito says.
 &HT;    A worker just sits down at the computer, presses a thumb against
a credit-card-sized scanner, and the system automatically unlocks
the files and applications that person is authorized to use.
 &HT;    ``Among the Fortune 1000 companies it is a no-brainer,'' Saito
says.
 &HT;    He also sees interest in biometrics spreading to small offices
and home-computer users.
 &HT;    ``We can prevent an application launch _ we won't let people
launch Quicken, for example, without a fingerprint,'' he says.
 &HT;    I/O's software can also control the Web browser, so that younger
family members can access only specific Web sites.
 &HT;    Eventually, fingerprints might also be used to finalize business
transactions _ tax payments or home refinancing, for instance _
conducted over the Internet.
 &HT;    President Clinton recently approved a bill that would make such
electronic signatures as legally binding as traditional ones in pen
and ink.
 &HT;    Sounds promising, but commercial biometrics has a history of
false starts. That's because the systems don't actually identify a
person; they merely compare a measurement of the human body with a
stored template.
 &HT;    If the measurement and the template are similar enough, the
comparing software declares the two a match.
 &HT;    Early systems sold in the 1980s didn't do very well on these
comparisons. They were subject to high numbers of false positives,
in which the system erroneously matched a person's measurement with
the wrong template, and false negatives, in which the computer
failed to identify a real match.
 &HT;    Today's systems are far more accurate, thanks to faster
computers, but they still make mistakes.
 &HT;    Voiceprint IDs haven't found widespread use largely because of
technical difficulties.
 &HT;    ``The inherent problem is that all microphones are not created
equal,'' Saito says. ``Ambient noise is another problem, especially
if you are outside on a tarmac, inside a client's office or in a
classroom full of kids.''
 &HT;    Or, in my case, standing in the rain, trying to get the
voiceprint lock to open between thunderclaps.
 &HT;    Striations in the eye's iris are a thousand times more
distinctive than the whorls on a finger, so in principle iris
prints should be even more reliable than fingerprints.
 &HT;    In 1995, the first iris scanners were successfully deployed to
provide security for prison doors and bank vaults, says Lou
Sassano, vice president of worldwide sales for IriScan, a New
Jersey company that holds patents on the technology.
 &HT;    Bank United of Texas recently set up three automatic teller
machines equipped with IriScan's technology in Dallas.
 &HT;    ``The recognition is so secure you do not have to use either
your ATM card or your PIN number,'' says Vern Stockton, a director
at Bank United.
 &HT;    Iris recognition adds approximately $5,000 to the overall
$15,000 to $35,000 cost of an ATM.
 &HT;    Late this year, IriScan will introduce a $200 camera for desktop
computers.
 &HT;    Part of the appeal of iris prints is that they require no
special action _ they can be read without a person's knowledge.
 &HT;    Facial recognition is prone to error but is even more stealthy.
Viisage Technology, a Massachusetts firm, has developed a system
that would allow police to scan a driver after they stop a vehicle.
Their approach, based on technology developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Lab in the early 1990s, would use a
hidden camera on the officer's collar to photograph people in the
car. Then a pair of radios would transmit the image to the police
station, where a computer would run a comparison against a
face-recognition database and transmit an alert to the officer if
the driver were wanted or dangerous.
 &HT;    Another Viisage product, called Hunter, is designed to pick out
known terrorists from airport surveillance cameras. More than 50
casinos already use a similar system of hidden video cameras and
computers to identify known scam artists and cardsharps.
 &HT;    There are no laws in the United States to regulate the
collection or use of biometric information.
 &HT;    ``Biometrics is one of the most urgent privacy issues,'' says
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
 &HT;    Biometric identifiers could replace Social Security numbers and
become a kind of ``informational flypaper,'' he says, so that
everything about you _ your product preferences, credit history,
youthful indiscretions _ sticks with you for life.
 &HT;    Someday you might feel a strange nostalgia for old-fashioned
signatures and ATM cards, not to mention locks and keys.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A large organization works most efficiently when a job gets
divided up among specialists, each of whom does a limited set of
things exceptionally well.
 &HT;    The same holds true for the human nervous system. Such division
of labor is especially prominent in the eye, home to two highly
distinct networks of light processing neurons.
 &HT;    In one network, visual nerve cells activated by rod-shaped
receptors are exquisitely sensitive to dim light and motion, but
hopeless at resolving colors and small contours.
 &HT;    The other network, driven by receptors shaped like cones, is
very proficient at discerning colors and fine details, but
relatively inept at detecting faint light or subtle movement.
 &HT;    Despite their individual weaknesses, the rod and cone systems
make a great team, working together like two army scouts who've
agreed that one will scan the landscape for movement but hand off
to his partner the job of determining what it is that's moving.
 &HT;    We don't notice that we have two receptor systems because our
brains seamlessly combine their outputs. But with these tests you
can tease them apart.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Compare the brightness of these two color patches. In strong
light, the red should look a little punchier. But if you turn down
the lights until the gap in the C above the colors is barely
discernible, the red should be the dimmer of the two hues.
 &HT;    That's because the cone system, which dominates vision in
daytime, responds well to red light, whereas the rod system, which
rules the night, can hardly see red at all.
 &HT;    This change in relative color brightness from day to night is
called the Purkinje shift, after Jan Evangelista Purkinje, the
Czech scientist who first described it.
 &HT;    The proportion of rods to cones is greater away from the center
of the retina where you fix your gaze, so the red splotch will look
even darker if you move it into rod territory by staring at the C
instead of directly at the colors.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Make an artificial star by taping a piece of cardboard over the
lens of a flashlight and then pricking a tiny hole in the
cardboard.
 &HT;    Ensuring that no light escapes except through the pinhole, put
the flashlight on a flat surface in a dark room, and angle the
light so you're not looking straight into it. Move 10 feet away and
you'll notice that the star is brighter when you look away from it
than it is when you look directly at it.
 &HT;    This provides more evidence that rods, which are most populous
in the periphery of vision, have greater sensitivity than the cones
that inhabit the center of the retina.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hold up your right index finger about 90 degrees from your
center of gaze. Now wiggle the finger vigorously, and notice how it
becomes much more visible while moving.
 &HT;    But if you look right at the same finger, it's just about as
noticeable moving as it is stationary. The reason: Rod-based

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1989, I bought a voiceprint lock for $1,500 and had it
installed on the front door of my condominium. The device was the
size of a shoe box, with a keypad on the front and a four-digit red
LED readout.
 &HT;    To get into my house I would simply enter my code (9) and say my
password (``airplane''). A moment later, the door would unlock.
 &HT;    The system worked pretty well, but it wouldn't let me into my
house during a loud thunderstorm or, ironically, when an airplane
was passing overhead.
 &HT;    When I sold the condo, the new owners painted over the
voiceprint reader and installed a more familiar, keyhole lock.
 &HT;    A decade later, computerized biometrics _ systems that read your
body measurements or patterns such as fingerprints, voiceprints,
iris prints or facial features _ has finally come of age.
 &HT;    For example, the U.S. Army is building a huge biometric database
intended to simplify everything from salary payments to military
security. Banks are experimenting with iris scanners as a way to
replace ATM cards and numerical pass codes.
 &HT;    As a result, the $60 million commercial biometrics market is
expected to grow tenfold in the next three years.
 &HT;    Fingerprints, which are by far the best-established biometric
markers, have thoroughly proven their worth in the world of law
enforcement. More than a hundred years ago, police in Argentina
began recording fingerprints left at a crime scene to identify
suspects. The idea quickly spread.
 &HT;    Throughout the 20th century, U.S. police departments and the FBI
compiled ''10-print cards'' from suspects and lifted samples of
fingerprints from crime scenes.
 &HT;    But as these files grew larger and larger they became less and
less useful, because searching for a match was manual. By the
mid-1980s it would have taken a single worker more than 33 years to
search the U.S. Department of Justice's 300,000 fingerprint cards
for a match, according to a 1987 department report.
 &HT;    Computerized fingerprint systems fundamentally changed the
rules. As police departments scanned fingerprint cards and latent
prints from crime scenes into their computers, the computers
rapidly found matches and solved crimes that had been given up as
hopeless.
 &HT;    Now electronic fingerprinting is catching on in the office.
 &HT;    ``The biggest applications are the `log in' process,'' says
William H. Saito, president and CEO of I/O Software, a California
firm that sells software for fingerprint and face recognition
systems.
 &HT;    Instead of having employees remember dozens of passwords for
different computer systems, companies are using biometric systems
to implement ``single sign-on,'' Saito says.
 &HT;    A worker just sits down at the computer, presses a thumb against
a credit-card-sized scanner, and the system automatically unlocks
the files and applications that person is authorized to use.
 &HT;    ``Among the Fortune 1000 companies it is a no-brainer,'' Saito
says.
 &HT;    He also sees interest in biometrics spreading to small offices
and home-computer users.
 &HT;    ``We can prevent an application launch _ we won't let people
launch Quicken, for example, without a fingerprint,'' he says.
 &HT;    I/O's software can also control the Web browser, so that younger
family members can access only specific Web sites.
 &HT;    Eventually, fingerprints might also be used to finalize business
transactions _ tax payments or home refinancing, for instance _
conducted over the Internet.
 &HT;    President Clinton recently approved a bill that would make such
electronic signatures as legally binding as traditional ones in pen
and ink.
 &HT;    Sounds promising, but commercial biometrics has a history of
false starts. That's because the systems don't actually identify a
person; they merely compare a measurement of the human body with a
stored template.
 &HT;    If the measurement and the template are similar enough, the
comparing software declares the two a match.
 &HT;    Early systems sold in the 1980s didn't do very well on these
comparisons. They were subject to high numbers of false positives,
in which the system erroneously matched a person's measurement with
the wrong template, and false negatives, in which the computer
failed to identify a real match.
 &HT;    Today's systems are far more accurate, thanks to faster
computers, but they still make mistakes.
 &HT;    Voiceprint IDs haven't found widespread use largely because of
technical difficulties.
 &HT;    ``The inherent problem is that all microphones are not created
equal,'' Saito says. ``Ambient noise is another problem, especially
if you are outside on a tarmac, inside a client's office or in a
classroom full of kids.''
 &HT;    Or, in my case, standing in the rain, trying to get the
voiceprint lock to open between thunderclaps.
 &HT;    Striations in the eye's iris are a thousand times more
distinctive than the whorls on a finger, so in principle iris
prints should be even more reliable than fingerprints.
 &HT;    In 1995, the first iris scanners were successfully deployed to
provide security for prison doors and bank vaults, says Lou
Sassano, vice president of worldwide sales for IriScan, a New
Jersey company that holds patents on the technology.
 &HT;    Bank United of Texas recently set up three automatic teller
machines equipped with IriScan's technology in Dallas.
 &HT;    ``The recognition is so secure you do not have to use either
your ATM card or your PIN number,'' says Vern Stockton, a director
at Bank United.
 &HT;    Iris recognition adds approximately $5,000 to the overall
$15,000 to $35,000 cost of an ATM.
 &HT;    Late this year, IriScan will introduce a $200 camera for desktop
computers.
 &HT;    Part of the appeal of iris prints is that they require no
special action _ they can be read without a person's knowledge.
 &HT;    Facial recognition is prone to error but is even more stealthy.
Viisage Technology, a Massachusetts firm, has developed a system
that would allow police to scan a driver after they stop a vehicle.
Their approach, based on technology developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Lab in the early 1990s, would use a
hidden camera on the officer's collar to photograph people in the
car. Then a pair of radios would transmit the image to the police
station, where a computer would run a comparison against a
face-recognition database and transmit an alert to the officer if
the driver were wanted or dangerous.
 &HT;    Another Viisage product, called Hunter, is designed to pick out
known terrorists from airport surveillance cameras. More than 50
casinos already use a similar system of hidden video cameras and
computers to identify known scam artists and cardsharps.
 &HT;    There are no laws in the United States to regulate the
collection or use of biometric information.
 &HT;    ``Biometrics is one of the most urgent privacy issues,'' says
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
 &HT;    Biometric identifiers could replace Social Security numbers and
become a kind of ``informational flypaper,'' he says, so that
everything about you _ your product preferences, credit history,
youthful indiscretions _ sticks with you for life.
 &HT;    Someday you might feel a strange nostalgia for old-fashioned
signatures and ATM cards, not to mention locks and keys.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A large organization works most efficiently when a job gets
divided up among specialists, each of whom does a limited set of
things exceptionally well.
 &HT;    The same holds true for the human nervous system. Such division
of labor is especially prominent in the eye, home to two highly
distinct networks of light processing neurons.
 &HT;    In one network, visual nerve cells activated by rod-shaped
receptors are exquisitely sensitive to dim light and motion, but
hopeless at resolving colors and small contours.
 &HT;    The other network, driven by receptors shaped like cones, is
very proficient at discerning colors and fine details, but
relatively inept at detecting faint light or subtle movement.
 &HT;    Despite their individual weaknesses, the rod and cone systems
make a great team, working together like two army scouts who've
agreed that one will scan the landscape for movement but hand off
to his partner the job of determining what it is that's moving.
 &HT;    We don't notice that we have two receptor systems because our
brains seamlessly combine their outputs. But with these tests you
can tease them apart.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Compare the brightness of these two color patches. In strong
light, the red should look a little punchier. But if you turn down
the lights until the gap in the C above the colors is barely
discernible, the red should be the dimmer of the two hues.
 &HT;    That's because the cone system, which dominates vision in
daytime, responds well to red light, whereas the rod system, which
rules the night, can hardly see red at all.
 &HT;    This change in relative color brightness from day to night is
called the Purkinje shift, after Jan Evangelista Purkinje, the
Czech scientist who first described it.
 &HT;    The proportion of rods to cones is greater away from the center
of the retina where you fix your gaze, so the red splotch will look
even darker if you move it into rod territory by staring at the C
instead of directly at the colors.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Make an artificial star by taping a piece of cardboard over the
lens of a flashlight and then pricking a tiny hole in the
cardboard.
 &HT;    Ensuring that no light escapes except through the pinhole, put
the flashlight on a flat surface in a dark room, and angle the
light so you're not looking straight into it. Move 10 feet away and
you'll notice that the star is brighter when you look away from it
than it is when you look directly at it.
 &HT;    This provides more evidence that rods, which are most populous
in the periphery of vision, have greater sensitivity than the cones
that inhabit the center of the retina.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hold up your right index finger about 90 degrees from your
center of gaze. Now wiggle the finger vigorously, and notice how it
becomes much more visible while moving.
 &HT;    But if you look right at the same finger, it's just about as
noticeable moving as it is stationary. The reason: Rod-based
peripheral vision is vastly more sensitive to movement than it is
to small details, while the cone-based central vision is less
responsive to movement and more acute.
 &HT;    Remembering the physiological differences between your night and
day eyes can come in handy at times. For example, now you'll avoid
wearing red if you want friends to find you while you're scanning
the night sky with your peripheral vision, seeking out both faint
stars and the kind that you wish upon.

can tease them apart.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Compare the brightness of these two color patches. In strong
light, the red should look a little punchier. But if you turn down
the lights until the gap in the C above the colors is barely
discernible, the red should be the dimmer of the two hues.
 &HT;    That's because the cone system, which dominates vision in
daytime, responds well to red light, whereas the rod system, which
rules the night, can hardly see red at all.
 &HT;    This change in relative color brightness from day to night is
called the Purkinje shift, after Jan Evangelista Purkinje, the
Czech scientist who first described it.
 &HT;    The proportion of rods to cones is greater away from the center
of the retina where you fix your gaze, so the red splotch will look
even darker if you move it into rod territory by staring at the C
instead of directly at the colors.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Make an artificial star by taping a piece of cardboard over the
lens of a flashlight and then pricking a tiny hole in the
cardboard.
 &HT;    Ensuring that no light escapes except through the pinhole, put
the flashlight on a flat surface in a dark room, and angle the
light so you're not looking straight into it. Move 10 feet away and
you'll notice that the star is brighter when you look away from it
than it is when you look directly at it.
 &HT;    This provides more evidence that rods, which are most populous
in the periphery of vision, have greater sensitivity than the cones
that inhabit the center of the retina.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hold up your right index finger about 90 degrees from your
center of gaze. Now wiggle the finger vigorously, and notice how it
becomes much more visible while moving.
 &HT;    But if you look right at the same finger, it's just about as
noticeable moving as it is stationary. The reason: Rod-based
peripheral vision is vastly more sensitive to movement than it is
to small details, while the cone-based central vision is less
responsive to movement and more acute.
 &HT;    Remembering the physiological differences between your night and
day eyes can come in handy at times. For example, now you'll avoid
wearing red if you want friends to find you while you're scanning
the night sky with your peripheral vision, seeking out both faint
stars and the kind that you wish upon.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS IDENTIFY MICROBE WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Many of the microbes are too small to see, and
through a microscope they resemble wriggling, translucent blobs
filled with lint.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not be as dumb as they look.
</P>
<P>
   One type of microbe has enough primitive intelligence to wend
its way through a maze, Japanese researcher Toshiyuki Nakagaki and
two colleagues report in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The microbe, a slime mold named Physarum polycephalum, can
figure out the shortest distance between two points in a maze, as
if it were a little computer, the Japanese scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This remarkable process of cellular computation implies that
cellular materials can show a primitive intelligence,'' Nakagaki
and his team write.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts scoff at the idea that microbes possess
intelligence, even primitive. They say the microbe's behavior is
just an unthinking reflex action.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some critics acknowledge, the maze-running microbe
dramatizes that microbes aren't as passive and helpless as they
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Some microbes can engage in surprisingly complex behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're observing sounds real. But it's the
interpretation of the results that I question. The use of the word
intelligence might be stretching it,'' said Dennis Miller, an
associate professor of biology at the University of Iowa. Miller
frequently works with Physarum polycephalum in his research.
</P>
<P>
   In Nakagaki's experiment, the microbe was able to navigate its
way through the maze until it found the shortest _ and, hence, most
energy-efficient _ route between two blocks of microbe food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligence is a little bit strong as a statement (of the
microbe's behavior), but otherwise it's a nice little story,'' said
Steven Lindow, chairman of the division of microbial biology at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Physarum polycephalum is a single giant cell, but it contains
multiple nuclei (gene-carrying materials). A typical cell contains
just one nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   A single Physarum polycephalum can spread several inches across,
as big as a Petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   Nakagaki works at the Bio-Mimetic Control Research Center in
Nagoya, Japan. His colleagues in the experiment were Hiroyasu
Yamada of Hokkaido University and Agota Toth of the University of
Szeged in Hungary.

&HT;     RANCHERO SINGER ROJAS REACHES NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ It wasn't even a week after her appendectomy,
but Nydia Rojas was ready to belt out her signature ranchero songs
for a PBS television show in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Still tender from the surgery, the 20-year-old then flew here
for another concert at an outdoor theater with about 300 people
watching her every delicate move. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Best Ranchero Performance nominee was headed
back to L.A. for the Latin Grammys at the Staples Center, where she
was seen by millions in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   After years of singing at everything from quinceaeras to
weddings and restaurants, where she made $40 for each appearance,
Rojas is finally reaching a new height in her career. On Saturday
at San Jose Arena she will begin a dream tour: appearing on the
same bill as legendary Mexican singers Juan Gabriel and Ana
Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be totally good at a different level,'' Rojas
said recently over a chicken ensalada at a Mexican restaurant.
``It's going to be instant credibility because of the name _ and
he's helping me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Crooner Juan Gabriel, who has amassed a musical empire worth
millions by writing, producing and performing his music since the
late '60s, is personally mentoring Rojas. Gabriel, who has written
hundreds of songs, is part of Hauser Entertainment, Inc., a
management group representing an A-list roster of Latino singers
including Rocio Durcal, Vicente Fernandez, his heartthrob son,
Alejandro Fernandez, and Joan Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Rojas was asked to join the elite circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought she'd be a vital part of our company,`` said Ralph
Hauser. ``She has a good voice, she has a good work ethic and
crossover ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser, who first met Rojas when she was about 16, watched her
grow up and was concerned about her voice changing, but it only got
better, he said. He added that he has asked Juan Gabriel ``if he
could help me in cultivating her in her growth. He's very
diversified. He's taken her under his wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas was born in Whittier, Calif., and raised in Guadalajara,
Mexico, where she took up mariachi music as a 2-year-old singing
Pedro Infante's ``Amorcito Corazon (Little Love, My Heart).''
</P>
<P>
   As a little girl she heard a boy in Mexico singing mariachi
music. It captivated her so much that she told her mother she
wanted to pursue mariachi singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was to say no,'' said Olivia Rojas, Nydia's
mother. ``I didn't want my daughter to sing love songs of
heartbreak that drunk men sing to women. Besides, it's not an easy
career, or lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter eventually forged an agreement. Nydia would
be allowed to sing as long as she studied music and kept up her
grades. She did.
</P>
<P>
   By age 11, Rojas had her first paying job as a mariachi musician
singing in a local L.A. restaurant. Years later she joined the
country's first all-female mariachi, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles.
By 15, she had gone solo and recorded her first album for Arista
Records.
</P>
<P>
   Today she has already recorded her third album, ``Si me
conocieras (If You Knew Me)'' on Hollywood Records and has played
for crowds reaching nearly 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   During the tour Rojas will be performing new music. She's
dropping the mariachi look and will add more pop. She will also be
moving around a lot more on stage. ``I will do a touch of mariachi
music (so as not to) leave my roots behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican music typically uses trumpets, violins, a vihuela (small
guitar) and a guitarron (a big guitar) to convey the music's
passionate plea to love. The svelte singer, who often wears the
traditional embroidered costume known as a charro, knows how to
play all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said she sees herself studying more, and not just music.
Between performances she takes classes at a junior college and said
she plans to transfer to a university to earn an MBA.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY
 &HT;    Judge's rebuke in Lee case is disputed
 &HT;    By David A. Vise
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department officials fired back Wednesday
at the federal judge in New Mexico who delivered a stinging rebuke
of the government's handling of the Wen Ho Lee case two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   James Robinson, head of the Justice Department's criminal
division, said U.S. District Judge James A. Parker's criticism had
been misguided. Norman Bay, the U.S. attorney for New Mexico, said
the judge was unaware of plea negotiations in which Lee's lawyers
had threatened to introduce U.S. nuclear secrets in the courtroom,
a tactic known as graymail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got great respect for Judge Parker, but don't know if he
was aware of all of the discussions that had occurred between the
parties,'' Bay told a Senate Judiciary Committee task force looking
in to the Lee case. ``When we were sitting in the courtroom at
sentencing, his comments came as a complete surprise to us. . . . I
was very much blindsided by the judge's comments.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count of what had
been a 59-count criminal indictment and was sentenced by Parker to
the nine months he had already served in jail while awaiting trial
on charges of mishandling classified information at Los Alamos
National Laboratory. Parker profusely apologized to the 60-year-old
Taiwanese American scientist for the harsh conditions of his
incarceration and lambasted the Justice Department and FBI, which
the judge said had misled him and embarrassed the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's remarks prompted President Clinton to raise
questions about Lee's pretrial incarceration and touched off a
debate about whether the FBI and prosecutors had tried to coerce a
confession from Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said it was common in such cases for the government to
agree to a plea bargain rather than risk the disclosure of national
secrets in open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Judge Parker made this statement was a little
unusual under the circumstances,'' Robinson said, adding that the
judge seemed to be ``making these comments for the galleries.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Judiciary Committee
task force, questioned why the government lawyers did not enter
into a plea bargain with Lee before he was indicted in December.
Bay responded that until the final plea bargain, Lee had refused to
answer questions under oath about what he did with roughly 400,000
pages of sensitive information that he had downloaded to computer
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Bay also said that during the negotiations in May, an attorney
for Lee threatened to take the government on a ``long, slow death
march'' by forcing disclosure of nuclear secrets in open court.
</P>
<P>
   Specter shot back: ``If somebody had told me, when I was a
prosecuting attorney, they were going to put me on a long, slow
death march, I'd say, `Let's start walking,' '' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Specter also questioned the conditions of Lee's confinement,
including a light that was left burning in his cell 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told that the light was a dull blue light, kind of like a
night light, and that the jail would use that just to make sure
that if someone walked by and looked inside his cell, that they
could make sure that he was there and that he was doing OK,'' Bay
said. ``. . . We never received a complaint from defense counsel
about the light.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also produced a memo saying that Lee told a
jail-appointed monitor in March that he had no complaints about his
conditions, other than wanting more fruit at meals.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ No matter how many international tournaments
the United States has won, Norway has always played the role of
asterisk in the American domination of women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   It is the one nation with a winning record against the United
States, the one team with the same unyielding resolve and
expectation of victory. Norway did not capitulate Thursday night
when overtime of the Olympic gold medal came in the most
excruciating of ways, Tiffeny Milbrett heading a brilliant cross
from Mia Hamm into the net half a minute from the end of
regulation. The Norwegians grew angry, not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got mad,'' defender Gro Espeseth said. ``I said: `No, we are
going to win this. We don't want them to do this again.' It was our
turn. We weren't going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3-2 Norwegian victory over the United States, before a crowd
of 22,848 at Sydney Football Stadium, will be remembered as one of
the greatest women's games ever played, wide open and full of wild
swings, breathless creativity, stirring defense, rapturous victory
and inconsolable defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive play developed 12 minutes into sudden death, when
midfielder Hege Riise sent a long, arcing pass into the penalty
area. Joy Fawcett got her head on the ball but could not control it
for the U.S. defense. The ball ricocheted off the upper left arm of
forward Dagny Mellgren and bounced free and unobstructed toward the
goal. Mellgren reached it and pushed a shot from 14 yards past the
diving U.S. goalkeeper Siri Mullinix, sending Norway into ecstatic
celebration and leaving the U.S. team in stunned silence, hands on
their hips, silver medals around their necks when they had expected
gold.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the game will be widely debated because of the
potential for a hand ball to have been called on Mellgren's winning
goal. The rules say that a violation occurs if a player touches the
ball on purpose or gains an advantage from the contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was hitting me,'' Mellgren said. ``I didn't
see it. I didn't do it on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain, the U.S. defender, said she was satisfied that,
unlike the NFL, international soccer does not rely on videotaped
replays to confirm or contradict a referee's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee is part of the game, for good calls and bad,''
Chastain said. ``I'd prefer her to make the call in that instant
than to rely on videotape.''
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett said she was uncertain what happened in the chaos of the
moment. Afterward, Julie Foudy, the U.S. captain, sought an
explanation from referee Sonia Denoncourt of Canada. The referee
put up her hand and said, ``Don't do this to me, Jules,'' said
Foudy, who added that Denoncourt thought the ball had hit
Mellgren's chest.
</P>
<P>
   The referee did not speak to reporters, but the U.S. team did
not challenge the decision, remaining gracious in defeat, calling
the loss shocking but not unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to focus on that,'' Foudy said. ``I think we need
to applaud Norway for a great game.''

<P>
   Norway has built a 15-13-2 overall record against the United
States, winning four and tying one of their eight matches this
year. It was Norway that handed the U.S. team their most bitter
defeat, a 1-0 loss in the semifinals of the 1995 Women's World Cup,
infuriating the United States when Riise and her teammates crawled
on their knees across the field in a celebration ritual called
``the train.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the United States defeated Norway in overtime of
the 1996 Olympic semifinals. The Americans opened the Sydney Games
with a 2-0 victory, dominating a Norwegian team that seemed slow
and listless. Thursday night, however, a rejuvenated Norwegian
squad prevailed on tactical resourcefulness, fresher legs and more
reliable goalkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The United States scored in the first five minutes when Mia Hamm
elbowed her way around the defender Goeril Kringen and crossed a
pass to Tiffeny Milbrett, who chipped it into the net from 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, no, not again,'' Espeseth told herself in the Norwegian
defense. ``Why should they win again and again and again?''
</P>
<P>
   She would not let them. A minute before halftime, Riise lifted a
corner kick from the right side and Espeseth outjumped the U.S.
defender Kate Sobrero, flicking the ball with her head. Guarding
the left goal post, Shannon MacMillan raised her left leg, but the
ball deflected into the net for a 1-1 tie. A minute before
halftime, the United States had given a dormant team new life and
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a momentum crusher,'' Foudy said.
</P>
<P>
   Norway had opened the game in a 4-4-2 alignment with four
defenders, four midfielders and two forwards. After halftime, it
switched to five midfielders and began to pressure the United
States, closing space that had been wide open. In the 78th minute,
Mullinix rushed 12 yards off her line to punch away a long pass,
but instead collided with Fawcett, knocking her off the ball.
Ragnhild Gulbrandsen's header bounded into the empty net and put
Norway up, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming the penalty area had made Mullinix an assertive
goalkeeper this year in replacement of an injured Briana Scurry,
but it also made her a risky last line of defense. She did not do
the one thing that is mandatory when she strayed from the goal
mouth: get her hands on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a lack of experience,'' Mullinix said.
``That's my style. I'm not going to not play my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom behind in any international tournament, the U.S. team
remained composed, and only 30 seconds before the end of
regulation, Hamm floated a crossing pass from the right flank to
the 5-foot-2 Milbrett, who outjumped a Norwegian defender and
headed in the tying goal. Criticized because she did not score in
the knockout round of the 1999 Women's World Cup, Hamm finished the
Sydney Games with the clever, dependable, relentless play that is
to be expected from someone with her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked up to heaven and said, `Thank you,''' Hamm said
of the tying goal. ``I didn't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway might have folded at this point, but as it gathered
before overtime, Espeseth said her teammates were telling one
another: ``This is our Olympics. We're not going to lose.''
Mellgren had entered the game only 12 minutes earlier. While Hamm
and Milbrett had been running up and down nonstop, the Norwegian
forward had rested legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the Americans would be tired at the end, and we had
fresh legs to put in,'' Norway coach Per-Mathias Hagmo said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve minutes into the overtime, Mellgren ran onto Riise's long
pass, lifted her arm slightly toward the ball, let it bounce and
fired a shot toward Mullinix. The U.S. goalkeeper lunged to her
left and got a hand on the ball but could not stop it. Norway had
won. Goalkeeping provided victory for the United States at the 1999
Women's World Cup, but Thursday night it was not steady enough to
prevent defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enormous will on our team,'' Mellgren said. ``We are
strong mentally and physically. We decided to win against every
team. I knew that if we kept going, we'd score a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mellgren's winning goal, Hamm knelt down and put her face
in her hands. Several of her teammates stood in disbelief. Others
hugged and cried in each other's arms. ``I was in shock until I got
to the locker room,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Having won a pair of World Cups and the gold medal at the
Atlanta Olympics in 1996, the U.S. team had changed the way women's
sports were viewed. They drew 90,000 fans to the Rose Bowl for the
1999 World Cup final, and 40 million television viewers in the
United States. No longer could anyone say that people would not pay
in large numbers to watch women play sports.
</P>
<P>
   A professional women's soccer league will start next April. The
players will finally be able to make a living at their sport
playing in their home country. But the U.S. squad wanted this
Olympic tournament as validation of their greatness, a confirmation
that they could win a major tournament outside the United States, a
final victory before many of the players considered retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted so badly to do it for this group,'' Foudy said.
``It's possibly our last time together. It's irreplaceable, this
bond.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, there were no excuses. Chastain, ever a
student of the sport, said defeat, as bitter as it was, was
tempered by the magnificence of Thursday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest game I've ever been part of,'' she said.

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Arabs might get in trouble for criticizing their
leaders on the streets of many Middle Eastern capitals, but now
they can get on the Internet and join in with ``Mock the
Governments.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one offering of an Arabic satire page on ``Al-Bawaba,'' a
new Internet portal not unlike the more familiar Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Bawaba users can also go to the ``relationships'' English
bulletin board to discuss taboo subjects in Arab society. There,
one writer named Rania asks, ``Why are men in the Arab world
allowed premarital relations and then women not?''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Bawaba, meaning ``The Gateway,'' opened over the summer as
the latest of several major Arab Internet service providers, or
ISPs, providing mostly unfettered news, chat and links to sites
around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The still fledgeling Al-Bawaba joins the early Internet pioneer
Arabia.com, and the youth-oriented Planet Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Together, by being objective news gatherers and hosts for
bulletin boards, they are pushing the limits of free speech in a
region where dissenters from political or religious conventions are
often jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of relief valve for people to say things they have
not been able to say or that have not been heard,'' said Daoud
Kuttab, director of the Institute for Modern Media at the
Palestinian Al-Quds University in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new ISPs are testing the economic waters
in an industry that is volatile enough even in America. In the
Middle East, computers are just catching on for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a mixture of modern technology, strategic planning and
entrepreneurial nerve.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Al-Bawaba's main editorial office is here in Amman,
where a few dozen journalists sit in modern work pods in the new
Merrill Lynch building. But the company is registered in Delaware
and its directors are in New York, giving it a foreign status that
could help insulate it from any attempts to control the content.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the satire page, Al-Bawaba intends to publish
literature and articles that have been banned in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the Web sites say that governments are already
finding out that the Internet is tough to patrol, much less
control. While some sites are blocked by the monopoly government
server in Syria, for example, users have learned to easily hack
their way through.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some governments seem more willing to give Internet speech
a wider freedom than, say, local newspapers or radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have resisted sacrificing or compromising the way we think
people ought to be able to communicate,'' said Osama El-Sharif,
editor in chief of Jordan-based Arabia.com. ``Eventually, it is not
us who will be changed, but the way the authorities will view
things that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the main obstacle to success at the Arab Web sites
may be the same as that faces in the freewheeling Western Internet
world _ money.
</P>
<P>
   Even American ISPs and Web portals are cutting back and facing
advertising shortages. The Arab sites, meanwhile, have to carve out
a niche in a much smaller computer world.
</P>
<P>
   The Nua Internet Survey, used by the U.S. Department of Commerce
for on-line estimates, reports that only about 2 million of the
more than 270 million Arabs in the Middle East have regular
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   There is potential for growth. Though home computers are too
expensive for most Arabs, Internet cafes are flourishing in Jordan,
Egypt and Lebanon. Palestinians, exposed to computers in the
Western countries where many have made homes, help spread the word
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Money for Al-Bawaba and Arabia.com comes mainly from a mix of
Arab conglomerates. One of Arabia.com's chief investors is hi-tech
savvy Saudi billionaire Prince al Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz
al Saud.
</P>
<P>
   Investors look toward a future that the Nua survey group says
could see 12 million Arab users in this region the next two years.
But, for now, the Web sites compete for a small pool of users and,
therefore, skeptical advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   El-Sharif says Arabia.com users click on 33 million of its pages
every month. But, he estimates that nearly half of its 300,000
regular users are Arab Americans. The 5-year-old Web site does not
expect to see any profits for another couple years.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to increase the audience, Arabia.com this month
launched a million-dollar ad campaign plugging the site throughout
the region, from newspapers in Egypt to billboards in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are targeted at young people. Not only are they open to
new technology, El-Sharif says, but they will become used to free
speech and spread the word as they mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones who will affect change in the future,'' he
says.

FIELD FLIES OFF IN A NEW DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sally Field appears to be eager to please. She's
sitting on the edge of a sofa in a cavernous suite in a Dallas
hotel, leaning into every question and comment as she discusses
``Beautiful,'' her feature-directing debut. She could be the
opposite of Mona, the ambitious beauty queen played by Minnie
Driver in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Field is affable; Mona is, well, kind of hard to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should be hard to take,'' Field says. ``I love that. I
love not knowing from the moment that you see someone on screen
that you're going to end up caring about their journey. Especially
when they're not coming onscreen with that, `You're going to have a
nice time with me because I'm going to be easy to take; I'm going
to be pleasant.' People aren't (pleasant). Things aren't. Life's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't sound like the winner of two Oscars and an Emmy
talking, recall that Field, who turns 54 in November, had been in
the biz more than a decade before she earned respect _ and her
first Emmy _ by playing a woman with 16 personalities in the 1976
TV movie ``Sybil.'' Recall that she had two Oscars before she
appeared to believe that she'd earned the respect. Recall that she
has been twice divorced, and that she's a single mother whose
primary focus these days is her youngest son, who's entering junior
high. Recall that she chooses her work carefully because she
believes it's still hard for a woman to earn respect in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   For her, it's especially hard to find a story that she can
relate to as a woman _ which is what drew her to ``Beautiful.'' Men
are inconsequential to ``Beautiful,'' which tells the story of a
woman who seeks redemption from an unhappy childhood by trying to
win beauty pageants. Mona, the protagonist, is so obsessed with
this process that she even pretends to be the aunt of her own
daughter _ because acknowledging the child would make her
ineligible for beauty contests.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Field's first directing assignment; she also handled a
1996 TV movie called ``The Christmas Tree'' and did a segment of
the Tom Hanks-produced HBO miniseries ``From the Earth to the
Moon.'' But it is her first shot at making a film for the big
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, primarily, I wanted to see if I wanted to do it
because I am a storyteller,'' Field says. ``As an actor, I'm a
storyteller, and that's what I've always liked about acting. I
thought, `You know, if I could translate this _ my love of acting
and my history with acting _ if I could translate it to directing,
if I ever could have any skill at it at all, then I could tell so
many more stories than I could as an actor, because as an actor I'm
locked into me. I can only tell stories about a woman my height,
approximately my age and my gender, my race.' I just was feeling
that really, I had more things to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Field started her storytelling relatively early. She entered
acting at age 18 when she enrolled in an actors workshop, which led
to a role in the 1965-66 TV series surf sitcom ``Gidget.'' As early
as 1967's ``The Flying Nun,'' she began studying under prominent
acting coach Lee Strasberg, and stayed with him off and on for
several years after the show was canceled in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had done a handful of theatrical movies before
``Sybil,'' her Emmy _ and a relationship with Burt Reynolds _
helped her leap to big-screen stardom. She sealed the deal with
Oscars for playing a labor-union organizer in 1979's ``Norma Rae''
and for playing a Depression-era farm widow in 1984's ``Places in
the Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing up in public, Field doesn't believe that she's
unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really got the opportunity to have most of my childhood,''
she says. ``Certainly, I have been through so much that my
generation of women has been through. I was raised in the '50s and
early '60s, and watched all hell break loose, and had never been a
leader in it. I've really been very comfortable to be a sheep. It's
hard for me because I find it much more comfortable to be in the
middle of the flock.''
</P>
<P>
   Field says that acting helped her concentrate not so much on
leading or following, but on being herself and not caring so much
about what others thought. She's aware that ``Beautiful'' might not
be for everyone, but that's all right, because it worked for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outside of my hands,'' she says of the movie's box-office
fate, ``so I'm not having a major anxiety attack, because there's
nothing I can do. I set out to do what I wanted to do, and that is
I have this little story to tell _ and I did that. Certainly I
wanted to be still alive afterward, and I'm still alive, and
really, I did the very best that I was capable of doing at the
time. There's really nothing else that I can ask of myself.''

 &HT;    `Titans' scores points with simplistic game plan
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans'' is a well-intentioned racial drama
that's drawn in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the true story of a Virginia high school football team
that in 1971 was forced to integrate, the earnest Disney film
presents an inspirational tale about putting aside differences to
unite for a common goal _ in this case, scoring touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring a charismatic performance by Denzel Washington, the
feel-good film is an entertaining crowd pleaser. However, its
approach to the civil rights struggle is almost cartoonishly
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Washington stars as Herman Boone, who was brought up to
Alexandria, Va., from South Carolina to coach the T.C. Williams
High Titans over Bill Yoast (Will Patton), a potential hall of fame
candidate with more seniority and staunch local support.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their combative meeting, Yoast agrees to act as Boone's
subordinate to keep the white players from sitting out the season
with him _ coaching the defense while Boone, a ``race man'' who
marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., takes the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the two coaches and their racially divided
staffs extends to the players, who previously attended all-white or
all-black schools. Racial brawls frequently erupt as the tough,
aggressive youths are packed off to a two-week summer training
camp, where Boone amusingly puts them through their paces like a
military drill sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   A pre-dawn run leads the team to the Gettysburg battleground,
where Boone delivers a stirring speech that puts the team's
conflict into historical perspective. ``If we don't come together
right now on this hallowed ground, we, too, will be destroyed,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans almost immediately pull together, but when they
return home to start school, the players find that their families
and friends don't share their newfound sense of harmony. Adding to
the strain, Boone learns that he will be fired if he loses a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans'' is remarkably high-minded fare for
producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who this summer gave us the
dumb-and-dumber duo of ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' and ``Coyote Ugly.''
Directed by Boaz Yakin (''Fresh''), the socially conscious drama is
the first release from Bruckheimer's Technical Black banner, which
will produce smaller films ``that explore issues not generally seen
in mainstream filmmaking,'' according to the media notes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film's heart is in the right place, its story lacks
complexity. The screenplay by former television writer Gregory
Allen Howard is broadly devised, with obvious heroes and villains,
and has all of the depth of a made-for-television movie.
</P>
<P>
   Washington clearly relishes his role, but his dialogue is
littered with platitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at family audiences, the uplifting film features no
profanity and steers clear of harsher racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   The likable gridiron ensemble includes lead defensive end Julius
Campbell (Wood Harris) and defensive linebacker and team captain
Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) _ opposing rivals who cross the color
line to become close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Hefty lineman Lewis Lastik (Ethan Suplee) doesn't care about
race, being a white kid from the poor section of town, and provides
comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   California transfer student Ronnie ``Sunshine'' Bass (Kip
Pardue), a long-haired quarterback, experiences the same
discrimination as his black teammates for being a hippie.
</P>
<P>
   Yoast's daughter, Sheryl (Hayden Panettiere), is a precocious
9-year-old tomboy who knows as much about football as any of the
men. Her lighthearted counterpart is Boone's prissy daughter, Nicky
(Krysten Leigh Jones), who prefers ``accessorizing'' dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans'' is a enjoyable effort, even though it
tackles major issues in a naive and shallow manner.

 &HT;    Actress rocked by character
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Frances McDormand sits down for an interview in a posh
Toronto hotel suite wearing a black Led Zeppelin T-shirt, jeans and
a denim jacket. The Oscar-winner's rock 'n' roll ensemble is in
stark contrast to the character she plays in Cameron Crowe's
``Almost Famous'' _ a somewhat eccentric, intellectual mother who
doesn't allow rock music to be played in her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be me,'' McDormand said, visually separating
herself from the role.
</P>
<P>
   McDormand, who won the Academy Award for best actress in 1996
for her performance as pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson in
``Fargo'', is drawing Oscar buzz again for ``Almost Famous''. Set
in 1973, the coming-of-age drama casts her as Elaine Miller, the
controlling mother of 15-year-old rock journalist William Miller,
played by newcomer Patrick Fugit, who is assigned to interview the
up-and-coming band Stillwater for Rolling Stone magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' premiered at the Toronto International Film
Festival and expanded to wide release last weekend, grossing $6.9
million on only 1,193 screens, for an average of $5,806 per screen.
DreamWorks today added another 500 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, the Oscar-nominated writer-director of ``Jerry Maguire'',
based the heartfelt, funny film on his experiences as a teen-age
reporter for Rolling Stone touring with Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd
Skynyrd, the Allman Brothers Band and the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine is inspired by Crowe's mother, Alice. Like McDormand's
character, Alice was a college professor who abhorred rock music
and wanted her son to grow up to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The complex and colorful role leapt out at McDormand, who being
42 and female finds her acting choices in Hollywood limited to
wife, mother or aunt. ``If I play mothers, I would like them to be
like Elaine,'' she said. ``I would like them to be people first.''
</P>
<P>
   McDormand would have pursued Crowe for the role, had he not
offered it to her first.
</P>
<P>
   ``She quotes Goethe, for God's sake,'' the actress said. ``I
mean _ male, female, who cares _ if they quote Goethe, go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Illinois, McDormand received her stage training at the
Yale Drama School. The versatile performer earned a Tony Award
nomination as Stella in a Broadway revival of ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' and made her screen debut in 1984 in the Coen brothers'
``Blood Simple''.
</P>
<P>
   McDormand married director Joel Coen, for whom she has also
appeared in ``Raising Arizona'' and ``Fargo''.
</P>
<P>
   McDormand recently finished shooting the upcoming Coen brothers
film, currently titled ``The Barber Project'', in which she stars
opposite Billy Bob Thornton. ``Black-and-white, film noir, takes
place in the '40s,'' she said. ``It's absolutely gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Coen live in New York City and have an adopted
6-year-old son, Pedro McDormand Coen. How would McDormand feel if
her son went on the road with a rock band, like William Miller in
``Almost Famous''?
</P>
<P>
   ``My son lives with a rock band,'' McDormand said.
``Comparatively speaking, he doesn't live with a conventional
family. So it wouldn't be my worry that he would go with a rock
band _ in fact, I would like him to play bass some day. My concern
would be if he chose the military.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress fears that she wouldn't have given her son the
necessary tools to prepare for such a life. ``That would be
terrifying to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a media conference at the film festival, Crowe said
that McDormand ``probably had to travel the greatest distance'' of
all of his cast members, ``acting like she didn't love Black
Sabbath when she does.''
</P>
<P>
   McDormand surprised her younger cast mates _ who also include
Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Lee _
by breaking into an air-guitar rendition of Black Sabbath's Iron
Man when Crowe played the song between takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my music,'' she said. ``In fact, it's more my music
than it is theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   McDormand said she didn't have to sublimate her love of rock
music to play Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   What connects the characters is their passion, she said.
William's is for music, which unites him with the musicians and
groupies who become his makeshift family, while his mom Elaine has
a passion for literature and human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't get to know what kind of music that she listened
to, but I'm sure it was Wagner with maybe a little Peggy Lee on the
side,'' McDormand said. ``But it was just a different generation.
She simply didn't have the exposure to the same kind of rock 'n'
roll that her son did. But it wasn't that they didn't share an
intellectual passion. They certainly did.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine stays in constant touch with William via the telephone
after he runs off to join the rock 'n' roll circus _ usually at
comically inopportune moments, such as when his hotel room is
overrun by groupies or when someone within earshot backstage is
loudly searching for drugs. Through these calls, Elaine develops an
unexpected bond with Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond is played by Crudup, a stage-trained actor with whom
McDormand appeared as mother and son in the off-Broadway production
of Oedipus.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone scenes presented an interesting technical
challenge, she said. ``That last phone call with Russell, it's a
two-person scene, but it's also a really well-written monologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Directing McDormand took on a surreal quality for Crowe when his
mother visited the set, but the actress said that she gained more
insight into the director than her character from Alice's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with a man who was really well-raised and had a really
extraordinary relationship with his parent,'' McDormand said. ``So
that's the way it affected me. But in terms of observing her
behavior or anything, it wasn't necessary because I was playing
Elaine. And it was so well-written that's all I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and a little Black Sabbath.

 &HT;    A charming exploration of 'Love &AMP; Sex'
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director Valerie Breiman claims to be an ``equal
opportunity exploiter'' when it comes to depicting the foibles of
men and women on-screen, and she succeeds charmingly in ``Love &AMP;
Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronicling the rocky long-term romance between journalist Kate
Welles (Famke Janssen) and painter Adam Levy (Jon Favreau), ``Love
&AMP; Sex'' captures many of the couple's highs and lows with comic
deftness and poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   What it fails to do, however, is flesh out the story around
these two characters. Their prickly relationship is served up like
an astronaut's breakfast, vacuum-packed and oddly sealed off from
the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, colleagues and former flames parade across the screen
like cardboard cutouts, which puts a lot of pressure on the leads _
particularly Janssen _ to carry the story. The disarmingly sexy
Favreau (``Swingers'') clearly has the chops to drive the story,
but the weight of the tale falls to Janssen, who has worked
diligently in movies as diverse as ``Rounders'' and ``X-Men'' to
transcend her former Bond girl status. Janssen's skills as a comic
actress are appealing, but her performance during ``Love &AMP; Sex's''
dramatic moments doesn't ring true.
</P>
<P>
   Kate first experience-- the heady intoxication of new love in
the fourth grade, when Bobby Morton strut-- over, Steve
McQueen-like, and slugs her in the arm. Later, away from the
schoolyard jeering of his pals, Bobby leans his forehead against
hers and stares soulfully into her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at you like this, it looks like you only have one
eye,'' Bobby says dreamily.
</P>
<P>
   Kate spends the next two decades choosing men who are variations
on her idealized fourth-grade boyfriend. While their romantic
murmurings have evolved somewhat, their ability to relate to Kate
on an intellectual and emotional level hasn't progressed much
beyond Bobby's primitive gestures.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Love &AMP; Sex'' isn't a movie about what jerks men can be.
More often than not, Kate is equally implicated in her past
relationship debacles, and the film is as much about the viability
of long-term monogamy as it is an affectionate _ if myopic _
examination of the idiosyncratic ways in which one couple connects.

 &HT;    A body blow to the heart
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Only fools and sportswriters can tease poetry
from fists thrashing flesh and bone. Fortunately, filmmaker Karyn
Kusama is neither. But she is a boxer, and in her brawny urban
melodrama ``Girlfight'' Kusama dresses the sport up in the attire
an insider would _ none at all. She strips boxing to its essence _
a prosaic contest of strength, drive and skill _ highlighting the
craft of calculated pummeling.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama's storytelling is equally bareknuckled, and fresh.
``Girlfight,'' which shared top honors at this year's Sundance Film
Festival, is lean and lithe, yet peppered with surprising emotion
drawn not from victories in the ring but from the triumph of love.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a boxing love story, one whose romantic heart beats
louder and truer than Rocky Balboa's plaintive yelps of ``Adrian!''
Kusama's unlikely pugilist is a teen-age girl, who parlays her
molten temper into boxing dynamite. Michelle Rodriguez, cutting a
dazzling figure in her first acting role, plays Diana Guzman, a raw
product of a broken family in the Brooklyn projects. Despair and
anger find articulation in her sharpshooting fists.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't go over well at school, where Diana's a repeat
offender, force-feeding chumps knuckle sandwiches when ordered. And
troubles at home are simmering, ready to boil. Diana has nothing
but resentment for her dead-end father (the fine Paul Calderon),
who drove her mother to suicide with abuse. In her unyielding
glare, he can do no right. She rebuffs his wan attempts at parental
guidance and keeps her little brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) under her
wing.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny is her link to the boxing world. Watching him train at a
Brooklyn Athletic Club gym, she spies an outlet for her errant
pugnacity. Opposition to her donning gloves is perfunctory, and
that's a strength in Kusama's mindful script. Grizzled regulars
razz Diana (``Why not aerobics?'' one slob chimes in), but she's
soon being trained by Tiny's coach, Hector (Jaime Tirelli). Her
eventual ``gender-blind'' fights are wrapped in others'
reservations, but her chops make her a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got guys hittin' you in the face?'' asks a shocked school
friend. The deepest dismay lies with her father, who storms out of
a match when he realizes it's his daughter poppin' a boy in the
ring. (When she later cold-cocks her dad, there's a sense of cheap
catharsis, but the scene is fraught with narrative urgency.)
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez trained 4 1/2 months for the role, so each hook and
jab is punishingly real. She's an intimidatingly alive actor,
stoking a guarded naturalism with feral fire.
</P>
<P>
   She possesses a complicated beauty _ part thug, part bombshell.
Her hard gaze is a slow burn, her swagger all tomboy. In glimmers,
though, she reveals a winning girlishness. Enough to captivate the
handsome young boxer Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who's pinned his
future on punching his way out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama depicts the courtship as sweetly tentative, as adolescent
love is. And the corker she throws into the relationship _
inevitable as it is, I won't reveal it _ pushes ``Girlfight'' even
farther from formula.
</P>
<P>
   The film works much better than it should. If any movie genre
invites weak-kneed platitudes, it's sports movies, where moral
conflicts are untangled in the ring, on the diamond or on the
gridiron. ``Girlfight'' honors the boxing-as-salvation metaphor and
occasionally lapses into sports-flick boilerplate about dreams and
``what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's forgiven for not romanticizing Diana's quest. Boxing
here is a spiritual palliative, not a cure. After a key win,
there's no champagne; Diana returns to the mildewed janitor closet
that is her ``locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusama keeps it real. The film has urban bite and tattered
edges; it looks slightly bruised. The fights are shot with few
tricks _ some slo-mo and lens-punches _ without the stylized
carnage of, say, ``Raging Bull,'' where violence was an overriding
theme. Kusama tastefully showcases Theodore Shapiro's vibrant and
eclectic soundtrack. Percussive flamenco clatters to the beat of
contacting fists.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama's remarkable debut feature startles and moves in equal
measures. ``Girlfight'' is heavy-hitting, but never heavy-handed.

 &HT;    Season-ending shows left many hanging, so here's a recap
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that movie stars disdained TV and TV stars knew
it, which is why they were always aspiring to the big screen. There
was a distinct line between the two types of actors, but that
divider exists no longer _ good material is good material, and
steady work is its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   This season, lots of big-screen names are coming right into our
living rooms, and nobody's apologizing or feeling a bit washed-up.
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler's Bette, boldly based on herself, likens a
television series to suicide, but there she is, playing herself in
a TV series and yukking it up. We get the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Geena Davis is playing it straight in The Geena Davis Show,
where she's a hot young thing engaged to a hot young widower with
kids. Davis' career needs a jump-start _ last year's Oscar gig left
us cold, and this year's Emmy near-nakedness left us colder. She's
undoubtedly hoping a sweet series will make people like her.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of liking her, Sally Field comes to series TV with
a recurring role on ER as Maura Tierney's mom, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Platt, a familiar supporting film actor, gets his own
scenery to chew in his new series, Deadline, where he plays a
crusading columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Wiest, one of Woody Allen's go-to pros, is taking over
the county DA's office on Law &AMP; Order, and Robert Patrick _ yup,
the Terminator guy _ is moving in on Mulder territory as David
Duchovny whittles his X-Files burden to 11 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Byrne and Charlie Sheen are new TV names we're used to
seeing on marquees. Byrne's Madigan Men is tailored to his Irish
charm, but Sheen has his work cut out, filling the shoes Michael J.
Fox left empty on Spin City.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Downey Jr. was a movie-guy until prison intervened; now
he's happy to take a recurring role as a romantic interest for Ally
McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? A job is a job, box office or not.

 &HT;    It has knives, it has sex - but it's not about the knives
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to the French to clarify the parallels between
knife-throwing and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is just that director Patrice Leconte can make any
unlikely activity seem erotic, but the razor-sharp variety act at
the heart of his delightfully tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy,
``Girl on the Bridge'', is positively steamy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it begins with the imminent threat of suicide and
continues on to knife-throwing's imminent threat of homicide, this
is the breeziest, most entertaining foreign film to hit our shores
since Run, Lola, Run ran herself ragged. It stars pop singer
Vanessa Paradis as Adele, the target of Daniel Auteuil's knives and
his ardor. While her acting range seems limited, she is so
perfectly cast and so appealing, I defy any red-blooded
heterosexual male moviegoer not to fall in love with her.
</P>
<P>
   In our earliest encounter with Adele, she is standing on the
edge of a Paris foot bridge, inching closer to plummeting into the
River Seine. Unlucky in love and unable to keep from choosing
badly, she wonders what the point is of continuing her miserable
life. Fortunately, Gabor happens along. He tries to talk her to
safety, but gallantly jumps in and rescues her when she makes good
her threat.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital, following their treatment for hypothermia, Gabor
demonstrates his psychic powers (and Leconte shows his cinematic
flair with a shot from an airborne fly's point-of-view). Gabor
persuades Adele to become his assistant in his knife-throwing act,
arguing that if he slips and misses, she will be no worse off than
when he first met her.
</P>
<P>
   They not only become a hit from the hotels of the French Riviera
to the cruise ships of Italy, but they discover a telepathic bond
and an uncanny streak of luck that nets them financial rewards in
the casino. Still, such good fortune does not buy happiness, for
Adele cannot keep her hands off each passing (and pass-making)
waiter or sailor. Apart, Adele and Gabor find their luck quickly
evaporates. Perhaps, although they kept their feelings to
themselves, they are made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Those who insist on deep meaning with their subtitled French
movies can contemplate the cosmos and the nature of destiny in
``Girl on the Bridge''. The rest of us can simply kick back and
have a good time. Were this story to be made by Hollywood _ which
looms as a possibility _ it would be a most mainstream romantic
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has the patina of art houses, largely because
Leconte filmed it in a moody black-and-white and the characters
happen to speak French. The only drawback of Jean-Marie Dreujou's
lush cinematography is the annoying habit of the subtitles to
disappear into the background tones.
</P>
<P>
   So ignore the dialogue every now and again and lose yourself in
Paradis' wide waifish eyes. Auteuil is Pygmalion to her Galatea,
supervising her transformation to human show business prop,
dictating her new chic haircut, the clothes she buys, her stance
and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Adele writhes, swoons and utters little orgasmic gasps
as Gabor hurls his steely-cold knives at her in invasive thrusts.
The sexual subtext is obvious and most amusing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with a delicious character-establishing
monologue by Adele, in which she recounts her many mishaps with
men. Explaining how she got herself into one such dilemma, she
shrugs her delicate shoulder and says, ``I went to his head, like
Cointreau.'' ``Girl on the Bridge'' should have a similar
intoxicating effect on audiences.

 &HT;    Most of the new fall TV programming _ not bad
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's shaping up to be a year of some tough choices for the
discerning television viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 new shows offered up by ABC, NBC, CBS, WB and UPN,
only a few are outright dogs _ The Trouble with Normal, a sitcom
about paranoids, comes to mind. Some movie names are squeezing
themselves into the small screen, and some of the medium's biggest
behind-the-scenes names have new stuff.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley _ Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, The Practice _ is
taking a shot at our school system with Boston Public. Darren Star,
who gave us Sex and the City, is the brain behind Grosse Pointe, a
comedy about a show within a show, and The Street, a drama focusing
on Wall Street's hot young things.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, Law &AMP; Order's main man, got himself a newspaper show
in Deadline. David Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants,
brings us Ed and Welcome to New York, both about sweetly goofy guys
from the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   And Aaron Spelling, who knows that trash is never trashier than
when it's dressed well, offers Titans, in which Baywatch babe
Yasmine Bleeth marries the father of her ex-lover.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is packed and most of it's good. So find the remote
and sit back down.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ed (8 p.m., ET , ET , NBC, premieres Oct. 8): It's a sleeper,
like its title character, a New York lawyer who got fired and
caught his wife in bed with the mailman all on the same day. Worst
day of his life? Nope _ best day of his life: Ed headed home to
Stuckeyville, Ohio, and bought a bowling alley. Tom Cavanaugh plays
Ed, an irresistible combination of confusion, confidence and charm.
Love interest is found in the girl who ignored him in high school;
comic relief is all over the bowling alley, which entices customers
by offering free legal advice with every three games.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hype (9 p.m., ET , WB, premieres Oct. 8): This is the only new
show that's not a running series and is already getting heat for
its racy content. It's a half-hour sketch comedy featuring 10 young
actor/comedians. Brought to us by the folks from Mad TV, it's got
promise if it rises from the gutter at least occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nikki (9:30 p.m., ET , WB, premieres Oct. 8): Nikki Cox may be
the only thing anybody remembers from Unhappily Ever After, and the
only thing anybody remembers about Nikki Cox is the way she's
built. Nikki's premise is bizarre: Cox is a dancer who dreams of
hitting it big in Las Vegas; newcomer Nick von Esmarch is the
college-bound boy she sidetracks and convinces to give up school to
chase his dream of becoming a big-time wrestler. They marry, and
the mother-in-law is a problem. Surprisingly, this show has some
trashy charm working for it, and Cox is more than the sum of her
curvy parts.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Yes, Dear (CBS, 8 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 2) Anthony Clark
(Boston Common) has yet to find his niche. This absolutely dreadful
show sets him back a few thousand steps, with its predictable setup
and stale jokes. Clark and Jean Louisa Kelly play new parents who
fret over baby's every breath and make cute ugly faces when they
eat baby food. Supported by Liza Snyder (Jesse) and Mike O'Malley
(The Mike O'Malley Show), who play some less-stressed in-laws who
believe TV is the best baby sitter, it's a good lineup. If only
they had some real jokes to work with.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tucker (CBS, 8:30 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 2): Another sitcom
staple _ the wacky blended family _ rears its weary head. Tucker is
being billed as some sort of coming-of-age series, and the absence
of a laugh track gives it more weight than it deserves. Starring
Eli Marienthal as befuddled 14-year-old Tucker, who moves with his
newly divorced mom (Noelle Beck) to his sister Claire's (Katie
Sagal) house. Tucker now shares a room with weird cousin Leon and
hates his new life, until he sees a foxy neighbor. Hormones in the
hands of television writers? Expect lots of below-the-belt
punchlines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Deadline (NBC, 9 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 2): Law &AMP; Order
brain Dick Wolf stretches our capacity for suspending disbelief
with this series about a newspaper columnist who takes graduate
students on missions of truth and justice. Oliver Platt is the man
for the job: He's Wallace Benton, who's big and puffy with
seductive floppy hair and a huge gob of brainy passion for his
work. Check out the other players: Bebe Neuwirth as his managing
editor; Lili Taylor as a gossip columnist; and Tom Conti (where
have you been?) as the paper's mogulish owner. These old faces are
balanced by some great new ones _ it's a smart show, so pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boston Public (Fox, 8 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 23): TV's
other reigning brain, David E. Kelly (Ally McBeal), tries high
school in this all-over-the-place drama with laughs about teachers
at the title school. Fyvush Finkel comes back from Picket Fences,
and Chi McBride may be able to make up for last season's famously
infamous The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. Kelley's record is
spotty, so we'll see if Boston Public is weird, wonderful or
weirdly wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Girlfriends (UPN, 9:30 p.m., ET , began Sept. 11): It worked
for HBO and Sex and the City, so why not here? Four black women,
fast friends, talk about life _ the ups, the downs, the way men
obsess about cup size. The cast is spunky, if mostly unknown
(Tracee Ellis Ross _ who's Diana Ross' daughter _ Jill Marie Jones,
Persia White, Golden Brooks).
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Geena Davis Show (ABC, 9:30 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 24):
This show is dead in the water. Even Peter Horton (thirtysomething
) can't pull this one out of the toilet. Horton plays a widower
named Max with kids, who sweeps Davis, cutely named Teddie (maybe
because she'll be wearing a lot of them) off her feet. Hilarity
doesn't ensue as she, tattoo, short T-shirts and all, tries to fit
in to his family life. Pity the children.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Michael Richards Show (NBC, 8 p.m., ET , Oct. 24): Sure,
he's got three supporting Emmys, but can he take the lead? Michael
Richards is now gainfully employed as a rule-bending private
investigator. The smart money hasn't been bet, as this show has
undergone some serious retooling. But Richards has more depth than
his turn as Seinfeld's Cosmo Kramer would indicate. Tim Meadows and
William Devane are part of the ensemble. Wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DAG (NBC, 9:30 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 31): The title stands
for David Alan Grier, the series star, and his character's name,
which is Dagget. OK, that's settled. Grier is a Secret Service
agent who dove out of the line of fire and became a national
laughing stock. He's reassigned to the first lady and daughter,
played by the great Delta Burke (Designing Women) and Lea Moreno
Young. Grier and Burke are sitcom pros and there's chemistry here.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dark Angel (Fox, 9 p.m., ET , Tuesday): OK, screen size
doesn't matter to James Cameron, who directed Titanic and
Terminator. He still has the buzz on his side with this tale of the
bad, scary future. Already, star Jessica Alba has been named the
next big thing and she is hot as Max, genetically altered
(enhanced, obviously) and on the run from an evil military man
(John Savage). Max has superhuman skills and an ally in Logan
(Michael Weatherly), who works with her to fight for truth and
justice. She's also got a bar code on her neck, which may also
become the next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gideon's Crossing (ABC, 10 p.m., ET , previews Oct 10,
premieres Oct 18): Andre Braugher takes charge as a doctor who
specializes in experimental medicine, who navigates a moral and
ethical maze at work while dealing with big personal issues at
home. He's got a great partner in the earthily soulful psychiatrist
Max Cabranes (Ruben Blades), who listens and councils with
brilliant one-liners: ``You're angry? Get angry with God! Pick on
somebody your own size.'' Braugher, who left Homicide: Life on the
Street about the time everybody was falling in love with him, takes
the weight of the series on his shoulders _ do we doubt he can
handle it? Nope. Just give him good stories, and we'll be there.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bette (CBS, 8 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 11): Who'd have
thought? Bette Midler plays a diva based on someone a lot like a
Divine Miss M we once knew. What's great about this is that many of
the jokes are at her own expense, and her support system _ husband
Roy (Kevin Dunn), daughter Rose (Lindsay Lohan), manager (Joanna
Gleason) and accompanist Oscar (James Dreyfus) _ is tolerant and
adoring. They ground and balance Midler's outrageousness, giving
this series a surprising warmth. You've got to love a big star who
commits to a series where her character says, ``Pretty soon I'll
have my own series and then I might as well kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Titans (NBC, 8 p.m., ET , premieres Wednesday): Trash at its
best, with Victoria Principal back in low-cut designer dresses,
right where she belongs. Yasmine Bleeth is the young, nubile babe
who agrees to marry Perry King, not knowing she bedded and broke
the heart of his son (Casper Van Dien). Principal plays King's
ex-wife, who lives in the mansion across the street and runs a hot
disco. The family's other children have problems with alcohol,
control and, not surprisingly, Yasmine. Camp it up, kids.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Normal, Ohio (NBC, 8:30 p.m., ET , premieres Nov. 1): Another
wacky family blend: John Goodman plays a newly out gay dad who runs
home to Ohio and his sister. Producers Bonnie and Terry Turner gave
us That '70s Show and Third Rock From the Sun, so here's hoping
they bring the same fresh sensibility to this one. At least they've
got Goodman, and that can't be bad, but this show _ like Michael
Richards' _ was being reworked at the last minute, and that can be
bad.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Welcome to New York (CBS, 8:30 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 11):
Nerd-out-of-water Jim Gaffigan plays a guy named, of all things,
Jim Gaffigan. From Indiana. Who's wooed to New York by Marsha
Bickner (Christine Baranski, late of Cybil), who produces a morning
show. His Hoosier roots are showing, but this hick is going to make
it on his own. Great sidekicks are all over the TV station,
especially in vain, stupid anchorman Adrian, played by a
scene-stealing Rocky Carroll (Chicago Hope).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Street (Fox, 9 p.m., ET , premieres Nov. 1): Hot stuff
from stock traders, or so the story goes. Tom Everett Scott is one
of the high-living players who populate this place, where boys will
be boys, even when they're trying to be men.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gilmore Girls (WB, 8 p.m., ET , premieres Thursday): One's a
woman, mother of the other, who gave up a life of privilege and all
its shackles when she had her namesake child. Lauren Graham is
32-year-old Lorelai; Alexis Bledel is her 16-year-old daughter _
call her Rory, please. They're growing up together, and we get to
watch. Edward Hermann and Kelly Bishop play the old-money parents;
Hermann turns reading the newspaper into the ultimate act of
passive aggression. A nice show, quiet and sweet, yet real and
pleasantly quirky. And on the WB, of all places.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cursed (NBC, 8:30 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 12): Yes, we love
Steven Weber (Wings), but not in this mess. Here he's is an ad man
who's hit _ literally _ with a hex from a bad blind date. Chris
Elliott does another turn as an eccentric best friend. No go, even
between Friends and Will &AMP; Grace.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Freedom (UPN, 8 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 27): This is another
hard-bodied fight for the American Way. Four folks, convicted of
treason after a military coup disrupts our own United States, put
the pedal to the metal. It's not WWF Smackdown!, but it's fast and
full of energy, and it stars Bodhi Elfman, who's married to Jenna
(Dharma &AMP; Greg) Elfman, in case anybody cares.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Fugitive (CBS, 8 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 6): Yes, we
love Tim Daly (Wings), but not with blond hair. Other than that,
The Fugitive has a big, expensive shot at series success. We all
know the story _ a nice doctor, unjustly convicted of wife's
murder, escapes and spends an hour each week chasing the one-armed
real killer. Mykelti Williamson is the cop on his tail. It worked
once with David Janssen; it worked again with Harrison Ford _ go
with three strikes and/or third time's a charm. We'll be the judge.
A cute trick: The plan is to shoot the show on the run, all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Grosse Pointe (WB, 8:30 p.m., ET , premiered Sept. 22): Grosse
Pointe is the show within the show, giving some young actors a
chance to act really cheesy, then change their hair and act really
real. The pilot wasn't funny, but don't give up: The cast is
appealing and it's always fun to be on the inside. This show's been
in the news already, after Aaron Spelling objected to one
character's too-close-for-comfort resemblance to his daughter,
Tori.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Trouble with Normal (ABC, 8:30 p.m., ET , premieres
Friday): The old line _ you're not really paranoid if they are
after you _ has become a sitcom. No, really. The support group for
paranoids doesn't help, and neither does living next to another
paranoid. Then the therapist's boyfriend walks in and makes fun of
everybody; then the paranoid gang drops in on her at home and
barely blinks. In fact, she goes on a group blind date with them.
If you're saying, ``Huh?'' you're not alone. Stars David Krumholtz
and Jon Cryer, who do the best they can with really bad stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  C.S.I. (CBS, 9 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 6): Old toenails and
hair fibers fascinate some folks, and when they're evidence in a
crime, at least they serve a purpose. The crime-scene folks at the
heart of this series (known as the ``Nerd Squad'') get deep into
the details, lots of them kinky, lots requiring strong stomachs.
William Petersen is boss; Marg Helgenberger is a single mom who
loves her job and loves her daughter _ a prescription for a
guilt-cliche cocktail. Maybe Jack Klugman's Quincy will drop by
sometime. Couldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Freakylinks (Fox, 9 p.m., ET , premieres Friday): One of the
Blair Witch guys was in on this, which stars Ethan Embry as Derek
Barnes, who uses a Web site to work some Scooby Doo magic. Derek's
brother, Adam, died a bizarre death, yet he's starting to turn up
on the Web. The truth is in there, somewhere, and it's spelled with
a www and a nice dot-com. OK, now scare us.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Level 9 (UPN, 9 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 27): Another nerd
alert for this super-secret team that takes high tech up a notch in
its quest to squash cybercrime. These guys are generic and the show
is, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Madigan Men (ABC, 9:30 p.m., ET , premieres Friday): They're
men and they're Irish, led by Gabriel Byrne, who plays Benjamin
Madigan with charm to spare. There's something for everybody:
Grandad Seamus (Roy Dotrice) and son Luke (John C. Hensley) bookend
Byrne as the three guys represent the old country, the immigrant
and the young Celtic turk. Grant Shaud (Murphy Brown) is a great
business-partner buddy. The only thing that could bring this one
down is an overload of blarney, but we'll take our chances.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  That's Life (CBS, 8 p.m., ET , premieres this Sunday then
moves to its regular time slot): This show has almost everything:
An appealing not-too-young lead in Heather Paige Kent, great
sidekick friends (Debi Mazar and Kristin Bauer), and overbearing
parents (Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino). What it needs is a love
interest for spunky Lydia (Kent), who dumps her lout of a fiance
and heads back to college, where she's smarter than she knows. And
she knows she's pretty smart. So's the show, even if the
Italian-family thing has been done to death. Eat takeout Chinese to
balance the meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The District (CBS, 10 p.m., ET , premieres Oct. 7): The
District has been taking serious heat from some, who bristle at the
premise: Hot-shot Jack Mannon (Craig T. Nelson) comes to
Washington, D.C., as its new police commissioner. His chest is all
puffed out as he begins to deliver on a promise to really cut
crime. Mannon is up against a legally challenged mayor and
butt-covering police chief. But the series doesn't shy from this or
many other issues, and Nelson is one actor able to play a bigger
than life eccentric who truly knows his stuff.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For nearly every first-time Olympian, even
one with lofty goals and an abundance of talent, Thursday night's
achievement would have been more than enough. For Marion Jones, it
was merely the end of phase two.
</P>
<P>
   After wringing the suspense out of the 200 meters with an ease
and controlled class that made it clear she would win before she
came charging out of the curve, Jones now has two gold medals and
the first sprint double at the Olympics since Florence
Griffith-Joyner in 1988. Jones' time of 21.84 seconds was the best
of the season and she won by a stunning 13 feet, but instead of the
wide-eyed, fist-pumping paroxysms of joy which normally would
accompany such a feat, there was only a glimmer of delight on her
face and a somewhat subdued victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable Mrs. Jones is far from finished here, and she is
intent on not losing her focus: Not in the face of doping
allegations against her husband C.J. Hunter in the middle of what
were scripted to be her Games; not in the face of two gold medals
when there are three more to be won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even halfway over,'' Jones said Thursday night , as
she made her way cordially and professionally past a long line of
television crews. ``As you all know, I'm here for greater things
than two gold medals. I came to prove to myself it's possible to
walk away from Sydney with five gold medals. So in a certain way
I'm checking them off the list, but I'm still enjoying them.''
</P>
<P>
   She could have been excused for gloating. Her victory margin of
.43 seconds over the silver medalist Pauline Davis-Thompson of the
Bahamas was the largest in an Olympic 200 since 1960 when another
African-American, Wilma Rudolph, dashed to gold in Rome. Not even
Griffith-Joyner in her season of dominance in 1988 could win by as
much in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Jones later made it clear that it had been more of a struggle
than it might have appeared, that she was not in a class by
herself. But she said that while sitting next to Davis-Thompson and
the bronze medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka. After Jones
left, Davis-Thompson set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Marion definitely is in a class by herself,''
Davis-Thompson said. ``She's a very talented athlete and you can
take nothing away from her. She knows how to compete under
pressure, and that's very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the reigning world shot-put champion, was watching from
the stands Thursday night after it was revealed on Monday that he
had tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in July. ``Just
because something like this comes up doesn't mean he's going to
hide in his apartment,'' Jones said, after embracing her husband
during her victory lap. ``That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she feared her husband's positive test might give the
public the impression that she was not ``clean'' herself, Jones
responded coolly, ``I don't have that fear, because the people that
know me and support me and train me and coach me know I'm a clean
athlete. So I don't think that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Jones think that the revelations and resulting media
frenzy will have an impact on her performance here as she goes
after gold medals in the long jump on Friday night and the
400-meter and 1600-meter relays on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us just started training this year, and this has been
a dream of mine for a lot of years,'' she said. ``To let one event
in your life, as dramatic as it might be, ruin that wouldn't be
worth it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jones surprised no one by winning the women's 200,
Konstantinos Kenteris of Greece surprised everyone but himself by
winning the men's 200. Entering the Olympics, Kenteris' personal
best was 20.25 seconds: Not even good enough to put him in the top
20 in the world this season. But Thursday night, in a close and
relatively slow race, he got the better of the favorite Ato Boldon
down the stretch to win in 20.09. The silver went to Darren
Campbell of Britain in 20.14; the bronze to a leg-weary Boldon in
20.20, .47 slower than his personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the Olympics are about: The guy nobody counts on
having the race of his life,'' said Boldon, who won a silver medal
in the 100 on Saturday. ``He did, and I'm happy for him.`
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as happy as Kenteris' fellow Greeks were for him.
With the Olympics coming their way in four years, they have their
first men's gold medal in a running event since Spiridon Louis won
the marathon in the first modern Olympics in 1896 in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Kenteris, 27, will now have a busy social calendar between now
and 2004. Though he was unknown to track mavens, he was not unknown
to Boldon, who beat him in the world junior championships in 1992.
Since then, Boldon has gone on to fame and the beginnings of a
fortune, while Kenteris has struggled with a chronic groin injury
and paid the bills by becoming a physical education teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Kenteris' began to hit his stride when he switched from the 400
to the 200 this season and joined a team of sprinters that includes
the women's 100-meter silver medalist Ekaterini Thanou.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners Thursday night included Ivan Pedroso of Cuba in
the long jump; Erki Nool of Estonia in the decathlon, and Yanina
Korolchik of Belarus in the women's shot put. Pedroso did not
secure victory until the last of his six attempts, jumping 28 feet
3/4 inch to leap past Australia's flamboyant Jai Taurima, who
already had jumped 27-10\ with a lot of vocal support from the
110,000 fans in the stands. Roman Schurenko (27-3\) of Ukraine won
the bronze. For the first time in Olympic history, no American man
won a medal in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   While Nool, the first Estonian to win a gold, was below par in
the pole vault and the javelin, he still managed to out-score the
opposition with a total of 8,641 points. That was more than 300
points lower than the world record held by Czech decathlete and
defending world champion Tomas Dvorak, who finished sixth here
while suffering from a torn stomach muscle. Dvorak's countryman
Roman Sebrle won the silver with 8,606 points; Chris Huffins of the
United States the bronze with 8,595 points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Huffins led after the first day; he led after nine events, but
after a relatively poor javelin throw left him with only a 14-point
edge over Nool, Huffins knew that his chances of holding onto any
medal were slim if he did not record a personal best in the 1,500.
He would do that and more, slicing 12.49 seconds off his previous
best to hold onto third place, 28 points ahead of Britain's Dean
Macey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us had an idea how fast I could run,''
said the 30-year-old Huffins, ``I think I earned a lot of people's
respect today, including my own.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. middle-distance runner Marla Runyon has earned respect
with her success on the track despite a visual impairment that has
left her legally blind. Thursday night, she qualified for the
1,500-meter final by finishing sixth in her semifinal in a time of
4 minutes, 6.14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to feel the pressure, and then I thought about it
and turned it around,'' she said. ``It's not pressure. It's an
opportunity. I have the opportunity to show the world and kids that
are losing their vision what life is going to be like: `Now there's
a girl who's legally blind, and she's in the Olympic final.' I hope
parents out there will say, I'm going to let my child be whatever
she wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones: The questions are whether she can overcome her
technical shortcomings to beat Heike Drechsler of Germany and Fiona
May of Italy and others in the long jump; and whether her teammates
can give her enough help in the relays. Without Jones in the
lineup, the Bahamas won the 400 relay at last year's world
championships. Davis-Thompson, a vivacious and voluble 34-year-old,
was on that team. ``We are still the underdog,'' she told Jones
Thursday night, ``and we love being in that spot. It's just going
to make our victory a little bit sweeter.''  &QL;

&HT;     BONDS WANTS A WORLD SERIES RING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN SHEA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Barry Bonds was named one of three finalists for a
player-of-the-year award sponsored by the players' union. When
informed of the news before the San Francisco Giants' 4-0 victory
over the Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday night, he didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that stuff. I've been winning individual
awards since Little League. I need a (World Series) ring. I don't
need any more individual awards. That's not going to signify
anything more in my career. You win awards, and you take them. But
I still haven't won a World Series yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this is a stale story. The questions aren't new: Will
Bonds finally play in a World Series? Will this be the year he
breaks his oh-fer string? Will he go home early again?
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, it's not a stale story. Bonds is 36, and it's been
uttered more than once in the clubhouse (not by Bonds) that this
could be the final chance for certain players to shoot for
baseball's grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds would never admit it. He seems to have the pride (and the
body) to play through age 40, if that's his intent. But how many
chances like this do you get in a career?
</P>
<P>
   For Bonds, this will be No. 5. Three with Pittsburgh ('90, '91,
'92) and two with the Giants ('97, '00). In the first four, Bonds'
teams were wiped out in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The closest he came to the World Series was '92, when the
Pirates were one out from winning the National League Championship
Series. They owned a 2-1 lead in Game 7, but Francisco Cabrera's
two-out pinch single in the ninth inning scored the tying and
winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   When Sid Bream slid safely into the plate, ahead of Bonds'
throw, the Braves were going to the World Series. Bonds was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best team wins the World Series,'' Bonds said. ``All the
rest of them, it's try again next year. A team might be better on
paper, but it doesn't always work out that way on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Bonds more excited about his chances of reaching the World
Series this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just as excited the first time,'' he said. ``And the
second time. And the third time. And the fourth time.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief pitcher Doug Henry goes back further with Bonds than any
other Giants player. They knew each other in high school in
California. They were teammates at Arizona State and with the '97
Giants. In July, the Giants reacquired Henry from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were still on the outside, I'd be rooting for him to get
to the World Series,'' Henry said. ``But now that I'm here, I'm
rooting for all of us to get there. He's not the sole reason we all
want to get there. We're all looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could do his part, but he can't carry us. One guy can stand
out, but he can't carry a team. The rest of us have got to do our
part, too. The whole team has to do the job, or it's not going to
happen.''

   ``U.S. v. Microsoft''
</P>
<P>
   By Joel Brinkley and Steve Lohr
</P>
<P>
   McGraw-Hill, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his findings of fact in the lawsuit brought against
Microsoft by the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general,
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson summoned up that familiar anecdote
about a man using a two-by-four in training a mule.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to the training, the man hit the mule in the head
with the piece of lumber to get its attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I've got Microsoft's attention,'' Jackson is quoted as
having said in ``U.S. v. Microsoft,'' by Joel Brinkley and Steve
Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Jackson has done that _ and more. In effect, he
has performed an enormous service for the nation by establishing an
important precedent in applying the Sherman Antitrust Act to
information age monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley and Lohr, reporters for The New York Times, do a
splendid job of presenting the two-year courtroom melodrama that
led up to Jackson's rulings of fact and law and his ultimate order
for the breakup of the software Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Their account is sufficiently lucid to hold the attention of
those not schooled in the metalanguages of computer programming
without insulting the intellects of those who are.
</P>
<P>
   The organization of the book is really what makes it work.
</P>
<P>
   Each important turn in the trial is summarized clearly and is
followed by reprises of news stories that narrated those
developments, stories whose significance many readers may not have
grasped at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The portraits of Jackson, Bill Gates, the attorneys for the
government and Microsoft and the witnesses are well-drawn,
humanizing the book and enhancing its readability. Besides
Jackson's and Gates', the memorable portraits are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ David Boies, the brilliant litigator who led the federal
courtroom team. In his cross-examinations, Boies so thoroughly
discredited most Microsoft witnesses that Jackson said afterward
that he found them unbelievable. On Boies' skill at making
Microsoft witnesses contradict themselves, Brinkley and Lohr write:
``For Microsoft witnesses, a few simple words of introduction
became deeply unnerving. `My name is David Boies, and I represent
the United States.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Netscape Chairman Jim Barksdale, who triggered the federal
investigation of Microsoft by having a company lawyer prepare a
white paper describing the tactics Microsoft used to try to exclude
Netscape from the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Gosling of Sun Microsystems, who was the lead engineer
in the development of Java, an Internet programming language that
Sun developed to allow applications to run on any operating system.
Microsoft developed its own version of Java, restricting software
applications to Microsoft's operating system. Brinkley and Lohr
describe Gosling as ``that rare computer programmer who is also
extremely articulate in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosling asserted that Microsoft was preventing the more
effective operation of programs used by most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has this basic strategy they call `embrace and
extend,' which some people call `disgrace and distend,' '' Gosling
said. ``But it's all about making it easy, so that people can get
on the Microsoft platform. And then they screw around with it so
that going the other direction is really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, in absentia, was a continuing presence in the courtroom
because the government team repeatedly used a videotaped deposition
he had given.
</P>
<P>
   In that deposition, Gates came across as arrogant and
uncommunicative. He indicated that he knew nothing of any
monopolistic tactics that Microsoft is said to have used to force
computer companies to accept Microsoft Explorer as its default
browser and shut the door to Netscape's Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   But his testimony was contradicted by intracompany e-mail
messages indicating that he was orchestrating the machinations.
Those thousands of e-mails also are used to discredit the testimony
of other Microsoft witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Jackson found in favor of the government, asserting
that Microsoft had used its monopoly power to impede innovation,
discourage competition and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions
have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in
the computer industry,'' Jackson wrote in his 207 pages of findings
of fact.
</P>
<P>
   He held off on issuing his findings of law to allow the parties
an opportunity to reach a settlement through mediation. When that
failed, Jackson
</P>
<P>
   ruled in April that Microsoft had violated anti-trust laws. In
June, he ordered that Microsoft be split into two companies _ one
for its Windows operating system and another for its other computer
programs and Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also imposed a long list of restrictions on Microsoft's
business practices, then suspended the imposition of his order in a
move to put it on the fast track to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The reader will come away from ``U.S. v. Microsoft'' with the
understanding that Microsoft has been severely chastened. Even if
Jackson's ruling is overturned, Microsoft will have to change its
monopolistic ways.

FAITH, CURIOSITY STEER VISITORS TO NEW MEXICO'S SCENIC CHIMAYO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMAYO, New Mexico _ The line stretches halfway through the
sanctuary, past rows of families kneeling and praying in simple
wooden pews, past the colorful, primitive-style paintings
surrounding the gold-embellished altar. Nearly everyone waiting
patiently in line carries two things: a rosary and a small plastic
bag.
</P>
<P>
   The rosary's purpose is obvious; the reason for the plastic bag
becomes clear the closer you get to the destination, a tiny room
off the Santuario de Chimayo. It contains a small, shallow pit
called ``el posito,'' or Little Healing Well. And it is because of
this room, with its makeshift altar and dirt floor, that this
200-year-old adobe church is sometimes called the American Lourdes.
</P>
<P>
   Like that French shrine, the Santuario has become known as a
place of healing. Legend has it that because the church was
expressly built on land where a crucifix mysteriously appeared
nearly 200 years ago, its dirt is sacred. Ever since, people have
believed that touching this dirt, rubbing it on a wound or an
affliction, could bring about a cure.
</P>
<P>
   For years, this was largely a local place, somewhere people had
to be told about by a friend or a family member, or stumble across
by accident while driving the back roads. But today, like so many
places in New Mexico, its fame has spread. Only 45 minutes north of
Santa Fe on a road touted as a scenic route to Taos, it attracts
the devout, and the merely curious, from all over. Visitors on this
recent sunny Saturday afternoon include tourists from Germany, New
York and France, plus two busloads of Roman Catholic pilgrims from
Albuquerque, two hours south.
</P>
<P>
   All seem to have immediately grasped the procedure. After
waiting for as long as 30 minutes, the pilgrims enter the tiny room
two or three at a time, kneel beside the shallow pit, and use a
metal cup to scoop dirt into the plastic bags. (Some use their
hands instead.) Some stop briefly to pray; a few immediately rub
the dirt on an arthritic hand or a sore foot.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? The long room leading to the healing room is lined
with old crutches and canes cast off by the cured, and its walls
are covered with pictures, crosses, statues and handwritten
testimonials and prayers of thanks. And many tourists and locals
seem convinced the site is sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people walk out of there blessed, yes,'' says Lolo
Medina, who sells family-grown chile powder and spice mixes at his
stand across the street from the church. ``It's about faith, that's
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither pilgrims nor locals, however, want to answer other, more
nagging questions _ such as, why there seems to be an unending
supply of soft, loose dirt in the pit, no matter how many people
line up to take some away.
</P>
<P>
   Not that skeptics can't enjoy a day trip to Chimayo as well. The
drive alone is worth the time spent, particularly if you take the
roundabout way through Nambe, with its rust-colored adobe church
perched picture-perfect on the side of a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Many plan trips around lunch at Restaurante Rancho de Chimayo, a
sprawling hacienda turned restaurant that might remind Texans of
Joe T. Garcia's. The New Mexican food is fine, but people really
come for the beautiful gardens and warm setting.
</P>
<P>
   Others come to shop, particularly for the locally made weavings,
which families have produced in the area for hundreds of years,
passing the techniques from generation to generation. There are
fine selections of wool blankets, vests, purses, coats, pillows and
wall hangings at several galleries; the rugs are particularly
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   And others come to see New Mexico as it once was, and still is
in a few isolated places. One of the best spots for that is Plaza
del Cerro, built about 300 years ago by Spanish settlers.
Constantly at war with the native American Indian settlements, the
Spaniards built their simple adobes right next to each other,
forming a solid adobe rectangle with a large, grassy plaza in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza was the center of the community then, says Chris
Brown, the part-time curator of the small museum just off the
plaza. It is operated by the Chimayo Cultural Preservation
Association. People raised vegetables there, kept chickens there,
gathered there to talk and celebrate, Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the plaza is still home to a handful of people, although
one side, the site of the former chapel, is somewhat dilapidated
and forlorn, its adobe bricks crumbling and its roof caving in. But
other homes are well-maintained and obviously lived in. This
includes a corner ominously posted with ``no tours'' signs, warning
visitors not to get too close.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much in Chimayo, there's a story there, too.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, Robert Redford wanted to film part of ``The
Milagro Beanfield War'' on this plaza. Most locals were receptive,
but a few didn't like the idea and fought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said all the attention would turn this into Disneyland,''
Brown says, smiling. ``So he went to Truchas (a nearby village)
instead. And it's exactly the same today as it was then. So it
probably wouldn't have made any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why take the risk? In Chimayo, there's something to
be said for tradition.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Chimayo is a scenic 45-minute drive from Santa
Fe; take Highway 85/284 north from Santa Fe, then head east at
Espanola on Route 76. An alternate route is to take Route 503 off
Highway 85/284 before getting to Espanola; this takes you through
Nambe and past its lovely adobe church, with a perfect setting
overlooking the high desert. Turn north on County Road 98 to
continue into Chimayo.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO: Santuario de Chimayo is open daily for prayer and
pilgrimages; it's on the main plaza in town, off County Road 98.
</P>
<P>
   The Chimayo Cultural Preservation Association maintains the
small Chimayo History Museum, with displays on weaving and local
history, located just off Route 76 and Plaza del Cerro. Hours vary,
but it's usually open Thursday through Sunday. (505) 351-0945.
</P>
<P>
   EATING: Restaurante Rancho de Chimayo ( (505) 351-4444) is the
most popular tourist spot for lunch and dinner, run for generations
by the Jaramillo family. Specializing in traditional New Mexican
dishes like chile rellenos and sopaipillas, it also serves
breakfast on the weekends. A gift shop selling pottery, jewelry and
textiles is attached; the extended family also runs a
bed-and-breakfast in the restored adobe home across the road.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all worked with people who are star performers but have
one serious personality shortcoming that makes life difficult for
everyone, limits their effectiveness and often proves to be their
professional undoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one executive we worked with, such people are
''95 percent brilliant, 5 percent disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tactics that you can use to help these otherwise
valuable people get beyond their psychological limitations.
</P>
<P>
   THE HERO
</P>
<P>
   The hero is often the last person a manager wants to change.
After all, why would you want to tamper with someone who gets more
done in a day than others do in a week?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that over the long term, the hero's constant
pushing adds real costs to the bottom line even if those costs are
obscured by short-term results.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully at the hero's trail, you'll probably find
the footprints of valuable people who left the company after trying
to keep up with the hero's superhuman exertions. Within the
company, you'll find burned-out co-workers. And the hero himself
may be thoroughly spent, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some heroes become addicted to success at an early age; others
push as a way of dealing with their own shaky self-esteem. An ``I'm
gonna show them'' mentality. Clearly, heroes lack the empathy
needed to understand what others are going through to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   To change a hero's behavior, express your appreciation for his
accomplishments. Then quickly segue into a discussion about the
costs of burnout _ in himself and in his team members.
</P>
<P>
   The hero must learn to take regular readings of his team's
temperature and to pay attention to body language, facial
expressions and energy levels that subtly indicate resistance or
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   As the hero's manager, you may want to help him make a checklist
of warning signs that the temperature is getting too hot: for
example, the times that he and others are leaving voice messages
and e-mails, the rising levels of illness among employees and
reports of marital troubles. The hero should fill out the list
weekly and discuss it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes have to think more about winning the war and less about
the individual battles. Emphasize that you need your hero to make
strategic decisions; he should delegate the implementation whenever
possible. You might even encourage him to hire an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is essential that someone take on the official role
of observing the hero. The goal is to turn down the volume without
switching it off. You could do this yourself, or help your hero
choose a trusted co-worker to carry out this task.
</P>
<P>
   THE MERITOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   Meritocrats believe that the world is a fair market in which the
best ideas will always win on their own merit. Such people
typically excelled at school and were consistently rewarded for
getting the highest score. Thus they have a naive reliance on the
authority of objective, measurable facts. They never accepted that
in the real world, ideas have to be sold, negotiated and shaped to
meet political and organizational realities.
</P>
<P>
   To help a meritocrat, you should first offer sympathy. Agree
that it's really an awful waste of time to have to persuade people
to support ideas of clear merit.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to raise a very difficult question: ``How
effective do you want to be?'' We've done this ourselves by using
Jimmy Carter as an example. Carter, we say, was a highly principled
and intelligent president who stayed unswervingly true to his
ideals. And yet even the most die-hard Democrat would agree that
Ronald Reagan was more effective than Carter at winning
congressional and public support for his agenda. We ask, ``Do you
want to be 100 percent pure, like Carter, or do you want to be
effective, like Reagan? You must choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager needs to help them see that it is possible to operate
in gray areas, accomplish a great deal and still emerge relatively
unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hero, the meritocrat has to learn much more about his
team. For each member, he needs to ask himself: What does this
person work for _ big money, prestige, intellectual challenge,
acquisition of power? Only when the meritocrat understands and
takes into account individual differences can he figure out how to
get people to support his goals and make their strongest
contribution to a project.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULLDOZER
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are people who decided early on that the world is a
hostile place where you should do unto others before they do unto
you _ plus 10 percent. They don't trust others, and others don't
trust them. At the same time, they're extremely loyal to their
bosses, and they get things done _ which is why they're worth
trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are often reluctant to change a style that, by their
lights, is highly effective. So to change a bulldozer, you have to
become one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking him if he has any idea how many enemies he has
created within the company. Follow this with a powerful line we've
used in our consulting: ``If I put it to a vote, there's no
question _ you'd be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of being fired is usually quite motivating. If the
bulldozer says he's willing to listen, the next step is to begin a
campaign of rapprochement. Tell him to make a list of his victims.
Then the two of you should script out an apology for each one.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, of course, is to get the bulldozer to avoid
causing damage in the first place. To do that, he has to become
more aware of when he is about to roll over someone so he can stop
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As with a hero, it's a good idea at the beginning to agree on
someone the bulldozer trusts to monitor his behavior. If the
bulldozer shows a willingness to change, he'll be able to build
roads for you without flattening people in his way.
</P>
<P>
   THE PESSIMIST
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists' worries are sometimes justified _ they're based on a
knowledge of mistakes that others have made. More frequently,
though, pessimists simply stifle creativity and block fruitful
opportunities. They also tend to micromanage, looking over
everyone's shoulders lest a mistake be made.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists are motivated primarily by a fear of shame of being
wrong or inadequate. And avoidance of shame can spread insidiously
throughout an organization's culture, destroying the company's
capacity to innovate and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the pessimist that you're on his side in looking at
proposals for change with appropriate caution. That positioning
lets you avoid a pointless wrangle over the pros and cons of any
particular initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Then point out that you're afraid that the impact of his alarms
is diminishing. Moreover, he's giving the other members of his
group a free ride: ``They don't have to worry and express their
reservations. You do that.'' The message: It's OK to worry, but
your fears must do more than guard the status quo; they should have
a constructive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Teach him how to evaluate risk better. Tell your pessimist that
when a change initiative is proposed, he must consider the pros and
cons of making the change as well as the pros and cons of doing
nothing. This way, he will be forced into a more objective risk
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   THE REBEL
</P>
<P>
   Although they fancy themselves as revolutionaries, rebels'
protests against ``the system'' don't go beyond simple grousing.
They're the ones who ask the inappropriate questions in meetings,
make jokes about the company's management and publicly question the
motives behind any major change.
</P>
<P>
   What rebels enjoy most is a game of tug of war. So your first
tactic is to refuse to play.
</P>
<P>
   Co-opt the rebel by making him responsible for a relatively
high-profile task that requires him to win the cooperation of
others. In essence, you pull him out of the heckling audience and
push him into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to begin by asking the rebel, in a neutral
tone, if he's thinking about quitting. When he says no (with
surprise), tell him that you were wondering because he always seems
to be butting up against the limits and putting the organization
down. If he says, ``No, I'm only kidding around,'' come back
forcefully: ``I don't buy that. And in any event, the things you
say hurt people and the morale of the group. That must stop!''
</P>
<P>
   Then shift to a different gear: ``But more to the point, you
seem to think that a lot of things around here should be changed.
True? Well, right now you're about as effective a revolutionary as
a 3-year-old. If you're going to battle the counterproductive
aspects of the `regime,' why not do it effectively?''
</P>
<P>
   Now you have the chance to help your rebel become a real leader
of change. His first assignment should be to spend a week as a
cultural anthropologist, noting all the subtle elements of your
organization's culture: what people reveal about their personal
lives; how they align in groups; how decisions are made officially
and how they are really made; and so on. You should require him to
hand you a written report.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask: ``If you were a real revolutionary fighting somewhere
against a dictatorship, would it be better to stand out or to blend
in?'' The answer is clear, so push the rebel to the logical
conclusion. ``You have a choice. You can work to change things here
or you can follow your old pattern and just be an irritant. If you
choose the latter, your career will stall. We need people like you
to help improve this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being negative just for its own sake, he'll turn his
energies toward constructive criticism and the building of a better
company.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOME RUN HITTER
</P>
<P>
   The home run hitter is always imagining the roar of the crowd
when the ball clears the outfield fence. However, he tends to
strike out a lot, swinging for the fence when a simple base hit
would have helped the team. Put simply, home run hitters focus on
things that are too big too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a home run hitter's manager, you need to deliver two
messages: (1) you appreciate his drive, ambition and
self-confidence; and (2) you want to move him up the curve as
quickly as possible but at a pace that ensures his steady progress
_ he must stay with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to explain just what the program, be it
spending time overseas or working more with particular clients.
Look at people in positions that he aspires to and explain their
career trajectories; that way, he'll understand that they didn't
just walk in and take over.
</P>
<P>
   Home run hitters worry that they'll never get ahead, and they
feel that their strenuous efforts go unappreciated. Therefore, talk
with them often about their career progression and praise them
frequently. This will help reassure your home run hitter that,
given a little time, he'll have his shot at the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tactics we recommend here won't work in every case,
they can help turn some of your brilliantly flawed performers into
spectacular achievers _ to the benefit of themselves and your
company.

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anti-business protesters have always sought to gain the upper
hand over the corporations they target. In one theater of conflict,
the Internet, they are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a combination of passion and tech savvy, activists
have launched sophisticated sites that attack individual companies
with eye-catching images, useful links, forceful prose, and even
audio and video streams.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most corporate sites either avoid controversial
issues, such as labor and environmental practices, or address them
with little more than bland text on hard-to-find pages.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of genetic modification. The UK government
cabinet office posts special Web pages to allay public concerns
about the safety of genetically modified food products
(www.cabinet-office. gov.uk/gm-info). They contain lengthy policy
statements and submissions from scientists and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Turn now to www.gm-info.org.uk, the Web site operated by
Corporate Watch. It contains lively, interesting and well-reasoned
articles on the risks associated with genetic modification,
flowcharts showing how business and government interests collide
and case studies targeting the leading biotech companies. It even
features a detailed map of the United Kingdom showing locations of
crop trials and manufacturing and storage facilities. The site as a
whole is brilliant propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This imbalance between corporate and protest sites is a problem
for two reasons. First, the Internet tilts the playing field in the
activist's favor. On the Web, the reach of a corporate
public-relations machine is no greater than that of any
organization committed to a cause. Moreover, the Web allows
protests to develop almost spontaneously among loose clusters of
organizations and individuals. When no single group is responsible
for a particular action, it's hard to know how to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the protest sites often have huge constituencies. The
World Wildlife Fund has about 5 million members; Greenpeace has 2.5
million. Corporate Watch claims more than 1 million page views per
month on its Web site, which contains some 430 links to other
protest sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds has a larger membership than any other political organization
in the country, including the Labour and Conservative parties.
Given numbers like these, it's clear that an effectively produced
site can have a major impact on public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have begun to respond. BP Amoco, for example,
recently upgraded its Web site to reflect the company's shift
toward more open dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders. It
used Greenpeace's visually appealing Shareholders Against New
Exploration (SANE) campaign, which had been aimed at BP Amoco, as a
reference point in redesigning its own site. The corporate site now
has links to environmental information, and one click brings the
viewer to a detailed explanation of the company's efforts to
explore solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can watch an animated ``solar story,'' with
audio, that debunks several myths about supposed problems with
solar power.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that heavily attacked companies such as BP
Amoco and Shell are taking a more open approach to communications
on environmental and social issues. They are debating these issues
in terms that the protest groups use, setting out the choices and
dilemmas they face, and being honest about failures as well as
successes.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web, in part, to say, ``We're not perfect. We
don't have the answer to every issue, but we're working with the
best intentions. Here are the issues we have trouble with. Tell us
what you think of them.'
</P>
<P>
   Any major corporation could be subject to a Web attack at almost
any time. In the struggle for hearts and minds, companies would do
well to learn from those attacking them by bringing a measure of
passion and creativity to their own Web presence.

   To help a meritocrat, you should first offer sympathy. Agree
that it's really an awful waste of time to have to persuade people
to support ideas of clear merit.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to raise a very difficult question: ``How
effective do you want to be?'' We've done this ourselves by using
Jimmy Carter as an example. Carter, we say, was a highly principled
and intelligent president who stayed unswervingly true to his
ideals. And yet even the most die-hard Democrat would agree that
Ronald Reagan was more effective than Carter at winning
congressional and public support for his agenda. We ask, ``Do you
want to be 100 percent pure, like Carter, or do you want to be
effective, like Reagan? You must choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager needs to help them see that it is possible to operate
in gray areas, accomplish a great deal and still emerge relatively
unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hero, the meritocrat has to learn much more about his
team. For each member, he needs to ask himself: What does this
person work for _ big money, prestige, intellectual challenge,
acquisition of power? Only when the meritocrat understands and
takes into account individual differences can he figure out how to
get people to support his goals and make their strongest
contribution to a project.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULLDOZER
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are people who decided early on that the world is a
hostile place where you should do unto others before they do unto
you _ plus 10 percent. They don't trust others, and others don't
trust them. At the same time, they're extremely loyal to their
bosses, and they get things done _ which is why they're worth
trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are often reluctant to change a style that, by their
lights, is highly effective. So to change a bulldozer, you have to
become one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking him if he has any idea how many enemies he has
created within the company. Follow this with a powerful line we've
used in our consulting: ``If I put it to a vote, there's no
question _ you'd be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of being fired is usually quite motivating. If the
bulldozer says he's willing to listen, the next step is to begin a
campaign of rapprochement. Tell him to make a list of his victims.
Then the two of you should script out an apology for each one.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, of course, is to get the bulldozer to avoid
causing damage in the first place. To do that, he has to become
more aware of when he is about to roll over someone so he can stop
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As with a hero, it's a good idea at the beginning to agree on
someone the bulldozer trusts to monitor his behavior. If the
bulldozer shows a willingness to change, he'll be able to build
roads for you without flattening people in his way.
</P>
<P>
   THE PESSIMIST
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists' worries are sometimes justified _ they're based on a
knowledge of mistakes that others have made. More frequently,
though, pessimists simply stifle creativity and block fruitful
opportunities. They also tend to micromanage, looking over
everyone's shoulders lest a mistake be made.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists are motivated primarily by a fear of shame of being
wrong or inadequate. And avoidance of shame can spread insidiously
throughout an organization's culture, destroying the company's
capacity to innovate and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the pessimist that you're on his side in looking at
proposals for change with appropriate caution. That positioning
lets you avoid a pointless wrangle over the pros and cons of any
particular initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Then point out that you're afraid that the impact of his alarms
is diminishing. Moreover, he's giving the other members of his
group a free ride: ``They don't have to worry and express their
reservations. You do that.'' The message: It's OK to worry, but
your fears must do more than guard the status quo; they should have
a constructive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Teach him how to evaluate risk better. Tell your pessimist that
when a change initiative is proposed, he must consider the pros and
cons of making the change as well as the pros and cons of doing
nothing. This way, he will be forced into a more objective risk
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   THE REBEL
</P>
<P>
   Although they fancy themselves as revolutionaries, rebels'
protests against ``the system'' don't go beyond simple grousing.
They're the ones who ask the inappropriate questions in meetings,
make jokes about the company's management and publicly question the
motives behind any major change.
</P>
<P>
   What rebels enjoy most is a game of tug of war. So your first
tactic is to refuse to play.
</P>
<P>
   Co-opt the rebel by making him responsible for a relatively
high-profile task that requires him to win the cooperation of
others. In essence, you pull him out of the heckling audience and
push him into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to begin by asking the rebel, in a neutral
tone, if he's thinking about quitting. When he says no (with
surprise), tell him that you were wondering because he always seems
to be butting up against the limits and putting the organization
down. If he says, ``No, I'm only kidding around,'' come back
forcefully: ``I don't buy that. And in any event, the things you
say hurt people and the morale of the group. That must stop!''
</P>
<P>
   Then shift to a different gear: ``But more to the point, you
seem to think that a lot of things around here should be changed.
True? Well, right now you're about as effective a revolutionary as
a 3-year-old. If you're going to battle the counterproductive
aspects of the `regime,' why not do it effectively?''
</P>
<P>
   Now you have the chance to help your rebel become a real leader
of change. His first assignment should be to spend a week as a
cultural anthropologist, noting all the subtle elements of your
organization's culture: what people reveal about their personal
lives; how they align in groups; how decisions are made officially
and how they are really made; and so on. You should require him to
hand you a written report.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask: ``If you were a real revolutionary fighting somewhere
against a dictatorship, would it be better to stand out or to blend
in?'' The answer is clear, so push the rebel to the logical
conclusion. ``You have a choice. You can work to change things here
or you can follow your old pattern and just be an irritant. If you
choose the latter, your career will stall. We need people like you
to help improve this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being negative just for its own sake, he'll turn his
energies toward constructive criticism and the building of a better
company.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOME RUN HITTER
</P>
<P>
   The home run hitter is always imagining the roar of the crowd
when the ball clears the outfield fence. However, he tends to
strike out a lot, swinging for the fence when a simple base hit
would have helped the team. Put simply, home run hitters focus on
things that are too big too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a home run hitter's manager, you need to deliver two
messages: (1) you appreciate his drive, ambition and
self-confidence; and (2) you want to move him up the curve as
quickly as possible but at a pace that ensures his steady progress
_ he must stay with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to explain just what the program, be it
spending time overseas or working more with particular clients.
Look at people in positions that he aspires to and explain their
career trajectories; that way, he'll understand that they didn't
just walk in and take over.
</P>
<P>
   Home run hitters worry that they'll never get ahead, and they
feel that their strenuous efforts go unappreciated. Therefore, talk
with them often about their career progression and praise them
frequently. This will help reassure your home run hitter that,
given a little time, he'll have his shot at the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tactics we recommend here won't work in every case,
they can help turn some of your brilliantly flawed performers into
spectacular achievers _ to the benefit of themselves and your
company.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Anti-business protesters have always sought to gain the upper
hand over the corporations they target. In one theater of conflict,
the Internet, they are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a combination of passion and tech savvy, activists
have launched sophisticated sites that attack individual companies
with eye-catching images, useful links, forceful prose, and even
audio and video streams.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most corporate sites either avoid controversial
issues, such as labor and environmental practices, or address them
with little more than bland text on hard-to-find pages.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of genetic modification. The UK government
cabinet office posts special Web pages to allay public concerns
about the safety of genetically modified food products
(www.cabinet-office. gov.uk/gm-info). They contain lengthy policy
statements and submissions from scientists and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Turn now to www.gm-info.org.uk, the Web site operated by
Corporate Watch. It contains lively, interesting and well-reasoned
articles on the risks associated with genetic modification,
flowcharts showing how business and government interests collide
and case studies targeting the leading biotech companies. It even
features a detailed map of the United Kingdom showing locations of
crop trials and manufacturing and storage facilities. The site as a
whole is brilliant propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This imbalance between corporate and protest sites is a problem
for two reasons. First, the Internet tilts the playing field in the
activist's favor. On the Web, the reach of a corporate
public-relations machine is no greater than that of any
organization committed to a cause. Moreover, the Web allows
protests to develop almost spontaneously among loose clusters of
organizations and individuals. When no single group is responsible
for a particular action, it's hard to know how to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the protest sites often have huge constituencies. The
World Wildlife Fund has about 5 million members; Greenpeace has 2.5
million. Corporate Watch claims more than 1 million page views per
month on its Web site, which contains some 430 links to other
protest sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds has a larger membership than any other political organization
in the country, including the Labour and Conservative parties.
Given numbers like these, it's clear that an effectively produced
site can have a major impact on public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have begun to respond. BP Amoco, for example,
recently upgraded its Web site to reflect the company's shift
toward more open dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders. It
used Greenpeace's visually appealing Shareholders Against New
Exploration (SANE) campaign, which had been aimed at BP Amoco, as a
reference point in redesigning its own site. The corporate site now
has links to environmental information, and one click brings the
viewer to a detailed explanation of the company's efforts to
explore solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can watch an animated ``solar story,'' with
audio, that debunks several myths about supposed problems with
solar power.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that heavily attacked companies such as BP
Amoco and Shell are taking a more open approach to communications
on environmental and social issues. They are debating these issues
in terms that the protest groups use, setting out the choices and
dilemmas they face, and being honest about failures as well as
successes.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web, in part, to say, ``We're not perfect. We
don't have the answer to every issue, but we're working with the
best intentions. Here are the issues we have trouble with. Tell us
what you think of them.'
</P>
<P>
   Any major corporation could be subject to a Web attack at almost
any time. In the struggle for hearts and minds, companies would do
well to learn from those attacking them by bringing a measure of
passion and creativity to their own Web presence.

THE METS VS. THE THING: A NONMUSICAL SEQUEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a character in the musical ``Phantom of the
Opera'' tries to explain away mysterious mishaps by saying ``these
things happen,'' another character says emphatically, ``These
things do not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips acknowledged that there is a thing that happens
to the Mets when they play the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Without putting the words to music, Phillips, the Mets' general
manager, said: ``We have a thing. We've got to try to figure out
what it is and why it is and how we're going to overcome it.
There's no ignoring that there's a thing. It's silly to say `Oh no,
it's just baseball.' It's something we have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Braves defeated the Mets in the last three games of
the season, knocking them out of a chance for the wild-card spot in
the playoffs. Last September, the Mets went to Atlanta a mere game
behind the Braves and lost all three games there, then lost two of
three in New York. Last week's trip to Atlanta resulted in two
losses in three games. And then Tuesday night at Shea Stadium the
Braves heaped insult upon the Mets' inability to beat them by
clinching their ninth consecutive division championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was as in your face as it gets in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be like this for the next 20 years,''
Phillips said. ``Sooner or later it's going to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to turn it one step at a time, the Mets beat the Braves,
6-2, Wednesday night and advanced to the National League playoffs
as the wild card for the second successive season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite a month in which they have won only 11 of 25 games,
the Mets gained the postseason more easily than a year ago. And if
they want to embellish baseball's version of the consolation prize,
the Mets can congratulate themselves for qualifying for the
playoffs sooner than the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been stoic about their fate. And maybe just a bit
disingenuous. What's the difference, they proclaimed, if they
finished first or finished second and won the wild-card
distinction? Either way they would be in the playoffs, and any team
in the playoffs is eligible to make it all the way to the World
Series and win it. Why, just look at the 1997 Florida Marlins, they
have said. Look at Al Leiter over there. He has a ring from that
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night's game, Bobby Valentine addressed the
issue of being the wild-card team, and he sounded downright
defensive about it. He chose to compare his team with the St. Louis
Cardinals, who had already clinched the National League Central
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis has won one more game in every 50 than we have,''
Valentine said, ``and in their city they're supposed to feel like
the kings and in our city people think that we should run away and
hide and be embarrassed about entering the playoffs. I don't get
it. And neither do my guys, so I tell them I don't get it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, relating a comment one of his players had made to him, the
manager added: ``One of my guys said which person is it who they
were supposed to go over and apologize to when they made the
playoffs. I said I don't get this whole thing. I said let's play
the game, win the game and not worry about the nonsense. Even those
who make something out of nothing will make nonsense a major
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, a veteran manager with tenures in Texas and New York,
has long been obsessed with the news media. It is important for him
to have supporters in that area. He doesn't care for critics. He
could avoid some of the attention he gets, but he brings it on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, as the Mets were struggling to win that
wild-card slot, he was interviewed by Sports Illustrated and said
he had ``five losers'' among the players in his clubhouse and said
other managers would be afraid to appear on a panel with him
because he would make them look bad.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he was interviewed by New York magazine and even
brought up the 1999 Sports Illustrated article, which caused a ton
of angst in the Mets' hierarchy. Valentine didn't utter any
similarly inflammatory comments, but he deplored the idea of a
magazine doing such a piece with the Mets in such a position (of
course, he could have declined the interview) and he referred to
``a couple of clowns'' in the New York area who he said didn't give
him the credit he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves in their division _ and maybe someday they won't
be if the National League becomes a four-division league _ the Mets
can't be expected to finish first. But they could beat the Braves
more often at critical times, and they could wrap up the wild card
more easily than they have the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But as the wild card, the Mets could have another opportunity to
knock off the Braves. Not that they should be dwelling on the
Braves when they play St. Louis or San Francisco in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time we should think about the Braves,'' Phillips
said, ``is tonight and tomorrow. After that, we shouldn't think
about them again until we're facing them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But just in case they do, the general manager dipped into the
past for an example the Mets could use in their attempt to change
their fortunes with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the ``thing'' the Mets have with Atlanta, Phillips
said, ``The Dodgers seemed to overcome it in '88 against the Mets
so it can be done.'' The Dodgers lost 10 of 11 games to the Mets
that season but beat the Mets in the league series. But they were
the Mets. This is the Braves.

<P>
   ``It was a pornographic affair.'' That's how she describes it.
By that she means they met only for sex. Once or twice a week, she
says. Or was it less than that, the way her ex-lover remembers it.
</P>
<P>
   Time has passed. How much isn't clear. Memories play tricks.
</P>
<P>
   For its American release, the French film ``Une Liaison
Pornographique'' has been renamed. ``An Affair of Love'' first
seems a distortion, but it is appropriate. The relationship changed
over time.
</P>
<P>
   The couple passed through red corridors to reach their blue
hotel room. They met to commit a special act, never shown. Her
previous lovers would not consent to it. Neither he nor she will
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   They met through a magazine ad, he says; she says they met
online. He keeps the magazine, wrapped in plastic _ a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   They talk to an unseen questioner. A filmmaker? Who or why isn't
told. Much is held in reserve. The characters go unnamed, for one
thing, to each other as well as to us.
</P>
<P>
   After their second meeting, they have dinner. Talk comes freely
with sex behind them and seduction not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Things change. Emotions intrude. Fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if,'' she started one eventful night, ``What if we made
love?''
</P>
<P>
   Relationships cannot exist in such abstraction. They're drawn
outside. They look within.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted six months, the man recalls. She says three or four.
</P>
<P>
   At 80 minutes, this film has found the perfect length. That is
not to say that it is slight. Every tale is not a novel. Some
stories should be miniature in scope. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``An Affair of Love'' &QL; 
Starring: Nathalie Baye, Sergi Lopez &QL; 
Director: Frederic Fonteyne &QL; 
Screenwriter: Philippe Blasband &QL;

FOX IN POSITION TO OWN OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ If NBC's Bob Costas wants to call a baseball
game on broadcast television during the next six seasons, he will
have to ring up Fox Sports.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's rejection on Tuesday of Major League Baseball's demand to
renew the contract it has had since 1996 allowed Fox to swoop in
with a $2.5 billion contract to merge its package with NBC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started Fox Sports, we said: `Where should we go?
Which sports did we want?''' said David Hill, the chairman of the
Fox Television Sports Group. ``We wanted and got the National
Football League, we wanted NASCAR and we wanted baseball. And we
said, `Wouldn't it be great to have the World Series year in and
year out?'''
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, that is what Fox will get. In addition to
six guaranteed years of the World Series, it will retain the
Saturday Game of the Week, carry every All-Star Game through 2006,
and every league championship series and division series. The
division series games will most likely be shown on cable on Fox
Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have taken place over several months, with baseball
initially wanting to triple what Fox and NBC were paying to renew
their deals. Both rejected the demands, as did ESPN, which was
paying about $43 million a year to carry division series games. ABC
and CBS passed on assuming NBC's package, which had only been for
the postseason and three All-Star Games. Fox made its offer to
baseball nearly three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's $417 million annual rights fee under its new deal
represents a 44 percent jump over the $290 million paid for the
same group of packages by Fox, NBC and ESPN since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best deal baseball could make,'' said Neal Pilson,
an industry consultant and former president of CBS Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball didn't have the leverage or competitive market going
for it. They asked for a tripling and got less than 50 percent.
This is the market. You get what the market says you're worth, not
what you say you're worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is assuming the largest load of sports network rights since
CBS owned a similar package from 1990 to 1993, minus the division
series, which had not yet been created. Hill insisted that Fox was
not destined to suffer a fate similar to that of CBS, which lost
nearly half of its four-year, $1.06 billion investment.
</P>
<P>
   Pilson, who made that deal, recalled that CBS was bedeviled by a
recession, the Gulf War and World Series featuring Toronto, a
market that is not included in the Nielsen ratings. ``But the
market is better now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said one of the crucial elements to making the new deal was
the growth of its owned and operated stations division. Fox owns 23
televisions stations and recently acquired 10 more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fox's new deal includes a renewal of its cable
rights on Fox Sports Net and Fx, spreading the financial burden
beyond the broadcast network. CBS did not have any cable properties
on which to show baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he was not worried that ABC, NBC and CBS would load up
their best first-run and event programming to counter the league
championship series and World Series on Fox. Rather, he points to
how Fox can now set its own advertising rates without being
tethered to NBC's pricing, and package multiple World Series deals
with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Pilson said that having the postseason is a bigger ratings boost
for Fox, which ranks fourth in the ratings race, than for any other
network. The World Series, which has rated between a 14.1 and a
17.4 since 1996, is still a marquee event, but it is a much better
prime-time alternative to entertainment programming for Fox than
for NBC, ABC or CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Series was good for Fox and NBC, but dramatically
better for Fox,'' he said. ``But the issue is the impact it will
have on its prime-time schedule. ABC and CBS wouldn't make this
deal because it would have such an impact on launching its fall
prime-time schedule. It may not have as much an impact on Fox's
prime time as Fox thinks it will have.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, without the NFL and, starting next season, baseball, is now
focused on the NBA; NASCAR (starting next season); the Olympics
through 2008; Notre Dame football; golf; the Wimbledon and French
Open tennis tournaments; launching the fledgling XFL with the World
Wrestling Federation; and, starting next year, the Triple Crown
horse races.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Back in Norway, they heard about the victory
tour, the commercials, the sponsorships, when the United States won
the Women's World Cup in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has more money,'' said Silje Joergensen, who
plays defense for Norway. ``They are rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian players did not sulk about losing to the Americans
as they went back to their jobs, playing for local clubs for a few
extra kroner. The countries are different. The cultures are
different. The economies are different.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, the Norwegians have been known to beat the United
States more than occasionally _ and even ticked off the Yanks with
a choreographed choo-choo train celebration after winning in their
semifinal of the 1995 World Cup in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archenemies'' is the word Tiffeny Milbrett once used to
describe the Norwegians, although Thursday night the effervescent
Milbrett was saying, ``Gosh, you've got to give them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing word of the way corporate and hometown America fell for
the women last summer, the Norwegians could only remind themselves
that their time would come around again.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived in the final of the Summer Games Thursday night when
Norway outlasted the United States, 3-2, in sudden death. Norway is
the only nation to hold an advantage over the Americans, 15
victories to 13 losses with two ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not everything,'' Joergensen said. ``We showed that
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The two old rivals, who have been storing up bruises and cuts,
grudges and resentments, in the decade and a half of this sport in
the Olympics, staged a classic game, as good as sport gets. The
United States tied the game in the dying seconds of regulation
time, and then Norway clutched the victory in the 12th minute of
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The leaping header by the 5-foot-2-inch Milbrett was as stunning
as Mookie Wilson's eccentric at-bat in the 1986 World Series,
during which a wild pitch by Red Sox pitcher Bob Stanley and a
ground ball that went through legs of Bill Buckner led to a Mets
victory. And the stunning overtime goal was as dramatic as Bill
Mazeroski's home run that ended the seventh game of the 1960 World
Series _ and more controversial because it involved a potential
hand ball by a Norwegian forward.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will debate how Hege Riise's perfect lofting pass was
touched by Joy Fawcett and then bounced onto the
chest/shoulder/upper arm of Norway's Dagny Mellgren, who lashed a
grass-cutter under the fingers of Siri Mullinix.
</P>
<P>
   The referee, Sonia Denoncourt of Canada, showed common sense in
deciding that Mellgren had not blatantly positioned her upper arm
to control the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Would the call have gone that way in the jingoistic confines of
the Rose Bowl in 1999? The Yanks got the benefit of the doubt when
goalkeeper Briana Scurry leaped forward _ in violation of the rule
_ to smother a Chinese penalty kick. Thursday night, Norway won on
neutral turf, with many Norwegians sprouting Viking horns and
painting their faces red.
</P>
<P>
   These Americans and the Norwegians have become the Fraziers and
the Alis of women's sport. When they become grumpy old women, they
will still remember the mutual testiness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 the Yanks beat Norway, 2-1, in China to win the first
World Cup. In 1995 the Yanks were offended when the Norwegians
crawled around the field clutching the ankles of the players in
front of them. And the Norwegians were not thrilled when the Yanks
beat them, 2-1, in overtime in the semifinals of the 1996 Summer
Games in Athens, Ga. But they usually come back.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have produced the greatest offensive and
defensive players in the history of the sport, Michelle Akers and
Linda Medalen, the latter a detective who treated the Americans
like suspected perps.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, the legend grows. Gro Espeseth, Norway's defender,
who missed the 1999 World Cup because of knee surgery, was back
Thursday night, scoring on a header off the desperate flying foot
of Shannon MacMillan. That goal gave the Norwegians a reprieve at
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we wanted it more,'' said Marianne Pettersen of
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett conceded that the Yanks have a problem when they play
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every other team, we play the way we want, but they know
how to beat us,` Milbrett said. ``We just played the best game of
the tournament, and we're going home with a silver medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are also going home to a professional league that
begins next April. And, yes, the Norwegians have heard about the
chunk of change being spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play soccer because I love it,'' said Joergensen, who is
attending college to learn to teach retarded children. ``I would
love to play soccer for money. I would go to the United States to
play in that league.''
</P>
<P>
   She would be welcome. And she would be gracious enough to not
mention the status of the Norwegian-American rivalry, at least not
very often.

AN ARTIST THE WEB WAS MADE FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You would think that art and the Internet were made for each
other. But all artists are not equal on the Web. There are
reproductions, to be sure, but what about ``appreciation''? Some
renowned artists are represented by little more than a few capsule
biographies and a lot of dealers, with precious little commentary
or insight, even from museums.
</P>
<P>
   For an Internet art feast, try Maurits Cornelis Escher
(1898-1972), the Dutch graphic artist. His experiments in
perspective, his mathematically grounded lithographs and his
spatial illusions have struck a chord with several Web audiences:
art lovers, math and science students and fans of the fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   Escher is known for drawings, woodcuts and lithographs of things
like steps that go up and down at the same time, waterfalls that
replenish themselves, hands that draw each other and repeating
patterns, known mathematically as tessellations, of lizards, birds
and other shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long before the first computer-generated 3-D images were
thrilling the public, Escher was a master of the third dimension,''
notes a page from the World of Escher (www.worldofescher.com), a
Texas company founded in 1993. Its five-year-old Web site includes
an Escher gallery, a bibliography and a selection of Escher
quotations and essays by and about him. It also offers posters,
neckties, T-shirts, CD-ROMs, jigsaw puzzles and _ in a tie-in with
its graphic-design merchandise _ a series of contests for students
who would like to try their hand at creating their own Escher-style
tessellations.
</P>
<P>
   The site draws 30,000 visitors a month, and it has received more
than 1,700 entries from students around the world since June 1995,
said Paul Schofield, the site's Webmaster, in an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   In an online essay, a past editor of the site, Tom Litchfield,
asks, ``Can you imagine his thoughts on computer programs that
automatically generate tessellations; would he be excited or
woefully disappointed?''
</P>
<P>
   He also wonders what Escher would think about all the
merchandise. The site reprints a 1969 letter by Escher in which he
complained to his son that ``the hippies of San Francisco continue
to print my work illegally.'' He hated ``virulently colored
posters,'' he added. But Litchfield surmises that Escher would have
eventually accepted and approved of his work's popularization.
</P>
<P>
   Totally Tessellated (library.thinkquest.org/16661) won a 1998
ThinkQuest Internet Challenge contest sponsored by a company called
Advanced Network and Services, which invites students and their
academic coaches to form teams to design educational Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   It has an extensive discussion of tessellations, those repeating
figures that fill two dimensions, as well as a series of hands-on
activities. The site's many pages explore the history of
tessellation as an artistic concept. It includes the Moorish motifs
in the Alhambra in Spain, which Escher visited and which profoundly
influenced him.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a large Escher section, with a lavishly illustrated
biography that shows examples of Escher's explorations of infinity,
knots, perspective and impossible architecture as well as
tessellations. There are also sections on related art movements,
like Cubism, and mathematical topics.
</P>
<P>
   Another teaching site, from IProject Online
(www.iproject.com/escher/teaching/teaching.html), offers a number
of lesson plans and classroom suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   On the official M.C. Escher Web site (www.mcescher.com), a
biography of Escher points out that in addition to his famous
impossible figures, he designed postage stamps and tapestries,
illustrated books and sometimes worked in three dimensions, carving
wooden spheres. Viewers can download a free interactive game. The
site's news section warns about fake Escher prints being offered on
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the site is a 3-D multimedia section that flies
a viewer around and through three of Escher's most famous works. It
was developed for a 1998 exhibition in Rotterdam, Netherlands,
where, the site says, visitors stood for two hours to watch what
can now be seen online: a vivid unraveling of how Escher fooled the
eye by compressing multiple viewpoints into one.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Escher quotations on the site is this one: ``I walk
around in mysteries. Each time, youngsters say, You make Op Art,
too. I don't know what that is, Op Art. This work I have been
making for the past 30 years.''

OKLAHOMA CITY IS SHEDDING ITS DULL AND DUSTY IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ This is a city that hasn't gotten much respect,
from the outside world or even from itself.
</P>
<P>
   Bisected by the Canadian River (which locals joke is the only
river that needs mowing three times a year), its economy dominated
by the cattle industry (step outside a downtown building, and some
days you can smell the evidence of the giant stockyards operation
just west of downtown), it has been hammered for being dull and
dusty, unsophisticated and unattractive. Even Tulsa looked down on
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the final straw came in the early '90s, when Oklahoma City
lost out on attracting a major out-of-town employer that had
promised to create up to 7,000 jobs. The company told Oklahoma City
that it just didn't have the ``quality of life'' that the winning
city offered. The mecca of culture that won the employer over?
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, was the wake-up call that Oklahoma City
needed. In the mid-'90s, the city launched a $700 million downtown
building spree, made possible by a five-year, 1-cent city sales tax
overwhelmingly approved by citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with only about half the projects finished, Oklahoma City
already looks like a new place, living up to its self-proclaimed
title, the Newest City in the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new 12,000-seat minor-league ballpark, a replica of
the vintage-style baseball fields so beloved in Arlington and
Baltimore. There's an expanded, renovated convention center, with a
shiny new Marriott Renaissance hotel tower across the street.
There's Bricktown, a bustling warehouse district of clubs and
restaurants. Its piece de resistance? The new Bricktown Canal, a
mile-long waterway lined with restaurants and plied by water taxis;
it is eventually supposed to hook up with the long-scorned Canadian
River in another ambitious redevelopment plan.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to come, including a downtown arena that will house
minor-league hockey and arena football, and a rebuilt music hall
and a new library. The building spurt has been accompanied by
expansion by businesses and museums _ and by a boom in civic pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally, the biggest change is that people no longer
apologize for being from Oklahoma City,'' says Sandy Pantlik,
communications director for the city's tourism office. ``I think
the locals are really excited about the changes. It's an exciting
time for Oklahoma City. ''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   They rise like twin modernistic Arc de Triomphes, golden and
simple, at once majestic and unspeakably sad, marking a different
kind of victory _ that of a city that has weathered catastrophe and
rebuilt itself in a new image.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two bronze gates, at each end of the Oklahoma City
National Memorial, is engraved with a time of day: 9:01 on one,
9:03 on the other, framing the time on April 19, 1995, that
Oklahoma City changed forever. It was at 9:02 a.m. that day that a
terrorist bomb went off at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
downtown, killing 168 and injuring hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than reconstruct the building, or erect a simple statue
or plaque, residents led the charge for a monument more fitting to
the memory of the United States' worst act of domestic terrorism.
In April, on the fifth anniversary of the bombing, President
Clinton dedicated the memorial, a $30 million project imposing in
its simplicity and funded by the federal government and private
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial has already become one of the must-see destinations
for tourists. They walk through the gates, separated by a shallow
granite reflecting pool; they photograph the field of empty chairs,
168 stone-and-bronze structures, each with a base of illuminated
glass, etched with the name of a victim, symbolizing the lives
lost. They scan the pictures and poems and teddy bears and wreaths
left on the Memorial Fence, pieces of the original chain-link fence
that contained the rubble, where the community left its heartfelt
tributes.
</P>
<P>
   They gaze at the few remaining fragments of the federal building
walls, etched with the names of every survivor; they sit under the
Survivor Tree, a giant 75-year-old elm that somehow, miraculously,
escaped the carnage. Those two aspects underscore the city's hope
that the memorial convey not just the city's great loss, but
celebrate its survival. A memorial center and museum, initially set
to open this year but now scheduled for a February debut, will
further that theme, with interactive displays and firsthand
retellings of the bombing and the rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has become so etched in the national consciousness
that it's often the first thing people think about when Oklahoma
City is mentioned. Many also believe that it spurred the downtown
redevelopment, which, of course, was already planned at the time of
the bombing.
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY: of the bombing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City residents understand they can't change that
perception. But they are valiantly trying to shed other outdated
perceptions of their hometown _ namely, that there's no culture, no
nightlife and nothing much to do.
</P>
<P>
   To be perfectly honest, North Texans ought to feel right at home
in Oklahoma City, as it bears more than a passing resemblance to
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City, too, has historic stockyards. (Theirs, however,
still comprise a working cattle district, with steakhouses and
diners geared to ranchers and cattle buyers attending the huge
weekly auctions.)
</P>
<P>
   Its Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center, with its
fine galleries of western art, its interactive, kid-friendly Old
West exhibits, and its lovely native-plant gardens, would fit
nicely in Fort Worth's museum district. (In fact, it seems like a
mondo combination of our Amon Carter and science and history
museums.)
</P>
<P>
   Its old-fashioned-looking red-brick Bricktown Ballpark is home
to the Oklahoma 89ers _ one of the Texas Rangers' minor-league
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   And its downtown is clean and safe, with a district of clubs and
restaurants that seems reminiscent of Sundance Square.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of downtown is Bricktown, an entertainment district
that looks like the love child of Dallas' West End and San
Antonio's River Walk, though it's not as big, commercial or crowded
as either of those. On weekend nights, young professionals and
date-night couples fill bars like Tapwerks, a sophisticated version
of the Flying Saucer beer joints popular in Texas. Families stroll
the sidewalks framing the canal and spill onto the patios of the
ubiquitous Tex-Mex restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The rebirth hasn't been without problems. Some folks, for
instance, have complained that the mile-long Bricktown canal was
little more than a chintzy imitation of San Antonio's historic
River Walk; indeed, development is still a bit sparse along the
waterfront. Overall, the level of sophistication doesn't always
match the ambition: For instance, one restaurant's frittata wasn't
the traditional Italian baked-egg dish, but rather a flat omelet
with asparagus and goat cheese piled on top. And the hottest dance
club seemed to play nothing but Madonna _ the '80s version at that
_ on a recent Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But growth, and new developments such as a planned movie theater
complex, ought to take care of some of that. In the meantime, those
who consider downtown limiting can find plenty to do elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The city's premier museum is the somewhat misleadingly named
Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Museum, with a terrific
collection of contemporary western art in its elegant galleries.
The 40-year-old museum has been on a growth spurt in the past six
years, with $50 million worth of new construction, renovation and
exhibits. Kids will love the interactive exhibits about rodeos and
cowboys, as well as Prosperity Junction, a life-size replica of an
Old West town, with livery stable, bank, saddle shop, train depot,
schoolhouse and marshal's office.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, there's the makings of a museum district, with several
special-interest institutions. There's the Firefighters Museum; the
Omniplex, with a planetarium and an American Indian center; the
National Softball Hall of Fame; and the 45th Infantry Division
Museum, with an eclectic collection of war memorabilia including
tanks, planes, cartoons, weapons and Nazi-era artifacts looted by
American GIs, such as pieces of silver, linens and china once used
by Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles west, adventurous diners ought to explore a
neighborhood sometimes called Little Saigon. More than 20 years
ago, Oklahomans sponsored a number of Asian refugees, who largely
settled in a rundown neighborhood west of the state capitol. Now
it's grown into a bustling community, filled with small groceries,
jewelers, video stores, tailors, nail salons and more than a dozen
restaurants, from tiny noodle shops and pho (soup) houses to big
Chinese buffets.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses initially may have been supported mainly by
immigrants, but now they draw from all over the city, and beyond:
Mick Jagger got takeout from Sala-Thai, an unpretentious but
deliciously authentic Thai restaurant, the last time the Rolling
Stones played in the area. The boys' autographed picture, with a
handwritten thank-you note from the band's manager, is posted
proudly but unobtrusively near the front door.
</P>
<P>
   That's classic Oklahoma City for you. Look closely, and it just
might surprise you.

`MARTIN BAUMAN': THE WRITING LIFE NEVER UNEXAMINED, OFTEN NASTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Bauman, the title hero of David Leavitt's new novel,
bears more than a passing resemblance to his creator. Like Leavitt,
he grew up on the West Coast and came east to attend an Ivy League
college. Like Leavitt, he published a story while still in his
early 20s in The New Yorker (or, in Martin's case, a magazine much
like The New Yorker), worked briefly at a publishing house and went
on to achieve a measure of renown as a novelist and short-story
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Bauman; Or, a Sure Thing'' is told in the first person
and set down in an intimate, confessional voice reminiscent at once
of Philip Roth's ``Ghost Writer'' and Evelyn Waugh's ``Brideshead
Revisited'': a voice inclined toward nostalgia and rumination, a
voice sure to remind readers at times of the supple sonorities of
Leavitt's brilliant debut collection of stories, ``Family Dancing''
(1984).
</P>
<P>
   This novel, however, divides peculiarly into two halves. The
first, both heartfelt and polished, stands as a classic
Bildungsroman about a young man's coming of age and provides as
poignant and funny an account of literary apprenticeship as that
found in the opening pages of William Styron's ``Sophie's Choice.''
It focuses on Martin's contentious relationship with his former
writing teacher, the irascible Stanley Flint, and his subsequent
efforts to achieve independence from his onetime mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of ``Martin Bauman'' is an altogether messier,
more haphazard production _ a rambling, self-indulgent chronicle of
Martin's romantic difficulties and the intramural squabblings of
his best friends. These latter pages, like the slush-pile
manuscripts Martin reads at the publishing house, echo ``in their
coarse sincerity'' the ``confessional talk shows'' of the '90s:
Martin rambles on here at wearying length about everything from his
endless sessions of television-watching to his medical treatment
for genital warts.
</P>
<P>
   We feel as i Leavitt were allowing us to eavesdrop on Martin's
whining therapy sessions instead of giving us a shapely account of
his hero's travails. It's a criticism echoed by Martin's friend
Seamus, who says he wishes Martin would ``get over his obsession
with stupid little picayune domestic details.'' Did Tolstoy write
about masturbation? Seamus wonders. Did Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, these later sections of the novel
illustrate some of the very things that an editor criticizes in
Martin's stories: The ``tone is sometimes condescending'' and
``there aren't any likable characters'' _ that is, ``characters
with whom we can sympathize, whose points of view we want to
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's warmly observed portrait of his mother and the comical
portraits of his roommates give way, as the book progresses, to
carping descriptions of people the reader has no reason to want to
get to know.
</P>
<P>
   Martin portrays his boyfriend, Eli, as a grievance-hoarding
hothead and dogmatic gay ideologue who won't even go to his best
friend's wedding because she is marrying a man instead of a woman,
and he depicts their mutual friend Liza as a self-absorbed
careerist who does little but obsess about her sex life. Their
acquaintances in the literary world are equally tiresome: a
collection of phonies, self-promoters and hypocrites, who seem more
interested in gossip and in social climbing than in writing.
</P>
<P>
   As for Martin himself, he evolves from a callow young man,
likable in his bumbling efforts to excel, into an openly ambitious,
even opportunistic fellow who clearly tries the patience of just
about everyone, including the author. He is needy and possessive in
his relationship with Eli, throwing a histrionic fit when Eli
spends an evening comforting a distraught friend instead of staying
home with him; later, he will cavalierly cheat on Eli with an
assortment of other men.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to his career, Martin can be similarly
self-serving, courting literary success the same way he once strove
to get straight As in school. When Flint speaks disparagingly of
Martin's novel in progress, Martin tries to get his former teacher
in trouble by ratting him out to his boss, suggesting that Flint's
womanizing may be cause for dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   It is Martin's relationship with Flint that serves as the
primary motor behind this book. Flint not only represents a father
figure whose blessings signify the approval of the grown-up world
that the young Martin so desperately craves, but he also embodies
all the glamour and sophistication that Martin projects onto the
literary world in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening sections of the book, Leavitt does a dexterous
job of delineating Flint's aura: his mythic reputation among young
writers; his use of cruel put-downs and over-the-top praise to
maintain a hold over his students; his rigorous, unforgiving
aesthetic. He also uses Flint's contentious, emotionally fraught
relationship with Martin _ much the way he used the relationship
between the concert pianist Richard Kennington and his protege,
Paul Porterfield, in ``The Page Turner'' (1998) _ to show his
hero's ambivalent progress toward adulthood and autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   When Flint recedes into the background in the second half of the
book, much of the novel's energy is lost, as the reader is
abandoned to the narcissistic navel-gazing of Martin and his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   While this portion of ``Martin Bauman'' is sorely in need of
some editing, while this part of the book points up Leavitt's
difficulties with the long-distance form of the novel, the voice he
uses in much of this volume _ confiding, meditative and pliant _
marks his rediscovery of one of his greatest strengths as a writer,
and it points the way toward more satisfying achievements.

 FROM: THE HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 By STEVE ROBBINS  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can management communications be screwed up? Let us count
the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some can be traced to the idiosyncrasies of leaders _ for
example, Howard Hughes, who had a deathly fear of germs,
communicated with employees solely by notes or by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the common foul-ups that every company falls
prey to at one time or another. Here are eight typical blunders and
how to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNICATION WITHOUT GROUND WORK
</P>
<P>
   Any controversial decision can engender scheming, plots and
politics. So rather than announcing a controversial decision to an
entire group, prep people one-on-one. By doing so, you can build an
alliance around the process, even if people disagree about the
content.
</P>
<P>
   Topics involving change are the most charged _ especially
reorganizations, changing goals and the departure of key employees.
</P>
<P>
   One way to cope is to name the emotion. ``This reorganization is
scary.'' Then address the concerns. Share the scenario you expect
to unfold. Demonstrate with your voice and body that you get it.
</P>
<P>
   LYING
</P>
<P>
   Certain topics must remain confidential while they're under
discussion. But be careful how you keep secrets. If people know
you've lied, you will lose their trust forever.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than lie, train yourself to respond, ``No comment'' or
``I can't answer that fully right now'' when asked about sticky
topics. Consistency is important. Warren Buffet never discusses his
investments, even with shareholders. As a result, his silence on a
particular deal gives away nothing.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEVING THAT WORDS CAN OVERCOME ACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   We want to believe that logic and discussion are the stuff of
persuasion, but in the end, actions win every time. If you say you
value everyone equally, but the executives have special parking
privileges, the message is clear: Status and title matter. If you
say you want feedback but explode when the feedback is negative,
the message is clear: You want to hear only about the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Before communicating standards of behavior, values or goals,
look carefully in the mirror. Review your recent decisions, and ask
whether the decisions support the values you're espousing. If not,
change your behavior.
</P>
<P>
   IGNORING THE REALITIES OF POWER
</P>
<P>
   Surprised that you never hear bad news until it's too late?
Don't be. The more power you have, the less you'll hear problems.
</P>
<P>
   For an honest assessment of a problem, seek out bad news. And
when it comes, appreciate it (visibly!).
</P>
<P>
   However, messages are magnified as they travel down the
hierarchy. For example, if you look pained during a presentation,
everyone will ``know'' you hated the presentation (or worse _ the
presenter).
</P>
<P>
   To prevent rumors, use plain, simple language. End meetings by
reviewing your reactions and next steps. ``I enjoyed your analysis,
Chris. The sales trend is disturbing _ let's follow up on
Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   MIXING BUSINESS AND FRIENDSHIP COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Confine friendship and business interactions to separate
meetings. If you must mix them, make the boundary clear. ``Let's
stop talking business for a minute and just talk as friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to contentious topics, keep it 100 percent
business in the office. An executive remarked to a friend at a
trade show that a new hire was extremely capable _ and good-looking
too. Bad move. Such comments at work can hurt credibility or turn
into a discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   UNDERESTIMATING YOUR AUDIENCE'S INTELLIGENCE
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to gloss over issues because ``people won't
understand.'' Why explain a reorganization when you can simply say,
``Here's the new org chart''?
</P>
<P>
   But that's a cop-out. Frontline employees may not be masters of
organizational design, but they deserve to know the rationale
behind changes that affect their lives. It's your job to help them
understand.
</P>
<P>
   CONFUSING PROCESS WITH OUTCOME
</P>
<P>
   In goal-setting, compensation and evaluation, it's easy to
confuse process with outcome. For example, you promise your team a
10 percent raise, but then the board caps raises at 5 percent. You
fight to raise the number, and compromise on 7 percent. But your
people don't appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   You want your team to honor how hard you tried _ to love you for
your process, not for your outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   When setting goals or evaluation criteria, communicate and
measure both the outcomes and processes involved. Motivation comes
from setting ambitious goals, especially if people are free to
choose how to reach them. To build a strong organization, however,
evaluation should include effort, learning and improvement _ all
process measurements _ to reinforce effective behavior.
</P>
<P>
   USING INAPPROPRIATE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Different communication channels work best for different topics.

<P>
   E-mail is great for conveying information, but don't use it for
emotional issues; e-mail messages are too easy to misconstrue.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls and face-to-face meetings are inefficient media for
disseminating information, but great for discussing emotional
topics. You can handle the listener's reaction, and you can use
your tone of voice and facial expressions to control your message.

   When Multi-Health Systems (MHS) of Toronto, Ontario, tested
1,500 U.S. Air Force recruiters for emotional intelligence, it
identified five attributes that separated those who made 100
percent of their quotas from those who made 70 percent or below.
MHS assigned relative weights to the attributes and they became the
basis for a formula for hiring new recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 250 to 300 people the Air Force hired using this
formula, the retention rate shot up by 92 percent. Factoring in the
costs of hiring, training and settling a new recruit into a
position, this translated into a $2.7 million savings.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody questions the importance of emotional intelligence for
leadership. Indeed, studies indicate that your emotional
intelligence or emotional quotient (EQ) accounts for 15 percent to
45 percent of your success on the job. (Your IQ, by comparison, is
said to account for less than 6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, notes author Daniel Goleman, in a 1996 study of a
global food and beverage company, where senior managers had a
critical mass of emotional intelligence, their divisions
outperformed yearly earnings goals by 20 percent. Division leaders
without that critical mass underperformed by almost the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, it's been difficult to apply the
principles of emotional intelligence to everyday situations. But
now that's changing. MHS and other companies have developed
assessment tools that can be incorporated into hiring,
performance-appraisal and executive-development processes. And
results like those achieved by the Air Force are making companies
take notice _ especially in the current climate, in which
competitive strategy depends upon the ability to hire and retain
top-notch workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was a matter of getting a better understanding of
all the people we were bringing in,'' says Shelley Ross, human
resources specialist at Wrigley Canada in Toronto. ``As with most
companies, our corporate culture has changed over the course of the
'90s. We now need people who are more flexible, more committed to
satisfying the customer. We've also moved to more of a team-based
approach throughout our plants, so we need people with better
decision-making skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Canada started using MHS's emotional intelligence test
on all prospective hires in 1998. Previously, the company had used
a personality assessment for professional and supervisory positions
only.
</P>
<P>
   In both examples, the MHS test used is called the EQ-i,
developed by psychologist Reuven Bar-On.
</P>
<P>
   A self-report instrument, the EQ-i rates respondents' answers
using five composite scales: intrapersonal, interpersonal,
adaptability, stress management and general mood. These five scales
are broken down into 15 subscale scores. Each test costs $30 to $35
and takes about 40 minutes to complete.
</P>
<P>
   How useful is the EQ-i? Wrigley's results have shown the
instrument to be ``an accurate tool,'' Ross concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the test is administered after an initial interview
with the hiring manager and a representative from HR. The results
can point to aspects of the candidate's social or self-management
skills that bear further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later in the process,'' Ross says, ``the hiring manager and
team members can use the test results to fine-tune their questions
of the candidate. I find that the test helps me with reference
checking in a similar way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person should never be hired based on test results alone,''
cautions MHS president and CEO Steven Stein. Prior experience,
education, references, interviews and even sample assignments
should all be factored into the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But that said, how can you implement the principles of emotional
intelligence in your own company's hiring processes? The route MHS
took with the Air Force is the most thorough, but if you have
constraints, start by administering an emotional intelligence test
to all job candidates. Then use tables MHS has developed _ they
list the most important EQ components for a variety of job
classifications _ to identify the best applicants.
</P>
<P>
   If an emotional intelligence test seems too involved, says
Sandra Yingling, Ph.D., senior consultant at Hay Group in Walnut
Creek, Calif., ``you can conduct `behavioral-event interviewing'
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, you ask a candidate to describe a time when she
felt frustrated by someone who didn't understand her idea. In the
candidate's response, you listen for how she decoded the reactions
of the other people around the table at the time of the
misunderstanding. At Hay, we've developed a dictionary of emotional
competencies that we use to assess the level of emotional
sophistication in a candidate's descriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of recruiting is to get someone who fits the
job and the culture,'' Wrigley's Ross says. ``We've discovered that
it's worth the effort to find someone who's a better match.''
</P>
<P>
   And EQ is becoming an increasingly important tool for that
search.

 FROM: THE HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 By STEVE ROBBINS  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can management communications be screwed up? Let us count
the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some can be traced to the idiosyncrasies of leaders _ for
example, Howard Hughes, who had a deathly fear of germs,
communicated with employees solely by notes or by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the common foul-ups that every company falls
prey to at one time or another. Here are eight typical blunders and
how to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNICATION WITHOUT GROUND WORK
</P>
<P>
   Any controversial decision can engender scheming, plots and
politics. So rather than announcing a controversial decision to an
entire group, prep people one-on-one. By doing so, you can build an
alliance around the process, even if people disagree about the
content.
</P>
<P>
   Topics involving change are the most charged _ especially
reorganizations, changing goals and the departure of key employees.
</P>
<P>
   One way to cope is to name the emotion. ``This reorganization is
scary.'' Then address the concerns. Share the scenario you expect
to unfold. Demonstrate with your voice and body that you get it.
</P>
<P>
   LYING
</P>
<P>
   Certain topics must remain confidential while they're under
discussion. But be careful how you keep secrets. If people know
you've lied, you will lose their trust forever.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than lie, train yourself to respond, ``No comment'' or
``I can't answer that fully right now'' when asked about sticky
topics. Consistency is important. Warren Buffet never discusses his
investments, even with shareholders. As a result, his silence on a
particular deal gives away nothing.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEVING THAT WORDS CAN OVERCOME ACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   We want to believe that logic and discussion are the stuff of
persuasion, but in the end, actions win every time. If you say you
value everyone equally, but the executives have special parking
privileges, the message is clear: Status and title matter. If you
say you want feedback but explode when the feedback is negative,
the message is clear: You want to hear only about the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Before communicating standards of behavior, values or goals,
look carefully in the mirror. Review your recent decisions, and ask
whether the decisions support the values you're espousing. If not,
change your behavior.
</P>
<P>
   IGNORING THE REALITIES OF POWER
</P>
<P>
   Surprised that you never hear bad news until it's too late?
Don't be. The more power you have, the less you'll hear problems.
</P>
<P>
   For an honest assessment of a problem, seek out bad news. And
when it comes, appreciate it (visibly!).
</P>
<P>
   However, messages are magnified as they travel down the
hierarchy. For example, if you look pained during a presentation,
everyone will ``know'' you hated the presentation (or worse _ the
presenter).
</P>
<P>
   To prevent rumors, use plain, simple language. End meetings by
reviewing your reactions and next steps. ``I enjoyed your analysis,
Chris. The sales trend is disturbing _ let's follow up on
Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   MIXING BUSINESS AND FRIENDSHIP COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Confine friendship and business interactions to separate
meetings. If you must mix them, make the boundary clear. ``Let's
stop talking business for a minute and just talk as friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to contentious topics, keep it 100 percent
business in the office. An executive remarked to a friend at a
trade show that a new hire was extremely capable _ and good-looking
too. Bad move. Such comments at work can hurt credibility or turn
into a discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   UNDERESTIMATING YOUR AUDIENCE'S INTELLIGENCE
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to gloss over issues because ``people won't
understand.'' Why explain a reorganization when you can simply say,
``Here's the new org chart''?
</P>
<P>
   But that's a cop-out. Frontline employees may not be masters of
organizational design, but they deserve to know the rationale
behind changes that affect their lives. It's your job to help them
understand.
</P>
<P>
   CONFUSING PROCESS WITH OUTCOME
</P>
<P>
   In goal-setting, compensation and evaluation, it's easy to
confuse process with outcome. For example, you promise your team a
10 percent raise, but then the board caps raises at 5 percent. You
fight to raise the number, and compromise on 7 percent. But your
people don't appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   You want your team to honor how hard you tried _ to love you for
your process, not for your outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   When setting goals or evaluation criteria, communicate and
measure both the outcomes and processes involved. Motivation comes
from setting ambitious goals, especially if people are free to
choose how to reach them. To build a strong organization, however,
evaluation should include effort, learning and improvement _ all
process measurements _ to reinforce effective behavior.
</P>
<P>
   USING INAPPROPRIATE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Different communication channels work best for different topics.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is great for conveying information, but don't use it for
emotional issues; e-mail messages are too easy to misconstrue.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls and face-to-face meetings are inefficient media for
disseminating information, but great for discussing emotional
topics. You can handle the listener's reaction, and you can use
your tone of voice and facial expressions to control your message.

WORLD TRAVELERS AT HOME EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sooner or later, most world travelers reach the same
realization: You can't leave yourself behind. In the most distant
locales and unlikely situations, you still carry a lifetime of
habits and memories. Yet with any luck, you'll bring back something
lasting: a new perspective on space and light, on how people
interact and how ideas fit together.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simon and Youssou N'Dour, two songwriters with
internationalist ears, have racked up ample mileage and countless
collaborators over the last decades as they made their musical
reflexes grapple with foreign stimuli. On their new albums, they're
back on home ground, but irrevocably changed. ``If you don't know
where you're heading anymore/Go back to where you come from,''
N'Dour sings (in the Senegalese language Wolof) on his new album,
``Joko (The Link)'' (Nonesuch 79617-2). ``Carry me home, my
teacher, carry me home,'' Simon sings on his new ``You're the One''
(Warner Brothers 2-47844).
</P>
<P>
   Each songwriter has taken up an old role, culturally ordained.
Simon is the introspective loner, an American individualist trying
to make sense of private lives and offering idiosyncratic
observations, strictly personal. N'Dour, doing the traditional duty
of a West African griot, makes himself the voice of a community:
praising historical figures, counseling virtuous behavior. Yet both
songwriters revitalize their accepted function with everything
they've gleaned abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the One'' is Simon's first album without a
superstructure _ just a batch of 11 new songs _ since ``The Rhythm
of the Saints'' in 1990. In between, he released a live album and
``Songs From `The Capeman,''' his 1997 Broadway musical. ``The
Capeman'' touched on crime, politics, ethnic tension and troubled
nostalgia. After the globetrotting of ``Graceland'' in 1986 and
``The Rhythm of the Saints,'' its music returned to New York City
circa 1959: doo-wop, Puerto Rican rhythms and pop.
</P>
<P>
   On its surface, ``You're the One'' seems to head back to the
folky tunes and shaky love affairs of Simon's 1970s albums like
``Still Crazy After All These Years'' and ``There Goes Rhymin'
Simon.'' It's full of translucent guitars and conversational
vocals, and most of its songs are written from the point of view of
someone who's staying put, contemplating the evanescence of love
and human folly.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``Graceland'' and ``The Rhythm of the Saints'' were
the memoirs of an unmoored, overstimulated traveler. The songs
sought to make sense of the distance, and the closeness, between
poverty and affluence, between tradition and technology, between
the material and the spiritual. Both albums were about uncertain
pilgrimages and stray epiphanies, described in the lyrics and
embodied in musical hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Those hybrids peek through the songs on ``You're the One,'' and
they frequently take over. Arrangements that start out with modest
fingerpicking, like ``That's Where I Belong,'' suddenly take on a
syncopated lilt and lift off. Bamboo flute, finger cymbals, cello
or mbira (thumb piano) might turn up, as two percussionists send
cross-rhythms flickering across and over the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Simon knows so much music now that he rarely draws a song from
just one idiom. While a vocal line may be symmetrical enough for a
campfire sing-along, a different rhythmic slant or percussion
accent sneaks in for a transcontinental second opinion. There are
glimmers of country, Indian music, mariachi, Celtic slow airs,
South African mbaqanga, bossa nova, reggae and Congolese soukous,
and at least one gorgeous pop chorus: the one-word chorale of
``Love,'' a benediction before Simon starts thinking about genocide
in the last verse.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameroonian guitarist Vincent Nguini, who has been working
with Simon since ``The Rhythm of the Saints,'' joins him through
much of the album, and their guitars intertwine like trellised
grapevines or DNA double helices. ``Darling Lorraine'' is a
six-minute study of the ups and downs of a marriage; it's also
about shifting pulses and rhythm patterns, chords switching between
minor and major, and the way a nearly inaudible shake of a maraca
or tap of a cymbal can tease a tune forward.
</P>
<P>
   In its own quiet way, ``You're the One'' is a completely
stubborn album. It's oblivious to anything like pop fashion,
relying on hand-played instruments and convoluted arrangements; its
songs ease into odd meters like 11/4 (``The Teacher''), or move
through ingenious, accelerating tempos like ``Hurricane Eye.''
Although ``The Capeman,'' in 1997, was a half-step ahead of the
Latin pop resurgence, ``You're the One'' doesn't hint at salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Where most pop and rock musicians cling to youth, Simon has
always presented himself as prematurely mature. He sang ``A Hazy
Shade of Winter,'' about missing ``the springtime of my life,''
when he was 26; in ``Still Crazy After All These Years,'' he acted
middle-aged at 33.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 58-year-old Simon mocks himself in ``Old,'' though he
takes it back by comparing one life span to the venerability of the
human race and the universe. Still, he allows himself a codger's
chutzpah; after singing about Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, he
cackles: ``Disagreements? Work 'em out.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon may be singing about death in the album's meditative final
song, ``Quiet,'' when he intones, ``I am heading for a time of
quiet/ when my restlessness is past''; he may just be seeking calm.
Even if he's not headed out of town, his music remains mobile.
</P>
<P>
   N'Dour has an eye on Senegal and an eye on the world throughout
``Joko.'' Where Simon allows himself the quirks of a private
citizen, N'Dour makes his statements with the self-conscious care
of a diplomat: Senegal's ambassador to the world. ``Drop your gun
and go to school,'' he sings, hoping to reach every urban child. He
proudly harnesses the latest technology to unmistakably Senegalese
music.
</P>
<P>
   His band, Super Etoile, has no rival in the brisk Senegalese
rock called mbalax, with jumpy six-beat rhythms and vocal lines
that leap out of the off-beats. It turns mbalax inward in ``Miss''
and lets it gleefully race ahead in ``Beykat,'' a tribute to
hard-working peasant farmers. But N'Dour also wields Western
sounds. There are hip-hop drum loops, guitar power chords and
brooding trip-hop synthesizers alongside the sputtering Senegalese
tama drums and keyboards programmed to plink like a kora, the
griot's harp-guitar. Peter Gabriel wafts a ghostly backup vocal
above the synthesized balafons (marimbas) of ``This Dream''; while
``Liggeey'' urges everyone to work hard, talking drums chatter
above a doo-wop chord progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birima,'' a jubilant praise song to an ancient king,
juxtaposes a stuttering traditionalist guitar with synthesizers.
Then it turns into a three-chord rock anthem; an electric organ
clinches a resemblance to Bob Dylan's ``Like a Rolling Stone.''
While drummers add a crackling cross-current, N'Dour's voice _ a
searing combination of passion and gentleness _ heads skyward with
improvisations that laugh out loud. Until he reaches the album's
last two songs, which are geared to English-speaking listeners and
verge on corniness, N'Dour presides over gleaming, intelligent,
unabashedly global pop. He hasn't decided to stay home; it's just
that he's at home everywhere. &QR;

SOUTH POLE HAS BEEN GETTING MORE THAN SNOW RECENTLY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CECIL JOHNSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine the hole in Texas Stadium expanded to a size sufficient
to encompass all of North America, and the sun's rays blitzing
down, as football officials say, ``unabated'' to the turf below.
</P>
<P>
   Got the picture? Well, that's how big the World Meteorological
Organization says the Antarctic ozone hole is this year.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ozone hole? A few years ago there was plenty of
excitement about it. In fact, the concern almost escalated to a
the-sky-is-falling kind of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   What scared folks who were knowledgeable about the ozone layer's
role in the environmental scheme of things was that its depletion
could lead to increased smog, damage to food crops and marine
ecosystems, as well as increases in skin cancer and cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen, and may be happening, because the ozone layer
screens the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Such
worries, along with fears of global warming, prompted most of the
major nations of the world to send representatives to Kyoto, Japan,
in 1997 to make some serious commitments to take remedial action to
combat those interconnected environmental threats.
</P>
<P>
   The same greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming play
an important role in depleting the Earth's protective layer of
stratospheric ozone. Compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, the
stuff that used to be contained in most aerosol propellants and the
refrigerants in refrigerators and home and automobile air
conditioners, also eat away at the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, scientists involved in an Antarctic expedition warned
that there might be a hole in the layer. And in 1985, a U.S.
weather satellite confirmed the existence of one.
</P>
<P>
   Other satellites also discovered a hole at the Earth's other
polar area. But the Arctic hole is smaller. The difference is said
to have something to do with the action of polar stratospheric
clouds at the South Pole that increase in winter and exacerbate the
destruction of ozone in the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
   WMO scientists say the southern ozone hole is larger this year
than it has ever been and that ozone levels are 50 to 70 percent
below what they were when the hole was first detected. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration officials say it is spread
over 11 million square miles, extending over all of Antarctica and
reaching the southern tip of South America, an area three times
greater than the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   One wouldn't expect the hole to continue to grow in light of
actions that governments and businesses have taken or promised to
take to prevent it. In the United States, many ozone-depleting
substances have been phased out, and stringent regulations have
been imposed to control the release of refrigerants while servicing
or disposing of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The layman, then, might logically expect the ozone holes to be
getting smaller instead of larger. But some scientists say there is
cause to become fatalistic about ozone depletion. They say the
growth in the holes is the result of ozone-destroying substances
that were realized years ago because that stuff takes a long time
to get up to the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   That means the effects of efforts to keep more
chlorofluorocarbons from getting up to the layer will not show up
for years to come. That's comforting. But there could be another
reason for the size of the 2000 Antarctic hole.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is a presidential election year. And there is
an extraordinary amount of hot air being emitted on the hustings.
That stuff travels fast because most it lacks any real substance.
That means it shouldn't take it long to get up there and do as much
damage to the stratosphere as it is wreaking upon the credibility
of the process by which Americans choose their leaders.

`BEAUTIFUL': NOT SO PRETTY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
On the wall beside the full-length mirror in Mona Hibbard's bedroom
is a motto to live by.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beauty is as beauty does.''
</P>
<P>
   When people get to know Mona, a different maxim comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty is only skin deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Mona (Minnie Driver) is a beauty pageant contestant with one
goal: winning. If that means gluing an opponent's hand to a flaming
baton, well, it's all for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful,'' directed by Sally Field from a script by Jon
Bernstein, takes a satirical and gentle _ but decidedly negative _
view of beauty contests and the driven women who claw their way to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   From as far back as she can remember, Mona has been obsessed
with winning pageants. As a child _ in the movie's early scenes _
she saves money to join local contests, though she never comes
close to winning.
</P>
<P>
   But she grows up, turns pretty and learns to dress, talk and act
like a beauty queen. She also learns to walk over people who get in
her way and to use those who try to help her.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many judges did you do to win this?'' a runner-up whispers
to Mona when crowning her in a local contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone except your dad,'' Mona says through a beatific
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's reached her 20s, with a real crack at winning the
Miss American Miss pageant, Mona has mastered the tricks of her
chosen trade but lost sight of the inner beauty the contest was
once supposed to represent.
</P>
<P>
   She is, in a word, a shrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' is a film with real problems. It's unimaginatively
directed and has a major imbalance between its dramatic and comic
elements. (Like an elderly woman committing suicide, and an
innocent person going to jail for her ``murder.'') It drags in the
middle. And the central character is unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   But like a pageant contestant who flops in talent but scores
well in the inspirational speech, there are elements and nuances
that save the movie from total washout.
</P>
<P>
   It touches, even if only glancingly, on a host of feminist
issues and interests, and presents them from a woman's viewpoint
(though writer Bernstein is male). The few men who pass through
this movie are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its problems are really assets. American audiences tend
to be unforgiving to female characters who aren't flawlessly sweet.
Yet Mona's unpleasant nature, though sometimes annoying, gives her
character and the film weight. And there are occasional hints that
somewhere, way deep inside, there's a good person who just got
misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the film dimension are relationships between Mona and two
other females whom she uses and abuses on her blinkered quest for
the sacred grail.
</P>
<P>
   One is her best friend, totally accepting Ruby (Joey Lauren
Adams of ``Big Daddy'' and ``Chasing Amy''). Since childhood, Ruby
has been Mona's unquestioning helper, seeing that Mona got to mall
openings on time or making sure her new gown is clean.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg of ``The Insider''
and ``Bicentennial Man''). Vanessa is Mona's daughter, but since
that would disqualify Mona from most beauty contests, Mona and Ruby
have always pretended Vanessa is Ruby's child. Even Vanessa doesn't
know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway along, the movie refocuses from Mona's back-biting to
her refusal to acknowledge Vanessa's needs. We're pretty sure that
somewhere around crunch time, Mona will be forced to decide between
what she's always thought she wanted most and what her daughter
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Driver deserves some kind of crown for risking such an
unappealing role. And also for her outrageous ``talent''
performance in the big pageant: It packs in every stagey cliche
movement possible but remains scarily believable.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, as Ruby, supplies the niceness missing from Mona, in a
voice somewhere between Jennifer Tilly's and Ashley Judd's. As
Vanessa, Eisenberg is appealing and sassy without gagging us on
cute.
</P>
<P>
   The ending is nicely handled. It's satisfying without being
overly sentimental and without Mona doing something too out of
character.
</P>
<P>
   Field's direction can most charitably be described as
workmanlike. It doesn't add any pizazz to the proceedings, and has
no comedy timing, but at least it doesn't distract with forced
artiness. Bernstein's script, decidedly sensitive to women's issues
and point of view, would have benefited from a smoother touch.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has bite, although not enough to leave teeth marks. &QL;

`GIRLFIGHT': FLOATING LIKE A BUTTERFLY, STINGING LIKE A BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We first see Diana Guzman, the heroine of ``Girlfight,'' Karyn
Kusama's sweet and fierce directorial debut, through a crowd of
teen-agers stampeding through the halls of a Brooklyn high school.
She's leaning against a locker, head down, her black hair in
cornrows along her scalp. Then she slowly raises her eyes, throwing
out a glower as fearsome as Robert De Niro's in ``Raging Bull.''
It's a riveting, iconic moment, a glimpse into the soul of an
angry, proud young woman. The shot also introduces a powerful,
extraordinarily gifted young actress: Michelle Rodriguez. Remember
the name.
</P>
<P>
   The first few scenes, which Kusama directs with fluid
efficiency, establish the basic facts of Diana's temperament and
her circumstances. She moves through life in a coiled sulk, ready
at the slightest provocation to explode out of quiet truculence
into rage _ the kind of adolescent that education professionals
would label ``at risk.'' Actually, when Diana's mad, everyone else
is at risk, from a stuck-up schoolmate to her own father.
</P>
<P>
   She's quick with her fists, but her most potent weapon is that
stare. When Diana shows up at a run-down gym hoping to sign up for
boxing lessons, one of the trainers sneeringly asks if aerobics
wouldn't be more suitable. She turns her head slowly and freezes
him with a look of pure contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I talking to you?'' she asks. Not many 18-year-old girls
can make a grown man cower like a beaten dog.
</P>
<P>
   Diana lives in the Red Hook housing projects with her father,
Sandro (Paul Calderon), and her younger brother, Tiny (Ray
Santiago), who dreams of becoming an artist. To Kusama's credit,
she doesn't load the family down with melodrama _ at least not
until the end of the movie, when a final confrontation between
Sandro and Diana tips over into sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a pervasive feeling of dread and disconnection in
the scenes that take place around the table in the family's tiny
kitchen. Sandro is sullen and a bully, and yet Calderon's
performance is also full of sorrow and unexpressed tenderness.
Sandro is crushing his daughter _ forbidding her to box, walking
out in disgust when he sees her in the ring _ but also trying,
clumsily, to protect her. The movie's main locus of unresolved pain
is in this relationship, between two people who are so much alike
and yet fail utterly to reach each other.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it deals with the new phenomenon of women who box,
``Girlfight'' follows a fairly standard sports melodrama story
line: We see a lot of hard training, a few triumphs and setbacks,
all on the way to the big fight at the end. Diana is grudgingly
admitted to the macho subculture of amateur boxing. Her big break
comes when the state declares that amateur bouts and tournaments
must henceforth include men and women fighting each other. Although
in real life there has so far been only one known, officially
sanctioned fight between a man and a woman, the movie does not make
mixed-gender boxing seem outlandish. The plot takes some unexpected
_ if occasionally contrived _ turns. At the gym, Diana meets Adrian
(boxing-movie fans will note that this was also the name of the
love interest in the ``Rocky'' movies), a handsome young
featherweight played by Santiago Douglas. Their friendship soon
edges toward a very tender, believable romance (featuring a
wonderful first kiss), and before you know it, they're scheduled to
meet in the ring, an event foreshadowed by an early sparring
session, in which Diana rocks Adrian with a right cross to the
temple and then says, for the first time, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this all a bit much? Maybe, but by the time the first bell
rings, you'll be in no mood to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama's unassuming script and Patrick Cady's fine, gritty
cinematography keep ``Girlfight'' anchored in unpretentious
realism. Diana and her young male sparring partners and opponents
look good, but not too good; they flail with the energy of the
youthful amateurs they're meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight'' sparkles with nice, small touches: a splendidly
punch-drunk rendition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner''; the
inspirational slogans, hand-lettered on cardboard, hung on the
walls of the gym; the sly banter between the wizened trainers.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast brings dimension to Diana's world.
Calderon's eyes and face suggest, more than the few lines he
speaks, the suffering behind his brutality. Douglas brings warmth
to his scenes with Rodriguez, and Jaime Tirelli _ as her gruff,
kindly trainer, Hector _ has the loose good humor that this role,
hardly the freshest in the fight-picture repertory, requires.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie belongs to Rodriguez. With her slightly crooked
nose and her glum, sensual mouth, she looks a little like Marlon
Brando in his smoldering prime, and she has some of his slow,
intense physicality. She doesn't so much transcend gender as
redefine it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, athletes like Venus Williams, Rebecca Lobo and
Marion Jones have given the world a new, intoxicating image of
female beauty rooted in power and confidence as well as grace.
Rodriguez is the first movie star _ and she is, without question, a
movie star _ to embody this new ideal. Allow me one lame sports
metaphor (after all, this is a review of a boxing movie): she'll
knock you out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes profanity and some violent scenes.

&HT;    
 &HT;    OFFICIALS TELL OF LAX ENFORCEMENT OF NURSING HOME STANDARDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after headline-grabbing disclosures of
life-threatening conditions in many nursing homes, enforcement of
federal standards continues to be uneven and sometimes toothless, a
Senate hearing was told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prevalence of poor care has not declined,'' said William
Scanlon, who led a U.S. General Accounting Office assessment of a
1998 nursing home initiative announced by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of new efforts, including more ``surprise''
inspections of the nation's 17,000 nursing homes, have yet to make
a difference, Scanlon told the Senate Special Committee on Aging in
describing the latest report card by the GAO, the investigative arm
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 Americans, most of them frail elders who cannot
speak for themselves, live in facilities where care is substandard,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials painted a picture of serious problems within
their nursing home inspection and enforcement systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years for penalties to be imposed,'' said Claire C.
McCaskill, state auditor for Missouri, who recently completed a
scathing investigation that revealed some fines in Missouri were
unpaid after four years of repeat visits, grace periods and
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill compared the current system with a mother telling her
son to remove unsanitary food from his room and, then, after
several days without improvement, telling him that he would be
punished _ but not until years later.
</P>
<P>
   Her audit also turned up major problems in the Missouri
inspection system. The state's inspectors rated 34 nursing homes
``deficiency free,'' but when federal inspectors rechecked them,
they found 22 of the homes had ``substantiated'' complaints from
residents and their families. In one of these homes, federal
officials found 39 complaints and 17 violations involving ``actual
harm'' to residents.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill urged that states be allowed to focus more on consumer
complaints at nursing homes, instead of requiring a thorough annual
inspection of each facility, as is now mandated by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   That idea was seconded by Maryland's director of nursing home
surveyors, Carol Benner, who represented a national association of
more than 5,000 inspectors. The survey teams are stretched too
thin, Benner told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government is spending nearly $40 billion
this year on skilled nursing home care through Medicaid and
Medicare, only about $200 million _ a thimble full by comparison _
goes for enforcing standards laid out in a 1987 law, whose
standards have never been fully enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which oversees
nursing homes, cited stepped up efforts during the past two years,
including more surveys conducted at night or on weekends, more
citations for substandard care, and more immediate sanctions for
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, HCFA now makes inspection results for specific homes
available on an Internet site at www.medicare.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, HCFA deputy administrator Michael Hash, conceded
shortcomings. A third of the states fail to investigate serious
complaints within 10 days as required and about the same number of
states fail to inspect every facility within the 15 months maximum
allowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A HCFA fact sheet acknowledged, ``Currently, nursing homes can
delay paying a fine for years while they appeal the penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Aging who raised the profile of the plight of nursing
home residents with hearings in July of 1998, promised to keep the
spotlight on the problem as the next president takes over.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said he was joining in a Clinton
effort to provide modest funding to increase staffing at some
nursing homes. The senator said he wants recommendations next year
for setting national standards for the ratio of nursing staff at
facilities, most of which have severe staff shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts hardly satisfy critics of the nursing home
industry, including the Texas Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Grassley timed for the hearing, Marie B. Wisdom,
president of the Austin-based group, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely weary of all of the so called 'attempts' by
Congress, presidents, (and) state legislators who say a lot but in
the long run, do nothing to create better environments in our
nation's nursing homes.''

 &HT;    `Titans': Football film packs moral wallop
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Rosa Parks had had Jerry Bruckheimer as a creative consultant
that fateful day she refused to give up her bus seat, he probably
would've had her carry a bomb in her purse, just to make her point.
</P>
<P>
   So what should we expect from ``Remember the Titans,'' a movie
that offers the unlikely coupling of producer Bruckheimer
(``Armageddon,'' ``Con Air'') and a true story from the civil
rights era about a newly integrated high school football team?
</P>
<P>
   Well, expect a lot of action. As in, lots and lots of football.
And expect the sort of rah-rah mentality that often fuels
Bruckheimer's ballistic extravaganzas. But this time, the cheering
is for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is Alexandria, Va., a generally affluent Washington
suburb, in 1971. It's a place where high school football is taken
as seriously as, well, we take it here. The new wrinkle is
integration, which has finally hit the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Beloved Coach Yoast (Will Patton), who's guided the T.C.
Williams Titans to several winning seasons, is passed over for the
position of head coach. Instead, the title _ and the authority _ go
to an unknown from North Carolina, Coach Boone (Denzel Washington).
The sticky part: Yoast is white (as was T.C. Williams High School
pre-1971); Boone is African-American. The stickier part: Though
both men are qualified and, in their different ways, deserving,
behind-the-scenes politics taint the appointment. As one school
board fat cat tells Yoast, ``Every head coach in the system is
white. We had to give 'em something.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stickiest part is the team. Can the players learn to put
aside their differences and come together as a team? (In an odd but
well-intentioned bit of racial profiling, the movie shows the white
players worried about losing their starting positions while the
African-American players confidently proclaim, ``From now on, the
Titans are going to be powered by soul power.'')
</P>
<P>
   The movie's earlier scenes take place at training camp, where,
in the time-honored tradition of ``The Dirty Dozen,'' the players
are forced to room together, play together and learn to behave as
if they're on the same side.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to enlightened leadership from both sides' star players,
the Titans come to respect, and, yes, even care about each other
(there are a few exceptions who crop up at well-timed intervals to
remind us this isn't just a football movie). Unfortunately, their
hard-earned one-for-all-all-for-one spirit doesn't extend to the
community at large. Parents gather outside school on opening day
waving anti-busing placards in front of their hate-smeared faces.
But then the Titans start winning. And keep winning. And the good
vibes prove contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Scriptwise, the movie is about a notch above ``The Mighty
Ducks.'' But the lack of narrative sophistication is overcome by
the sheer force of the story. Bruckheimer's
lowest-common-denominator mentality works surprisingly well here,
making ``Remember the Titans'' a crowd-pleaser with a moral
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The canny casting helps a lot. Washington can do this kind of
role in his sleep. The thing is, he'd still be worth watching _
even in his sleep. Patton, a proven character actor who's usually
stuck as a villain, gets to show his more likable side. The key,
however, especially for younger audiences who stand to get the most
out of the picture, is the roster of actors cast as the Titans.
Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst stand out as the team's leaders who set
an example with their colorblind friendship. So do Ethan Suplee as
a fat-boy buffoon more worried about getting into college than the
color of his teammates and Kip Pardue as a laid-back, long-haired
surfer from California whose lack of prejudice extends to gender
issues as well racial ones (Pardue, a Brad Pitt look-alike, is an
Atlanta native). Kudos also to 9-year-old Hayden Panettiere as
Patton's gridiron-crazy daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans'' doesn't strive for subtlety or
complexity, but ultimately, that's part of its strength. This is a
good-for-you movie disguised as a feel-good movie. And you know
what Mary Poppins said about that spoonful of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington. Rated PG for profanity, mild
violence and adult themes. 1 hour, 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Score one for Denzel's team!

 &HT;    Overdone `Beautiful' is only skin deep
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Make all the ``Gidget'' and ``Flying Nun'' jokes you want. The
fact remains that Sally Field has made some remarkable movies,
including two that won her Oscars (``Norma Rae'' and ``Places in
the Heart'').
</P>
<P>
   However, that's Sally Field the actor. Sally Field the director
has only one feature film to her name and that, alas, is
``Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't. Nor is it entertaining, incisive, amusing or
instructive. It's just a big lump of contradictory impulses, driven
mercilessly by Minnie ``If that's People magazine, I have a quote''
Driver.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Driver's off-screen behavior is her business. It's just
that her character somehow mirrors her seemingly incessant need for
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, back to ``Beautiful.'' The picture begins with an
overlong prologue introducing us to industrious little Mona, a kid
with a neglectful, negative mom and a stepdad who tries to molest
her when he's drunk. This straight-out-of-daytime-trash-TV home
life results in Mona's becoming obsessed with beauty pageants.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly (finally?) it's 10 years later. Mona (Driver) is still
determined to become a beauty queen. It looks like she may finally
have her shot. She's been named Miss Illinois Miss, making her
eligible for the national Miss American Miss title. Standing in her
way? Well, there's her checkered history of sabotaging pageant
rivals. And a scheming TV anchor who's up to no good. And the small
matter of having had a child (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) sometime in
her teens, whom she's foisted onto her best friend (Joey Lauren
Adams) to raise as hers (see, a Miss American Miss is supposed to
be a Miss, which pretty much excludes motherhood).
</P>
<P>
   But what's really holding Mona back is her gosh-golly-darn lack
of self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Berstein's script _ he wrote the Jerry Springer movie
``Ringmaster,'' which, come to think of it, may explain a lot _
can't decide whether it's an earnest, follow-that-dream melodrama
about a misfit who refuses to give up, or a scathing satire of
beauty contests. In trying to be both, it ends up neither.
</P>
<P>
   The succinct intelligence, intuition and craft that Field
brought to her acting seems to have deserted her in her new role as
director. ``Beautiful'' is embarrassingly overdone, whether it's
trying for comedy or poignancy. Do we really need the molestation
subplot (more like a molestation moment)? Do we really need to see
all five Miss American Misses' talent competitions? And how bad
does a movie have to be to squash the freshness out of ``Chasing
Amy's'' irrepressible Adams?
</P>
<P>
   Driver and Eisenberg _ she's the supposedly adorable tyke on
those ubiquitous Pepsi ads _ do look enough alike to be related.
More to the point, they share a similarly ruthless predilection for
camera hogging.
</P>
<P>
   There's a neediness _ in Driver's performance and Field's
direction _ that ultimately undercuts their efforts. Neediness,
alas, isn't beautiful. It isn't even cute with a good personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Minnie Driver. Directed by Sally Field. Rated PG-13 for
profanity and adult themes. 1 hour, 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Looks, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, 1.

 &HT;    `Dark Days' puts the spotlight on homeless in New York tunnel
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the real urban legends movie worth checking out. And
there's not a slasher in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Days,'' which won three prizes at Sundance this year, is
a most unusual documentary. Not only was it made by a young
Englishman who'd never made a movie before, but it's crewed by the
people who are its subjects. Namely, members of a community of
homeless people who live underground in an Amtrak train tunnel
stretching from 72nd Street to 125th Street on Manhattan's Upper
West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Marc Singer moved from his native England to New York
and immediately found work as a model. But what he really wanted to
do was direct. So he got a camera and, more importantly, found a
subject. Shot over a period of two years, ``Dark Days'' introduces
us to a half dozen or so of these denizens of the lower depths.
Singer's focus isn't on how they got there but how they manage to
stay there (some have lived in the tunnel 25 years). We see the
strange dailiness of their lives _ how they construct makeshift
homes out of discarded material; how they illegally tap into the
city's electricity so they can cook, shave, even watch TV (one sly
moment juxtaposes a homeless man next to a barely glimpsed ``Wheel
of Fortune''); how in a weird way they have replicated the basics
of a community. ``Hard to keep a place clean with a dog'' grouses
one tunnel guy, sounding for all the world like a put-upon
suburbanite.
</P>
<P>
   The picture's main problem is that after a point, we, well, get
the point. We become inured to their half-life present, and that,
almost de facto, keeps us distanced from their assorted pasts.
Memories of children lost in a fire or of a 5-year-old daughter
raped and mutilated lose some of their impact. We even find
ourselves thinking, gee, these folks really are relatively clean
and healthy. And they are. Then, we notice, so are the rats.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ``Dark Days'' reminds us how the unthinkable
can assume a kind of normalcy. Near the film's end, when there is
literally light at the end of their tunnel, one of them says he can
hardly remember how he ``let myself go like that'' and he vows
never to return to the ``dark days'' (his words) underground. A
small victory, but a victory nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Days''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary directed by Marc Singer. Not rated, but there are
adult themes. At Garden Hills. 1 hour, 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Notes from the underground.

 &HT;    Nothing shocking about additional `Exorcist' scenes
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't say Lucifer made them do it, but lucre might have
spurred director William Friedkin and writer-producer William Peter
Blatty to tinker with their supernatural classic, ``The Exorcist.''
Ranking second place at last week's national box office, based on a
limited screening, the 1973 flick opens wider today in a version
adding scenes and digital effects that actually reduce the
shocker's impact.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 minutes of new footage include one good addition. It's a
sequence showing distraught Hollywood star and single mom Chris
MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) taking 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda
Blair) for the first time to a doctor, after the girl's
increasingly weird behavior and complaints that her bed is shaking.
The scene adds to the movie's slow-building dread, before it
accelerates toward the head-spinning, soup-puking possession
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a couple of nice added grace notes that expand
Max Von Sydow's role as Father Merrin, the senior priest who aids
Father Karras (Jason Miller) in the climactic exorcism.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the bad stuff. We get a useless shot of the MacNeil
house in Georgetown, and a statue of the Virgin Mary before the
traditional opening in Iraq. The ``spider walk'' scene of Regan
coming downstairs upside down on all fours is included. It doesn't
work. Plus, the movie tacks on a more upbeat (and awkward) ending,
a scene of bantering between Father Dyer (the Rev. William
O'Malley) and Detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb).
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all are the digital additions _ superimposed flashes of
a demon face and the ancient statue first seen in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The demon face was supremely effective in the original
incarnation of the film because it flashed onscreen only two or
three times _ shock cuts that verged on subliminal, burning the
features into our minds. In the new version, the scamp shows up so
many times he's virtually a supporting character. (The movie's low
point comes when the face appears for a split second on the exhaust
hood of the MacNeil oven, apparently upholding the well-known
tradition of diabolical kitchen activity.)
</P>
<P>
   Do the tweaks and additions ruin the film? No. Its brooding,
ominous first half retains much of its power. And the over-the-top,
oozy shock effects in the second half still pack a wallop. But the
new version's amendments, for the most part, are distracting and
sometimes unintentionally funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Exorcist''
</P>
<P>
   Grade (for the 1973
</P>
<P>
   original): A-
</P>
<P>
   Grade (for the 2000
</P>
<P>
   remix): C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller and Linda Blair. Rated R
for strong profanity and disturbing images. 2 hours, 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A revamped classic, made scary in the worst ways.

 &HT;    `Girlfight' a knockout of a flick
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When teenager Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez) stares out her
tenement window at a young woman struggling home with an infant and
a toddler, you know she's afraid she's glimpsing her own future.
</P>
<P>
   If not winding up pregnant, the most she can expect is a
dead-end job. ``Your mother was a receptionist in a very nice
office,'' her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), tells her. That's
about the best life anyone in her Brooklyn neighborhood can hope
for her.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Girlfight,'' writer-director Karyn Kusama's rousing
debut, Diana decides to buck the self-fulfilling prophecies of
urban surrender. Only one fistfight away from getting expelled from
school, the trigger-tempered girl decides to channel her anger into
boxing lessons at the gym where her kid brother, Tiny (Ray
Santiago), trains. She isn't exactly welcomed with open arms. ``Why
not aerobics?'' one of the old regulars asks her.
</P>
<P>
   When a bully messing with Tiny winds up on the business end of
Diana's fists, he sneers, ``I guess you never learned how to be a
lady.'' No, not by his terms. But she learns how to take care of _
and control _ herself, even though she has to learn to punch
without her father finding out.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama's film, a winner of the director's award and grand jury
prize at Sundance, plus the Young Cinema Award at the Cannes Film
Festival, is a mix of clean storytelling, tough edge and gritty
urban texture. The movie is produced by Maggie Renzi, longtime
producer (and longtime companion) of independent film director John
Sayles, who makes a cameo here as Diana's distracted math teacher.
The association is appropriate. In her very first feature, Kusama
delivers a work that shares Sayles' attraction to working-class
settings. ``Girlfight'' also has some of Sayles' clear-eyed but
tender understanding of its characters. Everyone here has more than
one side, and Kusama loves their foibles as much as their
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   She's also not immune to a shameless sort of plot twist that
threatens to pit Diana against her newfound boxing boyfriend,
Adrian (Santiago Douglas), in the ring. The relationship between
these two is as interesting as the fighting matches (which Kusama
stages dynamically). We see how both Adrian and Diana gather
self-worth first from their wins on the mat, then through the
respect they give each other. As young as they are, they're both
veterans of the rough life.
</P>
<P>
   When he describes their relationship as a kind of war, she
replies, ``Maybe life's just war, period.'' But ``Girlfight''
believably shows them learning how to win, or at least stay up on
their feet. It's a crowd-pleaser that never sacrifices its brain to
the sucker-punch tricks of so many Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Rodriguez and Santiago Douglas. Rated R for
profanity. 1 hour, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A rousing female twist on the ``Rocky'' tale.

 &HT;    Branagh as Busby Berkeley to the Bard
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turning ``Love's Labour's Lost'' into a musical comedy may have
been a labor of love for Kenneth Branagh, but what's onscreen,
unfortunately, is often a labor to sit through.
</P>
<P>
   It must've looked good on paper. Take one of the Bard's least
performed works _ at best, the play is generally regarded a a kind
of warm-up for the infinitely superior ``Much Ado About Nothing'' _
and treat the plot the way those lavish MGM musicals from the '30s
treated their story lines. That is, as a lightweight necessary evil
around which to arrange all the sparkling musical numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh gets into the frothy spirit from the start with an
old-fashioned credit sequence featuring cameo introductions of the
cast against a lush red-satin background. Next comes an artfully
reproduced newsreel purporting to catch us up on the news of
Navarre, a tiny kingdom that, like the rest of Europe circa 1939
(the movie's setting), is teetering on the brink of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Battle, however, is the last thing on the mind of the youthful
King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola). So, he insists, is romance.
Rather, he and his three comrades _ Berowne (Branagh), Longaville
(Matthew Lillard) and Dumaine (Adrian Lester) _ have sworn to
devote the next three years to study and meditation. They will
``sleep little, eat and drink less and eschew all contact with
women.''
</P>
<P>
   His Majesty, however, has forgotten one little item on the royal
schedule: a visit by the Princess of France (Alicia Silvestone) and
her ladies in waiting _ Rosaline (Natascha McElhone), Maria (Carmen
Ejogo) and Katherine (Emily Mortimer). The oath goes out the window
as soon as the king and his pals meet the princess and her court.
</P>
<P>
   It's your basic boy-meets-girl plot, quadrupled by Shakespeare,
then dressed up by Branagh in Gershwin, Porter and Berlin as the
characters break off from speaking verse and break into song (and,
usually, dance).
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this tune-filled divertissement should be a delight.
In practice, well, let's just say it's marginally better than Burt
Reynolds' ``At Long Last Love'' or Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I
Love You.''
</P>
<P>
   Branagh is trying to make an all-singing, all-dancing silk purse
out of a sow's ear, and the strain shows. Essentially, he's left
himself vulnerable on two fronts. We're faced with actors who, for
the most part, aren't entirely at home with Shakespeare. At the
same time, most of the cast _ with the exception of Lester, who can
dance, and Nathan Lane, who applies his vaudevillian skills to
Costad, one of the low-comedy clowns in the play's subplot _ can't
sing or dance (don't ask them). The movie comes off as a kind of
jocular amateur theatrical, neither fish nor fowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there aren't some inspired moments _ a Branagh
monologue that melts into Berlin's ``Cheek to Cheek'' shows us what
the director apparently had in mind. But that synergy happens all
too rarely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love's Labour's Lost''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kenneth Branagh, Alicia Silverstone and Nathan Lane.
Directed by Branagh. Rated PG for mild sexual themes. 1 hour, 33
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A lost cause, methinks.

   DALLAS _ Sally Field appears to be eager to please. She's
sitting on the edge of a sofa in a cavernous suite in a Dallas
hotel, leaning into every question and comment as she discusses
``Beautiful,'' her feature-directing debut. She could be the
opposite of Mona, the ambitious beauty queen played by Minnie
Driver in the movie. Field is affable; Mona is, well, kind of hard

   UNDATED _ In this football melodrama set in Virginia during a

plays an African-American coach trying to integrate black and white

   UNDATED _ Minnie Driver has made a career of playing likable,
plucky women, in movies as diverse as 1995's ``Circle of Friends''
and this year's ``Return to Me.'' Actors get bored, though, and
it's easy to understand their attempts to stretch or to resist
being pigeonholed by playing against type. But in ``Beautiful,''
Driver overdoes it as Mona, a perpetual beauty-pageant contestant
whose attractive exterior masks a self-absorbed and misanthropic
interior. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment

   ``Adventures in Wild California''
</P>
<P>
   An Imax film.
</P>
<P>
   Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Review: You've got to hand it to the makers of the Imax movie
``Adventures in Wild California.'' Their movie will keep kids
slack-mouthed with excitement as they watch the extreme-sport
antics of athletic daredevils: tree climbers, snowboarders, skiers
and surfers. (SM) 40 minutes. Through March 4. Fernbank Museum of
Natural History, 767 Clifton Road N.E. 404-929-6400.

   Review: Cameron Crowe's (``Jerry Maguire'') exuberant and
knowing movie grabs the soul of rock 'n' roll and blissfully
re-creates the early '70s, a time poised between one water sign
(the Age of Aquarius) and another (Watergate). Drawing on his own
experiences, Crowe gives us a 15-year-old rock fan (Patrick Fugit)
who, in 1973, convinces Rolling Stone magazine to send him on the
road with an emerging group called Stillwater. He learns about sex,
drugs, rock 'n' roll and stomach pumps. He also learns why the
music matters _ and always will matter. (ERG)2 hours. A-

   ``Bait''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Foxx, David Morse and Kimberly Elise.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Review: May not hook you completely, but give it a chance.
Underneath the usual action-comedy trappings is an entertaining
and, on occasion, clever movie. Jamie Foxx stars as a small-time
crook who, without his knowledge, is released from jail with a
tracking device planted on him. The scheme, hatched by some federal
agents, is to lure a high-tech criminal out of hiding. A bit of
``The Truman Show'' emerges as the agents watching Foxx come to
care about him. Foxx, who provides the box-office bait, delivers a
fresh and charming performance reminiscent of early Eddie Murphy.

   ``Beautiful''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Minnie Driver. Rated PG-13 (profanity and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Review: It isn't. Nor is it entertaining, incisive, amusing or
instructive. Minnie Driver stars as a woman who makes up for her
neglected childhood by competing in beauty pageants _ even if that
means handing over her young daughter (Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the
brat _ er, tyke _ in those ubiquitous Pepsi commercials) to her
best friend (Joey Lauren Adams) to raise as her own. Directed by
Sally Field, it seems that all the intelligence and craft in her
acting has deserted in her directing. (ERG) At metro theaters. 1
hour, 52 minutes. D

   R (violence, drug content, brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl
with special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good vs.
evil, the film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The
Exorcist,'' ``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other
Catholic/satanic epics, all while managing to bore the pants off
you. (SM)1 hour, 50 minutes. D+

   ``Bring It On''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst. PG-13
</P>

   (sex-related material, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Kirsten Dunst stars in a comedy that pits two rival high
schools' cheerleading squads in a we-hate-you showdown at the
national cheerleading championships. Pretty much all the jokes fall
flat. Actually, the funniest bit involves projectile vomiting. And
what does that say about this movie? (BL)

</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   R (violence, language, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Don't get trapped in this one. Jennifer Lopez plays an
intrepid child therapist who, through an experimental sci-fi
technique, can enter the minds of others. A detective (Vince
Vaughn) asks her to stroll through the brain of a serial killer
(Vincent D'Onofrio) so he can find where he's stashed his latest
victim. Visually provocative, narratively impaired, it's like ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' without the compelling characters. (ERG) 1
hour, 52 minutes. C-

   ``Coyote Ugly''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello and
</P>
<P>
   John Goodman. PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving
liquor in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the
bar and set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big
pitchers of water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young
waif, a struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (BL) 1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>

   ``The Crew''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Burt Reynolds. PG-13
</P>
<P>
   (sexual content, violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: It stereotypes Jews and Hispanics and belittles the
group it's supposed to be celebrating, retirement-age Americans.
Even worse, the movie's not even funny. The stars are old mafia
wiseguys trying to fight a rent increase in their Miami hotel. Lame
plot twists and accidents ensue. (SM) 1 hour, 28 minutes. F

   ``Croupier''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen and Alex Kingston. Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Review: This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a
job at a casino running a roulette wheel to look for writing
inspiration. Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme.
``Croupier'' has more on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's
a fascinating, hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't
gamble. (SM) 1 hour, 31 minutes. A-

<P>
   ``Dark Days''
</P>
<P>
   A documentary directed by Marc Singer. Unrated (but there are
adult themes) Review: Here's the real urban-legends movie worth
checking out. And there's not a slasher in sight. Marc Singer spent
two years chronicling the daily routines of some homeless people
who live underground in an Amtrak tunnel on Manhattan's West Side.
The documentary can be monotonous, but it's a fascinating record of
how these people create a community out of society's discards
(themselves included). (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B-

   ``Duets''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Andre Braugher and Huey Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R (profanity, brief sex)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Off-key. Gwyneth Paltrow, Andre Braugher and Huey Lewis
are among six characters, each caught up in a personal drama,
headed for a big karaoke contest in Omaha. Sort of like a ``Love
Boat'' episode, only longer. And why, you might wonder, is an
A-list Oscar winner appearing in a dismal little movie about
karaoke? Check out the name of the director/producer. It's Bruce
Paltrow, as in father of ... (ERG)1 hour, 53 minutes. D

   ``The Exorcist''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller and Linda Blair. Rated R
(strong profanity and disturbing images)
</P>
<P>
   Review: You can't say Lucifer made them do it, but lucre might
have spurred director William Friedkin and writer-producer William
Peter Blatty to tinker with their supernatural 1973 classic (in my
book, the original gets a grade of A-). The 11 minutes of new
footage include one good addition (an early doctor visit) and a few
nice grace notes expanding Max Von Sydow's priest role. But at its
worst are new multiple superimposed flashes of a demon face (on a
stove vent, no less). It doesn't ruin the film, but new stuff is
sometimes distracting. (SM) 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+

   ``Girlfight''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Rodriguez and Santiago Douglas. Rated R
(profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Grand jury prize winner at Sundance, it's a mix of clean
storytelling, tough edge and gritty urban texture. In
writer-director Karyn Kusama's rousing debut, a trigger-tempered
teen girl, only one fistfight away from getting expelled from
school, decides to channel her anger into boxing lessons at the
gym. It's a crowdpleaser that never sacrifices its brain to the
sucker-punch tricks of so many Hollywood films. (SM) 1 hour, 50
minutes. A-

   ``Gladiator''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.

<P>
   R (extreme violence, perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects,
200,000 _ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell
Crowe as a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take
revenge on the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The
battles staged before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the
film's centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe.

</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   R (graphic violence, nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship
Troopers,'' ``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome,
state-of-the-art computer effects and exercise his gleeful brand of
brutal action. But his filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script
and characters so two-dimensional, they're virtually all
transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54 minutes. C

   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg''
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about baseball player Hank Greenberg. Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Aviva Kempner's documentary is a rare film indeed _ a
celebration of Hank Greenberg, a pro baseball player in the 1930s
and '40s who became the first Jewish sports superstar. Greenberg
broke records, was voted most valuable player twice and led his
team, the Detroit Tigers, to two World Series _ even as he was
being subjected to anti-Semitic baiting by fans, rivals and,
sometimes, his own teammates. (ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. A-

   ``Love's Labour's Lost''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kenneth Branagh, Alicia Silverstone and Nathan Lane.
Rated PG
</P>
<P>
   Review: A lost cause, methinks. Kenneth Branagh's song-and-dance
version of Shakespeare's play about a king and his comrades whose
monastic oath to embrace study and eschew romance is up-ended by
the arrival of the Princess of France and her court must've looked
good on paper. The cast, led by Branagh and Alicia Silverstone,
mostly can't sing or dance and, with a few exceptions, can't handle
the verse either. (ERG) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C-

   ``Nurse Betty''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock and Greg
Kinnear. Rated R (violence, language)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Renee Zellweger's otherworldly sweetness is used to
great effect in ``Nurse Betty,'' a dark fantasy. Like a collision
between ``Being There,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and early Coen
brothers, you've seen it before, but you've never seen anything
quite like this. Zellweger plays a waitress nurse in search of her
long-lost love, a soap opera character named Dr. David Ravell, and
steals a Buick to find him. Two problems. The Buick is full of
drugs, and hitmen Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock)
are soon on her trail. (ERG) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-

   ``Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson. PG-13 (crude humor and
sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Review: The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is
the nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kidCQ all the Murphy references). Murphy is
jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is simply not nutty enough.

   R (language, sex-related humor)

   ``The Perfect Storm''

(profanity, scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Review: The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so
does the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang
Petersen. Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates
the collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and
the battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) trying to survive the monstrous sea. (SM) 2

(contains adult themes, profanity).
</P>
<P>
   Part of BlackFilmFestAmerica's independent movie tour.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A sometimes witty, but thoroughly slow-going
relationship comedy. Malik Yoba (TV's ``New York Undercover'')
plays Keith, a New York journalist juggling a few too many personal
items. Like two girlfriends, a boss who wants to fire him, and
friends who see all too clearly through Keith's ``I'm OK'' veneer.
His saving grace may be his final assignment: date 30 women in 30
days for an article about the personal ads. (BL)

   ``Remember The Titans''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington. Rated PG (profanity, mild violence
and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Go Titans! This filmed-in-Atlanta crowd-pleaser with a
conscience is loosely based on a true story from the civil rights
era. In 1971, the football players at a newly-integrated high
school in Alexandria, Va., learn to come together as a team. Denzel
Washington shines as the team's new coach. So do Will Patton as his
passed-over assistant and Kip Pardue, Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst as
players. True, there's not much subtle here, but as a
good-for-you-movie disguised as a feel-good flick, it's very
effective. (ERG) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B+

<P>
   ``The Replacements''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (some crude sexual humor, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: It's got it all. Bone-crunching football plays.
Boneheaded comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer
player, puffs cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt
pep squad whose sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to
fumble a lot. Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman star in this dumb romp
about adult scabs taking over for striking pro players. (BL) 1
hour, 58 minutes. C

   ``Scary Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shawn Wayans and Marlon
Wayans. Rated R (strong crude sexual humor, profanity, drug use,
violence)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen
(writer/director), Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor);
and they are a talented bunch _ ``Scary Movie'' is a parody of teen
horror flicks.(BL) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+

   ``Space Cowboys''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and
Donald Sutherland. PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Review: The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in
Clint Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the NASA program in the '50s are
summoned into service to repair the thing. The best part of the
film is watching these veterans play off each other like seasoned
pros on the Senior Tour. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B

<P>
   Starring Pras, Ja Rule, Vondie Curtis-Hall. Rated R

</P>
<P>
   Review: Based on ``Ghetto Supastar,'' both the CD and
young-adult novel by hip-hop star Pras (aka the Fugees' Prakerzel
Michel), ``Turn It Up'' is a flashy, loud urban thriller that wants
to critique the guns-and-bullets world of thug life, while at the
same time reveling in its perks. It's a cautionary tale that isn't
quite sure what it wants to caution the audience about. (SM) 1

   ``Urban Legends: Final Cut''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Morrison and Matthew Davis. Rated R (violence,
gore, language, some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Please let it be final. University film students get
whacked in this slasher film with loose connections to ``Urban
Legend.'' The characters are all interchangeably gorgeous and
equally shallow. First-time director John Ottman manages to crank
some suspense out of chase scenes, but he can't bring life to a
movie formula that is dead dead dead. (SM) 1 hour, 34 minutes. D+

   ``The Watcher''
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Spader, Keanu Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R (violence, language)
</P>
<P>
   Review: There's a resonant 21st-century theme in ``The
Watcher,'' an otherwise standard serial-killer thriller. A sicko
named Griffin (Keanu Reeves) stalks pretty women and uses a burnt
out detective, named Campbell (James Spader), as his main pawn.
Debut director Joe Charbanic manages to wring some suspense out of
stock situations. Too often, though, he falls back on cliches,
including heavy breathing on the soundtrack, and an arty reliance
on blurry slo-mo flashbacks. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. C+

   Review: An Oscar winner for his ``Usual Suspects'' screenplay,
Christopher McQuarrie makes a sluggishly paced directing debut in
the tale of a couple of lowlifes named Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and

movie is so intent on an air of existential grunge, it becomes
suffocating and pretentious. (SM) 2 hours. D

   ``What Lies Beneath''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. PG-13 (terror,
violence, sensuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: What lies beneath this film is a script that could have
come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but boosted
by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford and
suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback to
haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than great effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10 minutes.

   Review: Despite some tasty ingredients, it's a screen confection
that never quite gels. Mix together the stories of Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, ``Like Water for Chocolate,'' a few Food Network series
and lots of dreamy samba and you'll get the recipe. Call it Magic
Realism Lite. Though it's packed with cooking scenes and shots of
steaming food, the movie's spiciest ingredient _ and the main
reason to see it _ is Spanish actress Penelope Cruz. (SM) 1 hour,
33 minutes. C+

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A state attorney general's
investigation into the Saratoga Race Course and the state's two
other thoroughbred racetracks run by the New York Racing
Association is focusing on mutuel clerks who may have knowingly
laundered money for organized crime, a source close to the
investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The source also said that a separate federal investigation has
been launched by the Internal Revenue Service, but that could not
be immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators raided the three NYRA tracks early Tuesday,
seizing about 300 boxes of financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Violette, a spokesman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's
office, said an ``ongoing investigation'' conducted by the office's
Organized Crime Task Force prompted the morning sweeps of Belmont
Park in Elmont; Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens; and Saratoga Race
Course, from which State Police and other law enforcement
authorities removed boxes of cashed mutuel tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the investigation said that it focuses in part
on the mutuel clerks who work the tracks' betting windows and may
have knowingly exchanged marked money involved in past crimes for
``clean'' money collected at the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYRA as a corporation is not a target of the investigation. At
the request of the state, we can't comment further,'' said NYRA
spokesman Glen Mathes.
</P>
<P>
   The case is not targeting specific clerks, but a person close to
the investigation suspects ``there may be some dirty clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next process, we'll be able to eliminate scores of
window tellers and start focusing in on a select handful,'' said
the source, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   NYRA President Terry Meyocks said the organization plans to
cooperate fully with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always looking to protect the integrity of the industry
and NYRA. Integrity is our major goal. We won't let the actions of
anybody get in the way of that,'' Meyocks said.
</P>
<P>
   The raids targeted financial documents and records, Violette
said. ``We now begin the process of sifting through them, analyzing
them and putting together a paper trail.''
</P>
<P>
   He would neither confirm nor deny whether they are investigating
the possibility of a conspiracy involving money laundering, but
stated that the main duty of the office's Organized Crime Task
Force was to get ``involved in tracking down and halting crimes
that are undertaken by organized criminals.'' The raids were the
result of a ``months-long'' investigation, Violette said. No one
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Police executed search warrants at the three tracks
and NYRA cooperated fully,'' Mathes said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, the State Police raided the main section of the
grandstand at Saratoga Race Course and removed boxes of cashed
mutuel tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they conducted the three sweeps
simultaneously on Tuesday, a dark day for racing, so they wouldn't
interrupt business at Belmont Park, which started racing after the
Saratoga meet ended Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   While the sweeps went smoothly at Saratoga and Aqueduct, the
vaults at Belmont that authorities needed to access were
time-locked with set devices that did not unlock again until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who made the Belmont raid were forced to guard the
vault overnight until its opening early Wednesday, according to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   State Police from the Albany area, White Plains and New York
City were involved in the raids, Violette said.
</P>
<P>
   NYRA employs up to 500 mutuel clerks at Saratoga Race Course,
Mathes said. Their duty it is to accept wagers and collect money.
</P>
<P>
   NYRA is a private not-for-profit company. It has a franchise to
manage the state's three tracks through 2007.

SPORTS COLUMN: A NIGHT OF COMPETING ASPIRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sports of the Times) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Some Olympic days are more defining than
others. Thursday was one of those days _ and one of those nights _
of clarity that brings fleeting insight into the essence of the
Olympic spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Not of the spirit that the International Olympic Committee
shamelessly sells and parcels out. Not of the spirit that compels
some athletes to load up with drugs. This was a glimpse into the
spirit of competition, of what the Australians call the ``fair
go.'' This is what you don't see when watching the television
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   This was the evening of Day 14, a night when Marion Jones won
her second gold medal, a night when Konstantinos Kenteris became
the first Greek man to win a gold in a running event, the 200
meters, since 1896, a night when Cuba's men broke the American
domination in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   Jones cruised home in the 200 with the fastest time in the world
this year, 21.84 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The silver medalist, Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas, was
so into the moment that she began crying tears of joy as soon as
she realized that she had finished second. When she stepped up to
get her medal, her mind was exploding with the names and faces of
all the people who helped get her there.
</P>
<P>
   This was a night when you learned a little more about Jones,
whose husband, C.J. Hunter, is involved in a controversy concerning
his failed tests for a performance-enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
   Jones puts on the good public face and seems authentic.
</P>
<P>
   When the stadium announcer made a mistake before the 200-meter
final and introduced her as an athlete from the Bahamas, Jones
shrugged her shoulders and smiled. Then she went out and beat
everyone by 13 feet. She ran one race and the rest of the field ran
another.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, someone asked Jones if, in light of the news about
Hunter, she was afraid people might think she wasn't clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't have that fear,'' she said evenly. ``The people
that know me, the people that support me, train with me and coach
me, know that I'm a clean athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone else asked about the source of her focus, her ability to
block out distractions. She said her goals give her the focus she
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to prove to myself that it's possible to walk away
from Sydney with five gold medals,'' she said. ``This has been a
dream of mine for a lot of years, and so to let one event ruin your
life, as dramatic as it might be, that wouldn't be worth it at all.
All the days my mother would travel four or five hours to take me
to a track. To let one event ruin it _ no way. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Jones accepted good-natured teasing and
gave it back.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis-Thompson said, in one of her extended answers, ``I'm
outspoken,'' Jones grabbed the microphone and said with mock
surprise, ``Noooo!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the subject of the women's 400-meter relay came up,
Davis-Thompson said: ``We are still the underdogs and we love being
in that spot. It's going to make our victory just a little bit
sweeter, Marion.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added: ``I know you have a little bit of Caribbean
blood in you, too, Marion'' _ alluding to Jones' mother's Belizean
heritage _ ``so you're almost like one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The room broke up and Jones lowered her head and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Grace and ease.
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Thompson was asked to compare Jones with the late Florence
Griffith-Joyner, since she had run against both of them. ``They're
both very dominant,'' she said. ``Marion seems more down to
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the women's 200, I had been to the tennis site to
listen to Serena and Venus talk about their gold medal performance
in doubles. Serena spoke of walking around and watching the
performances of other great athletes, and how it enabled her to see
herself, and her accomplishments, in a larger context.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that context is what makes this more than a mere
track meet, more than a tennis tournament where athletes are
sequestered in their own worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting a chance to meet fellow American athletes who I
have never met and probably will never meet again, from rowers to
judo experts, from everyone,'' she said. ``Even the big stars, the
men's basketball team, the women's basketball team. Venus, Serena,
Monica, Lindsay. To see how humble they were really puts this whole
thing in perspective.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the news conference broke up, the other sprinters stayed
and chatted. Jones sprang up, and the soft smile gave way to an
all-business gaze. In an instant she was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what Days 15 to 18 hold.
</P>
<P>
   Day 14, off camera, was pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    The day the typing died for a faceless e-community
 &HT;    By Jerry Gentry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Internet listserv creates an e-community of screen-readers
and typers, all sharing an interest: a political cause, a music
group or perhaps an antique car of which only 200 exist.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships consist entirely of electronically delivered
words. Faces are rarely seen, voices rarely heard. So what happens
when someone on the list dies?
</P>
<P>
   I am a member of a listserv for fans of the University of
Louisville. We e-mail to one address our complaints, cheers or
exasperations, and the messages are automatically sent to all on
the list. Some want the coach replaced; some want him retained. We
win, and we celebrate; we lose, and we sulk _ together, by reading
each other's words. We don't slouch out of an arena together or
smack high-fives; we type.
</P>
<P>
   One list member, a Louisville lawyer named Les Terry, sent
witty, concise and courteous messages. I particularly enjoyed his
lighthearted reports on alumni trips to road games. When the list
rhetoric overheated, he sent calm, rational messages that deflated
the hype. His e-mails were among the few that I clicked on eagerly.
His words reminded me of a favorite uncle who told funny stories
and hugged with big strong arms. He signed off with a simple
``Regards,'' a small touch that communicated respect and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the list received an e-mail with the ominous subject
heading, ``Listmember Les Terry.'' Like a phone ringing deep into
the night, the heading signaled bad news. Sure enough, the e-mail
from someone who knew Les said he had died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, I sensed a somber mood on the list, even though ``on the
list'' meant only reading messages on my computer in my office. I,
a solitary person reading pixels, experienced a shared loss. The
Louisville football team had just trounced its opponent, but not
one single e-mail celebrated the victory. All of us, apparently,
looked at our screens and knew something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   I knew Les only through typed words, but I felt sad. It was a
strange sadness, over the loss of a personality attached to no
person with whom I was physically familiar. Yet that personality
felt vivid to me. When someone we know dies, for a while, we
instinctively expect that person to walk in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing disappointment makes the loss more real. I began
expecting e-mails that didn't come.
</P>
<P>
   Many listmembers sent condolences, and several, including me,
said how much Les will be missed and speculated on what a
delightful man he must have been. Les's family members were
forwarded all our e-mails, and they responded that our impressions
of Les were correct. How remarkable is human language. Via his
words alone, his presence had passed electronically, accurately,
through wires onto a screen and into my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Through words flow one's character, one's demeanor. Because of
Les's words, his legacy is that of a warm, decent, jovial person.
Sports blather and hot-headed harangues do not last; respectful
dialogue and reasonable reflection do. Words flicker with our very
souls.
</P>
<P>
   Regards.

 &HT;    NUMBER OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPS
 &HT;    With HEALTH-INSURANCE-DATA, for a box/chart, which has moved.
 &HT;    ATTN TEXAS EDS: Your state tops the list in the proportion of
uninsured.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 2 million Americans, half of them children,
obtained health-care coverage last year, the first time in 12 years
that the number of people without health insurance dropped, the
Census Bureau says in a report to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The country's low jobless rate and broader health-care coverage
offered by employers contributed to the turnaround. The number of
people without health insurance declined by 1.7 million between
1998 and 1999, from 44.3 million to 42.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured children fell by more than 1 million to
10 million, from 15.4 percent to 13.9 percent of all children, its
lowest level since 1995. About 567,000 poor children gained health
insurance in 1999, stemming in part from a Clinton administration
push to increase government health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the number of uninsured Americans, particularly among the
working poor, remained high. About 15 of every 100 Americans
remained without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains last year, the number of uninsured has
increased by nearly 8 million since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a morning drizzle after a prolonged drought,'' Ron
Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a non-profit consumer
advocacy group on health-case issues, said of the 1999 decline in
the number of uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults and immigrants were the least likely to have
coverage. Minorities were less likely than whites to have
insurance, though coverage increased across all racial and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Texas topped the list of states with the highest share of
uninsured, 24.1 percent when statistically averaged from 1997 to
1999. Minnesota had the lowest rate of uninsured people, 8.8
percent of its population without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans _ 63 percent _ were covered by a health insurance
plan linked to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving force behind this improvement was an increase in
the likelihood of people having employment-based health
insurance,'' said Robert Mills, author of the Census Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said two vulnerable groups remained worrisome:
low-income working people not eligible for Medicaid or other
government-subsidized health care coverage and young adults unable
to obtain or afford coverage from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   One of every three people in poverty was not covered by a health
plan in 1999, virtually unchanged from the previous year. While
Medicaid covered 12.9 million poor people during at least part of
1999, another 10.4 million people below the poverty line had no
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Only 71 percent of young adults, ages 18-24, had health
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton took office in 1993 pledging health insurance
for all Americans. In the next five years, the ranks of the
uninsured grew by more than 4.5 million as administration efforts
to convince Congress to approve a comprehensive health care
proposal failed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress and the White House have agreed over the years
on a string of incremental measures to expand coverage. Overall,
about one of every four Americans has some form of government
insurance through Medicaid, Medicare or other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and the uninsured has been a major issue in the
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore would expand the federal Children's Health
Insurance Program and provide tax credits for low-income families
and the elderly. Republican George W. Bush has proposed a $2,000
refundable health credit for low-income families not covered by
Medicaid or an employers' health plan to be able to purchase their
own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have promised to make health insurance more
affordable for small businesses who cover their employees. Most new
jobs are created by small businesses, which are less likely to
offer employee health benefits because of the high cost of
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The non-profit Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation has been
studying uninsured families since 1995 and finds that many forego
medical care or wait until a health condition makes it absolutely
necessary to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see so visibly is that the uninsured are working
families living on the edge _ a major illness or accident can push
them over the edge,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's figures are based on its annual population
survey of 50,000 American households.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lower-income Americans were less likely to have health
insurance. About 24 percent of households with annual incomes of
less than $25,000 had no health insurance. (The poverty line is
defined as an income of $17,029 for a family of four and $13,290
for a family of three). About 8 percent of households with incomes
of $75,000 or more were without coverage. But overall, coverage
rates increased for households with incomes of less than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whites were much more likely than minorities to be covered by
health insurance. One of every three Hispanics, or 33.4 percent,
was without health insurance compared to 11 percent for
non-Hispanic whites. About 21 percent of African Americans and
Asian Americans were not covered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workers at large companies were twice as likely to have health
insurance than those employed by small businesses. About 31 percent
of workers at firms with 25 or fewer employers had coverage while
at companies with 1,000 or more employees, 68 percent of workers
had health insurance. (The estimates do not account for employees
that may be covered by another family members job-based insurance
policy).
</P>
<P>
   _ The share of population without health insurance fell in 15
states _ Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North
Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas. Meanwhile, eight states
saw an increase in the proportion of uninsured: Hawaii, Illinois,
Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
The results are based on statistical comparisons of two-year
averages from from each state for 1997-98 and 1998-99.

AUSTRALIAN DUOS CAPTURE GOLD OVER U.S. CREWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERB McCORMICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ In sight of the famous waterside Opera House
and the Olympic rings emblazoned across the Sydney Harbor Bridge,
the U.S. crews of J.J. Isler and Pease Glaser, and Paul Foerster
and Bob Merrick, raced to silver medals Thursday afternoon in the
waning days of the Olympic regatta.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in the women's and men's divisions of the
double-handed 470 dinghy, the twin silvers represented the best
results for the U.S. sailing team in two Olympiads. But if their
performance was exhilarating for the Americans, the day was
positively euphoric for the home team, which delivered the greatest
day ever by an Australian Olympic sailing squad.
</P>
<P>
   With helicopters wheeling overhead, dozens of spectator boats
cordoned off alongside the race course, and large crowds craning
seaward from shoreline vantage points, the Australian duos of Tom
King and Mark Turnbull, and Jenny Armstrong and Belinda Stowell,
capped off strong, consistent regattas to capture the respective
470 gold medals. It had been 28 years since Australia's last
sailing gold.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. pairs started the day off with golden possibilities,
but their destinies were not entirely in their own hands. Isler and
Glaser, in third place after 10 races, were nine points behind the
Australians. Theoretically, a race victory coupled with a poor
finish by the Australians could propel them to first. But, in the
points, a bad race could have dropped the U.S. sailors from medal
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Foerster and Merrick began the day in second, five
points behind the Australians. A race victory coupled with an
Australian finish of sixth or worse would have earned the Americans
the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The women's race went off first. The American boat got off to an
inauspicious beginning. `'The breeze came in very quickly,'' Isler
said, ``and we didn't get off the line very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the race, Isler and Glaser were mired in ninth
place and sailing astern of the Australians, Israelis and
Ukrainians, who were directly in their path to the medal podium. It
appeared that the U.S. pair was out of the running. But on the
second-to-last downwind leg, Isler noticed a stream of wind pulsing
off Bradley's Head, a promontory lined with spectators. Among them
was her husband, Peter, like his wife a veteran of the America's
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of boats passed us by going really close to the
headland and getting a big puff,'' Isler said. She made a mental
note of exactly where.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off on the final leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that last run, we saw the same kind of puff developing, so
we kind of reached up for it,'' Isler said, ``and the next thing we
knew we were crossing the Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Isler, running along the coastline, noticed it, too.
``There was a sweet spot right at the point, and they also got a
nice ride from a powerboat wake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were also passing several boats, and their sixth-place
finish in the race _ the Aussies, to raucous cheers from the Manly
Ferry, were first _ propelled the Americans to the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy,'' J.J. Isler said. ``Our best international
finish coming into this regatta was a seventh. This is all we could
ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the women's team, the men's team, featuring Foerster, a
silver medalist in 1992, and Merrick, came into the Olympics as one
of the favorites. And on the final day, sailing a near-flawless
race, they almost earned the top prize. ``We got a good start,''
Merrick said. ``We were able to go exactly where we wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Isler and Glaser, the men realized that the point off
Bradley's Head was paying huge dividends, and sailed directly for
it. They rounded the top mark in first, with the Aussies a distant
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd seen them earlier and knew they were a few back,''
Merrick said. ``But they're great sailors. From our point of view,
they really needed to be about 15th at that point to not be able to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the Australians did come back, rolling through the fleet to
camp right behind the Americans. The U.S. team hung on to win the
battle, but the Australians, with their second-place finish, won
the war, and the gold.

 &HT;    Physicist ponders cosmos in cappuccino
 &HT;    By Joe Earle
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Sidney Perkowitz stared into his cappuccino one
morning a few years ago, inspiration bubbled up.
</P>
<P>
   Perkowitz, a white-bearded Emory University physicist and
science writer, was struck by the form of the foam in his cup, so
much so that he launched a three-year survey of frothy things.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after digesting lots of research and more than a few
beverages, he's able to draw physical parallels between the head on
a beer and the structure of the universe, a souffle and top-secret
stuff inside spy satellites. He lays out his foamy connections in
the book ``Universal Foam: From Cappuccino to the Cosmos'' (Walker
and Co., $24).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great to have some meringue or drink a beer and
think it represents some kind of cosmic pattern,'' the 61-year-old
Perkowitz said one recent afternoon in his office at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Foam, he maintains, is strange stuff. Shaving cream, frothy
seawater on the beach, dishwashing suds _ it acts like nothing
else, posing physicists with unsolved math problems.
</P>
<P>
   Foam, he says ``is an everyday object that is mysterious.'' It's
taken a scientist who finds the fun in physics to plumb that
mystery. ``He's certainly not just your typical physicist,''
Phillip Schewe, a senior science writer at the American Institute
of Physics, says of Perkowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn of Polish immigrants, Perkowitz grew up on
Coney Island. He remembers living in an apartment beneath the
parachute jump ride, about a block from the roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he's written magazine articles on why
scientists dress so badly (a mixture of naivete and arrogance),
what happens when voice-recognition software hears poetry (``In
Xanadu did Kubla Khan'' becomes ``In salmon do did mobile bond'')
and how novelist E.M. Forster might have reacted to the Internet
(poorly).
</P>
<P>
   He started looking into the physics of foam with the idea of
doing another magazine article. But his frothy subject carried so
many possibilities that it led to a book that largely was written,
he says, while sipping froth-topped concoctions at his favorite
Atlanta coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he also learned how to make a better cup of
cappuccino. The secret, he says, is in the foam.

AFTER 5 SETS, THE RUSSIANS END THE UPSTART AMERICANS' RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SHAW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ A U.S. women's volleyball team that arrived
here little known and lowly rated took Russia to a fifth game
Thursday night for the right to play for the Olympic gold medal.
But the U.S. squad, seeded 10th in a 12-nation field, finally lost
to the second-seeded Russians in a tough 90-minute semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who won, 25-15, 23-25, 25-15, 26-28, 15-8, will
face Cuba, the defending two-time Olympic champion, for the gold
medal. The Cubans beat third-seeded Brazil, 27-29, 25-19, 21-25,
25-19, 15-9, in the other semifinal. The United States and Brazil
will play for the bronze medal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the U.S. team repeatedly battled back from huge
deficits against the more experienced Russians. After trailing,
19-13, in the fourth set, the Americans won a dramatic series of
set points to take the game, 28-26. In the fifth set, the Russians,
led by their twin towers, 6-foot-4-inch Yelena Godina and 6-3
Yevgeniya Artamanova, finally pulled away from the Americans. From
7-7 in the final game, Russia won eight of the last nine points of
the match. Godina finished with 28 kills and Artamanova had 26,
Lyubov Chachkova added 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic veterans Danielle Scott, 27, and Tara Cross-Battle,
32, and Logan Tom, a 19-year-old newcomer, were the mainstays of
the U.S. attack. Scott had a team-high 21 kills and Tom 15. While
most of the Americans said they were disappointed with Thursday
night's outcome, they took solace in their strong showing in the
tournament. They upset fourth-seeded China in four sets and edged
fifth-seeded South Korea in a thrilling five-set quarterfinal
Wednesday. In that comeback, the Americans rallied from a 12-9
deficit in the fifth set, winning four straight points to gain a
lead they never relinquished. And Thursday night they gave the
Russians a stiffer challenge than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team manager, Robert Gambardella, put its Olympic
performance in perspective. ``Everybody said we'd finish 10th
here,'' he said. ``Instead, this team has made history. Some
players have very little international experience and yet they made
the semis and the playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott looked forward to playing again. ``The Russians have been
an exceptional team for a long time, but we had a chance to win
tonight,'' she said. ``A lot of people didn't think we could get
this far. And we are not through yet. We still have a chance for
bronze against Brazil on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   And Cuba has a chance for an unprecedented third straight
volleyball gold thanks to the victory over Brazil. Cuba raced away
from Brazil in the deciding set Thursday night with a series of
spectacular 60 mph spikes.

   The Cuba-Brazil match had the feel of a gold medal showdown.
Traditional regional rivals with similar aggressive styles, the two
teams had clashed after Cuba's heated five-game semifinal victory
in Atlanta in 1996. In that match, players sniped at one another
during play and the tension boiled over during the post-match
handshake at the net. They slapped each other and scuffled again at
the tunnel leading to the locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   They were well-behaved Thursday night, although the Cuban
blocker Regla Torres glared at the Brazilians from across the net.
``I think there were problems, but those problems are nonexistent
now,'' said the Cuban captain, Regla Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil displayed marginally better form than Cuba going into
Thursday night's match, winning all five of its games in a week of
preliminaries. In those games, Brazil accumulated 395 points to its
opponents' 272, including a low-gear defeat of the U.S. team in
four sets. Cuba lost only to Russia in the round-robin
eliminations.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the 6-3 Torres, Cuba never trailed in the deciding fifth
game Thursday night, taking some drama out of the finish. ``It was
a hard game and both teams were very nervous,'' said Martenis
Costa, a Cuban attacker. ``We are used to winning and when we got
even with Brazil in the fourth set we felt confident we could
win.''

   CHENEY-PROFILE _ Troy, Mich. - No one is suggesting that Dick
Cheney is winning votes left and right with his stem-winding
oratory. The former Defense Secretary is so reserved that even when
he is on the attack, he peppers his remarks with ``if you will''
and ``it seems to me.'' The Cheney who is best at campaigning is
not Dick, but his wife, Lynne, who tries to humanize her husband
when she introduces him. (Sherman, The Altanta

   LIEBPROFILE _ ORLANDO, Fla. _ C-Span's cameras are rolling,

of television interviews via satellite. Kiki McLean, his press
secretary, interjects, ``You're on C-Span, sir.'' Lieberman is a

sprinkling Yiddish into his talks, always making sure to remind
listeners of the economic growth of the past eight years. (Sherman,

Luther King Jr. National Memorial, to be built in 2003 among the
cherry trees in the nation's Capitol want to erect a dramatic
entrance there made of Stone Mountain granite. Lotsa luck.It's not
a problem with the symbolism, in fact, there are probably dozens of
quarries and stone masonries in Georgia that would jump for the

 &HT;    Muslim `man of peace' to help Jews greet new year
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Jews in metro Atlanta and around the world begin their
holiest season of the year, one Atlanta congregation will be
hosting an unusual guest speaker: a Muslim sheik.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abu Saleh el Refai, a Sufi Muslim and spiritual leader of
Arabs living on the West Bank, will be the guest speaker this
evening at services sponsored by the nondenominational Shema
Yisrael, the Open Synagogue, at the Marriott Hotel at Century
Center, I-85 and Clairmont Road, beginning at 6:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after a profound religious experience, the sheik
opened the doors of his mosque in the Palestinian village of D'Ir
Qadis to Jews. The invitation to address a Jewish congregation in
Atlanta is a reciprocal gesture, said Jane Davis, a lay leader in
Shema Yisrael and founder of HOPE-HOWSE international, a nonprofit
human rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a walking man of peace,'' said Davis of the sheik, who
participated in the United Nations as part of the Millennium Peace
Conference of Religious and Spiritual leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The sheik called the opportunity to speak to a Jewish
congregation on Rosh Hashana ``a big gift from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year celebration, begins at sundown
today. For the next 10 days, Jews will mark the Days of Awe, which
end with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, on Oct. 9. It is a
period when many Jews reconnect with their faith, said Rabbi Arnold
Goodman of Ahavath Achim synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how far removed one may be from intense Jewish
observance, every Jew lives by the same calendar,'' he said.
``Observing our High Holy Days on days when the rest of society is
going about its regular business affirms our connection with Jews
the world over.''
</P>
<P>
   For information about Shema Yisrael High Holiday services, call
404-943-1100. Attendance is free, but reservations are required.

NORWEGIANS DO WHAT US DIDN'T THINK POSSIBLE: WIN   GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The Norwegians were still in shock from watching
Tiffeny Milbrett leap skyward and yank the Olympic gold medal from
their necks just before the referee blew the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our day,'' coach Per-Mathias Hagmo assured his charges
as they loosened their legs for overtime. ``We will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they did Thursday night at Sydney Football Stadium, as
substitute Dagny Mellgren pounced on a loose ball that had
ricocheted off her arm and slammed it home in the 102d minute for a
3-2 victory that ended the US soccer team's global reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Norwegian defender Gro Espeseth, after
her teammates had rallied to hand the stunned Americans their first
loss in a world-level tournament in five years. ``It's a magical
moment, that's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   For the US players, who were wandering numbed and tearful around
the pitch as their exuberant rivals did a victory lap, it was the
end of an era for a group who'd owned the planet since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen of them _ Brandi Chastain, Joy Fawcett, Julie
Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Carla Overbeck _ played on the
team that won the inaugural World Cup in 1991. Few, if any, are
likely to stick around for the next Cup in 2003 or the next
Olympics in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Last Roundup, and for most of the night it seemed
they would go out the way they came in nine years ago _ as
champions. The Americans hadn't lost a global match since the
Norwegians beat them in the 1995 Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   They were unbeaten in the 1996 Olympics, knocking out Norway in
the semis. They were unbeaten in last year's Cup, beating the
Chinese on penalty kicks in the final. And they were unbeaten here,
starting off with a 2-0 knockout of the Norwegians that easily
could have been 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamm walked into the box Thursday, strolled along the back
line, and tapped the ball to Milbrett for a gimme in the fifth
minute, it appeared the US was headed for a goalfest. ``I thought,
oh, no, not again,'' said Espeseth. ``Why should they win again and
again and again?''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans spent almost the entire first half in the
Norwegian end, just missing another goal in the 29th minute when
Foudy's header off a deflection dinged the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Had it gone in, the Norwegians might have come unglued. Instead,
they went to the dressing room reborn after Espeseth outleaped
defender Kate Sobrero and headed in Hege Riise's corner kick a
minute before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Americans were having the better of it as the second
half wore on. They had two lovely chances seconds apart in the 61st
minute, after a four-touch rat-a-tat in the area set up a blast by
Lilly that keeper Bente Nordby knocked down, leaving a rebound that
Foudy knocked back to Lilly for another shot, which defender Goeril
Kringen headed away diving across the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians were sitting back now, waiting for a long-ball
counter that might catch the Americans upfield. It came in the 78th
minute, and as keeper Siri Mullinix came charging off the line to
punch out the ball, Ragnhild Gulbrandsen outjumped Fawcett and
headed the ball past Mullinix and into the open goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rookie mistake by Mullinix, who had replaced Briana
Scurry this year after being cut from the Cup squad, and it looked
to have doomed the Americans as the minutes ticked down. But they
weren't playing that way. ``No chance this team is ever going to
give up,'' said coach April Heinrichs, ``until they tell us to get
off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the clock ran out, there were still a couple of
minutes of stoppage time. ``Two minutes is plenty,'' Heinrichs
said. Plenty of time for Hamm to run down the right side and loft a
cross for Milbrett, who leaped over three red jerseys and headed in
the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably one of my finest goals ever,'' said Milbrett. ``I
never score a goal like that. I'm 5-2. Definitely a dream goal.''
</P>
<P>
   And a horror for the Norwegians, who were less than 20 seconds
from the gold medal when the ball went in. ``It was terrible when
Tiffy scored,'' Espeseth said.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the end, only overtime. And here the Norwegians
had an edge in youth and freshness. Heinrichs had gone to her bench
only once, putting in Cindy Parlow as a third striker in the 69th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the Americans would be tired in the end,'' said Hagmo,
who inserted the 22-year-old Mellgren in the 83d minute and
Christine Boe Jensen for overtime. ``We had fresh legs to put
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans could never mount another rush. ``We just couldn't
step it up when we needed to,'' said Milbrett. The Norwegians
launched another long ball, this one from Riise from just inside
midfield _ and this one was fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett headed it out, but the ball bounced off Mellgren's left
arm and back toward the US goal. Mellgren dashed between Fawcett
and Sobrero and fired a shot that went under Mullinix's
outstretched hand. ``She got a finger on it,'' said Heinrichs.
``From my angle, I thought she just pushed it wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so. The Norwegians, who'd never won a team gold medal at a
Summer Games, mobbed Mellgren and each other. ``It's so much like a
dream,'' said Gulbrandsen. ``I didn't think it would end up like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Americans, who didn't know what a silver medal
looked like. ``You have to applaud Norway,'' said Foudy. ``They're
a class team. We have tremendous respect for them and what they've
done this whole decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians are the only team in the world that has a winning
record against the Americans. When they play, as they have 30 times
in the last 13 years, the difference is usually one goal. ``I hate
parity,'' Foudy said. ``Who wants parity?''

NO MERCY FROM THE SISTERS SLEDGEHAMMER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SYDNEY _ Venus pauses at the milky stripe, the baseline,
sensing, ``This is our moment. Me and Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   Then her left hand lifts and releases the yellow ball skyward.
For an instant it hangs in the air, like a mini-moon, before her
right arm and racket snap at it, jetting it on a diagonal, a rubber
missile whirring at 108 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, at the net, has just advised Big Sister to ``Serve an
ace!'' giggling, ``that's the way to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like an ace,'' Venus says to herself . . . but Kristie
Boogert somehow gets her racket on it to loft a desperate lob.
Moving beneath it, Serena peers at the ball in its descent and
decides not to let it live another instant, not even to let it
bounce. With a mighty overhead swipe, she crunches the concluding
shot of the 2000 Olympics, tennis precinct.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball, mistreated to the end of its usefulness by a
sisterly combination, bounds beyond the dazed Netherlands team,
Boogert and Miriam Oremans, Venus and Serena Williams joyously fall
into each other's arms and 10,000 onlookers applaud a historic
performance: siblings in concert digging gold from asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   If this had been a prizefight, a humane referee would have
stopped it after the first 20 minutes and seven games. But it was
an Olympic final, and the battering had to go on for another 29
minutes until the Sisters Sledgehammer had mauled the Dutchwomen,
6-1, 6-1, Thursday and Little Sister Serena was caught up in the
gold rush. No Olympic final since 1896 had been more one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   As the 3 1/2-hour warm-up act for the Sisters, Yevgeny
Kafelnikov was the first Russian to win gold, beating young German
Tommy Haas, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, a gold medal means more than Wimbledon or anything
else in tennis,'' said Kafelnikov. ``At 3-3 in the fifth I said to
myself, `You will never forgive yourself if you don't win it.' Gold
pulled me through.'' Starling Haas, No. 49, was delighted with
``unexpected silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours before, Venus had not been quite so
destructive in dancing down the yellow brick road in a country the
citizenry calls Oz. She needed 58 minutes to work over the
18-year-old Russian, Elena Dementieva, 6-2, 6-4, and scale the
victory podium for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will be even better to win one with Serena,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   US coach Billie Jean King said, ``Venus means it. They are
closer than any sisters I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it had been Venus who kept Serena out of King's
singles lineup by beating Little Sister in their emotional
Wimbledon semifinal. The three singles entrants were selected by
the computer then, and a victory for Serena would have shoved her
ahead of Monica Seles, who copped the bronze Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange being at a tournament and just playing doubles,''
Serena had said. But she wasn't along for the ride or to caddy for
Big Sister, who has fulfilled their father's prophecy of becoming
the planetary leading lady. Even if the computer is behind on that
subject, still listing Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport ahead
of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard to do my part so Venus and I can get it done.
We've been learning a lot about doubles from Billie Jean and Zina
(Garrison, assistant coach.)''
</P>
<P>
   They have a lot more to learn, which is fortunate for the
opposition _ colleagues nevertheless intimidated and endangered
just by being in the same rectangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been like two people playing singles instead of one
doubles team,'' said Serena, aware of their deficiencies, which
they overcome anyway with power, speed, and combativeness.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a work in progress it's Venus and Serena, so
raw, yet so rampaging. This was merely their 23d pro tournament _
and seventh title (three of them majors) _ winning 62 of 73
matches, the last 22 straight. Although out of position most of the
time, they lost but one set.
</P>
<P>
   King laughs, ``They'll get it. They're coachable. I'd say that
as a doubles team they're up to about 50 percent of potential. At
singles, Venus is 75 percent, Serena 65 percent. Wait'll they start
coming in more and volleying. And they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, shaking her head, ``I don't know how long
they'll stay interested. I hope it's a long time, to see what they
can accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, who turned 19 Wednesday, bubbles, ``We want to make a
Grand Slam in doubles. That's our next goal.'' Only one female team
has done that: Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what's happened to me,'' said Venus, ``is a miracle. I
look back to April when I hadn't played in months, and to be here
now with two gold medals and the rest (Wimbledon and US Open
titles) . . . it is hard for me to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   She was in the grip of tendinitis of the wrists, and her papa,
Richard Williams, was saying she should retire. Whether he was
trying to rouse her or was looking for a headline, the fact is that
Venus reappeared. But uncertainly. She split her first four
matches, got to the quarters of the French Open in early June, and
hasn't lost since. Unbeaten in 32 starts, six tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Winning 11 matches, singles and doubles, in 10 days, she became
the second woman to seize gold in singles and doubles, duplicating
Helen Wills Moody's 1924 feat. Moody's sidekick was her 37-year-old
mentor, Bostonian Hazel Wightman. Venus worried ``only that I might
pull a muscle or something, but we have good trainers and
therapists. Gotta lose someday, I suppose. Everybody does.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serena knocks off the last point, King leaps from her seat,
recalling her first glimpse of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 years ago. I was giving a clinic at the courts named
for me in Long Beach (Calif.), and her mom brought this skinny
10-year-old who was already taller than me. I told her she reminded
me of the great Althea Gibson, who had been my heroine. It's been
wonderful to watch her, and Serena, bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, the pioneering black champion of the US Open and
Wimbledon in 1957 who today is a reclusive 72-year-old, follows
what the sisters are doing and is really pleased, King said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters had made a 10-day trek, preceding the climb up
Olympus, seem a lark. Nobody was in their league. ``It is nice
playing for your country. Fantastic,'' said Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked so hard for this. The anthem, the roses, the medals
. . . I'd seen it on TV. But to happen to us . . . you want to hold
on to that. It might never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus beamed: ``To be up there beside my sister, my best friend,
was very, very good. It only lasts a minute but it was our
moment.''

MARION JONES BREEZES TO MORE GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Never, ever forget: There is a Them and an Us. Male,
female, makes no difference.
</P>
<P>
   We cheer for Them and admire Them and just plain marvel at Them
because they do what we can't, and never could, do. They do not
think like Us. They are not subject to the same pressures as Us.
Most of the time, they won't even acknowledge familiarity with the
word.
</P>
<P>
   So for Marion Jones there never was an issue. The world could
think whatever it wanted about her husband and his doping problems
and how they might affect public opinion of her. C.J. Hunter wasn't
going to run that 200-meter race. She was.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us just started training this year,'' she reminded Us
after demolishing the 200-meter field Thursday night to win her
second Olympic gold medal. ``This has been a dream of mine for a
lot of years, so to let one event in your life, as dramatic as it
might be, ruin that wouldn't be worth it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The race itself was a joke. The whole evening was a Marion Jones
showcase. She sashayed her way into the finals, and, once there,
pretty much embarrassed the other seven, breezing to victory in
21.84 seconds. Her margin of victory over second-place finisher
Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas was .43 seconds, the largest
gap between first and second place in this race since Australia's
Marjorie Jackson breezed home ahead of Holland's Bertha Brouwer in
Helsinki 12 Olympiads ago.
</P>
<P>
   If this were Greco-Roman wrestling, the race would have been
called three-quarters of the way through on the basis of ``grand
superiority.'' It if were Olympic baseball, they would have invoked
the ``10-run mercy rule.'' If Dick Vitale were doing the
play-by-play, he would have been screaming, ``Hey Pauline! Better
get a TO, Bay-bee!''
</P>
<P>
   The race was hardly worth analysis. She started well, came
blasting off the curve, and ran away from everybody. You could have
fit a city bus between her and the delightful Davis-Thompson, who
won her first Olympic individual medal in her fifth Olympics and
then charmed the world's media at the press conference. For the
34-year-old Bahamian, this silver was the equivalent of a gold. She
had no illusions about the possibility of defeating the greatest
woman sprinter alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did anyone else in the field. Down there in sixth place was
Australia's Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, who didn't get a medal but
had the thrill a day earlier of finishing ahead of a loping Jones
in a preliminary heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was good fun,'' she gushed. ``Marion was slowing down,
and I thought, `What the hell, I might as well win in my hometown.'
They gave me a photo of the finish, and I'll take it home and frame
it and tell my kids 20 years from now that mommy ran against her,
and I helped push her.''
</P>
<P>
   Though admitting that for her it's really a belt-notch,
``two-down-and-three-to-go'' affair, Jones did profess to a certain
amount of excitement over what she's already accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first Olympics,'' she pointed out. ``The other day
was the first time I actually touched a gold medal. This is the
second time I've actually touched a gold medal. It means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the goal remained five. Barely 15 hours after winning the
200, she was due at the track to help her relay team qualify in the
4 x 100 relay. There were serious questions about the Americans'
viability in that event. Then her focus would have to shift to
Friday evening's long jump. While no one doubted the US's
capability of qualifying in the 4 x 100, there were almost
undoubtedly going to be serious questions about their actual
chances of winning it. So it was possible she would go into the
long jump aware that the gold estimate might have to be scaled
down.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she allows negative thoughts to distract her, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking me about the relays, but I'm just taking it
day by day,'' she said. ``I'm just focusing on the long jump. I've
heard different things about the relays, but right now I'm
confident the US is going to be fine in the relays.''
</P>
<P>
   She was positively bubbly when discussing her chances in the
long jump, where she is all about raw talent, as opposed to
technique. Winning the long jump was always going to be a stretch _
in everyone else's mind, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident,'' she said. ``It was a great thrill for me to
go out and qualify on the first jump. That's not something I
normally do. I hope that this time tomorrow night you guys will be
talking about how well I jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   She says these things in a pleasant, matter-of-fact way,
antagonizing no one. In fact, perhaps the most amazing thing about
Marion Jones is that she has managed to win all these races and
make all this money and receive all this notoriety without having
the rest of her competitors wanting to drop her off a 10-story
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's incredible,'' saluted Gainsford-Taylor. ``She really is
an awesome athlete. I have a lot of respect for her. I admire her.
I've been out on the international circuit for 10 years, and I have
never met anyone any nicer. She's refreshing. There's such a thing
as a bad winner. She's a very good winner.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not a remotely normal human being, so don't even think
about telling your kids to eat their vegetables and say their
prayers and run their laps and think they might even remotely grow
up to be anything like her.
</P>
<P>
   Your kids and mine will always be one of Us. She is one of Them,
and even among Them, she is a higher order of being. Enjoy her. She
has been placed here to entertain us.

SEXUAL POLITICS: JOAN ALLEN TACKLES `THE CONTENDER'

 ART NOTE: Includes two color slides and black-and-white photos of
Joan Allen in scenes from ``The Contender.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 c.2000 Ivor Davis 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In her latest film, ``The Contender,'' Joan Allen plays a
senator nominated to fill an unexpired vice-presidential term. At
her confirmation hearings she has difficulty being taken seriously,
despite her obvious qualifications for the job.
 &HT;    Allen knows the feeling.
 &HT;    After all, even with back-to-back Oscar nominations to her
credit, she had to fight for her role in ``The Contender,'' which
will open nationwide on Oct. 13.
 &HT;    ``Several studios were prepared to spend $30 million on the
movie,'' says Allen, who was Oscar-nominated for ``Nixon'' (l995)
and ``The Crucible'' (l996), ``but they didn't want me attached.
They preferred Michelle Pfeiffer, Meryl Streep or Sigourney
Weaver.''
 &HT;    The low-key Allen lacks the box-office razzmatazz of a Pfeiffer
or a Weaver, so she got the part only because writer/director Rod
Lurie kept his promise to her, even though it forced him to sign on
with Dreamworks and work with a budget of less than $10 million.
 &HT;    The resulting film casts Allen as Senator Laine Hanson, with
Jeff Bridges as the flamboyant president and a barely recognizable
Gary Oldman as a sleazy congressman who, in an effort to derail
Hanson's nomination, dredges up allegations of a sexual scandal
which makes the Monica Lewinsky saga seem like a Sunday-school
picnic.
 &HT;    The central premise of the movie is a tough sell, to say the
least: The whole thing rides on the idea that a female nominee
would refuse to respond to charges that, during her long-ago
college days, she took part in sexual orgies _ even though she had
proof that the charges were false _ because she believed on
principle that one's private life has no place in politics.
 &HT;    The concept strains credibility, to put it mildly, but Allen is
such a solid actress that she manages to give it a semblance of
plausibility. Rarely has her innate believability, that quality of
unflashy, determinedly unglamorous ordinariness, worked more to her
advantage.
 &HT;    The irony, of course, is that it's exactly that quality which
has so far kept her from the studios' A-list. Her performances as a
distraught Pat Nixon in ``Nixon,'' as a wife accused of witchcraft
in ``The Crucible,'' as a stressed-out wife and mother in the 1970s
drama ``The Ice Storm'' (1998) and as a frustrated housewife in the
elaborate fantasy ``Pleasantville'' (1998) have charmed audiences
and critics alike, but the sense of realism she lends her roles
obscures the impressive acting chops it takes to make them
possible.
 &HT;    That may be about to change, however. Besides ``The Contender,''
Allen has another film already in the can, a drama filmed last year
and based loosely on the assassination of real-life Irish
journalist Veronica Guerin. They are her first films as a star,
rather than as a supportive co-star or a member of an ensemble.
 &HT;    ``It's called `When the Sky Falls,''' Allen says of the Guerin
biopic. ``She's called Sinead Hamilton in the film, and I had
finished it at the beginning of June.
 &HT;    ''`Contender' started in August,'' she adds, ``so I was glad to
have had that starring experience under my belt, (to know) what
it's like to have to go to work every day _ because, when you're
supporting, you have four or five days off in between. When you're
carrying a movie, you have to work a lot harder.''
 &HT;    Not that she's complaining, of course. Both roles are the kind
actresses kill for. The role of Senator Hanson was even written
expressly for her.
 &HT;    ``It's never happened to me before,'' she says with a laugh,
``and it probably won't happen again. But at least it happened this
time.''
 &HT;    When Lurie, then a film critic for Los Angeles Magazine, met
Allen at a critics-award event and told her that he was planning to
write a role for her, her reaction was a somewhat skeptical ``Oh,
great.''
 &HT;    But when she saw the script, the actress understood how well it
suited her.
 &HT;    ``The issue of privacy is very big with me,'' says Allen, who is
married to fellow actor Peter Friedman and has a year-old daughter,
Sadie. ``I'm a very private person, and I could relate to that
aspect of Laine's character a lot. Beyond that, there was a certain
strength or calm that I project, that I have naturally.
 &HT;    ``But I think the big difference is I'd never be able to respond
the way Laine did,'' Allen says, ``to stick to what she was able to
stick to and withstand that kind of constant assault. I'd
crumble.''
 &HT;    Or so she says _ the background of the 5-foot-10-inch, rail-thin
actress suggests that she doesn't crumble easily. Born of solid
Midwestern stock, she grew up in the small town of Rochelle, Ill. _
population 8,000 _ and, though she says she was desperately shy,
discovered acting when she failed to make the cheerleading squad.
 &HT;    ``I really treasure having had that experience,'' Allen says.
``It was a really grounded, simple way to grow up, the Midwest.
There's nothing very gushy about (Midwesterners). People are pretty
straightforward. People are kind of quiet _ you don't always know
what they're thinking.''
 &HT;    She attended Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, where
her friend John Malkovich introduced her to a new theater he had
gotten involved in. That theater wound up relocating to Chicago and
becoming the famous Steppenwolf, with Allen along for the ride as
of its second year.
 &HT;    ``John asked me if I wanted to do a play the summer between my
junior and senior year,'' she recalls. ``I went back reluctantly to
school for my senior year, and when I graduated I had a place to
act immediately.''
 &HT;    The big city was a shock after Rochelle, and she got an even
bigger one later on, when she moved to New York to pursue a stage
career which peaked with a Tony Award as Best Actress for ``Burn
This'' (1988) and a second nomination for ``The Heidi Chronicles''
(1989).
 &HT;    But she says that Rochelle is still what keeps her grounded.
Besides, her life in New York is scarcely the glitzy existence of a
movie star.
 &HT;    ``I walk around, I take the subway. I get recognized
occasionally, but I blend in a lot,'' Allen says. ``People will go,
`Did I go to high school with you? Did you grow up in Tucson?' I
get questions like that a lot _ they can't quite place my face.''
 &HT;    In an industry in which stars often complain about the glare of
the spotlight, Allen says that it's perfectly easy to avoid, at
least on her level.
 &HT;    ``I don't seek it out, for one thing,'' she says. ``Some people
like that aspect of the business. I choose not to live in Los
Angeles. I don't socialize. I support movies I'm involved with and
I'll go to events surrounding them, but I don't go out much to
premieres and things like that.
 &HT;    ``I'm not very visible, so I think people forget about me,''
Allen concludes. ``I don't really come to mind as somebody to want
to say much of anything about.''
 &HT;    That may change, given ``The Contender,'' ``When the Sky Falls''
and a TNT television miniseries, ``The Mist of Avalon,'' which
offers Allen the chance to play her first all-stops-out villain.
Due next year, it's a Camelot drama told from the women's point of
view, co-starring Anjelica Huston and Julianna Margulies. Allen
freely admits to chewing some scenery.
 &HT;    ``It was a blast,'' she says. ``I'm even more villainous than in
the book. I try to take over Camelot and kill Anjelica Huston with
a dagger. I cast evil spells.
 &HT;    ``Every day was like being on the playground,'' she says with a
laugh. ``We would just giggle. I had to do this spell where I had a
bird wing and was spitting in the fire, trying to cast a spell so

ARMSTRONG FACES CONTEST WITH THE CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Cancer couldn't knock him off his bike, at least not
for long. Then, about 10 days before he was to arrive here, ready
to hunker over his handlebars and fix his gaze on winning his first
Olympic medal, Lance Armstrong slammed headfirst into an oncoming
car, leaving him with a shattered helmet, crumpled bike, and
cracked vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   But what's a crack in the spine when the oncologists,
chemotherapists, an army of lab techs, and oceans of anxiety are
fading images in your rearview mirror?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just part of my job,'' said Armstrong, who has been pedaling
long enough now that he dismisses these unexpected road hazards the
way a cross-country truck driver factors in weather delays.
``Crashes are a part of what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The more important, more rewarding, and usually more successful
part of what Amstrong does will play out Saturday on the roads
around Olympus. The 29-year-old from Austin, Texas, who four years
ago was diagnosed with testicular cancer, will compete in the
Olympic cycling time trials, what amounts to a three-lap drag race
of some 29 miles (46.8 kilometers).
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Tour de France winner, who has conquered bigger
opponents in recent weeks and years, has only the clock to conquer
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one country _ I think it's Italy _ where the old
wives' tale about the cat is that he has more than nine lives,''
said Armstrong. ``I think the cat has something like 12 or 13
lives. So, I hope I'm an Italian cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was his typically grinding, persistent self Wednesday
when he made his 2000 debut on the road of the Rings, the grueling
148-mile road race. However, unlike the last two summers in the
hills and valleys of Provence, where he won consecutive Tours,
Armstrong finished 13th. He was well off the winning pace set by
longtime German rival Jan Ullrich, and was also behind fellow Yank
George Hincapie (eighth).
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it was harder than I thought it would be,'' said
Armstrong, who didn't consider himself among the favorites headed
into the race. ``I waited too long (to make a charge). But that's
the way races go.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the time trials will be almost a sprint. Every 90
seconds a racer leaves the starting line, sent charging around a
loop of some 10 miles that must be circled three times. The
hard-charging Armstrong figures he has a better crack at making the
medal stand in this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there was only one reason to come, and that's to
win,'' he said. ``I've been (to the Olympics) twice before, so I
didn't need to come for a vacation. I'd never been to Australia. I
see it's a really nice place for vacation, but it's not the reason
I came.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where he is, no matter how long the course or how big
the prize money, Armstrong races as much these days to celebrate
his recovery from cancer. By his example, he hopes he has
reaffirmed that hard work, determination, and a will to survive can
be transferred from the winding road to the often more arduous
hallways of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't wake up every day thinking that I want
to be an inspiration to somebody,'' he said. ``All I do is live my
life. When I had the illness, I fought the illness and I was
committed to getting better and leading a normal life _ to
returning to a life _ and I try to exemplify that even today, even
though it has been four years since my diagnosis. I think it is
better if I don't try too hard to be an inspiration; you just live
your life the way you want to live it, and if that is inspirational
to someone else, then that is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration wasn't the first thing that came to Armstrong's mind
the day he rounded the blind curve in Nice, France (where he now
lives with his wife and child), and barreled into the oncoming car.
Just behind was Team USA member Tyler Hamilton, from Marblehead,
Mass., who steered wide of the collision and pointed his bike for a
more welcoming nearby ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit the car . . . I assumed the worst,'' said
Hamilton, ``because the impact _ it was an amazing impact _ and it
was loud, so loud. I saw Lance lying there. I didn't think the
outcome was too good. If you saw his bike, you wouldn't believe the
shape he is in now.''
</P>
<P>
   The oncoming car was going too fast. Armstrong, trying to
maximize his speed, was hugging too much to the inside curve. When
all came to a standstill, Armstrong realized both parties were at
fault. And he needed medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclists used the driver's cell phone to call Armstrong's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could just give you an idea how quiet these roads are,''
said Armstrong. ``After the accident . . . we waited an hour and a
half for my wife to come and pick us up _ and she was the next car
to come by. It was just bad luck, in the wrong place at the right
time. It could have been a lot worse, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing potential catastrophe has become a familiar part of
the landscape for Armstrong. The cancer could have been worse. If
not for his helmet, and a little bit of luck, he figures the crash
could have finished what the cancer had started.
</P>
<P>
   But he's here, still pumping his legs like pistons, climbing
hills, still racing by all demons and dents. A dogged Texan in an
Italian cat's clothing.

&HT;     AIRLINE EXECUTIVES WARN CONGRESS ABOUT FLIGHT DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of American Airlines, Donald J. Carty,
warned Thursday that flight delays will worsen unless Congress
intervenes to limit the burgeoning number of flights at major
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Carty said an unprecedented demand for air travel is prompting
competing airlines to schedule too many morning and evening flights
in places such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston. The result:
delays, cancellations and lost baggage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should authorize a discussion among airlines to prompt
them to cut back on flights at peak hours until airport capacity
expands, he said. Anti-trust law bars such meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has got to give or the bad situation that exists is
going to deteriorate,'' Carty told the aviation subcommittee of the
House Transportation and Infrastructure panel. ``We need to be
using our airspace differently.''
</P>
<P>
   More runways and more airports also are needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick W. Smith, chairman and CEO of FEDEX Corp., said the
federal government needs to limit the number of flights at hub
airports at peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think this summer was bad,'' Smith said, ``next summer
is going to make this one look like a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints from irate fliers skyrocketed this past summer as
travelers faced the worst summer travel in years. In July, 30
percent of major airline flights were delayed, compared to a
typical late rate of 20 percent, according to the Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just damn near came to a halt this summer,'' complained
Rep. Steven T. Kuykendall, R-Calif., a member of the panel. ``
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the Transportation and
Infrastructure panel, said Congress is expected to vote next week
to provide $40 billion over three years to expand airports and
modernize air traffic control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the reason we have these delays is we don't have
an air traffic control system that enables us to fly safely in bad
weather,'' Schuster said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney E. Slater, secretary of the U.S. Department of
Transportation, told the panel that ``unacceptable airline delays
and cancellations'' were triggered this summer by record-level
passenger demand, bad weather, inoperable runways and aircraft
equipment problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said part of the solution is to send more planes to smaller
airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we need some additional capacity at major airports,
but we can make better use of regional airports,'' Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane F. Garvey, administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, which oversees the air traffic control system, said
in an interview that ``there is no silver bullet,'' to stop flight
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said the solution involves better scheduling at airports,
new technology and use of niche airports just for cargo flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the hubs that can solve this,'' Garvey said.
``You've got to have a network.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., blamed the airlines for delays
and said the carriers should be barred from scheduling too many
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are driving this and they are driving it in a way
that has cost billions of dollars of delays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., a member of the panel, said in an
interview that the answer is state-of-the-art air traffic control
and weather monitoring equipment and better communication to
passengers who are left in the dark when planes are delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be pushing information on people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John R. Thune, R-S.D., said one reason airline passengers
get so frustrated is they ``believe a lot of the time they are not
getting the straight scoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., suggested that the Federal Aviation
Administration place message boards in airports informing
passengers of weather delays before they have checked luggage and
gone through security.

B92: TRUE DEFENDERS OF THE FREE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
bc-DIGITAL-L.A.
cc,78p3  (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   For more than a decade, the radio station-turned-opposition
media conglomerate known as B92 has battled Serbian strongman
Slobodan Milosevic and his Yugoslavian government, pushing for an
end to the ultra-nationalist policies that helped fuel the ethnic
cleansing of Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Milosevic apparently losing in last week's
presidential elections, B92 may finally find some peace of its own.
At least that's the hope of Gordan Paunovic, the organization's
new-media director, who was recently in Los Angeles for the Digital
Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking forward to the day when we have a normal
political climate, and not wars,'' Paunovic said.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years, what started as a ragtag operation with an expired
temporary broadcasting permit and a '50s-era transmitter has grown
into a network of radio stations, a Web site (www.freeb92.com),
record company and more.
</P>
<P>
   For this election, ``the opposition used the Internet to educate
people to prevent manipulations on the day of the election,''
Paunovic said. ``There is no way Milosevic can win legally.
Milosevic is going to lose. The question is how.''
</P>
<P>
   The station's Web site had an entire section devoted to the
elections, making it easy for people to check whether they're
actually registered to vote, and in what town, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the latest noble effort by an organization that has
labored since 1989 to present ``unbiased, uncensored news unshaped
by the government,'' Paunovic said. ``We were really the first ones
in Yugoslavia to do that. And we got a tremendous response.''
</P>
<P>
   As unlikely as the organization's beginnings were, it started
with great hope as communism crumbled in Eastern Europe in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, two years later, war came and all the hopes were gone,''
Paunovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal ethnic conflicts of the next several years, fostered
by the pan-Serbian ambitions of the Milosevic regime, put B92 in a
difficult legal position, because the police could legally have
shut them down for broadcasting with an expired permit. But it
didn't happen, at least not immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got signs that the government was not very happy with what
we were doing,'' Paunovic said. ``But at that time they still
wanted to present themselves as open to free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the station was shut down in 1991 when it reported
on street clashes between anti-war protesters and police. When
protests then shifted to reopening the station, government
negotiators agreed, provided the station stopped broadcasting news
coverage, which it did temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, with the Dayton Peace Accords in place and
international trade sanctions lifted, B92 started the region's
first Internet service provider, in part to maintain contacts with
its network of correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet company ``promoted human rights, freedom of speech,
anti-war and peace activities. We gave free Net access to
practically everyone who believed the same as we did,'' Paunovic
said. ``The Internet is the last stand for freedom in the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, B92 was shut down again, and then its signal was
jammed. Fortunately, the station was just about to begin Webcasting
through Real Networks, instructing the few people with Net access
to print out B92 news reports for neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The station was shut again briefly when it reported the NATO
bombing was about to start. More recently and devastatingly, many
of B92's assets in Serbia were turned over to a
government-controlled entity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing seemingly everything, the organization soldiered
on, launching Radio Free 92 in May of last year. The Web site at
www.freeb92.net has no important assets based in Serbia, to protect
against further shutdowns and seizures. It also has begun a network
of stations just outside of Serbia. Asked why B92's workers
continue on despite years of government hassles, Paunovic shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our life,'' Paunovic said. ``It's not the money. We're
not underpaid, because the country as a whole is in such trouble.
But compared to the state-run media, it's nothing, it's peanuts.
But it's a huge passion.'' &QL;

IRENE PIERCE STIVER, 76; PIONEER IN PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Irene Pierce Stiver, a pioneer in the study of the
psychology of women, died of lung cancer Sunday in her home in
Newton. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stiver was the founder and former director of the department
of psychology at McLean Hospital in Belmont. She was also
affiliated with the Stone Center for the study of psychological
problems at Wellesley College. She was one of the pioneers of a new
clinical approach to psychology called the relational-cultural
theory.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stiver and her colleagues posit that the theory of human
development they had been taught _ which held that separating from
relationships and achieving autonomous selfhood was the pinnacle of
development _ did not fit their experience as women and as
therapists, or the experience of their women patients.
</P>
<P>
   They created a theory that underlines their belief that women's
relationships are part of their essence.
</P>
<P>
   It is a theory that puts ``mutual empathy'' at the center not
only of psychotherapy, but of women's development itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stiver was born in New York City. She graduated from
Brooklyn College and earned a doctorate at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   She began her career as an experimental psychologist. Her first
academic position was at Wellesley College as an assistant
professor of psychology.
</P>
<P>
   As her interest in clinical psychology grew, she accepted a
full-time position at McLean Hospital. She was promoted to director
of the psychology department at McLean in 1958 and also principal
associate in psychiatry (psychology) at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 she resigned from the hospital to pursue private
practice fulltime and to devote her energies to the work of the
Stone Center.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her husband, Ray B.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Conspire to arrive by ship. Like
Naples, like New York and Cape Town, Vancouver looks its best from
the water, its shiny glass towers rising like Xanadu against a
backdrop of indigo peaks whose foothills dip their toes in the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Morris, who has seen a city or two in her day, wrote that
Vancouver's setting, at the southwest corner of Canada, ``is better
than San Francisco's, because of the greenness, better than
Sydney's, because of the mountains all around, rivaled perhaps only
by Rio and Hong Kong.'' More than 40,000 newcomers take up
residence each year, and the Vancouver metropolitan area now boasts
a population of more than 2 million, third largest in Canada.
</P>

   Clean and leafy, blessed with a temperate climate marred only by
rainy winters, a model of municipal etiquette, Vancouver seems to
have it all. It is relatively crime-free; Vicky Gabereau, the host
of a nationally televised talk show originating here, said proudly,
``There's no place in town I wouldn't walk, day or night, unless I
was wearing a big diamond ring or planning to take my shirt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Vancouver may be isolated, but it is
nevertheless as cosmopolitan a city as any boulevardier could hope
for. A friend of mine who lives in Seattle, three hours south of
here, remarked that this city ``has a sexy beat, a kind of
skirt-swinging glamour'' that she finds missing from her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to live here,'' said Mike Harcourt, a former
mayor and provincial premier, and he may be right. The local papers
carried an article recently disclosing that Lloyd Axworthy,
Canada's foreign minister, planned to quit politics to run a think
tank at the University of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   John Nichol, a onetime senator in Ottawa, said he missed ``the
tang of the sea in my nostrils, the sense that everything beyond is
Asia'' when he left Vancouver. The city's other special quality, he
added, is its newness. ``Everyone in Vancouver is just out of the
bush, or almost,'' he said. ``There was nothing here, nothing at
all to speak of, just 80 or 90 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If Canada as a whole lives a calmer life than the United States
_ former Prime Minister Kim Campbell once famously described her
countrymen as ``decaffeinated Americans'' _ people in Vancouver are
even more laid-back. In summer the workweek tends to start about
noon on Mondays and end about noon on Fridays. Canadians who live
elsewhere call this region Lotusland.
</P>
<P>
   That implies, of course, a degree of disengagement from the
serious business of life, and it is true that Vancouver is full of
distractions: sailing in the sheltered waters that stretch from
here to Vancouver Island, skiing in Whistler, just 75 miles up the
Sea-to-Sky Highway, or simply gazing at the magnificent panoramas
outside one's office or apartment window. No point in fighting all
that, so in summer performing-arts groups move outdoors, offering
Shakespeare in a waterside park and Mozart in the Coast Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even loyalty to our professional teams can be fleeting,'' a
rabid local sports fan said, and that may be one big reason the
local heroes don't fare better. In Vancouver participating in
sports trumps watching them.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Canucks have never won hockey's Stanley Cup,
Canada's big prize. But the Canucks have one distinction: They sell
not only hamburgers and hot dogs at their games but sushi, too.
Waves of immigrants from Japan, India, Vietnam and especially Hong
Kong have given the city an Asian flavor.
</P>
<P>
   It has three Chinese-language daily papers and a
Chinese-language radio station. It eats dim sum _ excellent dim sum
_ the way New York eats corned beef. Exotic fruits like mangosteen,
longan and rambutan, rare or unavailable in the United States, are
sold by every greengrocer in town. By some estimates, almost a
third of the city's population has its roots in Asia, and more than
half the city's schoolchildren speak English as a second language.
</P>
<P>
   An Urban Forest
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Vancouver is situated on a thumb-shaped peninsula, with
water on three sides _ Burrard Inlet, which forms the harbor;
English Bay; and False Creek, which is neither false nor a creek.
(It's another inlet.) At the peninsula's tip is one of the city's
most remarkable features, Stanley Park, a 1,000-acre reserve, much
of it dense, natural forest, only a 15-minute walk from the heart
of downtown. Vancouver folk defend it as fiercely as New Yorkers
defend Central Park, resisting any incursion into their
``wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the park is only slightly younger than Vancouver
itself. As they began rebuilding after a disastrous fire in 1886,
the city fathers persuaded Ottawa to give them the land, once a
military reservation, for an urban oasis.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see how the city lives, join the crowds who visit
the park on weekends. Amid bronze-leaved Japanese maples and
ancient cedars whose corded trunks reach straight and tall to the
sky, Mr. and Mrs. Vancouver and their kids throng Stanley Park on
foot, in horse-drawn carriages, on bicycles, on in-line skates.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting there for them are rugby fields, a cricket pitch, tennis
courts, three beaches, a pool, a lake, a lagoon, a restaurant, a
fish-and-chips stand, a pitch-and-putt golf course, angling piers,
yacht basins, a rowing club, a lawn-bowling club, an aquarium with
8,000 marine creatures, a zoo, cormorants and seals posing on the
rocks at low tide, and not a scrap of litter. You'll find plenty of
that in the tacky Gastown area downtown, along with T-shirt shops
and mediocre restaurants, if you're misguided enough to go there.
</P>
<P>
   Don't. Stay instead in Stanley Park, and drink in the matchless
panoramas of sea and sky surrounding you. I'll bet you find it hard
not to gush. My wife, Betsey, noticed the motto on the license
plate of a parked car. ``Beautiful British Columbia,'' it said.
``They don't lie,'' Betsey said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil Loveliness
</P>
<P>
   After Stanley Park head to Chinatown. Actually, Vancouver's
Chinese population has grown so much that it now fills four
Chinatowns; you want to visit the original one, which stretches
along Pender Street. One building there bears the date 1889. But
Nathan Fong, a writer and food stylist who walked through the
crowded street markets with us _ pointing out unfamiliar items like
whole lotus roots, and one or two that even he did not recognize,
like a globular fruit called santol _ said that things had changed
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I used to walk here with my parents and grandparents
about 25 years ago,'' he said, ``we always saw people we knew. But
not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood beauty spot is Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Garden
and the adjacent park, which reproduce exactly the tranquil
loveliness of the famous gardens of Suzhou in China. Rugged objects
(weirdly weathered limestone rocks) are contrasted with gentler
ones (waterlilies). Contorted miniature pines line pebble walkways.
Thousands of crates of building materials were shipped from China
to ensure authenticity, and no nails, screws or power equipment
were used.
</P>
<P>
   Near Main and Pender, the Times Square of Chinatown, there are
dozens of restaurants. Small shops like Dollar Meat that sell
uncooked as well as barbecued ducks and lamb reminded me of similar
places in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, except that these are spotlessly
clean: No flies, no dogs. Other stores sell dried fish like
pomfret, dried mushrooms and other wrinkly things.
</P>
<P>
   Quails filled the window of one poultry dealer. A single farmer
in the Fraser Valley south of Vancouver, Fong told us, raises
25,000 quails a week, mostly for Chinese gourmands in the Vancouver
area.
</P>
<P>
   The great surge in Chinese immigration was caused by political
uncertainty in Hong Kong in the 1980s and early '90s. Some wealthy
Chinese hedged their bets, staying on in Hong Kong and building two
or three houses in Vancouver as investments (and possible future
refuges). But the successful hand-over of the former British colony
to Beijing calmed a lot of nerves and kept many Chinese at home.
Vancouver people no longer talk quite so much about Hong Kouver.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver is named for Capt. George Vancouver of the British
navy, who explored Burrard Inlet in 1792. But it was the coming of
the Canadian Pacific Railway, which decided in 1884 to make this
its transcontinental terminus, that ensured the city's future.
Shipping is a major business here; looking across to Asia,
Vancouver is Canada's principal port. Timber from the heavily
wooded hinterland has been a major business from the earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   New lines of work have developed in recent decades. Tourism is
one, stimulated by Vancouver's beauty, the quality of its food
(especially in the Asian restaurants, which may be unmatched in
North America) and its convenience as a jumping-off place for
Alaskan tours. Environmental research, software and other
technologically based companies also generate thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity at Work
</P>
<P>
   On Granville Island in the center of the city you can see the
creativity of Vancouver at work. A group of shabby warehouses and
derelict factories has been converted into studios for glass
blowers, potters, weavers, quilters and the like; only the best,
chosen by a jury, are granted space. A rope factory nearby has been
transformed into a public market selling everything from classic
French stocks to Korean sweet-potato noodles to dolmas to fish,
fish, fish and more fish. The island has quickly become one of the
city's favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprisingly, Vancouver has become a film capital.
Hollywood producers and homegrown auteurs as well have made movies
a billion-dollar-a-year business in Vancouver, and the long white
trailers of the crews are a familiar sight on local streets. Robert
Altman was one of the first directors to discover the low costs,
high skills and photogenic land- and cityscapes hereabouts; he made
``McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' here in 1970, and dozens of other films
have followed. Recently much of ``The X-Files'' was filmed here.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the traffic as been one-way; the actors Michael J.
Fox and Jason Priestley, to name just two, are local boys who
migrated south.
</P>
<P>
   Hipsters' Hangout
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada when you don't fit in where you grew up, you come to
Vancouver,'' said Tom Rowe, one of the partners in the
film-producing Sextant Entertainment Group. ``There is tolerance
and freedom here, which has an impact in the film business and
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Like writing. Douglas Coupland, a local novelist, coined the
expression ``Generation X'' in his 1991 novel of that name, and
William Gibson, who lives here, too, gave the word ``cyberspace''
to the language in his 1982 short story ``Burning Chrome.'' W.P.
Kinsella wrote a novel, ``Shoeless Joe,'' about that game they play
across the border; it became the film ``Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And like the counterculture. Vancouver was full of hippies 40
years ago, and there are still quite a few around. You see more
sandals here, summer and winter, than you do in most cities.
Sophie's Cosmic Cafe in Kitsilano is a reminder that that
now-gentrified area was once the hipsters' hangout. There is also
weed, known here as ``B.C. Bud.'' Marijuana-growing and
marijuana-smoking are widespread. Last May hundreds of people
gathered for a ``smoke-in'' on the steps of the Vancouver Art
Gallery. The police ignored them, and support is growing for
legalization among politicians and newspaper columnists.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt, the former mayor, has been wrestling since he was a
long-haired storefront lawyer in the 1960s with what he called
``our major challenge: how to handle the inevitable growth without
losing the city's soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Having helped to block the building of a proposed waterfront
freeway, as well as the bulldozing of old, characterful
neighborhoods, Harcourt became an apostle of rapid transit, green
zones and wilderness reserves to limit the paving-over of farmland.
One consequence has been increasing urban density, typified by a
forest of steel-and-glass skyscraper apartment blocks along False
Creek in central Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But congestion, especially traffic congestion, remains a
problem, and now officials here and across the border are working
on a comprehensive growth-control strategy for the basin stretching
hundreds of miles from here to Olympia, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur C. Erickson is Vancouver's big architectural kahuna, one
of a triad of Canadian stars, along with Israeli-born Moishe Safdie
(designer of Vancouver's elliptical, technologically advanced,
hugely popular new library, which draws 8,000 visitors a day), and
Frank O. Gehry, whose worldwide practice is based in California. An
apostle of Le Corbusier, Erickson designed the Canadian Embassy on
Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   For his hometown Erickson, 76, has produced a Sikh temple,
several office buildings, most of Simon Fraser University in nearby
Burnaby and Robson Square, the focal point of downtown Vancouver.
There he reworked an old courthouse, now the Vancouver Art Gallery,
which augments its small collection of modern Canadian art with
traveling shows, and created a three-block-long mall. Ferragamo,
Vuitton, Dunhill and other chic-eries cluster around it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Justice for All
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the mall, Erickson placed the Law Courts, one
of his key works. Conceived as the antithesis of traditional court
buildings, which are often dark and forbidding, it is dominated by
a vast, airy, welcoming atrium, which is covered by a sloping
glass-and-tubular-steel roof and heavily planted with vines and
shrubs. Justice, it says, is available to all.
</P>
<P>
   The other must-see Erickson building is off to the west. (It is
on the West Side of town, not to be confused with the West End or
with West Vancouver.) At the University of British Columbia he
adapted the post-and-beam construction methods of the aboriginal
Indians for a Museum of Anthropology that displays a comprehensive
collection of their evocative art, some of which bears an uncanny
resemblance to that of the Marquesas Islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes baskets, textiles, jewelry and wooden
sculptures of ravens, otters and bears. Its high point, however, is
the largest grouping anywhere of totem poles, those magical,
towering objects carved for thousands of years by the coastal
tribes. They stand in a Great Hall, formed by a series of enormous
reinforced concrete trusses and sheathed in glass on one side.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away is the Van Dusen Botanical Garden: 55 acres with
7,500 unusually clearly labeled plants from around the world that
thrive in Vancouver's relentlessly benign climate. The magisterial
conifers, grouped by genus, are particularly notable; among them
are sequoias and cedars, firs and pines and spruces of the types
that clothe the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Beachhead for the Arts
</P>
<P>
   The performing arts have established a solid beachhead in
Vancouver. Less than five years old, Ballet British Columbia has
flourished under the leadership of John Alleyne. The Vancouver
Opera suffered a big setback in 1988 when poor attendance at some
of its arcane offerings, like works by Leos Janacek, caused the
Briton Brian McMaster to quit as general director. But it
recovered, and it will offer four productions this season,
including Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1919, the Vancouver Symphony was dealt an even harder
blow in 1988; out of money, it was forced to suspend operations.
But Romanian-born Sergiu Comissiona rebuilt it in a nine-year stint
as music director. He will be replaced this fall by Bramwell Tovey,
a young Englishman who is identified with choral works and new
music.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Millerd's Arts Club Theater Company, based on Granville
Island, will stage eight Canadian and foreign plays this fall,
including Yazmina Reza's ``Art'' and Martin McDonagh's ``Cripple of
Inishmaan.'' To the irritation of some chauvinists, the Vancouver
Playhouse does fewer Canadian plays; next door, the Queen Elizabeth
Theater is host to touring musicals and rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most successful of Vancouver's theatrical
efforts is Bard on the Beach, an annual festival in a red-and-white
tent in Vanier Park that stages Shakespeare against the
ever-stirring backdrop of water and mountains. It began in 1990
with one play and a budget of $25,000. This summer, with a $1.2
million budget, the festival staged 146 performances of three
plays, including a rousing ``Henry IV, Part 1,'' with Duncan
Campbell, a star for years at Stratford, Ontario, as Falstaff; and
his son, Torquil, as Prince Hal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've touched a nerve, I guess,'' said Christopher Gaze, an
Anglo-Canadian actor who founded the company and still leads it.
``We played to 96 percent capacity last year. We're affordable,
accessible and out of doors, which is what this city wants. We
struggled a little, but then the support came _ whumpf! _ like a
forest fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonders by Rail and Boat
</P>
<P>
   Given good weather, the call of the wild can be irresistible in
Vancouver, even for sedentary souls like Betsey and me, and you
don't have to rent an ocean kayak or a mountain bike to explore the
city's glorious surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   One easy way to do it is by taking a steam train, the Royal
Hudson, which puffs up the coast to the logging town of Squamish
most mornings in summer, snaking past waterfalls and mammoth
Douglas firs, clinging at times to cliffs 100 feet above the sea.
The return trip, made by boat, is no less spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   A scenic 90-minute ferry ride across the Strait of Georgia,
winding through the rocky, conifer-shrouded Gulf Islands, will
deposit you (and your rental car, which is well-nigh indispensable)
on 350-mile-long Vancouver Island, which shields the city from the
Pacific. Victoria, the trim little provincial capital, is the best
place to head for first.
</P>
<P>
   Not so very long ago, I'm told, Victoria was pure, provincial
Victoriana. Morley Safer, the Canadian-born CBS correspondent,
remembers arriving one afternoon in the 1960s at the vine-covered
old Empress Hotel and discovering a the dansant in progress, with
music by Billy Tinkle and his Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Victoria is much less sedate. Betsey and I spent a Sunday
morning in one of the many hotels that circle its landlocked
harbor, reading the newspapers, eating breakfast and watching the
tiny local ferries scuttle back and forth like cockleshells,
dwarfed by the big Seattle boat. Seaplanes came and went, kayaks
slid silently past, and handsome yawls heeled in the wind. Best of
all, it happened to be the day of the annual Chinese dragon boat
races, with 20 oars flailing away on each canoe and a drum booming
a steady cadence.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant summer flowers filled every pot, every hanging basket
and every bed around the harbor, all as carefully tended as a
dowager's coiffure. But the truly amazing displays are at Butchart
Gardens, a half-hour north.
</P>
<P>
   There, in and around an old limestone quarry, we encountered
millions of roses, billions of dahlias, trillions of tuberous
begonias, some as big as a softball, and zillions of Japanese and
Chinese tourists. I exaggerate, but not much. Every spring the
gardens import 135,000 flower bulbs from the Netherlands, and every
summer evening bushes and blossoms are lighted by thousands of
lights linked by 11 miles of hidden wiring. It is a show worth
crossing a continent to see.

<P>
   &UR; By R.W. APPLE Jr. &LR;  &QC;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel
information, about Vancouver, with prices in U.S. dollars ($1
equals $1.49 Canadian):
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS, 791 W. Georgia St., (604) 689-9333. Canada is
justly proud of this Toronto-based chain, and Vancouver has no more
prestigious address. Guests can avail themselves of an
indoor/outdoor pool and a 165-shop mall that leads off the swanky
lobby (with Birger Christensen and Prada as bait for the unwary).
From the upper floors sweeping vistas open across the harbor to the
mountains. But guest rooms are a bit dowdy, and service is
disjointed. Double rooms: $302.58 to $383.27.
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN, 645 Howe St., (604) 687-1122. Built as a Mandarin
hotel, the Metropolitan retains that group's understated elegance,
and in Diva, it has one of the city's best dining rooms. Blond
wood, ribbed silk and chrysanthemum prints evoke Asian tradition;
business-class rooms with Frette robes, ergonomic chairs and
computer printers plant the Met firmly in the 21st century. This is
the kind of hotel where the staff knows your name before you check
in. Double rooms: $218.50 to $285.80
</P>
<P>
   PAN PACIFIC, 300-999 Canada Place Way, (604) 662-8111. Part of
Canada Place, where the big cruise ships dock, the 504-room Pan
Pacific juts into the harbor beside the five white sails that have
become the city's architectural trademark. Glass walls in the
three-story lobby take full advantage of the site; guest rooms,
trimly furnished in bird's-eye maple, offer hypnotic views. Squash
courts and a running track; expensive and worth every penny. Double
rooms: $310 to $365.
</P>
<P>
   SUTTON PLACE, 845 Burrard St., (604) 682-5511. The choice of
many a sophisticated traveler, this was once the property of the
French-owned Meridien chain, and it still feels more European than
North American. Guests are greeted by antiques, marble floors,
lavish floral displays and a friendly front-desk team, and the 397
rooms show a similar attention to detail. An adjacent, connected
building offers condominiums for rent by the week. Double rooms,
$180.90 to $288.50.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   BISHOP'S, 2183 W. Fourth Avenue, (604) 738-2025. John Bishop
turns no somersaults and chases no fads. His food is simple and
straightforward, marked by clear flavors, bright colors and
combinations that work _ grilled salmon with a ginger glaze; seared
scallops in a red pepper and chive bisque, topped with a potato
galette; halibut on a warm potato salad. The service is suave,
personal, polished. This is a restaurant that will thrive for
years.
</P>
<P>
   C, 2-1600 Howe St., (604) 681-1164. The C stands for
contemporary and for sea, which nicely sums up this glass-and-steel
pavilion hard by False Creek, just across from Granville Island. In
winter it's best at night; in summer go at midday, sit on the
terrace and watch the world go by, in kayaks, on in-line skates and
on bicycles built for two. The blue-plate lunch, for a mere $11 a
head, includes a refined tomato bouillon, five plates of light,
delectable seafood dim sum, and a few sweet tidbits. Top wines from
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   LE CROCODILE, 100-909 Burrard St., (604) 669-4298. Michel Jacob
named his restaurant for the three-star classic in his hometown,
Strasbourg, and there are always Alsatian dishes on the menu, like
onion tart and pheasant on sauerkraut. They are impeccably cooked,
like everything else here, including liver with onions, and
sweetbreads with Calvados. This is a place to savor the fondly
remembered flavors of yesteryear; Proust would have adored it.
</P>
<P>
   KIRIN MANDARIN, 1166 Alberini St., (604) 682-8833. Vancouver's
best northern Chinese food, served by uncommonly gracious waiters
in a bright, postmodern room. Suggestions: among the dim sum, the
deep-fried prawn and yellow chive roll; among the big dishes, half
a Peking duck, served in two courses: the sensationally crisp skin
with scallions, pancakes and a very light hoisin sauce, followed by
the duck meat steamed with cabbage and mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   LUMIERE, 2551 West Broadway, (604) 739-8185. Rob Feenie is
Vancouver's culinary phenom, and his welcoming restaurant has been
chosen as the city's best for two years running. A typical summer
dish: tiny slices of lightly seared salmon, served cold atop a
granita made of celery juice, ponzu and shiso. Four tasting menus
are offered nightly; I'd be happier if there were a la carte
dishes, too.
</P>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, 244 E. Georgia St., (604) 682-5777. A Chinatown hole
in the wall with irresistible Cambodian and Vietnamese food,
including crunchy, garlicky deep-fried spot prawns; cold chicken
and cabbage salad and a sour fish soup with chilis, pineapple,
purple basil and waterlily stems, deemed ``out of this world'' by
Mrs. A. Five copious dishes, two beers, two Cokes: $45.
</P>
<P>
   PICCOLO MONDO, 850 Thurlow St., (604) 688-1633. A small, serene
realm of Old World courtesy, this is one of the city's hidden
treasures. George Baugh and Michele Geris, husband and wife,
soft-spoken and able, serve zephyr-light pastas and definitive,
mahogany-dark osso buco. With which, praise the Lord, one can drink
attractively priced 10-year-old red wines from the likes of Bruno
Ceretto, Angelo Gaja and Monte Vertine. Just try that in New York.
</P>
<P>
   SUN SUI WAH, 3888 Main St., (604) 872-8822. Marvelous dim sum
and a lot more in a squeaky-clean room designed by Bing Thom, a
leading Vancouver architect. The gentle flavors of the best
Cantonese cooking prevail here, and the XO sauce, all the rage at
the moment, is as good as any on the continent. Ask Allan Yung, the
knowing manager, for guidance; but don't miss the tripe, squab and
ham sui gok (deep-fried dumplings made from glutinous rice.)
</P>
<P>
   TOJO'S, 202-777 West Broadway, (604) 872-8050. Reserve a seat at
the counter; watching Hidekazu Tojo work, seeking his counsel and
laughing at his (bad) jokes is integral to the experience. The BC
roll (``inside out'' salmon skin) is the trademark, but the
seasonal specials are better. Sablefish in broth with sliced pine
mushrooms, served in a bowl covered with parchment, thrilled us. So
did halibut cheeks and citrus-cured albacore.
</P>
<P>
   VIJ'S, 1480 W. 11th Ave., (604) 736-6664. On the menu at Vikram
Vij's animated, clean-lined restaurant, tucked behind a shiny black
Art Deco facade just off Broadway, it says ``curry art.'' At the
peak of their season, he chooses perfectly ripe mangoes and
combines them with acidic tomatoes in a Gujarati sauce spiked with
cumin. Slimline lamb chops (``popsicles'' in Vij-speak) are bathed
in a red curry rich in fenugreek. Even the rice (basmati) is
noteworthy, as is Vikram Vij's attention to his clients. No
reservations.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   After a cold dawn with areas of frost and valley fog, abundant
sunshine will bathe the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states.
Despite the sunshine, afternoon temperatures will be several
degrees below normal.
</P>
<P>
   Variable clouds and showers will linger over Florida as gusty
breezes from the east draw moisture inland. Farther north, sunshine
will be plentiful in the Southeast. The afternoon will be warm with
comfortable humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Warm winds from the southwest will deliver unseasonable warmth
from the Plains into the northern Mississippi Valley and Great
Lakes states. Sunshine will be ample in these regions.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy clouds and showers will occur near the central Rockies,
although most of the interior West will be warm and dry. Meanwhile,
clouds and periods of rain will arrive in western Washington.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FROST ABOVE FREEZING &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast early Friday and Saturday, the first frosts of
autumn will occur in some locations where the temperature remains
above freezing. Official thermometers are placed five feet above
the ground. On a clear and calm night when the winds are light, the
air at the ground cools rapidly as it radiates energy to space. As
the night goes on, the layer of cold air gets deeper, but the
coldest, and as a result the densest, air hugs the ground. The
difference between the temperature near the ground and the official
air temperature can often be more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN `BIG BROTHER' FORMAT, NICE IS NOT ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Skedded as TV-WEEKEND)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching ``Big Brother'' has been as exciting as watching
vegetables grow. More precisely, it has been as exciting as
watching people put together a jigsaw puzzle, one of the many inane
tasks assigned to the 10 contestants who agreed to live in a house
for three months with cameras on them 24 hours a day. You may be
wondering why producers would even imagine that seeing people set
up dominoes or ride a stationary bike would create dynamic
television, but it turns out that such stupid human tricks are not
to blame for the show's failure.
</P>
<P>
   Similar tasks have been used in the 10 other versions of ``Big
Brother'' around the world, and they have still become hits as the
franchise has spread from the Netherlands through Germany to Spain.
What's wrong with us? Or is the United States the only ``Big
Brother'' to get things right, philosophically, even if that
philosophy has meant stultifying television?
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between our ``Big Brother'' and the others
is bland niceness. Other countries' contestants sniped at one
another, had sex, created drama. The Americans acted as if they
were in some celibate, selfless commune and just happened to be
wearing body mikes. They are walking, talking symbols of the
sensitive, Oprah-ization of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's live, hourlong finale (8 p.m. on CBS) will reveal which
of the three remaining contestants has won $500,000. (The others
were tossed out, one by one, by viewers who phoned in votes at 99
cents a call.) But the truer cultural revelation has been shaping
up for weeks. The CBS ``Big Brother'' veered away from sensational
chair-tossing television and displayed how Americans want to think
of ourselves _ good-natured and noncompetitive _ which is not
necessarily what we really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' should have been the ultimate in living life for
the camera, with a half-hour of filmed excerpts five nights a week,
an hourlong live show weekly and 24-hour Web casts presenting what
the television versions did not. Every other week, contestants
voted on which two (or more) of them would be nominated for
expulsion; that meant they had to play to each other. But they also
had to play to the television audience. The potential for mind
games, poses and strategies makes ``Survivor'' look like a day at
the circus.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Big Brother'' is the anti-``Survivor,'' and its weaker
ratings are just the start. It is a commercial disappointment. CBS
has tried to spin this by noting how much ``Big Brother'' ratings
have improved over last summer's programs, but last summer CBS
presented reruns, not this hugely hyped event.
</P>
<P>
   The casting was timid; people in the European houses were on the
average younger and more daring. Then there was the dreadful
editing. Viewers were often dropped into the middle of confusing
conversations, then could spend excruciating minutes watching
someone nail up letters spelling ``Happy Anniversary'' and watching
someone else correct his spelling.
</P>
<P>
   These failures hurt, but the real problem was the group's sense
of community. Viewers of ``Survivor'' loved its intrigue, as
Richard Hatch plotted his success. The cast members of ``Big
Brother'' think strategy is a dirty word; they say that ``the
experience,'' as they so sensitively call it, is more important
than money.
</P>
<P>
   BLANDNESS PAID OFF
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the audiences seem to have bought this psychobabble.
The most confrontational contestants were the first to go, starting
with Will. The only black man in the group, he determinedly stirred
up intense conversations about race. The manipulative and
self-absorbed Jordan, a former stripper, went next. The most
successful contestants used blandness as protective cover. (Whether
it was calculated or because they couldn't help it, we may never
know).
</P>
<P>
   The producers will reveal little about the voters, except to say
they form a small percentage of total viewers. Whether the voters
are typical or not, they have placed two of the most agreeable
personalities among the three finalists, all of them men in their
20s.
</P>
<P>
   Josh, originally cast as the womanizer, has turned out to be
meek. It was news on the Web this week when two members of the
Italian ``Big Brother'' had sex. In England, after a flirty woman
called Mel was voted out, that Web site wrote, ``Sex kitten's
memory lives on.'' Here the attitude seems to be, ``No sex, please,
we're CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Josh almost kissed Brittany, the sometimes pink-haired,
sometimes green-haired self-proclaimed virgin. ``The reason I don't
want to kiss you is because I like you,'' he said, saving himself
for a meeting with her outside the house. This sincere
self-restraint can't be what the producers hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Another finalist is Curtis, a law school graduate whose every
comment is followed by a big infectious laugh that saves him from
ever seeming harsh. The producers tried to stir up trouble. In the
so-called Red Room, where contestants talk directly to the camera
and name their candidates for expulsion (out of earshot of their
housemates), the disembodied voice of Big Brother asked, ``Are you
nominating Josh because he's competition for you?'' Curtis said,
``I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the earnest Cassandra (voted out three weeks ago) was
asked a similar question about whether she was strategizing, she
stomped out of the Red Room and said, ``I'm so insulted.'' A common
refrain in the group was, ``I'd nominate myself if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   A REBELLION THAT FIZZLED
</P>
<P>
   The only finalist who has been direct about wanting to win the
contest is Eddie, a straightforward New Yorker who lost a leg to
cancer when he was a boy. ``As much as they say it may be about the
`experience,' it's about money,'' he told the Red Room camera. But
with the slightest nudge he agreed when his self-abnegating
housemates suggested a mass walkout.
</P>
<P>
   That loony attempt at rebellion isn't up there with the Boston
Tea Party, but it was the series' high point. For a day or so it
was satisfying to watch as the producers nearly lost control of
their show. The revolt was started by George, a roofer in his 40s,
who seemed like a sane family man at first. Soon, he was letting
Brittany dye his hair green, and Jamie, a would-be actress who won
the Miss Washington USA pageant, try out her makeup on him. George
inexplicably wore a toga on the night he was voted out; like so
many of his attempts at humor, the get-up was baffling.

 &HT;    PROPOSED LAW COULD HELP BELEAGUERED ONLINE MUSIC COMPANIES
 &HT;    EDs: This story does not carry a dateline
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bill filed this week in the U.S. House could make the world a
much easier place to do business for some beleaguered online music
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Music Owners' Listening Rights Act of 2000, the bill
would allow companies to store and transmit music over the Internet
to users anywhere in the world without violating copyright laws _
as long as the listener could prove they had already purchased the
music.
</P>
<P>
   A listener who wants to hear their entire CD collection while
traveling or at their office, for example, could do so without
taking their CDs with them simply by logging on to an online music
site.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gets at the crux of a lawsuit filed by the recording
industry against online music pioneer MP3.com Inc. Three weeks ago,
a federal judge ruled that MP3.com willfully violated copyrights
held by Universal Music Group, setting the stage for what could be
$118 million or more in damages. Universal claims that MP3.com
illegally made digital copies of its CDs and then let users who
could supposedly prove they own the CDs access them anywhere
through its ``My.MP3.com'' service.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., who sponsored the bill, said he did so
because he thinks current copyright laws don't adequately address
services like MP3.com's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are facets of copyright laws that were written for an
earlier era that apply very awkwardly in the Internet era,'' said
Boucher, co-chair of the Internet Caucus, a group of lawmakers who
focus on technology issues. ``They shackle the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   A Universal spokesman did not return a reporter's phone call
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to members of Congress, leaders of groups
representing record labels, movie companies and musicians urged
them not to pass the bill because it would deprive artists of
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said that wasn't the cause, however, because Internet
listeners would have to prove they already bought a piece of music
before they could listen online.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of MP3.com, the copyright owners have already been
paid,'' when the listener bought the CD, he said. ``They don't show
a loss, but MP3.com can't go forward with its business.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other record labels have already settled copyright cases
with MP3.com. Universal is working on a service similar to
MP3.com's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the ulterior motive of Universal is to sue
(MP3.com) out of business so they can have the business all to
themselves,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com on Thursday started what it calls a ``Million Email
March'' asking users to urge Congress to support the bill. Its
introduction also is proof that MP3.com's newly hired lobbying team
in Washington is working. In introducing the bill, Boucher cited a
survey paid for and provided by MP3.com that shows that more than
70 percent of frequent Internet users support business models such
as MP3.com's.
</P>
<P>
   With only about two weeks left in the current Congress, it's
highly unlikely that lawmakers will take any action on the bill
this year. But Boucher said when Congress reconvenes in January,
he'll re-introduce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I introduced it now just to begin the conversation and to
educate the members of Congress that there are ... provisions in
the current copyright law that will impede the growth of the
Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the bill won't likely help MP3.com with its short-term
legal battles _ a federal judge in November is expected to
determine damages in the Universal Music lawsuit _ it could make a
big difference when MP3.com appeals the case, as it has said it
will do.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsoring the bill, HR5275, are Reps. Richard Burr, R-N.C.,
Ray LaHood, R-Ill. and Fred Upton, R-Mich.

 UNDATED: was baffling.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month, George misread the fine print in the contestants'
contract with ``Big Brother,'' and decided that if the remaining
six members walked out together they would share the prize money.
(The runner-up gets $100,000 and the third-place finisher $50,000.)
He was convinced that this was the secret intent of the producers
all along, the hidden message those European ``Big Brother'' houses
had failed to get: teamwork and brotherhood. He even convinced
Eddie to go along. The rebellion collapsed when the producers
explained that no one would get anything if they all walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that they all walked in because they were
willing to trade their privacy for the possibility of fame and
$500,000. Still, it's easy to see why this misguided idea of unity
appealed to them. They had been isolated from contact with the
outside world for two months; they had become increasingly
suspicious of the producers; they were intensely aware of the
cameras. Brittany, interviewed on the show after she had left the
house, explained how conscious everyone had been of the producers'
attention. ``Once you say something they think is important, you'd
hear `Whrrr,''' as the hidden camera zoomed in.
</P>
<P>
   UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   How much of the contestants all-for-one attitude was genuine?
How much was smart posturing for each other and the public? How
much was the delusional result of having been in captivity?
</P>
<P>
   They're not letting on. The recently expelled contestants have
continued to gush about their terrific ``experience.'' Jordan has
griped that the editing made her look bad, but she was sent home so
early it's impossible to separate her bitterness from sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointment of this ``Big Brother,'' CBS may try
another, this time with a more volatile cast. Americans can create
reality television in a livelier way. MTV's ``Real World'' loads a
house with young people raging with hormones and curiosity, and
actually sends them out of the house. This season's cast lived in
New Orleans and produced a public-access television show.
</P>
<P>
   The success of confrontational reality shows exposes the gap
between our noblest self-image and our mischievous delight in
others' conflicts. What the public says it wants and what it
watches are two different things. If viewers had been voting on
``Survivor,'' Richard, who was at the bottom of popularity polls,
might have been voted off first. That would have been the
``correct'' choice, proving how good-natured we are and how we
admire straightforwardness.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Brother'' contestants have turned this attitude to
their advantage, but their determination to be likable may have
been short-sighted. Jamie, who was tossed out only three days ago,
brooded recently when a plane flew over the yard trailing the
message that she was ``two-faced.'' Her housemates assured her they
didn't believe it. (Despite many suspicions, the producers say that
neither they nor CBS had anything to do with the many banners flown
over the house. An early one read: ``Big Brother is worse than you
think. Get out now.'')
</P>
<P>
   MONEY AND CELEBRITY
</P>
<P>
   But in England's ``Big Brother,'' Craig, a builder who went on
to win, dramatically confronted Nick, a stockbroker, across the
kitchen table. ``How can you be so two-faced?'' Craig asked,
challenging Nick after he had been caught lying about passing notes
and trying to orchestrate the nominations (a violation of the ``Big
Brother'' rules). Nasty Nick, as he was called by the English
tabloids, had done worse than that. He had concocted a sob story
that his wife had been tragically killed in a car crash. The
producers kicked him out for cheating, but he went on to sell his
story to a tabloid for as much money as the ``Big Brother'' grand
prize, and become the most famous character on the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' after all, is a game show about money and
celebrity. The Americans' togetherness quietly undermined the
show's crass, humans-on-display tone, but it didn't change the
world. When they get out, they have to face a harsh reality; in
their isolation, they seem to have thought that a huge audience has
been paying attention.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year beginning Friday night,
marks, for Jews, the year 5761 since the creation.
 &HT;    In the Bible we are told how God created the world in six days.
Man was created last, on the sixth day.
 &HT;    It's interesting to note that the Jewish New Year celebration
does not really mark the creation of the world at all. It marks the
creation of man.
 &HT;    Indeed, why doesn't the Jewish New Year begin on the first day
of creation? Why does the creation of the world take second place
to the creation of man?
 &HT;    According to the mystical teaching of Kabbala, the only reason
for creation is to give man a chance of being a partner in God's
world. As the Bible states: Man is created in God's image.
 &HT;    In order for man to be a good partner he needs all the resources
of the world. Therefore, God created the complete world and only
then did he create man, his partner.
 &HT;    In creation there are four distinct worlds or orders: The first
is mineral (inorganic) followed by vegetative, animal and man _
humankind. Each creation has a divine soul or spark.
 &HT;    Each of the worlds complements the one above and the one below.
Their relationship is symbiotic, mutually enriching. As one world
enters the other it achieves full enrichment and purpose.
 &HT;    For example, the animal eating the grass that used the mineral
world for growth now becomes animal. When eaten by man it once
again moves up a level.
 &HT;    In Kabbala this act is called transcendence. The worlds are not
sacrificed, but rather uplifted _ a passage for the soul or spark
of the created being to a higher world. This is true of all worlds,
including mankind.
 &HT;    When each world feeds a higher one it is fulfilling a divine
mission. Man, the highest of all the worlds, is to be productive.
 &HT;    Kabbala also explains that whatever man needs most, God provides
for free or with little effort. Man needs air, water and bread.
 &HT;    Sadly, of the two, man has polluted the air and water. This, of
course, cannot continue for it defeats the purpose of creation. Man
is to work in keeping the creations in a healthy balance. By
providing humanity with courts of justice, practicing respect for
all forms of life whether inorganic, animal or man, then all
elements are preserved, their purpose being fulfilled.
 &HT;    On the New Year the Almighty renews the vitality _ life force _
for the world.
 &HT;    Now if man does good, to better the world, God is happy with
creation. Then man is considered a great partner. Unfortunately,
man has not always performed to God's expectations. There are times
that man has been a bad partner, abusing the trust given to him.
 &HT;    So once a year God checks the account and sees if there is an
equal partnership taking place. On Rosh Hashanah the books are
examined and accountability questions are asked. Have you used your
partnership in a good way? God seems to be saying I created the
entire world for you so you would find everything you would need
for a partnership _ now what have you done?
 &HT;    Therefore, once a year all mankind is asked to renew the
partnership. Recognize your potential and make your year better
than the last. Repent for your past misdeeds and resolve to do only
good. Do it in a happy fashion by going to synagogue, having a
kiddush, family meal, and dipping your challa, bread and apple in
honey _ the symbol of a sweet New Year.
 &HT;    Remember, the Jewish people do not have a monopoly on
celebrating the birthday of mankind. I suggest that all of us
celebrate this event, the birth of man, by allowing God to enter
the hearts and homes of all of us. Dip some apple in honey and
renew your partnership with God.

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year beginning Friday night,
marks, for Jews, the year 5761 since the creation.
 &HT;    In the Bible we are told how God created the world in six days.
Man was created last, on the sixth day.
 &HT;    It's interesting to note that the Jewish New Year celebration
does not really mark the creation of the world at all. It marks the
creation of man.
 &HT;    Indeed, why doesn't the Jewish New Year begin on the first day
of creation? Why does the creation of the world take second place
to the creation of man?
 &HT;    According to the mystical teaching of Kabbala, the only reason
for creation is to give man a chance of being a partner in God's
world. As the Bible states: Man is created in God's image.
 &HT;    In order for man to be a good partner he needs all the resources
of the world. Therefore, God created the complete world and only
then did he create man, his partner.
 &HT;    In creation there are four distinct worlds or orders: The first
is mineral (inorganic) followed by vegetative, animal and man _
humankind. Each creation has a divine soul or spark.
 &HT;    Each of the worlds complements the one above and the one below.
Their relationship is symbiotic, mutually enriching. As one world
enters the other it achieves full enrichment and purpose.
 &HT;    For example, the animal eating the grass that used the mineral
world for growth now becomes animal. When eaten by man it once
again moves up a level.
 &HT;    In Kabbala this act is called transcendence. The worlds are not
sacrificed, but rather uplifted _ a passage for the soul or spark
of the created being to a higher world. This is true of all worlds,
including mankind.
 &HT;    When each world feeds a higher one it is fulfilling a divine
mission. Man, the highest of all the worlds, is to be productive.
 &HT;    Kabbala also explains that whatever man needs most, God provides
for free or with little effort. Man needs air, water and bread.
 &HT;    Sadly, of the two, man has polluted the air and water. This, of
course, cannot continue for it defeats the purpose of creation. Man
is to work in keeping the creations in a healthy balance. By
providing humanity with courts of justice, practicing respect for
all forms of life whether inorganic, animal or man, then all
elements are preserved, their purpose being fulfilled.
 &HT;    On the New Year the Almighty renews the vitality _ life force _
for the world.
 &HT;    Now if man does good, to better the world, God is happy with
creation. Then man is considered a great partner. Unfortunately,
man has not always performed to God's expectations. There are times
that man has been a bad partner, abusing the trust given to him.
 &HT;    So once a year God checks the account and sees if there is an
equal partnership taking place. On Rosh Hashanah the books are
examined and accountability questions are asked. Have you used your
partnership in a good way? God seems to be saying I created the
entire world for you so you would find everything you would need
for a partnership _ now what have you done?
 &HT;    Therefore, once a year all mankind is asked to renew the
partnership. Recognize your potential and make your year better
than the last. Repent for your past misdeeds and resolve to do only
good. Do it in a happy fashion by going to synagogue, having a
kiddush, family meal, and dipping your challa, bread and apple in
honey _ the symbol of a sweet New Year.
 &HT;    Remember, the Jewish people do not have a monopoly on
celebrating the birthday of mankind. I suggest that all of us
celebrate this event, the birth of man, by allowing God to enter
the hearts and homes of all of us. Dip some apple in honey and
renew your partnership with God.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore switches focus to prosperity
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore switched his focus today from pummeling George W. Bush
on Medicare and began casting the election as a choice between
prosperity and ``a massive tax on America's potential,'' pitching
debt reduction as his economic priority. Paying down the national
debt in 12 years, as he hopes to do, would eliminate interest
payments that form essentially the government's third largest
program behind Social Security and defense, Gore told the Brookings
Institution in Washington. He said Bush's across-the-board tax cuts
would disproportionately benefit the wealthy, giving ``too much to
too few at the expense of too many.'' By taking money from programs
and debt reduction, he said, Bush would tax America's potential.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH FOCUSING ON SPENDING AND ENERGY
</P>
<P>
   Seeking political points on the economy, George W. Bush painted
Al Gore today as a big spender who would bring back the era of
expansive government and threaten prosperity. He challenged Gore to
forswear raising taxes to bolster Social Security. ``If the vice
president gets elected, the era of big government being over is
over,'' Bush said. So, too, he said, ``could be our prosperity.''
Bush leveled his attack in Green Bay, Wis. On Friday, he is to make
an energy policy speech in Saginaw, Mich., calling for increased
domestic production, more energy assistance for low-income
households, and a tougher foreign policy toward oil producing
allies.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN: BUSH `DECEPTIVE' ON DRUG PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman, flanked by longtime congressional colleagues,
accused Republicans today of ``downright deceptive'' claims about
their plans for drug coverage for senior citizens. Standing on the
Capitol steps, Lieberman said the plan backed by George W. Bush
would ``leave behind more than half of all senior citizens who have
coverage today.'' By contrast, he said, Al Gore and the Democrats
want to offer protection under Medicare to ``every single senior
citizen and person with disability in the country.'' Lieberman's
appearance at the Capitol as Gore's running mate, with his
limousine parked a few feet away, underscored his new status after
12 years as a rank-and-file senator from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   OIL MONEY GREASES THE COFFERS
</P>
<P>
   Alongside a few friends from the oil industry, Dick Cheney
helped raise $8 million for Republican Senate candidates and blamed
the Clinton administration for a lack of leadership that he says
has left the United States without an energy policy. Big oil and
other special interests came through Wednesday night at the 6th
annual Senate Majority Celebration, where 1,400 supporters paid at
least $1,500 each to dine on mustard-and-herb crusted beef and
Pacific salmon with sun-dried-tomatoes _ and toast GOP leadership.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee said the money will
fatten a campaign bank account that stood at $22.8 million as of
Aug. 31, just short of the $24.7 million balance of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH'S DEFENSE SPENDING PLAN SMALLER
</P>
<P>
   Top military leaders have appeared before Congress to underscore
their need for more money, more personnel and more modern equipment
to keep pace with the increased number of missions since the end of
the Cold War. George W. Bush has repeatedly charged that the
military is ill-prepared for combat, but proposes increasing
defense spending by less than half what Al Gore wants. Bush says he
would spend $45 billion extra on the military in the next decade,
while Gore would says he'd spend $100 billion during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   NADER ON LETTERMAN TONIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader gets his turn on David Letterman's late-night show
tonight, capping a week in which he's drawn thousands to rallies in
Minneapolis and Seattle. Yet, despite attracting large crowds and
breaking into the talk-show milieu, the Green Party candidate has
been sliding in the polls and is no closer to being included in
debates. But Nader has scheduled another super rally Sunday at the
Fleet Center in Boston to press for entrance into the first debate
on Tuesday, even though a bipartisan commission reaffirmed this
week that he failed to meet the criteria set for inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   GORE AGREES TO CONDITIONAL SOFT MONEY BAN
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has agreed to swear off soft money for the rest of the
campaign _ on the condition that George W. Bush does the same. Gore
accepted a challenge from Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russ
Feingold (D-Wis.) to all candidates in the 2000 election to forego
the unregulated contributions. But he made clear that he was not
agreeing to unilateral disarmament. Even before Gore agreed to the
deal, Bush said he would ``probably not'' sign to such an
agreement, because the vice president wasn't trustworthy enough to
stick to it. Said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer: ``Governor Bush
looks forward to working with Senators McCain and Feingold after
his election to pass meaningful campaign-finance reforms including
a ban on corporate and union soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   GOING WEST FOR THE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is on a three-day fund-raising trip outside New
York. She started in Oklahoma City, where her host, Michael Turpen,
was a former state attorney general who came under scrutiny in one
of the fund-raising investigations involving her husband's
re-election. She then held an event in Las Vegas on Wednesday
night. She's to be in Los Angeles today and Friday. Her opponent,
Rick Lazio, has criticized her for relying heavily on contributions
from Hollywood celebrities, a traditional fund-raising source for
Democrats, and at first, her aides would not disclose the names of
sponsors of the California events. They later acknowledged that one
host would be Cher. The others include the financier Marvin Davis
and his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   NEW DEBT REDUCTION PLAN FROM HILLARY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, supported by ex-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and billionaire investor Warren Buffet, pledged to protect the
federal budget surplus from Republican ``tax schemes'' by proposing
legislation to limit tax cuts and new spending. Clinton proposed
mandatory debt-reduction caps that would make it more difficult for
Congress to use expected budget surpluses for cutting taxes or
paying for new programs. Her plan is similar in general terms to
the one proposed by Al Gore, but goes further by setting aside more
money for debt reduction and imposing legislative hurdles for
making exceptions. Her New York Senate opponent, Rick Lazio,
suggested that Clinton's policy proposals would leave little of the
surplus left to apply toward reducing the debt.
</P>
<P>
   BIG FUND-RAISING PUSH BY GORE
</P>
<P>
   Election Day is now less than six weeks off, and fund-raising is
more frenetic than ever. On Wednesday night, Al Gore raised more
than $3.5 million for the Democratic National Committee, bringing
his total take for the party in the last 16 days to nearly $25
million and his total take since January to more than $65 million.
Gore attended two events, starting with a reception at a downtown
Washington hotel for the Women's Leadership Forum. More than 800
people, paying $125 each, contributed about $500,000. He then took
his motorcade to a dinner at the Washington home of Sen. Jay
Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), where about 300 people, paying a minimum of
$5,000 each, contributed more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   A WEEKEND OF DEBATE PREPPING
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore will return to Florida this weekend to prepare for the
first presidential debate with George W. Bush _ and soak up some
important media attention in that key battleground state. The
primary purpose for the trip to the Mote Marine Laboratory on
Longboat Key near Sarasota is to practice for the televised
showdown Tuesday in Boston. But the Saturday-through-Monday visit
also will provide the fringe benefit of press coverage in a region
of the state dominated by senior voters, a key voting bloc Gore
must reach if he is to beat Bush in Florida. On the other side,
Bush spokesman Tucker Eskew said the Texas governor will split
preparation time this weekend between his offices in Austin and his
ranch Crawford, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS' CHEERLEADER-IN-CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   A successful rally in Connecticut was a vivid demonstration of
how President Clinton may turn out to be the Democrats' secret
weapon in the battle for control of the House. While keeping a
relatively low profile in the presidential campaign, Clinton is
taking an increasingly active role in assisting congressional
Democrats regain the power they lost under his watch. Rep. James
Maloney, a Democrat waging a close race for a third term in his
southern Connecticut district, had hoped to turn out 1,500 people
for a recent rally in Danbury. But with Clinton's name as a draw,
more than 3,500 people flooded an outdoor amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH THE ELDER STUMPS IN DELAWARE
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush invoked images of the Persian Gulf
War and President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky while
stumping for Republican candidates in Delaware, including his
presidential candidate son, George W., and five-term Sen. William
Roth. Bush questioned the Clinton-Gore administration's overseas
military policies and said his son would have handled the war much
as he did. He also said George W. would ``restore honor and
decency'' to the White House. Bush was in Delaware for a
fund-raiser at the home of Charles Cawley, chairman of credit card
giant MBNA Corp.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN HELP FROM A TV PRESIDENT
</P>
<P>
   In overwhelmingly Republican Utah, Democrats have to tread
carefully. In the 1st Congressional District, Kathleen
McConkie-Collinwood is bringing in the president on Saturday to
help her sagging efforts against the Republican incumbent, Rep.
James Hansen. Oh, not the real president; Utah residents don't
especially like President Clinton. Her guest is Martin Sheen, the
actor who plays a president on ``The West Wing'' the popular NBC
television series.
</P>
<P>
   THE OFTEN CONFLICTING POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gallup's daily poll of likely voters nationwide
showed Al Gore on top by as much as 10 points, while the bipartisan
Battleground poll had George W. Bush ahead by as much as 6 points.
Ten days ago, Newsweek put Gore ahead among likely voters by a
whopping 14 points; Sunday it reported that his lead has withered
to 2. But maybe that's wrong, since the aforementioned Gallup poll
now has Bush ahead by 3. Pollsters tried to explain the phenomenon,
but the explanations may not provide a lot of comfort. Pollsters
can't agree on the best way to identify the people who are most
likely to vote, and so they develop their own methods. In the words
of David Moore, senior editor of the Gallup poll: ``You can't
assume that all the methods are good. You just don't know. It's
part of the wizardry of polling.''
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS USE WEB DIFFERENTLY
</P>
<P>
   More Republicans than Democrats surf the Web, and members of the
two political parties differ markedly in their surfing habits,
Internet audience tracker Media Metrix Inc. said today. Media
Metrix reported that registered Republicans represent 36.8 percent
of U.S. Internet users, outnumbering registered Democrats, who
represent 27.9 percent. The remaining 36.8 percent were affiliated
with other parties or not registered. The researchers also found
that members of the two major parties display distinct patterns in
the kinds of Web sites they visit, tending to confirm the
stereotypes: Republicans are more interested in money; the
Democrats in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   DAILY POLL OF PRESIDENTIAL RACE
</P>
<P>
   Reuters news agency and cable channel MSNBC will sponsor a daily
tracking poll of the presidential election, beginning Friday and
running through Election Day on Nov. 7. The poll, conducted by John
Zogby International, will survey 400 likely voters each day to
produce a rolling three-day average of 1,200 likely voters. This is
believed to be the largest sample planned for a daily tracking poll
in the presidential race. The poll will be released early each
morning by both Reuters and MSNBC. The results will be used
throughout the day on MSNBC as well as on NBC's ``Today,''
``Nightly News with Tom Brokaw,'' and ``Meet the Press with Tim
Russert.'' The results also also be available on MSNBC.com and on
Reuters.com.
</P>
<P>
   MAJORITY FOUND UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ONLINE VOTING
</P>
<P>
   Americans have mixed feelings about online voting and the Web as
a source for political and election information according to a
recent nationwide survey conducted by Rasmussen Research, an
independent international polling firm. Both Internet and
non-internet users cited election fraud and privacy concerns as
reasons against online voting, and expressed concern about the
trustworthiness of candidate Web sites. Some 51 percent said voters
should not be permitted to cast their ballots for president and
other elected officials via the Internet.

 &HT;    FDA approves new abortion drug
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Food and Drug Administration officially approved on
the use of RU-486 Thursday, hundreds of Atlanta women have already
taken the abortion pill to end their early pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The Feminist Women's Health Center has been conducting clinical
trials for the drug, also known by the chemical name of
mifepristone, since 1994, according to Lindy Wood, the clinical
trial site coordinator. She said most of the nearly 500 women who
tried RU-486 thought it a better alternative to more traditional
surgical abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very successful, with the greatest advantage being
women liked the privacy of it _ that they could be in their home,
near their own bathroom,'' she said. ``That the experience became
less clinical, felt more natural and a far more personal
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wood said, almost 96 percent of the women said they
would recommend it to others.
</P>
<P>
   That angers anti-abortion forces, who have rallied to keep the
U.S. ban against the pill in place for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, abortion has become not a medical necessity, but a form
of birth control,'' said Jen Wilson, spokeswoman for Georgia Right
to Life Committee Inc., based in Atlanta. ``The Clinton-Gore
administration has now decided it's okay to hand out abortion pills
like candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, anti-abortion advocates fear that women will think of
this a ``quick and easy'' way of ending a pregnancy, when it is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Where a surgical abortion can take a few minutes, ``medical
abortion'' induced by the drug takes days, and in a few cases,
weeks. Also, one in 20 women who try medical abortion will need to
have a surgical abortion because the pills did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Under the FDA ruling, doctors should be able to receive
mifespristone _ a little white pill, no bigger than a tablet of
aspirin _ within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Once taken, the drug causes the lining of the uterus to break
down. A few days later, the woman takes another drug, misoprostol,
either orally or through vaginal inserts. This causes the uterus to
contract, expelling the embryo.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is about 95 percent effective, and most women
experience cramps similar to a difficult period, according to the
National Abortion Federation, an abortion rights organization that
licenses clinics and abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of bleeding often is greater than with surgical
abortions, with many women passing large blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   The pills _ and the required ultrasounds, check-ups and lab work
_ cost about the same as a traditional surgical abortion: between
$300 and $400. Abortion rights advocates expect, however, that cost
to go up since Danco Group, a women's pharmaceutical company, has
an exclusive license to manufacture, market and distribute the drug
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And insurers have yet to weigh in on whether drug, which will be
under the new brand name of Mifeprex, will be covered in
traditional plans. Abortion rights advocates expect that insurance
companies that already cover abortions will cover this new option.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid administrators will have to evaluate whether the
health-care program for the poor should include the pill as part of
its health care coverage of low-income women, said Joyce Goldberg,
spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Medical Assistance. Now,
the government health care plan for the poor only pays for an
abortion if the pregnancy is a result of incest or rape or
endangers the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   And any new drug has to go through an internal review process
before it can be approved for Medicaid use, which would include
RU-486. And although a Kaiser Family Foundation survey shows that
about half of obstetric/gynecology doctors in nation would be
willing to prescribe the drug, the Food and Drug Administration has
placed restrictions on which doctors will be able to administer the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulations, mifepristone will probably be handled
mostly by doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology.
Specifically, the drug can only be distributed to doctors trained
to diagnose the duration of pregnancy and to detect ectopic, or
tubal, pregnancies, because those women cannot receive
mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   And the FDA restricted mifepristone's use to doctors who can
operate in case a surgical abortion is needed to finish the job or
in cases of severe bleeding _ or to doctors who have made advance
arrangements for a surgeon to provide such care to their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Such requirements probably will not prevent most metro Atlanta
patients from seeking a medical abortion, but may make it difficult
for women in rural areas to obtain the pills, according to Dr.
Andrew Toledo, a board member of the Georgia Obstetrics/Gynecology
Society, specializing in reproductive endocrinology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a negative perception about anything
having to do with abortion and right-to-life issues (in rural
areas),'' said Toledo, who specializes in infertility at
Reproductive Biology Associates Inc. and will not be using the drug
because of the nature of his practice. ``And most doctors (in rural
areas) simply aren't going to be comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, however, that the problem of access for poor, rural
women will continue to exist, according to Kay Scott, Planned
Parenthood of Georgia's president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Probably 85 percent of the abortions in the state are provided
in the metro Atlanta area, she said. And often, low-income women
travel by bus to Atlanta to have a surgical abortion, because they
don't have access to such services in their hometown, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such issues, it is unlikely whether the use of RU-486
will exceed the number of surgical abortions in the near future,
experts said. At the Feminist Women's Health Center of Atlanta, for
example, about 500 women have been involved in clinical trials that
occurred between 1994 and 1995, and again starting in 1998. In the
meantime, the clinic averages between 50 to 75 surgical abortions a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly is not going to replace surgical abortions,''
said Wood. ``But it does give women one more option.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RU-486 is not a drug you can purchase at a pharmacy. You must
have a doctor prescribe it and administer it. The doctor must be
able to diagnose pregnancies and either be able to perform surgery
if necessary or arrange surgical back-up.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RU-486 is not the same as the ``morning after pill.'' Such
emergency contraception pills must be taken within 72 hours of
unprotected intercourse. They contain levonorgestrel and ethinyl
estradiol or levonorgestrel alone, and work the same way as birth
control pills: They delay or inhibit ovulation or fertilization.
They do not cause an abortion and do not interfere with an existing
pregnancy. RU-486 can be used for an abortion up to 49 days from a
woman's last menstrual period and it works by causing the uterus to
shed the lining and embryo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RU-486 was first approved in 1988 in France, where it was
developed by the pharmaceutical firm Roussel-Uclaf. It was banned
in the United States until the Clinton administration, in one of
its first actions, asked the FDA in 1993 to re-examine its ban.

VANCOUVER: EVERYTHING'S NEW BUT THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Budgeted earlier as VANCOUVER-APPLE)  
(Eds:  Optional sidebar at end of article) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Conspire to arrive by ship. Like
Naples, like New York and Cape Town, Vancouver looks its best from
the water, its shiny glass towers rising like Xanadu against a
backdrop of indigo peaks whose foothills dip their toes in the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Morris, who has seen a city or two in her day, wrote that
Vancouver's setting, at the southwest corner of Canada, ``is better
than San Francisco's, because of the greenness, better than
Sydney's, because of the mountains all around, rivaled perhaps only
by Rio and Hong Kong.'' More than 40,000 newcomers take up
residence each year, and the Vancouver metropolitan area now boasts
a population of more than 2 million, third largest in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and leafy, blessed with a temperate climate marred only by
rainy winters, a model of municipal etiquette, Vancouver seems to
have it all. It is relatively crime-free; Vicky Gabereau, the host
of a nationally televised talk show originating here, said proudly,
``There's no place in town I wouldn't walk, day or night, unless I
was wearing a big diamond ring or planning to take my shirt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Vancouver may be isolated, but it is
nevertheless as cosmopolitan a city as any boulevardier could hope
for. A friend of mine who lives in Seattle, three hours south of
here, remarked that this city ``has a sexy beat, a kind of
skirt-swinging glamour'' that she finds missing from her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to live here,'' said Mike Harcourt, a former
mayor and provincial premier, and he may be right. The local papers
carried an article recently disclosing that Lloyd Axworthy,
Canada's foreign minister, planned to quit politics to run a think
tank at the University of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   John Nichol, a onetime senator in Ottawa, said he missed ``the
tang of the sea in my nostrils, the sense that everything beyond is
Asia'' when he left Vancouver. The city's other special quality, he
added, is its newness. ``Everyone in Vancouver is just out of the
bush, or almost,'' he said. ``There was nothing here, nothing at
all to speak of, just 80 or 90 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If Canada as a whole lives a calmer life than the United States
_ former Prime Minister Kim Campbell once famously described her
countrymen as ``decaffeinated Americans'' _ people in Vancouver are
even more laid-back. In summer the workweek tends to start about
noon on Mondays and end about noon on Fridays. Canadians who live
elsewhere call this region Lotusland.
</P>
<P>
   That implies, of course, a degree of disengagement from the
serious business of life, and it is true that Vancouver is full of
distractions: sailing in the sheltered waters that stretch from
here to Vancouver Island, skiing in Whistler, just 75 miles up the
Sea-to-Sky Highway, or simply gazing at the magnificent panoramas
outside one's office or apartment window. No point in fighting all
that, so in summer performing-arts groups move outdoors, offering
Shakespeare in a waterside park and Mozart in the Coast Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even loyalty to our professional teams can be fleeting,'' a
rabid local sports fan said, and that may be one big reason the
local heroes don't fare better. In Vancouver participating in
sports trumps watching them.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Canucks have never won hockey's Stanley Cup,
Canada's big prize. But the Canucks have one distinction: They sell
not only hamburgers and hot dogs at their games but sushi, too.
Waves of immigrants from Japan, India, Vietnam and especially Hong
Kong have given the city an Asian flavor.
</P>
<P>
   It has three Chinese-language daily papers and a
Chinese-language radio station. It eats dim sum _ excellent dim sum
_ the way New York eats corned beef. Exotic fruits like mangosteen,
longan and rambutan, rare or unavailable in the United States, are
sold by every greengrocer in town. By some estimates, almost a
third of the city's population has its roots in Asia, and more than
half the city's schoolchildren speak English as a second language.
</P>
<P>
   An Urban Forest
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Vancouver is situated on a thumb-shaped peninsula, with
water on three sides _ Burrard Inlet, which forms the harbor;
English Bay; and False Creek, which is neither false nor a creek.
(It's another inlet.) At the peninsula's tip is one of the city's
most remarkable features, Stanley Park, a 1,000-acre reserve, much
of it dense, natural forest, only a 15-minute walk from the heart
of downtown. Vancouver folk defend it as fiercely as New Yorkers
defend Central Park, resisting any incursion into their
``wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the park is only slightly younger than Vancouver
itself. As they began rebuilding after a disastrous fire in 1886,
the city fathers persuaded Ottawa to give them the land, once a
military reservation, for an urban oasis.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see how the city lives, join the crowds who visit
the park on weekends. Amid bronze-leaved Japanese maples and
ancient cedars whose corded trunks reach straight and tall to the
sky, Mr. and Mrs. Vancouver and their kids throng Stanley Park on
foot, in horse-drawn carriages, on bicycles, on in-line skates.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting there for them are rugby fields, a cricket pitch, tennis
courts, three beaches, a pool, a lake, a lagoon, a restaurant, a
fish-and-chips stand, a pitch-and-putt golf course, angling piers,
yacht basins, a rowing club, a lawn-bowling club, an aquarium with
8,000 marine creatures, a zoo, cormorants and seals posing on the
rocks at low tide, and not a scrap of litter. You'll find plenty of
that in the tacky Gastown area downtown, along with T-shirt shops
and mediocre restaurants, if you're misguided enough to go there.
</P>
<P>
   Don't. Stay instead in Stanley Park, and drink in the matchless
panoramas of sea and sky surrounding you. I'll bet you find it hard
not to gush. My wife, Betsey, noticed the motto on the license
plate of a parked car. ``Beautiful British Columbia,'' it said.
``They don't lie,'' Betsey said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil Loveliness
</P>
<P>
   After Stanley Park head to Chinatown. Actually, Vancouver's
Chinese population has grown so much that it now fills four
Chinatowns; you want to visit the original one, which stretches
along Pender Street. One building there bears the date 1889. But
Nathan Fong, a writer and food stylist who walked through the
crowded street markets with us _ pointing out unfamiliar items like
whole lotus roots, and one or two that even he did not recognize,
like a globular fruit called santol _ said that things had changed
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I used to walk here with my parents and grandparents
about 25 years ago,'' he said, ``we always saw people we knew. But
not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood beauty spot is Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Garden
and the adjacent park, which reproduce exactly the tranquil
loveliness of the famous gardens of Suzhou in China. Rugged objects
(weirdly weathered limestone rocks) are contrasted with gentler
ones (waterlilies). Contorted miniature pines line pebble walkways.
Thousands of crates of building materials were shipped from China
to ensure authenticity, and no nails, screws or power equipment
were used.
</P>
<P>
   Near Main and Pender, the Times Square of Chinatown, there are
dozens of restaurants. Small shops like Dollar Meat that sell
uncooked as well as barbecued ducks and lamb reminded me of similar
places in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, except that these are spotlessly
clean: No flies, no dogs. Other stores sell dried fish like
pomfret, dried mushrooms and other wrinkly things.
</P>
<P>
   Quails filled the window of one poultry dealer. A single farmer
in the Fraser Valley south of Vancouver, Fong told us, raises
25,000 quails a week, mostly for Chinese gourmands in the Vancouver
area.
</P>
<P>
   The great surge in Chinese immigration was caused by political
uncertainty in Hong Kong in the 1980s and early '90s. Some wealthy
Chinese hedged their bets, staying on in Hong Kong and building two
or three houses in Vancouver as investments (and possible future
refuges). But the successful hand-over of the former British colony
to Beijing calmed a lot of nerves and kept many Chinese at home.
Vancouver people no longer talk quite so much about Hong Kouver.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver is named for Capt. George Vancouver of the British
navy, who explored Burrard Inlet in 1792. But it was the coming of
the Canadian Pacific Railway, which decided in 1884 to make this
its transcontinental terminus, that ensured the city's future.
Shipping is a major business here; looking across to Asia,
Vancouver is Canada's principal port. Timber from the heavily
wooded hinterland has been a major business from the earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   New lines of work have developed in recent decades. Tourism is
one, stimulated by Vancouver's beauty, the quality of its food
(especially in the Asian restaurants, which may be unmatched in
North America) and its convenience as a jumping-off place for
Alaskan tours. Environmental research, software and other
technologically based companies also generate thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity at Work
</P>
<P>
   On Granville Island in the center of the city you can see the
creativity of Vancouver at work. A group of shabby warehouses and
derelict factories has been converted into studios for glass
blowers, potters, weavers, quilters and the like; only the best,
chosen by a jury, are granted space. A rope factory nearby has been
transformed into a public market selling everything from classic
French stocks to Korean sweet-potato noodles to dolmas to fish,
fish, fish and more fish. The island has quickly become one of the
city's favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprisingly, Vancouver has become a film capital.
Hollywood producers and homegrown auteurs as well have made movies
a billion-dollar-a-year business in Vancouver, and the long white
trailers of the crews are a familiar sight on local streets. Robert
Altman was one of the first directors to discover the low costs,
high skills and photogenic land- and cityscapes hereabouts; he made
``McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' here in 1970, and dozens of other films
have followed. Recently much of ``The X-Files'' was filmed here.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the traffic as been one-way; the actors Michael J.
Fox and Jason Priestley, to name just two, are local boys who
migrated south.
</P>
<P>
   Hipsters' Hangout
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada when you don't fit in where you grew up, you come to
Vancouver,'' said Tom Rowe, one of the partners in the
film-producing Sextant Entertainment Group. ``There is tolerance
and freedom here, which has an impact in the film business and
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Like writing. Douglas Coupland, a local novelist, coined the
expression ``Generation X'' in his 1991 novel of that name, and
William Gibson, who lives here, too, gave the word ``cyberspace''
to the language in his 1982 short story ``Burning Chrome.'' W.P.
Kinsella wrote a novel, ``Shoeless Joe,'' about that game they play
across the border; it became the film ``Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And like the counterculture. Vancouver was full of hippies 40
years ago, and there are still quite a few around. You see more
sandals here, summer and winter, than you do in most cities.
Sophie's Cosmic Cafe in Kitsilano is a reminder that that
now-gentrified area was once the hipsters' hangout. There is also
weed, known here as ``B.C. Bud.'' Marijuana-growing and
marijuana-smoking are widespread. Last May hundreds of people
gathered for a ``smoke-in'' on the steps of the Vancouver Art
Gallery. The police ignored them, and support is growing for
legalization among politicians and newspaper columnists.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt, the former mayor, has been wrestling since he was a
long-haired storefront lawyer in the 1960s with what he called
``our major challenge: how to handle the inevitable growth without
losing the city's soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Having helped to block the building of a proposed waterfront
freeway, as well as the bulldozing of old, characterful
neighborhoods, Harcourt became an apostle of rapid transit, green
zones and wilderness reserves to limit the paving-over of farmland.
One consequence has been increasing urban density, typified by a
forest of steel-and-glass skyscraper apartment blocks along False
Creek in central Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But congestion, especially traffic congestion, remains a
problem, and now officials here and across the border are working
on a comprehensive growth-control strategy for the basin stretching
hundreds of miles from here to Olympia, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur C. Erickson is Vancouver's big architectural kahuna, one
of a triad of Canadian stars, along with Israeli-born Moishe Safdie
(designer of Vancouver's elliptical, technologically advanced,
hugely popular new library, which draws 8,000 visitors a day), and
Frank O. Gehry, whose worldwide practice is based in California. An
apostle of Le Corbusier, Erickson designed the Canadian Embassy on
Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   For his hometown Erickson, 76, has produced a Sikh temple,
several office buildings, most of Simon Fraser University in nearby
Burnaby and Robson Square, the focal point of downtown Vancouver.
There he reworked an old courthouse, now the Vancouver Art Gallery,
which augments its small collection of modern Canadian art with
traveling shows, and created a three-block-long mall. Ferragamo,
Vuitton, Dunhill and other chic-eries cluster around it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Justice for All
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the mall, Erickson placed the Law Courts, one
of his key works. Conceived as the antithesis of traditional court
buildings, which are often dark and forbidding, it is dominated by
a vast, airy, welcoming atrium, which is covered by a sloping
glass-and-tubular-steel roof and heavily planted with vines and
shrubs. Justice, it says, is available to all.
</P>
<P>
   The other must-see Erickson building is off to the west. (It is
on the West Side of town, not to be confused with the West End or
with West Vancouver.) At the University of British Columbia he
adapted the post-and-beam construction methods of the aboriginal
Indians for a Museum of Anthropology that displays a comprehensive
collection of their evocative art, some of which bears an uncanny
resemblance to that of the Marquesas Islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes baskets, textiles, jewelry and wooden
sculptures of ravens, otters and bears. Its high point, however, is
the largest grouping anywhere of totem poles, those magical,
towering objects carved for thousands of years by the coastal
tribes. They stand in a Great Hall, formed by a series of enormous
reinforced concrete trusses and sheathed in glass on one side.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away is the Van Dusen Botanical Garden: 55 acres with
7,500 unusually clearly labeled plants from around the world that
thrive in Vancouver's relentlessly benign climate. The magisterial
conifers, grouped by genus, are particularly notable; among them
are sequoias and cedars, firs and pines and spruces of the types
that clothe the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Beachhead for the Arts
</P>
<P>
   The performing arts have established a solid beachhead in
Vancouver. Less than five years old, Ballet British Columbia has
flourished under the leadership of John Alleyne. The Vancouver
Opera suffered a big setback in 1988 when poor attendance at some
of its arcane offerings, like works by Leos Janacek, caused the
Briton Brian McMaster to quit as general director. But it
recovered, and it will offer four productions this season,
including Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1919, the Vancouver Symphony was dealt an even harder
blow in 1988; out of money, it was forced to suspend operations.
But Romanian-born Sergiu Comissiona rebuilt it in a nine-year stint
as music director. He will be replaced this fall by Bramwell Tovey,
a young Englishman who is identified with choral works and new
music.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Millerd's Arts Club Theater Company, based on Granville
Island, will stage eight Canadian and foreign plays this fall,
including Yazmina Reza's ``Art'' and Martin McDonagh's ``Cripple of
Inishmaan.'' To the irritation of some chauvinists, the Vancouver
Playhouse does fewer Canadian plays; next door, the Queen Elizabeth
Theater is host to touring musicals and rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most successful of Vancouver's theatrical
efforts is Bard on the Beach, an annual festival in a red-and-white
tent in Vanier Park that stages Shakespeare against the
ever-stirring backdrop of water and mountains. It began in 1990
with one play and a budget of $25,000. This summer, with a $1.2
million budget, the festival staged 146 performances of three
plays, including a rousing ``Henry IV, Part 1,'' with Duncan
Campbell, a star for years at Stratford, Ontario, as Falstaff; and
his son, Torquil, as Prince Hal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've touched a nerve, I guess,'' said Christopher Gaze, an
Anglo-Canadian actor who founded the company and still leads it.
``We played to 96 percent capacity last year. We're affordable,
accessible and out of doors, which is what this city wants. We
struggled a little, but then the support came _ whumpf! _ like a
forest fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonders by Rail and Boat
</P>
<P>
   Given good weather, the call of the wild can be irresistible in
Vancouver, even for sedentary souls like Betsey and me, and you
don't have to rent an ocean kayak or a mountain bike to explore the
city's glorious surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   One easy way to do it is by taking a steam train, the Royal
Hudson, which puffs up the coast to the logging town of Squamish
most mornings in summer, snaking past waterfalls and mammoth
Douglas firs, clinging at times to cliffs 100 feet above the sea.
The return trip, made by boat, is no less spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   A scenic 90-minute ferry ride across the Strait of Georgia,
winding through the rocky, conifer-shrouded Gulf Islands, will
deposit you (and your rental car, which is well-nigh indispensable)
on 350-mile-long Vancouver Island, which shields the city from the
Pacific. Victoria, the trim little provincial capital, is the best
place to head for first.
</P>
<P>
   Not so very long ago, I'm told, Victoria was pure, provincial
Victoriana. Morley Safer, the Canadian-born CBS correspondent,
remembers arriving one afternoon in the 1960s at the vine-covered
old Empress Hotel and discovering a the dansant in progress, with
music by Billy Tinkle and his Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Victoria is much less sedate. Betsey and I spent a Sunday
morning in one of the many hotels that circle its landlocked
harbor, reading the newspapers, eating breakfast and watching the
tiny local ferries scuttle back and forth like cockleshells,
dwarfed by the big Seattle boat. Seaplanes came and went, kayaks
slid silently past, and handsome yawls heeled in the wind. Best of
all, it happened to be the day of the annual Chinese dragon boat
races, with 20 oars flailing away on each canoe and a drum booming
a steady cadence.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant summer flowers filled every pot, every hanging basket
and every bed around the harbor, all as carefully tended as a
dowager's coiffure. But the truly amazing displays are at Butchart
Gardens, a half-hour north.
</P>
<P>
   There, in and around an old limestone quarry, we encountered
millions of roses, billions of dahlias, trillions of tuberous
begonias, some as big as a softball, and zillions of Japanese and
Chinese tourists. I exaggerate, but not much. Every spring the
gardens import 135,000 flower bulbs from the Netherlands, and every
summer evening bushes and blossoms are lighted by thousands of
lights linked by 11 miles of hidden wiring. It is a show worth
crossing a continent to see.

   &UR; SAMPLING LIFE WHERE MANY WANT TO LIVE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By R.W. APPLE Jr. &LR;  &QC;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel
information, about Vancouver, with prices in U.S. dollars ($1
equals $1.49 Canadian):
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS, 791 W. Georgia St., (604) 689-9333. Canada is
justly proud of this Toronto-based chain, and Vancouver has no more
prestigious address. Guests can avail themselves of an
indoor/outdoor pool and a 165-shop mall that leads off the swanky
lobby (with Birger Christensen and Prada as bait for the unwary).
From the upper floors sweeping vistas open across the harbor to the
mountains. But guest rooms are a bit dowdy, and service is
disjointed. Double rooms: $302.58 to $383.27.
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN, 645 Howe St., (604) 687-1122. Built as a Mandarin
hotel, the Metropolitan retains that group's understated elegance,
and in Diva, it has one of the city's best dining rooms. Blond
wood, ribbed silk and chrysanthemum prints evoke Asian tradition;
business-class rooms with Frette robes, ergonomic chairs and
computer printers plant the Met firmly in the 21st century. This is
the kind of hotel where the staff knows your name before you check
in. Double rooms: $218.50 to $285.80
</P>
<P>
   PAN PACIFIC, 300-999 Canada Place Way, (604) 662-8111. Part of
Canada Place, where the big cruise ships dock, the 504-room Pan
Pacific juts into the harbor beside the five white sails that have
become the city's architectural trademark. Glass walls in the
three-story lobby take full advantage of the site; guest rooms,
trimly furnished in bird's-eye maple, offer hypnotic views. Squash
courts and a running track; expensive and worth every penny. Double
rooms: $310 to $365.
</P>
<P>
   SUTTON PLACE, 845 Burrard St., (604) 682-5511. The choice of
many a sophisticated traveler, this was once the property of the
French-owned Meridien chain, and it still feels more European than
North American. Guests are greeted by antiques, marble floors,
lavish floral displays and a friendly front-desk team, and the 397
rooms show a similar attention to detail. An adjacent, connected
building offers condominiums for rent by the week. Double rooms,
$180.90 to $288.50.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   BISHOP'S, 2183 W. Fourth Avenue, (604) 738-2025. John Bishop
turns no somersaults and chases no fads. His food is simple and
straightforward, marked by clear flavors, bright colors and
combinations that work _ grilled salmon with a ginger glaze; seared
scallops in a red pepper and chive bisque, topped with a potato
galette; halibut on a warm potato salad. The service is suave,
personal, polished. This is a restaurant that will thrive for
years.
</P>
<P>
   C, 2-1600 Howe St., (604) 681-1164. The C stands for
contemporary and for sea, which nicely sums up this glass-and-steel
pavilion hard by False Creek, just across from Granville Island. In
winter it's best at night; in summer go at midday, sit on the
terrace and watch the world go by, in kayaks, on in-line skates and
on bicycles built for two. The blue-plate lunch, for a mere $11 a
head, includes a refined tomato bouillon, five plates of light,
delectable seafood dim sum, and a few sweet tidbits. Top wines from
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   LE CROCODILE, 100-909 Burrard St., (604) 669-4298. Michel Jacob
named his restaurant for the three-star classic in his hometown,
Strasbourg, and there are always Alsatian dishes on the menu, like
onion tart and pheasant on sauerkraut. They are impeccably cooked,
like everything else here, including liver with onions, and
sweetbreads with Calvados. This is a place to savor the fondly
remembered flavors of yesteryear; Proust would have adored it.
</P>
<P>
   KIRIN MANDARIN, 1166 Alberini St., (604) 682-8833. Vancouver's
best northern Chinese food, served by uncommonly gracious waiters
in a bright, postmodern room. Suggestions: among the dim sum, the
deep-fried prawn and yellow chive roll; among the big dishes, half
a Peking duck, served in two courses: the sensationally crisp skin
with scallions, pancakes and a very light hoisin sauce, followed by
the duck meat steamed with cabbage and mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   LUMIERE, 2551 West Broadway, (604) 739-8185. Rob Feenie is
Vancouver's culinary phenom, and his welcoming restaurant has been
chosen as the city's best for two years running. A typical summer
dish: tiny slices of lightly seared salmon, served cold atop a
granita made of celery juice, ponzu and shiso. Four tasting menus
are offered nightly; I'd be happier if there were a la carte
dishes, too.
</P>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, 244 E. Georgia St., (604) 682-5777. A Chinatown hole
in the wall with irresistible Cambodian and Vietnamese food,
including crunchy, garlicky deep-fried spot prawns; cold chicken
and cabbage salad and a sour fish soup with chilis, pineapple,
purple basil and waterlily stems, deemed ``out of this world'' by
Mrs. A. Five copious dishes, two beers, two Cokes: $45.
</P>
<P>
   PICCOLO MONDO, 850 Thurlow St., (604) 688-1633. A small, serene
realm of Old World courtesy, this is one of the city's hidden
treasures. George Baugh and Michele Geris, husband and wife,
soft-spoken and able, serve zephyr-light pastas and definitive,
mahogany-dark osso buco. With which, praise the Lord, one can drink
attractively priced 10-year-old red wines from the likes of Bruno
Ceretto, Angelo Gaja and Monte Vertine. Just try that in New York.
</P>
<P>
   SUN SUI WAH, 3888 Main St., (604) 872-8822. Marvelous dim sum
and a lot more in a squeaky-clean room designed by Bing Thom, a
leading Vancouver architect. The gentle flavors of the best
Cantonese cooking prevail here, and the XO sauce, all the rage at
the moment, is as good as any on the continent. Ask Allan Yung, the
knowing manager, for guidance; but don't miss the tripe, squab and
ham sui gok (deep-fried dumplings made from glutinous rice.)
</P>
<P>
   TOJO'S, 202-777 West Broadway, (604) 872-8050. Reserve a seat at
the counter; watching Hidekazu Tojo work, seeking his counsel and
laughing at his (bad) jokes is integral to the experience. The BC
roll (``inside out'' salmon skin) is the trademark, but the
seasonal specials are better. Sablefish in broth with sliced pine
mushrooms, served in a bowl covered with parchment, thrilled us. So
did halibut cheeks and citrus-cured albacore.
</P>
<P>
   VIJ'S, 1480 W. 11th Ave., (604) 736-6664. On the menu at Vikram
Vij's animated, clean-lined restaurant, tucked behind a shiny black
Art Deco facade just off Broadway, it says ``curry art.'' At the
peak of their season, he chooses perfectly ripe mangoes and
combines them with acidic tomatoes in a Gujarati sauce spiked with
cumin. Slimline lamb chops (``popsicles'' in Vij-speak) are bathed
in a red curry rich in fenugreek. Even the rice (basmati) is
noteworthy, as is Vikram Vij's attention to his clients. No
reservations.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Patience and a penalty point helped propel
Steven Lopez of Sugarland, Texas, to a tae &UR;  &LR; kwon &UR;  &LR; do gold medal
Thursday night, 1-0. Lopez faced Sin Joon Sik of South Korea for
the gold medal in the 68-kilogram (150-pound) class, after
defeating three opponents by a combined 10-1. The 6-foot-2-inch
Lopez used a six-inch height advantage to keep Sin backing away and
risking penalties for lack of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that sooner or later they were going to give him
penalty points,'' Lopez said. When a penalty point was deducted,
Lopez said, a further complication developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I landed a foot kick, but the crowd was too loud,'' Lopez
said. With the judges unable to hear the sound of his kicks against
Sin's protective gear, the best strategy became patience. Lopez
said that he left his chest open to attack, hoping that Sin's right
kick would leave an opening for a return blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a trap, and he fell for it,'' Lopez said. With about a
minute left in the final round and the match scoreless, Sin tried
the kick and Lopez countered to score the winning point.
</P>
<P>
   Under tae &UR;  &LR; kwon &UR;  &LR; do rules, the point total was recorded as 1-1,
but the penalty deduction meant a decision for Lopez, 1-0.

CHINESE RETAIN DOMINANCE IN DIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL BRINK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Two systems for developing divers were on
display at the Olympic Park Aquatic Center here Thursday night, and
the results were as defining as Fu Mingxia's nearly flawless
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Fu won the women's 3-meter springboard title by surpassing her
Chinese teammate, Guo Jingjing, on the final two dives. With the
victory, she joined two Americans, Greg Louganis and Pat McCormick,
as the only divers to win four Olympic gold medals, and she became
the first female diver to win five career medals. She also
continued the Chinese dominance that has accounted for eight medals
so far in this diving competition.
</P>
<P>
   The two-woman duel between Fu and Guo underscored the efficiency
of a state system for identifying potential stars at a young age.
Fu was a world champion at age 12, and was 13 when she won the
platform gold at the Barcelona Games in 1992. Now 22, and back from
temporary retirement, she is a mentor and tutor, as well as
inspiration to a new generation. That includes Guo, an 18-year-old,
who said Fu ``looks after all the young divers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the women left behind Thursday night were two U.S. divers,
Jenny Keim of Miami, who was eighth, and Michelle Davison, who
finished 12th and last. They are products of a U.S. system that
runs up against social and familial boundaries that inhibit
excessive training regimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese and their system put a lot of miles on their
kids,'' said Tim O'Brien, a U.S. assistant coach. ``They're so well
trained and disciplined. Our kids are training three, four hours a
day. Theirs train eight. The Chinese teach them beginning at age 7
or 8. For the most part, people in our country have resisted going
in this direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Davison, a 20-year-old out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said she
would not want to go to such extremes for a sport she pursued
because of her passion for it. ``It's such a different society,''
she said of the Chinese. ``To them, diving is their livelihood. In
the States there are so many other things.'' That's also true for
Keim, who plans to be in law school by the time the 2004 Summer
Games are held in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Americans couldn't help being impressed by Fu and the
Chinese, for their consistency of effort and technique. ``They
always look the same,'' Keim said. ``I don't really understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Developing a stronger grass-roots program has been a priority of
Bill Walker, who was elected in 1998 as president of U.S. Diving.
Among the initiatives are a Future Champions Program, more regional
training centers and a possible national training center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to plant some roots,'' Davison said, ``and in eight,
10, 12 years, we'll be up there.''
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping the women's golds in 1996, Fu retired and entered
college in Beijing. But she returned in July 1998, citing her love
for the sport and concern that she was ``getting fat.'' Thursday
night, at 106 pounds, she stayed close to Guo for three rounds,
then edged ahead of her by just more than one point on the fourth.
On the final dive, Guo faltered on a inward 2 1/2 somersault, and
Fu locked up the gold with a clean entry on a reverse 1 1/2
somersault with 2 1/2 twists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I have a lot of gold medals, but I don't consider myself
special,'' she said afterward.

&HT;     CONGRESS POISED TO EXONERATE PEARL HARBOR COMMANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHARLES J. LEWIS and ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 60 years after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor,
Congress was poised Thursday to posthumously exonerate the military
officers who were blamed for the disaster because U.S. forces were
caught unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation, nearing final action in Congress, praises Rear Adm.
Husband E. Kimmel and Army Maj. Gen. Walter C. Short as
``professional and competent'' and asks President Clinton to
promote them to the highest ranks they held before being forced out
of the military in the wake of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,400 people were killed in the attack on Dec. 7,
1941, the worst military disaster in U.S. history. The United
States declared war against Japan the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel and Short were relieved of their commands and found
guilty of ``dereliction of duty'' for not being prepared for the
attack. Kimmel, the Navy commander at Pearl Harbor, and Short, the
Army chief, were removed from their commands and sent into
retirement. Both men reverted to their previous ranks as two-star
officers in accordance with military rules at the time, though
Kimmel had been a full admiral with four stars and Short had been a
lieutenant general, with three stars.
</P>
<P>
   Short died in 1949 and Kimmel died in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of World War II, Congress and President Harry S.
Truman enacted legislation that allowed all officers to retire that
the highest ranks they had attained during the war. However, the
law made an exception for Kimmel and Short.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pending legislation, the catastrophic U.S.
losses at Pearl Harbor ``were not the result of dereliction'' of
duty on the part of either man. Promoting them, it says, is
essential in order to rehabilitate their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   To do otherwise ``serves only to perpetuate the myth that the
senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and
responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is a
distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two of the
finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The exoneration is contained in the annual budget authorization
bill for the Defense Department. Both the House and Senate have
approved the exoneration of Kimmel and Short and the bill is now in
a Senate-House conference committee to iron out differences over
such issues as the number and types of weapons to be purchased.
Because both chambers voted for the Pearl Harbor provision, it is
almost certain to be included in the final version expected to win
final passage before Congress adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the legislation, Kimmel and Short were excellent
military commanders. Each ``performed his duties competently and
professionally, and, therefore, the losses incurred by the United
States in the attacks on the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
and other targets on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941,
were not a result of dereliction in the performance of those duties
.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers assert that blame doesn't rest with Kimmel and
Short but with a bureaucratic military chain of command that
neglected to pass along key intelligence information. The officers
``were not provided necessary and critical intelligence that was
available, that foretold of war with Japan, that warned of imminent
attack, and that would have alerted them to prepare for the
attack,'' the lawmakers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The exoneration is in line with a historical tendency of
Congress to be less harsh with Kimmel and Short. Following
extensive hearings after the war, a joint House-Senate committee
concluded in 1946 that Kimmel and Short were guilty of ``errors of
judgment and not derelictions of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest congressional action was hailed by Edward K. Kimmel,
the youngest of three sons of Husband Kimmel, and a leader in the
ongoing campaign to exonerate his father.
</P>
<P>
   The exoneration would be ``very significant,'' Kimmel said, but
noted that it is up to Clinton to actually take the step of
nominating both officers for promotion. ``Only the president can
make this happen because he is plenary over the military, he's the
command-in-chief,'' Kimmel said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel, 79, a retired lawyer for the DuPont Co. in Wilmington,
Del., praised Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., William Roth, R-Del.,
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., for getting
the exoneration language in the authorization bill. He said he was
counting on them to urge Clinton to follow through.
</P>
<P>
   The exoneration was also praised by Edward Beach, a retired Navy
captain and a long-time supporter of the Kimmel family's crusade on
behalf of Husband Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the official exoneration of Kimmel and Short,'' said
Beach, the author in 1995 of ``Scapegoats,'' a defense of the two
commanders. ``They already have been exonerated in public opinion.
Now this action means they are officially `not guilty.' History
will have to take note. This is the final point.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, University of Pittsburgh historian Donald M.
Goldstein expressed outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rewriting history,'' said Goldstein, a co-author of
the 1981 best-selling Pearl Harbor history, ``At Dawn We Slept.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel and Short were not the only people responsible for the
disaster, Goldstein said, ``but they nevertheless should have been
better prepared. I'm sorry but they really bungled it. I can't
understand how (Congress) can rewrite history with a bill. The
bottom line is that they were caught unprepared.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Pearl Harbor commanders had received an
official ``war warning'' message from Washington on Nov. 27, 1941,
that predicted a possible Japanese attack at any minute. Kimmel and
Short later testified that they assumed other U.S. military
commanders in the Pacific _ including Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the
Philippines _ were the primary target for the warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kimmel and Short had enough information and should have been
ready, despite all of the stuff going on in Washington,'' Goldstein
said, adding that the debate over culpability for Pearl Harbor will
go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearl Harbor never dies and we will never see the end of it,''
he said.

   The view that top leaders in Washington shared in the guilt was
embodied in a 1995 Pentagon study of Pearl Harbor commissioned by
Edwin Dorn, then the undersecretary of defense, in response to a
request by Thurmond, then chairman of the Senate Armed Service
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorn report concluded that Kimmel and Short shouldn't be
singled out for blame because key Washington officials contributed
to the disaster by withholding valuable intelligence from Kimmel
and Short and by sending confused messages to the Pearl Harbor
commanders.

ANTIQUES: A DEVOTION TO JAPANESE ART IS REQUITED 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE CHARLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rene Scholten came to love Japanese art through a
circuitous route. On a trip to Japan while working as a software
consultant, Scholten, who is Dutch, purchased an inexpensive
woodblock print. Then he saw a fine 1929 print by Torii Kotondo of
a beautiful woman applying powder. Completely seduced, he bought
it.
</P>
<P>
   When an art dealer friend said he wanted to quit, Scholten took
over his shop in The Hague. Business expanded, and so did the
gallery; Scholten left his high-tech life and became a partner in
Hotei Publishing, expanding its list of books on Japanese art.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent venture is Scholten Japanese Art in Manhattan,
which he opened two weeks ago with the help of two respected
experts, Katherine Martin and Rosemary Bandini. Its first show
focuses on the art of the Edo period in Japan (1603-1867).
Intricate netsuke, the fanciful toggles that delighted the Japanese
gentry for whom they were carved, are suspended in illuminated
plastic cubes, as are shimmering lacquer boxes, better suited to
holding admiration and wonder than more substantial stuff. On the
walls are prints by some of the great masters: Suzuki Harunobu,
Katsukawa Shuncho, Kitagawa Utamaro and Utagawa Hiroshige. Scholten
spent $10 million to convert three floors of the town house at 63
East 66th St., and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   Woodblock prints known as ukiyo-e have been the portal into
Japanese art for many Westerners, including Monet, whose collection
can be seen at his home-museum in Giverny, and van Gogh, who copied
two of Hiroshige's prints, most famously ``Ohashi Bridge.'' The
fragile colored prints were also favorites of Frank Lloyd Wright;
an exhibition of his collection and his architecture in Japan will
be at the Japan Society in March. The allure has not faded. A
recent woodblock show at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco drew
more than 80,000 visitors. ``They have an immense following,'' said
its director, Emily Sano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone can collect Monet, but they can collect prints,''
said Martin, the Scholten gallery's managing director. ``Here are
artists at a turning point. They are creating totally new abstract
images, taking proportion and perspective and color and playing
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The prints lead the viewer into the floating world ukiyo, a
Buddhist concept for the sad and transitory nature of the material
world. Edo artists transformed the idea into the transitory world
of pleasure, a demimonde of geisha and parties, actors and theater.
</P>
<P>
   The high-flying Edo era was a boom period. Like present-day New
York, Edo (now Tokyo) was  &UR; the &LR;  center of commerce and trade.
Merchants flush with money from a new economy sought to spend it on
pleasure and more pleasure. Ukiyo-e put the spotlight on this
self-indulgent, glamorous world, immortalizing the day's most
sought-after courtesans, the season's most popular Kabuki actors.
``The beauties were Edo's supermodels, the actors its rock stars,''
Martin said. ``The prints were the Edo period's color TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The prints were major productions. Publishers hired artists who
drew images that were then carved into wood blocks (sometimes a
dozen or more for one print) by a master engraver. The blocks were
given to a printer who worked under the publisher and the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Although publicly scorned by the higher-caste samurai, the
burgeoning merchant class collected the prints as passionately as
later generations would collect posters and baseball cards. Some
artists became almost as famous as their subjects. Utamaro, who
worked at the end of the 18th century, was the Richard Avedon of
Edo. Known for his innovative close-ups of the beauties of the day,
he at once idealized them and captured, through simple elegant
lines, their emotions and personalities. (His ``Mirror of
Courtesans of the Green Houses'' is for sale at Scholten for
$25,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There were thousands of images and varying levels of prints,
ranging from cheap ephemera to mica-ground prints for the
wealthy,'' said Sebastian Izzard, a dealer who has just opened a
new space at 42 E. 76th St., Manhattan. Many were lost to fire or
ruined by water. In the Meiji period, when the Japanese turned
their eyes to the West, some were actually used for packing.``We
have no real idea of how many have survived,'' said Izzard, who
worked at Christie's for 17 years. ``What we do know is that there
are many `sleeping prints' stored away. Whenever a fine `unique'
print is sold for a high price at auction, another surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Scholten's aims is to make the gallery a focus for
Japanese art: a library on the third floor will be open to
students, scholars and collectors, and Martin plans a series of
lectures next year. (Information and appointments: 212-585-0474.)
``We want to develop collectors,'' Scholten said. ``And you can
only really do that through a gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mann, a collector from Chicago, agreed: ``It's one thing
to see a print on a wall at a museum, and quite another to hold it
and examine it. An even larger barrier is psychological. You can't
own a museum print. A print in a gallery is much more seductive.''
</P>
<P>
   The novice has much to learn. A print of the famed Ohashi bridge
by Hiroshige can sell for anywhere from several hundred dollars to
tens of thousands. In a recent auction at Christie's an early
impression went for $52,875; at Scholten, another fine impression
costs $75,000. At issue is the quality and condition of the print.
Often an early edition will command the highest price: the artist
was there supervising the printer, making sure the proper colors
were used. In later editions, when the artist was off creating new
images, a printer might take shortcuts, using less expensive
pigments.
</P>
<P>
   But the first impression does not always command the highest
price. Sometimes a coterie of patrons commissioned a deluxe edition
printed on special paper with special pigments. Or the publisher or
artist decided to edit the print to make it more salable or
attractive. The first prints of Hiroshige's ``Ohashi,'' for
example, are sometimes known as ``Two Boats''; in later editions
two boats in the background were etched out to make the print more
aesthetically appealing. Popular works could be printed and
reprinted until the block became so worn that the impressions were
virtually unreadable. The title of Hiroshige's series ``100 Views
of Edo'' was actually changed to ``100 Views of Tokyo.'' ``The name
of the city changed in 1868, 10 years after the print was made,''
Izzard said. ``The condition of the blocks had to be pretty
rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The prints are as ephemeral as their subjects, soon fading in
direct light. Improperly stored, they become food for worms and
insects. Today most serious collectors keep prints in acid-free
paper in boxes, taking them out to look at or to hang on a wall,
for only a brief time, behind protective glass.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for ukiyo-e are driven by fashion, just as they were in
the Edo period. Although a popular image in excellent condition
would be out of reach for most (an actor print by Sharaku just sold
at Christie's for $280,000), there are still many prints in fine
condition available for as little as $3,000 or $4,000. ``You might
not be able to afford a fine print of `Ohashi,''' Martin said.
``But there are excellent prints from the same series that you
could buy for $3,000. The market, today as in the past, is driven
by changing tastes.''

uninsured Americans gained health-care coverage last year, the
first time in 12 years that the number of people without health

the turnaround. Still, the number of uninsured Americans,
particularly among the poor, remained high. The number of people

the company said in a press release. WebMD has said it would close

</P>
<P>
   HMO _ Last year health care costs rose about 7 percent
nationwide. This year, double-digit increases are forecast. The
main reason this is happening is that managed care companies
charged less than the market value for years, as they competed for
contracts and market share. But in 1998, that changed. Companies
decided they wanted to turn a profit and the skyrocketing cost of
prescription drugs and lower government reimbursements cut into the
bottom line. But while state government and UT workers are facing
higher co-pays this year for their health insurance, other
companies -- notably in the high tech area -- aren't passing along
costs. We'll look at what companies are doing about rising health
care costs, what it means for employees and what's on the horizon.

   AIDS-CONFERENCE _ ATLANTA _ She struggles to put her fear into

different from everybody else,'' the 33-year-old Atlanta mother
said. Truth is, Mardis Andrews isn't. She has never been. In
Georgia, 82 percent of women with AIDS are African-American, just
like her. And African-American children represent 62 percent of all
new HIV-AIDS cases in the United States, just like her daughter.
But if these numbers are lost on Andrews, they weigh heavy and wide

ART REVIEW: HIGH PRIEST OF A BOUNDLESS ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much has been made of John Ruskin (1819-1900) this
year, and not without a reason. It is the centenary of the death of
this artist, art and architectural critic extraordinaire, social
reformer, polymath lecturer, first official professor of art in
England (at Oxford University) and an admirer of little girls whose
mismarriage to a full-grown woman ended in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   So far in 2000, there has been a big Ruskin show at the Tate
Britain in London, another at the Yale Center for British Art and a
third at the Grolier Club in New York, as well as the publication
of ``John Ruskin: The Later Years,'' the second and last volume of
a biography by Tim Hilton (Yale University Press).
</P>
<P>
   Now the Morgan Library has mounted its own show of Ruskiniana,
``Ruskin's Italy, Ruskin's England,'' a biographical assemblage of
133 objects: letters, manuscripts, photographs, drawings, paintings
_ including several self-portraits _ and artifacts. They were mined
entirely from the Morgan's own Ruskin collection, proclaimed by the
library to be one of the world's most comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Ruskin's Italy, Ruskin's England'' can't exactly be
described as an art show, it has a number of paintings and drawings
by Ruskin himself as well as by the British artists J.M.W. Turner,
John Constable and the Pre-Raphaelites John Everett Millais,
William Holman Hunt, Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and
others in the Ruskin pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Ruskin's illustrious and influential career lay a
troubled life. He was the only child of wealthy and zealously
religious parents who refused to let go of him. (When he enrolled
at Oxford, his mother took up residence near the university.) His
disastrous marriage left him a lonely bachelor subject to fits of
unrequited love for little girls. He was also beset by bouts of
mental illness. In the end, this brilliant and privileged man died
in the care of relatives, and in his last decade he rarely spoke.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Ruskin's genius that this show celebrates: the
enormous energies as a writer, critic, artist, educator and
reformist that made him a giant of the Victorian age whose
published works ran to 39 volumes. He set new standards for
criticism, looking to art for morality, spirituality and a
reflection of nature's truth. His early interest in the work of
Turner inspired the eloquent if sometimes longwinded meditations on
art and architecture that began with his first book, the
five-volume ``Modern Painters'' (1843-1860).
</P>
<P>
   The meditations continued in ``The Seven Lamps of Architecture''
(1849), a paean to medieval architecture as the true expression of
national values, which established Ruskin as a leader in the Gothic
Revival movement. And in ``The Stones of Venice'' (1851-53) he
extolled Venetian Gothic architecture as reflecting national and
domestic integrity, as opposed to the ``corrupt'' Venetian
Renaissance that succeeded it. The books established him as the
most influential art critic and theorist of the age.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition starts with Ruskin's family and childhood. Early
on he showed signs of his polymath talents: he collected minerals,
wrote poetry, and at the age of 10 composed a book of ``Amusing
Characters for Children,'' for which he drew color illustrations
copied from George Cruikshank's drawings for ``Grimms' Fairy
Tales.'' Also on view are 18 sermons he wrote between ages 13 and
15 on the first five books of the Bible, hand-bound into five thin
booklets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the show's highlights are a number of Ruskin's detailed
drawings and quick sketches for ``The Seven Lamps of
Architecture.'' He never regarded his drawings as art but as useful
notes. Still, his precise and elegant draftsmanship is nothing
short of beautiful, exemplified in a meticulously shaded rendering
of the stone balls surrounded by flowing leaves that adorn part of
the central gate of St. Mark's in Venice. ``It looks as if its
leaves had been sensitive, and had risen and shut themselves into a
bud at some sudden touch, and would presently fall back again into
their wild flow,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he was preparing ``The Stones of Venice,'' Ruskin's
marriage (in 1848) to Euphemia Gray, the daughter of a business
acquaintance of his father, was falling apart. Holograph letters
from ``Effie'' to her parents detail the main causes: too much
interference from Ruskin's parents, his absorption in his work and
his sexual indifference, not to say disdain. In 1854 the marriage
was annulled, and the next year she wed Millais, the painter, until
then a close Ruskin friend.
</P>
<P>
   Also touched on is Ruskin's famous rejection of Whistler's
``Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket,'' offered at the
Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 for 200 guineas. ``I have seen, and
heard, much of Cockney impudence before now,'' Ruskin wrote, ``but
never expected to hear a coxcomb ask 200 guineas for flinging a pot
of paint in the public's face.''
</P>
<P>
   Whistler sued, winning only a farthing in damages, and was
bankrupted by the court costs. But posterity has declared in his
favor. Shown here are a copy of his 1878 book, ``Whistler vs.
Ruskin: Art and Art Critics,'' and a holograph letter of 1878 from
Burne-Jones to Ruskin about the former's court appearance in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The show touches on many other aspects of Ruskin's life and
career, including his work as a social reformer and
environmentalist who he pushed for a minimum wage, pensions and
nationalized education and his pathetic infatuation with a
10-year-old girl named Rose La Touche, whom he met when he was 39
and tried to reach by spiritualism after her early death.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Ruskin's life is sadly sketched out in notes made by
him during periods of mental collapse. ``Worst horror I ever
knew,'' is the terse comment in one of them. His working career
ended in 1889, and there is a terrible photograph of him, vacant of
expression and much diminished physically, as he slumps on a bench
next to the robust female cousin who took care of him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he left behind much to commemorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruskin's Italy, Ruskin's England'' is at the Morgan Library,
29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0610, through Jan. 7.

`LIFEGAME': YOUR STORY, TRANSFORMED ON THE SPOT INTO THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 (Eds: This was originally scheduled as BC-BIOGRAPHY-THEATER) 
By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The odds are you have never heard of the star of
``Lifegame,'' the piquant, oddly touching new offering from the
ever-resourceful Improbable Theater. Certainly, I had never heard
of one Nancy Rosenthal, who on the night I caught the show held the
stage of the Jane Street Theater with a commanding, radiant
centeredness. I would recommend that you go see the charismatic
Rosenthal, a self-described ``stay-at-home Mom'' of 45, except that
her run ended the night it began. The stars of ``Lifegame'' are
stars for only two hours.
</P>
<P>
   This latest work from the young British troupe that turned
Scotch tape into ectoplasm in ``70 Hill Lane,'' the real-life
haunted-house drama that was their maiden outing in New York, is
now turning instant biography into instant, multiform theater. The
show is based riskily on the classic premises that everyone has a
story to tell and that no examined life is truly boring.
</P>
<P>
   Each evening, a preselected volunteer (not drawn from that
night's audience) is brought onstage and asked basic biographical
questions by a single, mercifully tactful interviewer (who changes
nightly). This is conducted rather in the manner of a television
talk show, though not of the confrontational sort. The volunteer's
answers are quickly _ sometimes even simultaneously _ turned into
vignettes by the company's seven-member ensemble. This is your
life, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifegame,'' which was created by Keith Johnstone and has been
previously seen in London and San Diego, sounds like the kind of
performance that you would attend only at gunpoint and then spend
staring at your shoes. After all, the potential for disaster, of
both the humiliating and the boring varieties, is large. Anyway,
haven't we had enough of ordinary people doing psychological (and
sometimes literal) stripteases on daytime television?
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a glowing gentleness about ``Lifegame,'' a
curiosity coupled with respect, that keeps it a healthy distance
from a tabloid sensibility. It is made clear from the beginning
that the guests control the direction of the evening: they can
provide and withhold information as they see fit. As the show
progresses, the effect is less Jerry Springer than Federico Fellini
_ that is, as in the later, warmer memory films of Fellini, like
``Amarcord,'' or its American cousin, Woody Allen's ``Radio Days.''
</P>
<P>
   As in those movies, basic recollections of childhood are given
an exaggerated life that combines comic flourish with deep
wistfulness. Rosenthal, for example, had to give only a few
particulars of her child's eye view of her mother _ as a glamorous
looking woman who served food in a Brooklyn school cafeteria _ for
three ensemble members to assemble an immediate vision of boys
lining up to have their plates filled by a ladle-wielding femme
fatale. ``The boys were crazy about her,'' said Rosenthal, nodding
at the scene before her.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonplace recollections are often the most
inspirational for the seven-member company: Rosenthal's description
of turning down a date in junior high school became a musical set
piece with an impromptu ballad of teen-age angst and an ice-skating
puppet. A passing reference to a troubled love affair turned into a
hilarious five-second portrait of the reckless boyfriend who fast
became history. Extemporaneous music, from keyboard and sax,
floated in counterpoint, providing the soundtrack that every life
begs for.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it takes a fair amount of questioning to arrive at an
incident the performers can ride to interpretive heights. A couple
of vignettes died on the vine. Yet longeurs are few and usually
overridden by the combined feelings of suspense and good will one
feels for the people onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, the visiting subject of ``Lifegame'' chooses an
alter ego among the performers. Guests may also participate as
actors if they choose. Rosenthal chose to and was remarkably
effective at playing her own grandmother and a nun schoolteacher
who sang the prepositions as a mnemonic device. She also recounted
a most tangled tale of courtship with the man who would become her
husband that left the others on stage open-mouthed and temporarily
silenced.
</P>
<P>
   This was either lucky or unlucky for the troupe, depending on
your point of view, since Rosenthal often upstaged the
professionals without ever seeming to try. It is telling that the
company appeared entirely comfortable with the situation, even
shaping the material so the evening would end logically with the
reappearance of the popular singing nun as embodied by Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Lifegame'' so appealing is the clear sense that its
performers are there not to show off their obvious talents but to
provide a frame for others. It is as selfless-seeming a slice of
show business as I have ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   The show is nearly impossible to review in any conventional way,
since its tone and shape depend entirely upon its volunteer guest
star. But from my single experience of ``Lifegame,'' I can attest
that I was far more engrossed by the story of the protracted,
conflicted romance of Rosenthal and her husband-to-be than I have
ever been by chronicles of Bruce and Demi or Gwyneth and Ben.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Museum of Modern Art has got to be in an
enough-already frame of mind. The staff has just come through a
grueling strike. Construction on a new wing has reduced the
sculpture garden to rubble. Now all hands are on deck for ``Open
Ends,'' the third and final leg of ``MoMA2000,'' the
millennium-marking group show that has taken up every inch of the
museum's gallery space for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open Ends'' goes only semi-wild, or maybe sporadically wild,
in its debut on the museum's second floor. (The third and fourth
floors will be phased in later this fall.) The show covers the
years from about 1960 to the present, which have been over all a
dynamite, don't-stop-running time for art. Yet in presentation the
period looks surprisingly well-behaved. Even Damien Hirst and Paul
McCarthy, artists graced with some kind of genius for making a
mess, look tidy here.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, ``Open Ends'' starts off on familiar footing with
two classic modernist works that serve as thematic keys to much of
what follows.
</P>
<P>
   One is Barnett Newman's beetling anti-monumental sculpture
``Broken Obelisk'' (1963-9), its sharp, upside-down point pinning
idealism like a butterfly to the ground. The other is James
Rosenquist's mural-like ``F-111'' (1965), a Pop version of the
Sistine Chapel ceiling that turns images of war, childhood and
American consumerism into billboard advertising for the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Both works are installed in the second-floor lobby, and from
there ``Open Ends'' branches off into five thematic shows. Probably
the logical one to hit first is ``Pop and After,'' a surveyish
look, useful but dry, at how one strand of postwar art has endured
and changed during four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Pop is about appetite _ for sex, food, fame, fashion, whatever _
and that comes across loud and clear in art from the 1960s, from
Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup cans, to Claes Oldenburg's
soft-sculpture ice cream cone, to Tom Wesselmann's glam
shaped-canvas ``Smoker, 1 (Mouth, 12),'' with its plush red woman's
lips and phallic cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and 90s pieces, the Pop approach becomes distanced
and critical. Warhol's soup is replaced by controlled substances in
the print series ``The Last Supper'' by Hirst. Oldenburg's ice
cream turns excremental in a painting by Mike Kelley. As for
Wesselmann's icon of passive female sexuality, Cindy Sherman
consigns it to the deep, dark past with her hilarious
faux-seductress self-portraits.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of Pop-ish political art yields similar contrasts. A
Jasper Johns American flag painting from the 1950s is as mute and
guarded as the Cold War era that produced it, while David Hammon's
1990 ``African-American Flag,'' done in Marcus Garvey's black
nationalist colors, is a real banner, hanging loose and ready for
use.
</P>
<P>
   Good as it is to see such pieces together, they suggest what can
get lost in era-spanning shows: namely, period texture, the
you-are-there verve generated by a combination of exemplary works,
inspired misfires and ephemeral quick-reaction pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop and After'' is followed by an attractive selection of
prints that brings Minimalism into the picture. But things start
hopping with ``Architecture Hot and Cold,'' a hallucinatory
gathering of images of unbuilt or unbuildable buildings, which
collectively push the idea of utopianism in directions Barnett
Newman could barely imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The installation is engagingly dense and busy. The result turns
what is usually assumed to be a professionals-only field into fun
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open Ends'' is punctuated here and there by solo
installations. The best of these is the much admired two-screen
video ``Ever Is Over All'' (1997) by the Swiss artist Pipilotti
Rist. On one screen the camera zooms through wind-blown flowers
like a pollen-drunk bee. On the other a young woman in a party
frock and ruby red shoes skips down a Zurich street, smashing car
windows with a flower-shaped club. It's an exhilarating piece, a
fairy tale of destruction that makes a perfect transition to the
final show, ``Innocence and Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   This section tackles one of the defining motifs of current art _
the corruption of childhood _ and evokes it through a handful of
familiar sculptures from the 1980s and 90s: Jeff Koons' stainless
steel bunny, Mona Hatoum's glass crib, Robert Gober's wax image of
a little girl's shoe sprouting human hair _ arranged in a
chapel-like space.
</P>
<P>
   One could point to other, broader, more urgent exclusions in
``Open Ends.'' The number of women remains low. African-American
and Latino artists are few, as are Asians outside of architecture
and design. Contemporary African work? Virtually none. And
so-called outsider art is nowhere in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   All of this goes on the must-do list for the Museum of Modern
Art's future. The compiling of such a list was, presumably, one of
the inspirations for ``MoMA2000.'' And if some enlightened
exhibiting and shopping results, this exhausting project will have
been worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of ``Open Ends,'' the third and final cycle of
MoMA2000, remains at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 W. 53rd St.,
through Jan. 2. The third-floor galleries will be open from Nov. 5
through Jan. 30, and the fourth-floor galleries from Oct. 19
through Jan. 30.

   &UR; BY JACOB WEISBERG &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The vice president appeared here Monday
to amplify his many promises about Medicare. Not only would he
create a new prescription drug benefit and make sure no beneficiary
was forced into an HMO, Gore told the audience of about 1,000
people, mostly retirees, he also promised ``tough new penalties for
any HMO that tries to exclude or drop our seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he was at it, he promised to ``eliminate most
co-payments and deductibles for important screening tests.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience loved it. And why wouldn't they? Gore stopped just
short of inviting everybody on an all-expense-paid cruise _ just a
block away from the headquarters of the International Shuffleboard
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance _ like Gore's recent move to tap the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve _ raised an interesting political
question. Is it possible for a presidential candidate to pander too
much? In recent weeks, the Gore campaign has seemed like an
experiment designed to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   In a primary campaign, it pretty clearly is possible to
overpander to special interest groups. Al Gore first found this out
in 1988, when he tried so hard to please Jews voting in the New
York primary that he made a fool of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to learn a political lesson too quickly, Gore repeated
the performance in 2000. His effort to distance himself from his
own administration over the Elian Gonzalez case offended many of
his core Democratic supporters without winning over very much of
Republican-leaning Cuban-America.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the environment of presidential primaries tends to be so
rife with pandering _ think Steve Forbes' wooing of the religious
right this year _ that it sometimes rewards candidates who make a
flourish of not truckling to the interest groups. Examples of
pander-backlash candidates include Bruce Babbitt in 1988, Paul
Tsongas in 1992 (he memorably slammed Bill Clinton as the ``pander
bear''), and John McCain in 2000. None of these men won his party's
nomination, but each got a lot of mileage out of standing up to
constituencies within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   It's also evident that primary-season pandering can come back to
haunt a candidate in a general election. Walter Mondale's efforts
to tickle the tummies of such Democratic ``special interests'' as
teachers, blacks, and union members contributed to his defeat in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   In a general election, however, the downside to pandering is
less obvious. It's true that Ross Perot got a good deal of mileage
out of his calls for ``sacrifice'' in 1992. But Bill Clinton, who
pandered to the middle class with the promise of a tax cut and to
the elderly with a variety of things including a proposal to
control prescription drug prices, was the guy who won.
</P>
<P>
   In general elections, pandering tends to ignore the narrower
groups that make up a party's base in favor of broader
constituencies. In other words, instead of gun-owners or Teamsters,
the general-election panderer tends to reach for the ``middle
class'' (often called ``the beleaguered middle class'') and the
elderly (usually referred to as ``our seniors'').
</P>
<P>
   Broad-gauge, general-election pandering has a much better track
record. In fact, I can't think of a presidential candidate who ever
lost a presidential election by offering too many tax cuts to the
middle class or too many new goodies to the old. Consider what
happened to the candidates who pandered marginally less than their
opponents in the last several elections.
</P>
<P>
   I think you'd have to say that the underpanderers were Jimmy
Carter in 1980, Mondale in '84, Michael Dukakis in '88, and George
Bush in '92. They all came in second.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit of a tossup in 1996 when it came to pandering. Bob
Dole indulged in the practice by promoting a huge tax cut, while
Bill Clinton mainly promised to protect existing middle-class
programs. Clinton arguably pandered less than his opponent and won
anyway. But Dole hardly lost the election because of excessive
pandering. Without his tax-cut proposal, Dole might have done even
more poorly than he did.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always been a masterful panderer because of his
ability to appeal to special interest groups without giving away
the store to them. Clinton can leave a room full of applauding
union members certain that he has endorsed their positions on every
issue they care about. Some time after he's gone, they realize that
Clinton escaped without signing on the dotted line. But even then,
they don't turn against them.
</P>
<P>
   The president has remained wildly popular among blacks despite
his failing to do anything specific for them other than deciding
not to end government-sponsored affirmative action programs.
Clinton panders expressively, not specifically.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the many skills that Gore, who remains a much
more literal-minded panderer, failed to learn from the master. When
Gore sucks up, he does sign on the dotted line, promising more than
is sensible.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's too-specific panders will come back to
haunt him in the event he's elected. Gore has been so emphatic
about saving beneficiaries from HMOs that when he gets around to
worrying about rising Medicare spending, his best method of cost
control will be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Gore's recently satisfied request that the
president liberate some of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Gore's
stance not only contradicts a clear position he took seven months
ago, it also means that it's going to be harder for him to return
to his old, sound arguments in favor of higher fuel taxes if he
wins and oil prices plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's falling poll numbers might be taken as evidence that a
nominee can blow it by overpandering. But it's still too soon to
draw that conclusion. As I say, it's never happened before.

ARCHITECT'S ILLUSTRATIONS SIMPLY AND ELOQUENTLY EXPLAIN `BUILDING
BIG' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LELAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An automobile piston, as anyone who has read David
Macaulay's 1988 best seller, ``The Way Things Work,'' can tell you,
is a simple reciprocating pump that operates on the principle of .
. . well, it would be a lot easier to explain using one of the
witty illustrations that fill Macaulay's books and television
programs.
</P>
<P>
   You could blow a gasket trying to explain some of the principles
that Macaulay, an author and illustrator, distills into simple,
illuminating images.
</P>
<P>
   Under a heavy sky in Brooklyn earlier this week, Macaulay, 53,
was at it again, pointing up at the maze of beams and cables
supporting the Brooklyn Bridge and talking about force. The
vertical cables, he explained, suspend the roadway from above,
while the diagonal cables fight wind sheer by . . . frankly, here
again it would help to call upon one of his eloquent sketches,
which combine the technical insight of a draftsman's drawings with
the chatty unpretentiousness of children's book illustrations. They
make long stories short and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge is one of the massive engineering projects Macaulay
seeks to demystify in his new book, ``Building Big'' (Houghton
Mifflin, $30), and in a five-part public television series of the
same name that begins on Tuesday. ``Building Big,'' whether book or
television program, comes stuffed with his illustrations,
explaining civil works of daunting complexity in simple,
comprehensible images and transforming physical principles into
engaging narratives. Along the way, the project examines the
confluence of ambition, risk and vision that has shaped the growth
of modern cities and the lives of the people who inhabit them.
</P>
<P>
   An architect by training, Macaulay has made a career of
explaining the mechanics of the commonplace fixtures of modern
life: the toasters, cathedrals, mills, ships and other engineering
feats whose inner lives often pass unexamined. The most popular of
Macaulay's books, ``The Way Things Work,'' has sold 2.5 million
copies, plus another 500,000 for a later version, updated as ``The
New Way Things Work,'' which adds explanations of things like CD
players and the computer mouse. In all his work, he focuses on the
bones of design, treating the visible surfaces as the obligatory
neat endings to more interesting hidden depths.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brooklyn waterfront, raising his voice to compete with
the wind and the traffic noise, Macaulay found he had a lot of
explaining to do. Imposing, homely edifices towered all around,
monumental constructions of steel and concrete encrusted with
layers of soot. Macaulay could not have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love process,'' he said, ``and these structures are all
about process. They're autobiographical. If you look closely at
them, they describe their origins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Building Big'' is Macaulay's way of letting those
autobiographies speak. Divided into five segments _ tunnels, dams,
skyscrapers, bridges and domes _ the project took him from the
Aswan High Dam in Egypt to the bowels of the Holland Tunnel.
Combining social history with engineering basics, the book and
series examine the forces of ego as well as those of tension and
compression, and the ways those forces conspire to create the
alternatively inspiring and oppressive cityscapes in which modern
urban residents live and work.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Building Big'' marvels at the scale and daring of its
huge edifices, Macaulay and his producers are careful to note the
consequences of the underlying ambitions. Some dams, particularly
in the Pacific Northwest, have prevented salmon from swimming
upstream to their spawning grounds, contributing to the extinction
of as many as 100 salmon species; 500 workers died building the
Aswan Dam. Big structures have big impacts on the environments
around them.
</P>
<P>
   But Macaulay reserves his harshest criticisms for skyscrapers,
whose rise he traces from the stone towers erected by feuding clans
in San Gimignano, in Tuscany, to the ugly glass boxes of the
International style that lurch upward with little regard for the
other buildings around them or the people slumped inside. The
modern city, he says, is dehumanized by architecture that fails its
narrative function.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a skyscraper says something about how it works, it engages
you,'' he said. ``If it's just a box, you're held back,'' reducing
a building to ``a storage system for the people inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own home life, Macaulay has sought a smaller scale. With
his wife and two young children, he lives in an 1848 Gothic revival
house in the coastal town of Bristol, R.I., and makes his studio
above a nearby shipbuilding museum. The house has required
extensive renovation over the years, and Macaulay, following the
pull of his curiosity, has busied himself with plaster and molding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bigger on the destruction end, tearing down a bathroom,''
he said, than putting it all together again. ``I leave that to the
contractor.'' But for an illustrator who specializes in pulling
things apart, such demolition provides another way to tell the
story of a building.
</P>
<P>
   The most harrowing story in ``Building Big,'' a segment that
appears in the television series but not in the book, raises the
prospect of destruction on a much larger scale. During the
construction of the Citicorp Center in Manhattan, contractors cut
costs by bolting together a series of joints, rather than welding
them. A small change, but as engineers realized during
construction, it left the building unable to withstand punishing
winds. As Hurricane Ella approached in 1962, city officials met
secretly with the Red Cross to discuss plans for evacuating
Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Ella, fortunately, turned out to sea, and welders secured the
construction. But the lesson remains at the core of ``Building
Big'': every desire for bigness comes with human costs, often
reducible to formulas. Macaulay makes these formulas easy to
understand, and all the more brutal in their clarity.

HOW TO RECOGNIZE A POLITICAL LIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>

online magazine of politics and culture, is available from the New
York Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales representative

</P>
<P>
   (Michael Kinsley is editor of Slate.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell when a politician is lying? Don't say, ``When
his mouth is open and words are coming out.'' That is a cheap shot,
quite frankly, and unworthy of too many readers. A better clue is
when he or she is using the word ``frankly'' or _ especially _
``quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I asserted that this favorite rhetorical
device is an example of spin, an attempt to claim courage or
originality for a toadying or banal remark.
</P>
<P>
   But on reflection, and a bit of research, it appears to be more
of an unconscious verbal tic than a conscious strategy. For some
pols, it is virtually a throat-clearing device. But isn't it odd,
Dr. Freud, that they should choose this particular phrase? And when
a pol begins every third sentence with the word ``frankly,'' what
are we supposed to assume about the other two?
</P>
<P>
   Appending ``frankly'' to almost any remark made in public turns
that remark into a literal lie in two senses. Regarding the
speaker's motive, it implies an artless lack of calculation or an
active desire to tell unpleasant truths. And it implies that the
remark itself is not merely true but deeply true in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Unless last week is wildly atypical, American politicians use
the word ``frankly'' dozens of times a day. While I wouldn't say
the magic word is a clear sign that a lie is attached, there may be
a negative correlation between use of ``frankly'' and actual
frankness.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' for example, Sen. Dick Durbin declared _
as if these were confessions wrung out of him by Tim Russert's
famous tough questioning _ that ``frankly'' the Republicans are
adopting positions long held by Democrats, and ``frankly'' he
doesn't care for Bush's policies on various matters.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to a question about Al Gore and contributions from trial
lawyers, Durbin replied ``frankly'' that ``the Bush campaign looks
in the rear-view mirror'' whereas ``Americans want to talk about
where we're headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The current king of frankly is Republican vice-presidential
candidate Dick Cheney. He said that ``frankly'' he was astonished
that Al Gore would attend a Hollywood fund-raiser. Also,
``frankly,'' he ``would expect better of the vice president'' than
to misrepresent what his dog pays for prescription drugs.
``Frankly,'' the Clinton administration is ducking a fight with
Iraq. ``Frankly'' Clinton's decision to release oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve was politically motivated. ``Frankly,''
in fact, it was ``not sound policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other recent highlights of political frankness: Sen.
Barbara Boxer alleged that ``frankly,'' voters tell her, ``Barbara,
we don't want a tax cut.'' Rep. John Kasich revealed that
``frankly, we'll have an election this fall and then, come January,
we'll kind of know ... what we're in for.'' The political director
of the AFL-CIO ``frankly'' predicted ``the greatest union turnout
effort ever`` this election.
</P>
<P>
   However, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt acknowledged
that ``frankly'' he was more concerned about bipartisan cooperation
``to get things done for the American people'' than about which
party may have a majority in the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, Sen. Don Nickles scored a spectacular
quintuple-frankly, reporting in regard to the administration's oil
policy that ``frankly'' it will lead to price controls, ``frankly''
it won't work, ``frankly'' Al Gore and the administration are
``part of the problem'' because _ ``frankly'' _ ``politicians like
Al Gore'' are ``not making good economical decisions,'' and
``frankly'' this has been a problem with Clinton-Gore for years.
</P>
<P>
   In a later at-bat, Nickles added that ``frankly'' he prefers the
marketplace to government price controls (his description of the
choice between accepting the OPEC cartel price and trying to break
it, for which ``frank'' is only one word), and ``frankly''
everything the administration has done about oil has been
``counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate race is producing orgies of frankness. A New
York Democratic legislator named Eric Schneiderman, on CNN to
defend Hillary Clinton, noted ``frankly'' that most White House
guests were not campaign contributors (the famous
most-airplanes-land-safely defense) and even ``frankly''
acknowledged that her opponent, Rick Lazio, accepts campaign
contributions too.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, meanwhile, is a formidable frank-artist in his own right.
Last week he confessed that ``frankly'' Hillary thinks ``it only
matters what you say when you get caught`` and that ``frankly''
he's too busy running for the Senate to comment about Hillary's
exoneration on Whitewater, among other franknesses.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be said that a diplomat's job was to ``lie for his
country.'' But now all is frankness. The U.S. ambassador-at-large
for war crimes (presumably that should be ``against'' war crimes)
predicted that ``frankly'' Slobodan Milosevic would have more
credibility if he turned himself in. And an international trade
official, lobbying Congress for the China pact, testified
``frankly'' that it was a better deal for us than for them.
</P>
<P>
   These days TV talking heads, not poets (frankly), are the
``unacknowledged legislators'' of our political system. And
increasingly they, too, feel the need to reassure viewers that what
they say is actually both sincere and true. TV pundits' own special
technique is to preface an assertion _ however obviously
speculative, tendentious, or flat-out made-up _ with the phrase,
``The fact of the matter is ...'' But they often resort to the
classic ``frankly'' as well. On CNN's ``Capital Gang,'' for
example, conservative pundit Kate O'Beirne had the guts to admit
that ``frankly'' George W. Bush's ``polls started looking good''
(sic) because ``he started talking about ... what the Bush agenda
means for the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank talk indeed!
</P>
<P>
   Now financial pundits are horning in. One of them observed that
Saddam Hussein ``frankly'' doesn't care for either American
presidential candidate. (He was claiming frankness for himself, of
course, not for Saddam Hussein.) And, in what was frankly the
frankly of the week, a man named Von Waggoner said on CNN,
``Frankly, the optical networking space is a little bit worrisome,
just from a valuation standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. How very, very true. And thank goodness someone
finally said it. Frankly.

IN DAMIEN HIRST'S UNIVERSE, GLASS AND STEEL MEET PILLS AND PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Contrary to rumors that the young British artist
Damien Hirst has forsaken art for the business of advertising or
restaurant running, he seems to have gone into overproduction. His
third solo show in New York, which inaugurates the palatial
redesign of the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, is an extravaganza of
paintings and room-size vitrine sculptures, including two that have
been outfitted as gynecological examination rooms and then filled
with water and fish, to great Surrealistic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through this museum-size show, which can sometimes seem
about twice too big, it is irresistible to wonder, first, which
cost more, the renovation of the gallery or the production of the
works on view, and, second, what Hirst would have done had he not
had so much money at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent the ends justify the means. This is a strong
show, far more coherent than the jumble of work Hirst presented in
his previous Gagosian effort. There are undeniable duds. I would
avoid anything with Ping-Pong balls, bobbing or stationary; also
the pair of shrouded faux cadavers titled ``Adam and Eve.'' And the
giant anatomical figure made of painted bronze in the front gallery
might as well be a kiosk pointing the way to other works.
</P>
<P>
   Still, so long as the fish remain healthy, this exhibition shows
Hirst moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that
catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose
themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes
oppressive relationship to science and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This show presents what might be called the Damien Hirst
Universe. It is a big, shiny place with gigantic graph-paper grids
printed on many of the walls; pale dot paintings; expanses of
gleaming glass, mirror and stainless steel; and scores of pristine,
beautifully presented objects _ elements that frequently coalesce
into moments of clarity and beauty and something approximating
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Row upon row of shiny medical instruments occupy one wall
vitrine along with two skeletons, separately coffered. In another,
the handmade, actual-size models of 8,000 pills are laid out like
gems on thin metal shelves. ``Trinity'' consists of three towering
wall cabinets whose brightly colored anatomical mannequins and
models of organs and limbs gaily deconstruct the human body.
</P>
<P>
   In the best works, Hirst brings the visual and mental, the
material and the literary, into perfect balance. One shiny vitrine
presents the artificial skeletons of two dozen small mammals, all
perfect and white with their miraculous engineering everywhere
apparent; it is as wonderful to look at them as structures as it is
to identify the animals (several dogs and cats) and to find one's
reverence encapsulated in the work's title, ``Something Solid
Beneath the Surface of Several Things Wise and Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The displays confirm that Hirst has raided every postwar art
movement from Minimalism to Pop to Super Realism to Neo-Geo. His
main feat is the appropriation of the Minimalist box. His vitrines
and, now, vitrines-within-vitrines are crucial in the way they
encase, monumentalize and aestheticize his tableaux and create a
needed sense of distance for the viewer. And despite his
Neo-Geo-like use of store-bought commodities, this show also
reminds us that his work is so sincere, and even sweet at times,
that it should be called post-postmodern.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst's main objective seems to be to get us to look at the
wonders and horrors of natural life and to realize not only that
they are often the same thing, but also that both have been
intensified by man's pursuit of knowledge. Another objective may be
to simply prepare us for the inevitable: decline and death. It is
somehow comforting to be introduced to all those medical
instruments in the guise of art. The next time many of us see them,
they may be being applied to our own bodies.
</P>
<P>
   He is interested in both sides of any position. In ``A Way of
Seeing,'' he creates a comforting image of a scientist as bohemian
and as seer: a meticulously real life-size sculpture inside a
double vitrine depicts a man with a ponytail who is wearing a lab
coat and jeans as he sits at a desk staring into a microscope,
surrounded by a strip of sandy, carefree beach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pitfalls of progress are also in evidence. In ``Looking
Forward to the Total and Absolute Suppression of Pain,'' a walk-in
vitrine where the use of clear and mirrored glass may bring to mind
the work of Dan Graham, four television monitors, installed at
hospital-room height, blast the viewer with nonstop commercials for
painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when Hirst's pursuit of accessibility rolls
over into obviousness, as in the segmented vitrine filled with
plump garbage bags and room fresheners where the punch line is
``Stop Me B4 I Kill Again,'' scrawled on the tarnished mirror of an
old wardrobe. And the way these works fit together and play against
one another can make you wonder how some of them will stand on
their own. But on the whole this exhibition gives New York a sense
of Hirst as an artist with big, life-affirming messages to get
across, determined to do so without preaching, and in terms as
close to purely visual as possible.

 NEARING 100th BIRTHDAY, A MAN OF FASHION FINDS LIFE A GOOD FIT  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clothes make the man, goes the old saw. You would not
get an argument from Abe Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   The garment business _ in his case, manufacturing women's coats
and better dresses for more than half a century _ made him one of
the kings of Seventh Avenue. Even now, gliding gracefully toward
his 100th birthday in October, Schrader still appreciates the value
of a well-cut suit of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting Wednesday in his apartment overlooking Central Park,
reminiscing about the rag trade before it became the more high-hat
fashion business, he was impeccably turned out in a blue cashmere
jacket, gray slacks, crisp baby-blue shirt and gleaming black
shoes. A red silk handkerchief that matched the shade of his tie
peeked from his breast pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my clothes are made to order,'' Schrader said, as he
flipped open his jacket to show his Italian tailor's label. ``Even
when I made $10 a week, I saved up my money all year and bought a
custom suit.''
</P>
<P>
   This might sound strange coming from a man whose manufacturing
company, Abe Schrader Corp., once dominated the city's
ready-to-wear industry. But Schrader, a smallish man who once could
burn up the dance floor at nightclubs like El Morocco, never found
a good fit off the rack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lust for life,'' he said, his Polish accent making
the words especially rakish. ``And especially on a dance floor,
you've got to look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the city celebrated clothes with Fashion Week, an
extravaganza of designer fashion shows meant to highlight New York
as a fashion center. Schrader, who persuaded City Hall 35 years ago
to name a stretch of Seventh Avenue ``Fashion Avenue,'' followed it
from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some good, some bad,'' he said, diplomatically, of the spring
2001 styles on display.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader retired from the clothing business 12 years ago, after
watching it change from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   When he started out, in the early 1920s, the industry was big
enough to absorb waves of immigrants _ Germans and Irish, followed
by Eastern European Jews, then Italians. Seventh Avenue was the
center of factories where garments were cut and sewn.
</P>
<P>
   Now most factories have moved offshore in pursuit of cheap
foreign labor. And many of the original independent apparel makers
of Seventh Avenue were long ago gobbled up by conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader was one of the immigrants who built the business. He
arrived in the United States at the age of 20 from Poland. His
mother hoped he would continue his religious studies and become a
rabbi. But Schrader had his father's business instincts. He started
out as a contractor, hiring people to sew garments for a middleman
who got the orders from a retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, the ambitious Schrader began his own
manufacturing business, complete with a stable of designers, and
dealt directly with retail stores. One of his first contracts was
with the government for uniforms for the Women's Auxiliary Army
Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' he recalled with a deadpan look, ``an instant
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader's life might appear to mirror the archetypal
turn-of-the-century immigrant tale. Think, for example, of the
immigrant protagonist in the classic 1917 novel ``The Rise of David
Levinsky,'' torn between his rabbinical studies and the lucrative
garment business.
</P>
<P>
   But Schrader shrugged off the comparison. Although he can still
toss off a Talmudic reference when pressed, he said godliness was
not found in ritual or retreat from the world, but in doing good
deeds. Besides, he explained: ``Competition is a godsend. If you
didn't have it, you'd pay double for your clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Schrader was also a fixture in the city's high
society nightclubs, where he put his love of ballroom dancing on
display.
</P>
<P>
   That is how Pauline Trigere, the fashion designer whose coats
were produced by the Schrader company for several years, first met
Schrader. ``It was on the dance floor at El Morocco,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trigere, who has been in the business almost as long as
Schrader, gave him the supreme compliment from a designer: ``When I
made a collection, it was shown the way I made it. He never did
something that hurt the garment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader retired in 1988, four years after he sold his business
to Interco Inc. With time on his hands, he started, for the first
time, to feel his age. ``The first year I went from one museum to
the other, one library to the other,'' he said. ``Finally my son
said to me, `Here, Dad, take my car and chauffeur. Tell me, where
would you like to go?' And I said, `Wall Street.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, snappily dressed and eager as any 24-year-old dot-com
millionaire, he goes each day at 1 p.m. to his own private office
in the brokerage firm of Bishop, Rosen, where he trades stocks for
his own account.
</P>
<P>
   It is his joy, like dancing the waltz, although he admitted that
``at 100, I'd be lying to tell you my feet are as good as they used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He stays at his office until about 4:30 p.m., relishing that
everyone calls him Abe, like a pal, instead of the stuffier Mr.
Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat me royally over there,'' Schrader said happily,
settling into his car for the daily ride downtown. ``It keeps me
young.''

 &HT;    Morris offers inside glimpse of Clinton presidency
 &HT;    By David Brown
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Dick Morris has known the president and first
lady for many years. He worked for Bill Clinton in the 1978, 1982,
1986 and 1990 governor's races in Arkansas and rejoined Clinton in
late 1994, after Republicans took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, at Miami University on Wednesday night for a lecture,
provided glimpses into the president's personal life and also spoke
at length about the upcoming presidential election and Hillary
Clinton's bid for a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Morris on Clinton's peccadilloes:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had hundreds of women since he's been in the White House
. . . You (referring to the president's inner circle) had to be a
moron to believe this guy after his past record (with women).''
</P>
<P>
   Morris on the president's personal vs. public life:
</P>
<P>
   ``Which Bill do you want, the Saturday Night Bill or the Sunday
Morning Bill?''
</P>
<P>
   Morris on the impeachment:
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him being indicted when he leaves office. And I
think he'll be convicted of perjury and fined $10,000. I do not
feel he should have been removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris on the private Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ``In private, he's a cold fish ... he projects empathy in public
but actually he's just reflecting things back ... he doesn't have
much love for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris on Bill and Hillary's relationship:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary loves Bill, and Bill loves Bill, so it works out ...
She gets things when he's caught cheating ... After Monica, she got
the Senate. Basically he subordinates the entire administration to
get her elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris on China-gate:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the Clinton scandals, the one he should have gotten
impeached over is taking money from Loral for giving away our
nuclear secrets to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris on his role in Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been a good president, and I'm proud I helped get
him re-elected. But I did not know in 1996 that he was doing all
this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris on Bush-Gore 2000:
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people basically like Bush more ... The problem
is, all of the issues that used to push the Republicans like crime
and welfare reform have gone away. So what do you need a Republican
for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes a lot of difference who wins - both are
good men, both are centrists, and both will lead their party in a
new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   On Hillary Clinton's Senate bid vs. Rick Lazio:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hillary gets less than 50 percent of the vote in the final
poll before Election Day, she will lose. If the final polls show
Hillary defeating Lazio by 48-44, she will likely lose the election
by 52-48. Hillary has got to pull her poll number up to 50 percent
in order to win. Forty-eight percent won't be good enough.''

 &HT;    Former Clinton strategist assesses Internet potential
 &HT;    By David Brown
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Well-known political strategist and commentator
Dick Morris focused on the future power of the Internet on
Wednesday night at Miami University. Morris was on campus as part
of the Miami University Lecture Series. Following his lecture at
Hall Auditorium about the Internet and an extended question and
answer session that delved into a variety of political topics,
Morris continued to entertain questions for more than an hour at a
</P>
<P>
   reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the cusp of gigantic change,'' said Morris, who is
president of the nonpartisan Web site Vote.com. ``And it all comes
about as a result of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, chief strategist for President Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign, said the most important aspect of the
Internet is that it eliminates cost and obstacles to communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's free, it's instant, and it's global,'' Morris said,
adding that the Thomas Jefferson model of democracy could be
possible through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson once said, in 1793, ``I subscribe to the principle,
that the will of the majority honestly expressed should give law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Jefferson would have loved the Internet,'' Morris said.
``The logistical reasons Thomas Jefferson's ideals failed are no
longer valid. But now that we can have it, should we have it?''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he sees a future where referendums will play a much
larger role in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, people will have more and more control over the
institutions that govern them,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the digital divide locking out the poor who have no
computers and the elderly who don't know how to use computers,
Morris said in two or three years Internet access will come via
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, there's no more digital divide,'' Morris said.
``Everyone watches TV.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Morris, television viewing is going down while
Internet usage is up. He sees that trend continuing and politicians
adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are like lions. When the antelope migrate, so do
the lions,'' Morris said. ``When people leave TV to go to the
Internet, the politicians will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   He said political and candidate sites will have to be
continually updated and interesting to lure viewers _ and potential
voters. Morris said if he were running the presidential campaign of
either Al Gore or
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, he would have targeted Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 123 million e-addresses right now,'' Morris said.
``If I were running a campaign, I would have given away anything to
get you to give me your e-mail address.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the touch of a button could send out positive
information on his candidate to those 123 million people. A spike
in the polls would surely follow, and the opposition would have to
launch an ad campaign. At that point, Morris said he could then
launch something negative against the opponent, and 123 million
people would receive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, my finger would defeat his money and my
candidate would win the election,'' Morris said, illustrating the
power of the Internet and the reason big money won't be as
important in future campaigns.

A NEW HOME FOR OLD MASTERS; GIFT TO NEW MUSEUM; JASPER JOHNS IN
HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Inside Art) 
(ATT: Okla., Texas, N.Y.) 
 By   CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A major gift has transformed the University of Oklahoma into a
repository of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Clara Weitzenhoffer, an art collector and longtime arts
supporter who died in July, bequeathed her collection of 33 works,
including 22 paintings and 11 works on paper by van Gogh, Degas,
Gauguin and Monet. It is the largest collection of French
Impressionist art ever given to a public American university.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was formed in the 1950s and '60s by Weitzenhoffer
and her husband, Aaron, a founder of the Davon Oil Co. who died in
1960. They lived in Oklahoma City and La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzenhoffer also gave the university her collection of 17th-
and 18th-century furniture and decorative objects. The total gift
is valued at more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both the art and objects will eventually be on display in a new
$10 million addition to the university Museum of Art in Norman,
Okla. The addition, which is being designed by the Washington
architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen, will not be completed for several
years, but the collection will be displayed at the Museum of Art
from Nov. 14 through Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Boren, former Oklahoma governor and senator and the
president of the university, said that he met Weitzenhoffer through
her son, A. Max Weitzenhoffer, a theater producer and university
alumnus, and that her son played a role in the gift. The highlights
include a van Gogh portrait (circa 1886-88) of Alexander Reid, a
British art dealer and painter; Gauguin's ``Copenhagen'' (1886), a
snowy street scene, in muted tones; Pissarro's ``Shepherdess
Bringing In the Sheep'' (1886); and Monet's ``Riverbank at
Lavacourt'' (1879).
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman will become a destination,'' Boren said. ``We had
100,000 visitors in the first week when we opened our Natural
History Museum this spring.'' Since 1994 the university has been
working to improve its arts complex. The campus now has a new $16
million concert hall and the Charles M. Russell Center for the
Study of Art of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   BIG GIFT TO NEW MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are becoming more creative about their art
collections. An example is Altoids, the maker of ``the curiously
strong mints.'' A subsidiary of Philip Morris, Altoids has been
quietly putting together a collection of works by emerging artists
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   This week it announced that it had donated the entire collection
of some 70 works to the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, amassed with the help of a panel of arts
professionals, features artworks by visual artists working in the
United States, with each piece acquired for less than $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Altoids has presented its new acquisitions in a tour
of five or six cities, including New York, Chicago and Miami. But
the company decided it needed a permanent home for its growing
collection where the public could view the artworks on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The donation is the first corporate gift to the New Museum as
well as the biggest collection it has received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at a lot of places,'' said Andrew Burke, brand
manager of Altoids. ``But the New Museum, we felt, was the best for
trying to recognize these great artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift includes works by artists including Laylah Ali, D.L.
Alvarez, Jessica Craig-Martin, Sam Durant Barry McGee and Dario
Robleto. It is conservatively valued at $175,000, Altoids said
</P>
<P>
   The works will go on view at the museum from Jan. 12 to 28.
</P>
<P>
   JASPER JOHNS IN HOUSTON
</P>
<P>
   With the completion of its new $50 million building designed by
the architect Jose Rafael Moneo, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston
is focusing on expanding its collection. It has made progress in
strengthening its photography holdings and is now turning its
attention to contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Among its latest acquisitions are Jasper Johns' ``Untitled (Red
Yellow Blue)'' painting from 1984, six related etchings and a
lithograph. The painting, which experts value from $12 million to
$15 million, was purchased from the artist with funds from the
Brown Foundation in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought Johns' `Ventriloquist' in 1984 from Leo Castelli and
we have the related prints and drawings,'' said Peter C. Marzio,
the museum's director. ``So we contacted Jasper Johns and said we
wanted not just a paintings but work that showed its beginnings and
its afterlife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Untitled (Red Yellow Blue)'' consists of three panels divided
into horizontal sections and incorporates many of the artist's
familiar motifs: stenciled letters, imprints of the artist's hand
and a handkerchief suspended from two nails (in homage to the
19th-century American trompe l'oeil painter John Frederick Peto).
</P>
<P>
   The works will go on view toward the end of October, Marzio
said.  &QL;

&HT;     A HELLAS OF A WIN FOR GREECE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For the first time in, oh, 2,000 years or
so, a Greek athlete has won a gold medal at 200 meters in the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the Greeks staged Olympic Games that are considered
Ancient today.
</P>
<P>
   But never in the history of the Modern Olympics has a Greek
athlete won a gold medal in the 200-meter dash. Or any medal, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   History was made Thursday night at Stadium Australia when
Konstantinos Kenteris shocked the sprinting world by winning the
200 in 20.09 seconds over a field of more accomplished dashmen.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenteris deserved his stunning victory as he came from a
meter behind in the last 80 meters of the race to post a time of
20.09 seconds, a new national record for the country that calls
itself Hellas.
</P>
<P>
   Hellas of a win, Konstantinos. In fact, the last Olympic track
and field medal won by a Greek man was also named Konstantinos. In
the long-discontinued standing long jump, Konstantinos Tsiklitras
won the gold medal in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was the slowest winning time in an Olympic
Games since Moscow in 1980, when Pietro Mennea of Italy ran 20.19
for the gold. Not having men like Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene
or Frankie Fredericks in the race will do that for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment I stepped into this country I realized the
others didn't have anything better than me,'' the 27-year-old
Kenteris said. ``I knew I had a chance, especially as there were
five black runners and I was the only white.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the wonders of Olympic translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that I've won,'' Kenteris said. ``I didn't
come here to lose, I came here to win. I said Konstan the Greek
would win.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's about time, Konnie. See you in Athens in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Campbell of Great Britain came across the finish in 20.14
for the silver medal. Just as he had in Atlanta in 1996, Ato Boldon
of Trinidad and Tobago got the bronze medal in 20.20, a significant
accomplishment considering he ran from the island of lane eight.
</P>
<P>
   Just how different Sydney 2000 was different from Atlanta 1996
was reflected in the comparative times. Michael Johnson's run for
the ages in Atlanta with his astonishing time of 19.32. Fredericks
of Namibia ran 19.68 for the silver and Boldon the Bronze came
through in 19.80.
</P>
<P>
   And where were the Americans, who had won the last four gold
medals in the Olympic 200? Still running for the finish line, or so
it would appear from the dreadful form posted by the callow duo of
Coby Miller and John Capel.
</P>
<P>
   Miller finished seventh in 20.35. Even worse was Capel, who ran
a personal best 19.85 to win the Olympic Trials race in Sacramento
that featured Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene sprawled on the
track in agony with hamstring cramps.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, while an obscure Greek made history, Capel
finished last in 20.49.

   FDA-ABORTION-PILL (Undated) _ In what abortion-rights supporters
hailed as a major victory, the Food and Drug Administration
announced Thursday that it had approved the marketing of an
abortion-inducing pill, the first alternative to surgical abortion
approved in the United States. The pill will be available for sale
in about four weeks, its maker said. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION-PILL-REACT (Washington) _ Abortion-rights supporters
celebrated a victory Thursday with the FDA's approval of the
abortion pill RU-486, but they acknowledged that it could be an
exceedingly fragile one. At the same time, abortion opponents
denounced the administration and the FDA for furthering ``a culture
of death'' and vowed to keep fighting, legislatively and
politically. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ELECTIONS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Yugoslavia's democratic
opposition thinks it has a president in Vojislav Kostunica, but it
also has a problem: how to get the incumbent, President Slobodan
Milosevic, out of power. The problem is more than technical:
Milosevic shows no signs of wanting to go. So Kostunica and the 18
party leaders who support him decided Thursday night to call a
rally for Friday in Belgrade's Square of the Republic, where they
will ask the people of Yugoslavia to perform ``any act of civil
disobedience they have at their disposal'' until Milosevic leaves
office, said Zarko Korac, a party leader. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   DENMARK-EURO (Copenhagen, Denmark) _ Denmark rejected the euro
on Thursday, undermining Europe's common currency and efforts to
intensify the European political integration championed by France
and Germany. In the first popular test for the euro, introduced
last year without such democratic consultation in 11 states of the
15-member European Union, Danes voted to preserve the krone. By
Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   MICH-CAMPAIGN (Pontiac, Mich.) _ On Feb. 22, Gov. George W. Bush
lost the Michigan Republican primary to Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, thanks to a notably poor showing among independents,
moderates and women. Seven months later, in this same pivotal Great
Lakes state, he is again having trouble attracting independents,
moderates and women in his race against Vice President Al Gore. The
race is close here, with Gore very narrowly ahead. By R.W. Apple
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GORE (Washington) _ One of the fixtures of the 2000 campaign has
been the candidates' efforts to connect themselves and their policy
proposals with everyday people. George W. Bush has his tax
families, who gladly tell how much money they will save under his
tax-cut proposal; Al Gore spends the night at the homes of local
teachers before spending the next day in their schools. But the
vice president is about to take the approach to another, much
higher, level. In the next day or so, he will transport a dozen
people from all corners of the country to Sarasota, Fla., to
participate in his debate preparation. They will then travel to
Boston to be in the audience. By Kevin Sack.

&HT;     BUSH-GORE DEBATES MAY BE `THE WHOLE BALLGAME' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Millions of voters will get a chance to see
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush in a live,
unscripted showdown Tuesday night when the presidential contenders
square-off in the first of three debates that could sway the
outcome of the closest presidential election in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the 52-year-old vice president, and Bush, the 54-year-old
governor of Texas, will be trying to sell themselves to voters as
the best man to succeed President Clinton when he leaves office in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from staking out competing policy positions, the
candidates are hoping to portray themselves as attractive
personalities and smart leaders. Bush hopes to steel his aw-shucks
appeal with the detailed knowledge required of a president. Gore is
looking to connect with voters by toning down his lofty
policy-laden discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The three debates offer the candidates a total of 4 hours and 30
minutes of free, unfiltered prime time television time to reach
millions of TV viewers drawn to an OK-Corral format that can spark
memorable one-liners and disastrous gaffes _ and serve as grist for
chit chat at the office water cooler for days afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, the former Democratic chairman who co-chairs the
unofficial bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, likens
the debates to subjecting candidates to ``job interviews with the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk adds: ``The debates help voters decide if they want this
guy in their homes on their television sets for the next four
years. This is as real as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, says the looming debates ``will be the whole ball game''
_ as decisive as the encounters in 1960, 1976 and 1980 that gave
challengers the momentum to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a veteran of five nationally televised presidential
campaign debates, says the encounters ``give voters the best chance
they can get to take the measure of a person under some fire.''
Clinton added in an interview for the Public Broadcasting System's
``Debating Our Destiny'' project: The debates ``show whether you
can understand a situation in a hurry and respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Gore debate on Tuesday at 9 p.m. EDT takes place in
Boston at the University of Massachusetts adjacent to the John F.
Kennedy presidential library, with the candidates standing behind
lecterns.
</P>
<P>
   Their vice presidential running mates, Republican Dick Cheney
and Democrat Joe Lieberman, debate Thursday at Centre College in
Danville, Ky., seated with a moderator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore meet again on Oct. 11 at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C., in a talk-show style format, seated
side-by-side with a moderator. The candidates last week for a
debate on Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., for a
town hall-style meeting fielding questions from citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Each presidential debate is 90 minutes long and will be anchored
by Jim Lehrer of PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules permit the candidates to take notes during
their exchanges, but not to bring anything into the hall, such as
crib sheets or props that can be used to challenge their rival.
Video excerpts from the debate cannot be used by the rival campaign
for campaign ads but political parties and independent political
organizations are free to harvest the moments of triumph or
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite candidates' pre-debate jockeying to lower expectations
for their own performance and raise the bar for their rival, Gore
and Bush head into the debates with formidable reputations for
staging stunts, blunting rivals' parries and recovering from snafus
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a veteran of three presidential campaigns and 24 years in
the House, Senate and vice presidency, has repeatedly demonstrated
his knack for the political jugular during debates, including
during the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination
against former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dramatically challenged Bradley's vote as a senator against
federal disaster relief for flooded farmers during a debate before
the Iowa caucuses in January, by introducing an Iowa farmer in the
audience who suffered flood damage on 300 acres in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you vote against the disaster relief for Chris
Peterson when he and thousands of other farmers here in Iowa needed
it after those '93 floods?'' Gore demanded of Bradley in the
debate's most dramatic moment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has demonstrated an ability to recover from debate
mistakes, backpedaling quickly during the Democratic presidential
primaries after telling voters in a campaign debate with Bradley in
New Hampshire that he would impose a ``litmus test'' requiring
prospective appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to fully
support allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the nation's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Gore quelled a political firestorm two days later by saying that
he would only require military officers to carry out his policies
as president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore showed in his 1992 debate with then-Vice President Dan
Quayle that he can thrust and parry, as well. When Quayle insisted
that Clinton had ``trouble telling the truth,'' Gore snapped back
with a rejoinder reminding voters of President George Bush's
flip-flop on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush, in case you've forgotten Dan, said, `Read my
lips, no new taxes,'' Gore injected.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato says that Gore should ``make his policy points without
being arrogant or appearing school-marmish.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee defeated by
the Clinton-Gore ticket, said in a PBS interview that Gore has to
fight the same tendency to dote on specifics that he had as a
senator-turned-nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're running for president _ they don't need to know how the
watch is made,'' Dole advised. ``Just tell them what time it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, saying he views the encounter as ``a great opportunity to
explain my vision for the country,'' says his tight race with ``a
sitting vice president with the economy pretty good and the world
at peace indicates I have got a very good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have the least experience in government of any
presidential candidate since retired Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower ran
in 1952. But the son of the former president won his shot at the
presidency in the first place by besting silver-tongued Texas Gov.
Ann Richards in a gubernatorial upset in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, an ex-oil field entrepreneur and baseball team owner,
tangled effectively during the GOP presidential primaries with his
most durable rival, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a master of 17 years
of give-and-take in the House and Senate. Bush surprised McCain and
threw the ex-Navy fighter pilot on the defensive during a campaign
debate in the South Carolina primary by wielding a negative
campaign leaflet sponsored by the McCain campaign that had appeared
on a voter's windshield after McCain promised to end negative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato says that Bush must appear presidential and in command of
policy details to combat some voters' concerns that the Yale- and
Harvard-educated multimillionaire is ``not bright enough or quick
enough on his feet to serve as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato adds: ``People will be looking to see whether he is truly
articulate and knowledgeable _ or grammatically challenged as he
has been on some occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said one mistake he hopes to avoid is glancing at his watch
as his father did impatiently during the three-way presidential
debate in 1992. As the GOP nominee put it: ``I'm not going to be
looking at my watch, I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President George H.W. Bush recalled that moment in an
interview for the PBS documentary. ``It took a little incident like
that to show that I was, you know, out of it,'' the former
president recalled. ``They made a huge thing out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 80 million Americans are expected to view the first
debate, Kirk said, down from the record of 98 million who viewed
the final presidential debate in 1992 but above the 66.4 million
who viewed the first nationally televised presidential debate in
1960 between then-Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Sen. John F.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The major broadcast and cable television networks will broadcast
the Tuesday night debate, with the exception of NBC and Fox which
have opted out of national broadcast coverage, citing other
broadcast commitments.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole, like other presidential and vice presidential candidates
who have endured laser-like scrutiny during the 18 presidential and
five vice presidential nationally televised debates since 1960,
knows the dangers of words gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, known at the time as an acerbic Kansan, dealt his ticket a
blow in 1976 when, as the GOP vice presidential nominee, he charged
that 1.7 million Americans had been killed ``in Democrat wars in
this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-President Gerald Ford committed a gaffe of his own in a
1976 debate with former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, insisting in the
midst of the Soviet Union's Cold War control of Eastern Europe that
``there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never
will be under a Ford administration.'' The Ford-Dole ticket lost.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mondale, the former vice president who carried the
Democrats' banner in 1984, paid the price for a triumphant one
liner by his rival. Then-President Ronald Reagan, 73 and the oldest
person to serve as president, had appeared flustered at points
during the first Reagan-Mondale debate.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second showdown, Reagan was affable, relaxed and in
command. When questioned about his earlier performance and the
impact of age, Reagan quipped: ``I want you to know I will not make
age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for
political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondale, in his interview for the PBS special, said he knew his
campaign was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked off and I was almost certain the campaign was over _
and it was,'' Mondale recalled. Reagan carried every state against
Mondale except the challenger's native Minnesota and the District
of Columbia.

 &HT;    Even in defeat, U.S. team a winner
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ World Cup heroine Brandi Chastain has a message for
those who might get a little excited over one excruciating Olympic
loss, maybe try to turn it into a sad farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Aw, keep your shirt on.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain knighted the Americans' 3-2 sudden-death gold medal
loss to Norway as the best women's soccer game she's ever played a
part in. Divorcing oneself from the result, it would be impossible
not to get swept up in the tension and the violent back-and-forth.
``I can hardly wait to watch the video of this one. This was a game
you could enjoy as a fan,'' the world's most reasonable silver
medalist said.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Chastain this night was played by Dagny Mellgren.
But unlike the poor man's strip tease that took place when Chastain
booted the deciding shootout goal in the '99 World Cup, Mellgren
remained in uniform after her winning boot. No matter the signs
sprouting around the Sydney Football Stadium with the highly
un-Olympian message, ``Show Us Your Sports Bra.''
</P>
<P>
   Resulting was a scene that would have once been thought
oxymoronic _ delirious Norwegians
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps a jumping-off place for the team that invented
women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   It's still difficult to believe that the now-familiar crew of
Hamm and Chastain, Foudy and Milbrett, did not defend the Olympic
gold won in Athens. You invest so much in giving women's soccer an
identity, the least you should expect in return is to win
everything in sight before dissolving.
</P>
<P>
   And dissolve this group inevitably will. Mia Hamm and Kristine
Lilly made their debuts with the U.S. team when they were 15 and
16, and it has been 13 hard years of campaigning since. Michelle
Akers has retired, Chastain and Joy Fawcett are 32. A generation of
pioneers is passing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a women's professional soccer league is on the way, but
there'll not be another major international gathering until the
2003 World Cup. The personality of the U.S. team is bound to change
before then.
</P>
<P>
   Putting this bunch in perspective, grandly, was coach April
Heinrichs: ``It would be the equivalent of having Johan Cruyff,
Franz Beckenbauer, George Best and Pele all on the same team, the
same 10 years. No coach will ever have that again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd need a book to explain it, more than a quick answer or
sound bite,'' Heinrichs said. ``They carried the flag for a lot of
women's sports, not just soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   The night was all set up for them to deliver one last,
devastating jolt. Trailing 2-1, Tiffeny Milbrett headed in her
second goal of the night in the very last second of stoppage time.
On to sudden-death extra time. Could another shootout and some
victory display featuring feather boas be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   But this was the one opponent capable of ruining a good time.
Even as the U.S. had beaten the Norwegians 2-0 earlier in the
Olympic competition, it was wary. Norway was the only team to ever
take down the Americans in a major international competition (the
'95 World Cup). The Norsewomen were not intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th minute of overtime, Mellgren struck. It could have
been called a hand ball and no goal as the high pass to the front
of the U.S. net appeared to bounce off Mellgren's arm before her
soft shot got through goalkeeper Siri Mullinix. When it wasn't, the
Americans didn't cuss and spit and pull out their hair, another
reason to honor them.
</P>
<P>
   The critical eye saw Norwegian goalkeeper Bente Nordby outplay
Mullinix (who faced only three shots on goal, stopping none of
them). It saw the Norwegian defense come up large and the U.S.
waste too many opportunities. It saw so much energy expended in
getting that last-second goal that there was little left for
overtime. Nothing left but shock.
</P>
<P>
   The more deliberate eye saw a team proud of what it has done and
eagerly seeking heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost games before in my life,'' Chastain said.
``Ultimately, I don't see us as losers. This team has done more for
this sport than anyone can imagine. That seems like a winner to
me.''

<P>
   SYDNEY _ The improbable run by the U.S. women's volleyball team
ended in the Olympic semifinals Thursday when Russia proved too
tall an order.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian players averaged about 6-foot-3 at the net and
looked like street performers on stilts. They were overpowering on
serves and blocked effectively to win 25-15, 23-25, 25-15, 26-28,
15-8 after the United States fought off two match points in the
fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some moments of greatness,'' said U.S. player Kerri
Walsh. ``Our comeback in Game 4 was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The final set was tied at 7 before the Russians closed out the
match at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Saturday, Russia will
play Cuba, the dominant team for the past decade, for the gold,
while the United States will play Brazil for the bronze. Brazil
defeated the U.S. in four sets during group play.

 &HT;    AirTran, mechanics settle on new contract
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways and its mechanics' union settled on a
new contract Thursday, three days before the current pact would
become amendable.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's 350 mechanics and inspectors, who are represented
by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, must ratify the
five-year agreement and will vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran and the Teamsters came to an agreement quickly
considering that in the airline industry talks between companies
and workers often drag on for years before a pact is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups had informally negotiated since spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the airline was forced to cancel flights, the
company suggested that employees frustrated with talks were causing
a work slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very close to agreeing on the contract last week and
then we had a couple of delays,'' said AirTran Marketing Director
Tad Hutcheson. ``We're extremely pleased with this contract ... we
believe the aircraft mechanics and inspectors will overwhelmingly
ratify it.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTran said the contract calls for higher wages, benefits and
better job security but declined to release details. Teamsters
officials could not be reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first contract renewal for AirTran and its
mechanics. The pilots' contract, which becomes amendable in April,
will be negotiated next.

   WASHINGTON _ If it weren't all so darn patronizing, we female
voters might actually feel spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Much political talk these days has turned to ways of wooing
women's votes. It echoes the mood in the so-called ``year of the
woman'' in 1992 in which more women were sought after. They won
more congressional seats that year than in the previous 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory reflected a pent-up fury at Republican policies of
the prior decade _ policies that many women felt pandered to male
interests and repressed females' economic and legal progress.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later voters responded to modified GOP rhetoric by
pushing many female politicians back into the familiar also-ran
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In the current campaign do we think anything will really change
for most of us when this election is over? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   The two major candidates are treating us again like some
monolithic female army marching in lock-step in response to
programmed political strategies that they think move us, but not
men.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying truth here, however, is that we still aren't
taken seriously. And it's partly our own fault.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that after the Democratic convention women swung to
Vice President Al Gore because of his passionate smooch with wife
Tipper and then swung back last week to Gov. George W. Bush because
of his televised peck on Oprah Winfrey's cheek. That's what polls
seem to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   A visible touch of humanity never hurts a public figure, but the
idea that symbolic or social kissing is what matters most to women
is silly.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have been appearing on daytime and late-night TV
chat shows popular with stay-at-home folks. The theory is that
candidates who want to spend their days running the country must
identify with homemakers who spend their days running the vacuum
cleaner. Neither Gore nor Bush has yet produced a cookie recipe but
Bush has talked about his love of peanut butter sandwiches and Gore
jokes that a union song was his mother's lullaby to him when he was
a baby.
</P>
<P>
   This television frivolity is meant to be a bonding experience
that will result in votes on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have gaggles of advisers trying to understand
women, whom both candidates, in their own campaigns, treat as a
strange species to be allowed only in small numbers into their
inner circles. They've got tokens, but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   The polls are shifting rapidly. So today's figures may not track
tomorrow. But at the moment a Los Angeles Times national poll shows
Bush with a 22-point advantage among men while Gore has a 6-point
advantage among women.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap in which women generally favor Democrats over
Republicans opened in the 1980 campaign, in which Ronald Reagan
concentrated on the getting male vote with macho-oriented policies
that left women out. He did everything but go to a wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   The imbalance has varied through subsequent presidential
campaigns, but the Democrats have consistently done better with
women than the Republicans, and they, in turn, have consistently
done better with men.
</P>
<P>
   Current surveys indicate that married women prefer Bush to Gore
and unmarried women prefer Gore to Bush. There are several theories
as to why this is so, but mostly it has to do with economics.
</P>
<P>
   Married women tend to have higher income and feel more secure.
They tend to be less sympathetic toward paying taxes for federal
social programs. Single or divorced women are more inclined toward
Democratic-backed initiatives such as a hike in the minimum wage,
day-care tax credits, family leave and support programs for
low-income elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing for female votes, Gore opts heavily for
family-oriented policy arguments, stressing those issues that
resonate with many women: gun control, abortion choice, aid for
college tuition, help for underfunded public schools, protection of
Medicare and new prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has problems with many women on the issues because he
opposes most gun control and abortion and favors plans to partially
privatize Social Security and provide taxpayer-paid vouchers to
parents to enable them to abandon bad public schools.
</P>
<P>
   He seldom talks about abortion and softens his education
language to avoid the word ``vouchers,'' talking instead about
discipline and instilling moral values.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also says that ``women are very discerning people. They are
going to ask the question, `What is the person's heart like?'''
</P>
<P>
   No, governor, this will never do. We're not choosing a lifetime
soul-mate with a heart full of love. We're picking a president,
heaven help us.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to ask, ``What are the person's policies like? Will
they help us or hurt us?'' And that's what men are going to ask
too.

   NEW YORK _ It is late morning on a muggy day in August. Most of
New York City seems to be rushing to appointments or toiling in
air-conditioned offices. But in a cramped, dusty East Village space
on 13th Street, four people who make their lives working in the
theater are talking about a hat.
</P>
<P>
   This is a costume meeting for the Classic Stage Company's
production of ``I Will Bear Witness,'' a one-man adaptation of the
diaries of Victor Klemperer. ``Witness'' is one of four productions
that make up the company's current season, and this meeting is one
of the countless, painstaking rituals of preparation that the
company has gone through over the last several months to make it
all come together.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit theater's season planning is a craft all its own,
one of mundane logistical maneuvering as well as lofty creative
ambition; of sleepless-night angst and pride-swelling triumph; of
big-picture matters like building audiences and details as precise
as choosing a hat. It's a balancing act of egos, schedules, budgets
and creative visions. The process is happening at theaters all over
the country and at many in New York, but it formally begins in
earnest in the spring and ends in the fall. The planning is
conducted at many levels, depending on an institution's finances.
It almost always involves a deep and consuming commitment of
passion and time.
</P>
<P>
   At the 33-year-old Classic Stage Company, which has an operating
budget of $1.3 million and is on a par with off-Broadway companies
like the Atlantic and the Vineyard, the first offering of this
season, ``Texts for Nothing,'' started previews Wednesday and opens
on Oct. 15. It is a one-man performance of prose pieces by Samuel
Beckett featuring and directed by Bill Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   After that is ``Race'' by Ferdinand Bruckner, about the effects
of the Nazis' election on a group of medical students in Germany in
1933. This will be performed in repertory in February and March
with ``I Will Bear Witness,'' which was adapted for the stage by
Karen Malpede and George Bartenieff and will be performed by
Bartenieff.
</P>
<P>
   These will be followed by ``In the Penal Colony,'' a
music-theater work by Philip Glass based on Kafka's story, which
will run in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this theater company create its season over the last
six months offers a window into not only the running of a small
nonprofit institution but also the making of art.
</P>
<P>
   MARCH
</P>
<P>
   When Barry Edelstein, 35, was selected to be the artistic
director of the Classic Stage Company in 1998, one of first things
he did was call artists he had worked with in the past to say,
essentially, ``I'm running this theater now; come work with me.''
The first of them was Irwin, perhaps best known for his performance
with David Shiner in the hit Broadway show ``Fool Moon.'' Irwin had
performed a version of ``Texts,'' developed by Joseph Chaikin, in
1991 at the Public Theater. He wanted to go a little further with
the Beckett play, in which he brings his clowning skills to
portraying a tramplike figure searching for his place in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, everything looks like a go: scheduling has been
worked out, and the theater has agreed to Irwin's idea of building
a large hillside with water and real dirt. Doug Stein will design
the set. The one sticking point is getting the rights to the
material from the Beckett estate, famously zealous in controlling
the staging of the playwright's works.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has had an exchange of letters with Beckett's nephew,
Edward, in which Beckett has expressed some reservations about the
project. In particular, he is opposed to any changes, and Irwin had
hoped to perform 5 of the 13 original texts with a few minor
excisions for pacing. This is nail-biting time; will Irwin get the
green light or won't he?
</P>
<P>
   It looks promising, but projects do sometimes fall through. In
just a few weeks, Classic Stage's original choice for its fourth
slot, an adaptation of Ovid's ``Metamorphoses,'' which takes place
in a giant swimming pool, will evaporate because of scheduling
problems with the director, Mary Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing material, Edelstein says, several considerations are
at work. First of all is scheduling. That includes questions like
``Is so-and-so free then?'' and ``Who's going to come downtown in
May to see a play about the Nazis?'' But more important is the
composition of a season. Classic Stage's mission is to present
classics for contemporary American audiences, which means rewriting
and reimagining works that already exist. The company's last two
seasons have included ``Naked,'' by Luigi Pirandello; Beckett's
``Waiting for Godot''; and ``The Misanthrope'' by Moliere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes my job exciting,'' Edelstein says. ``You're
dealing at an incredibly abstract level with big philosophical
questions: What is a classic? How does time intervene to change a
piece of art? Then you have to find a community of artists who have
perspective on that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to talk about is the deep inner heart of the
play _ the way men and women relate, the way that power works, the
questions that are at the heart of what the drama is talking
about,'' Edelstein continues. ``You can slap a three-piece suit on
Hamlet; does that make a contemporary work? I don't think so. Yes,
these plays survive across time. But aspects of these plays don't,
and when they don't you learn that society has changed. So thinking
about a play from 400 years ago, you have an opportunity to think
about our world.'' (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   APRIL
</P>
<P>
   In planning a season, a theater also has ticket sales to
consider, and featuring stars can help get people in the door. In
the two seasons that Edelstein has been at Classic Stage, the
company has featured Uma Thurman, Mira Sorvino and John Turturro.
But he is frustrated because some people now associate Classic
Stage with celebrities. ``Those are the ones that generate
attention,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to cast the best actor for the part,'' he
adds. ``Of course, it's also to explore exciting people we think
audiences are going to want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars also matter to Beth Emelson, 34, Edelstein's partner as
the company's producing director, because she is concerned with
building Classic Stage's audiences. ``Beth's challenge to me,''
Edelstein says, ``was, `Give me two names people know in each
season brochure.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether because of big names or because they simply like the
shows, more and more people are coming to Classic Stage these days.
In the last two years, the theater's membership has increased to
1,200 from 224. Classic Stage members _ who tend to be between the
ages of 25 and 45 _ pay $25 a year and see any play for $20.
</P>
<P>
   Growth is important to the company because more money will allow
for more shows with longer runs and larger casts. This year the
theater's operating budget has grown to $1.3 million from $500,000.
Emelson and Edelstein concluded their first year at the company
with a surplus of $250,000, which was used to help pay off an
eight-year debt of about $100,000, to increase the staff to seven
from three, to buy computers and to upgrade dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Without an advertising budget, Classic Stage has to be creative
about getting the word out. Emelson devotes much of her time to
reaching out to the Union Square neighborhood. She makes contact
with colleges in the area like New York University, the New School
and Baruch College, puts up posters in dormitories, gets material
about the theater into orientation packets and speaks to professors
about incorporating Classic Stage productions into the curriculum.
This season, for example, Emelson has been talking to the German
department at New York University about organizing a conference
around Holocaust drama in connection with ``Race'' and ``Witness.''
``It's a wasted opportunity if we don't,'' Emelson says.
</P>
<P>
   Other Classic Stage efforts include special student matinees for
high school students; a program called Classic Stages/New Visions
that presents new works on classic themes; Saturday symposiums at
which scholars talk about topics related to a current Classic Stage
play; and Tuesday Talks, at which the actors and designers meet
with the audience after a show.
</P>
<P>
   In April the company started a Web site, www.classicstage.org.
MAY
</P>
<P>
   Construction is about to begin. For the 33 years that Classic
Stage has occupied a former stable on East 13th Street, no
productions have been mounted in the summer because the theater had
no air-conditioning and the heat was too much for audiences to
bear. (Legend has it that during one season that ran into June,
Turturro was forced to perform Brecht in a full-length leather coat
on a 115-degree day and that the theater's board members had to
spritz the audience.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to an $850,000 capital campaign that is also paying
for a new lobby, renovated bathrooms and a raised ceiling, the
theater will have not only central air but also central heat. In
the past the theater used two gigantic gas blowers that were so
loud they could be used only before performances and at
intermission. While it may seem to most like an incidental upgrade,
to the theater it is a seismic change; whereas Classic Stage
functions 12 months of the year, it has been able to earn money
only during seven _ from October through April. Now the theater
will be able to produce shows year-round _ renting the space out to
others as well as producing its own _ and its directors can hardly
contain their excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it's a brand-new day in terms of what the calendar
looks like,'' Emelson says. ``Up till now, a key resource in
planning the season was the Farmer's Almanac _ what's it going to
be like outside? And those days, happily, are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Classic Stage was founded by Christopher Martin, who was
followed as artistic director by Carey Perloff, then David
Esbjornson. In June 1998, Edelstein heard that the position was
open, threw his hat into the ring and got the job.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein, born and reared in Fairlawn, N.J., is a cerebral man
with wire-rimmed glasses. He majored in drama at Tufts University,
where he started directing, and on graduating in 1986 won a Rhodes
Scholarship and earned a master's in philosophy from Oxford
University, where he specialized in Shakespeare. After another year
in London, Edelstein came to New York, worked at the Public Theater
under Joseph Papp, taught Shakespearean acting at Juilliard and
began directing. He eventually built a career as a freelance
director _ working at Williamstown Theater Festival, the Roundabout
Theater Company and the Public _ and he continues to direct plays.
He did ``Julius Caesar'' in Central Park this summer and will do
``Race,'' which he also adapted, at Classic Stage.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein says he wanted to run a theater because he was
interested in having more control over his career. ``This is a
place where I can do work I believe in on my own terms,'' he says.
``I have a home now.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Emelson both call their partnership strong, saying they
consult on every decision, from the color of the lobby to how many
season brochures to print and how best to approach a certain actor.
</P>
<P>
   Emelson, who radiates warmth and organization, is from
California, Pa., the daughter of arts educators. She moved to New
York City 14 years ago to attend NYU, where she earned a degree in
arts administration and theater management. Then came work at the
Public, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Lincoln Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain satisfaction in selling tickets and raising
money _ that's part of the job, that's what's expected,'' Emelson
says. ``But the part I most enjoy is working with writers and
directors.'' June
</P>
<P>
   With the Ovid play now off the schedule, Classic Stage is
casting about for a production to fill its final slot. The company
has had a reading of Neal Bell's play ``Monster,'' an adaptation of
Mary Shelley's ``Frankenstein.'' Another possibility is ``In the
Penal Colony,'' a new music-theater piece by Philip Glass, directed
by JoAnne Akalaitis, with scenery by John Conklin and lighting by
Jennifer Tipton _ what Edelstein calls a ``dream team of the
avant-garde theater.'' The production is being staged first at A
Contemporary Theater in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Stage decides to go with the latter, excited to present
the production's New York premiere and relieved that the season is
finally set, though a bit nervous about pulling off something so
ambitious. The show requires a live quintet _ which may turn out to
be imported from Europe _ two opera singers and three actors.
``Nobody else in his right mind would try to do it,'' Edelstein
says.
</P>
<P>
   What Edelstein is not worried about at this point is the fact
that the season as a whole is looking grim, with two Holocaust
plays and an opera about capital punishment coming on the heels of
Beckett. Edelstein says he simply needs to feel good about each
individual project _ and he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own philosophy is, in New York the whole notion of season
planning is different,'' he says. ``In a city where you're the one
major professional theater and there are five smaller theaters,
then I think you know your 20,000 subscribers are going to see your
entire season and in that case a pu pu platter is a good idea _ a
little of this, a little of that. In New York, people don't
experience theater in a seasonal way. You have members who see
everything, and we do. But they are a relatively small proportion
of our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Edelstein says, he is not concerned with how the plays
he selects relate to one another; he doesn't plan a season around a
theme or any other common thread. ``There are people who regard
season planning as a curatorial activity,'' he says. ``They've got
to have these five plays dealing with war, or one play for every
decade of the 20th century. Our view of this season is, `Let's get
great projects, each one of which is a legitimate response to our
mission.'''

 &HT;    AVIATION OFFICIALS REASSURE CONGRESS THEY ARE WORKING TO EASE
CONGESTION
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories
 &HT;    By KAVITA KUMAR
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a summer of frustrating delays, aviation
officials reassured members of Congress on Thursday they are
working to alleviate the congestion at the nation's busiest
airports.
</P>
<P>
   While the situation of the past few months _ the worst in five
years _ can be mostly attributed to bad weather and airline labor
disputes, officials said the delays passengers have experienced are
part of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather simply exacerbates the problems that airports are
already experiencing in terms of congestion,'' said Benjamin
DeCosta, general manager of Atlanta's Hartsfield, widely regarded
as the world's busiest airport. He was testifying before a House
Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more travelers take to the nation's skies every year
because of the robust economy, airports are straining to
accommodate the increased demand on their runways. And air traffic
controllers are struggling to efficiently guide planes through
increasingly crowded skies.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) forecasts that airline
passenger traffic will more than double in the next ten years. That
translates to as much as 70 percent of projected traffic growth at
the nation's 30 largest airports.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to reducing delays at Hartsfield, DeCosta said,
is its $5.4 billion expansion project which includes plans for a
fifth runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the fifth runway today, our average time of delay
would be cut in half,'' DeCosta said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., asked that FAA officials work with
Hartsfield to help get the runway approved as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will definitely work with you to help you,'' responded
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who also testified.
</P>
<P>
   But building new runways, which often are opposed by local
communities or are challenged on environmental grounds, is not a
panacea to the problem of air traffic delays, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And, it takes years for new runways to materialize. Hartsfield's
fifth runway isn't due for completion until 2005, DeCosta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on the short-term and on less controversial
things now,'' said FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. ``So we're
looking for those things _ the low-lying fruits, if you will _ that
can help us in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater said the FAA is using more advanced technologies to
modernize the air traffic control system which he said ``will
improve the controllers' ability to manage increasing levels of
traffic.'' The agency hopes to ease congestion by routing more U.S.
flights through Canadian airspace and by using lower altitude
routes which Garvey likened to ``opening up a new highway''.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has also identified the top seven choke points _
including Atlanta _ and has developed routes, approaches and
procedures to reduce congestion in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling more flights during non-peak hours and offering
financial incentives to passengers for those flights were some
other solutions thrown out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Slater seemed unwilling to start regulating how airlines
schedule their flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken an approach where we bring airlines and heads of
airports together to deal with overbooking,'' he said. ``We wish to
do it in a way that recognizes all the benefits that have come from
a deregulated industry'' where the federal government has eased its
control over scheduling and routes.
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta said Hartsfield has worked with Delta to modify its
flight schedule. More flights are now scheduled during the non-peak
hours in the early morning and late evening, he said. But it's
still unclear what sort of an impact this shuffling has had on
delays at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury's still out on that one,'' DeCosta said.

   NEW YORK: our mission. ''' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JULY
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on ``Texts'' at the theater, amid the scaffolding
and rubble of renovation, Irwin says he is optimistic about getting
the necessary approval from Edward Beckett. ``I think we're in good
shape,'' he says. ``I think I see my way clear to sending him
something he will say yes to.'' Irwin is also clearly excited about
the prose pieces from the original book, ``Stories and Texts for
Nothing,'' that he has selected. ``Like the continent of Africa,''
he says. ``The more I read them, the deeper I can go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His respect for you as an artist is so profound that he's
going to say yes,'' Edelstein predicts hopefully. Later in the
month Beckett faxes Classic Stage permission to go ahead, but Irwin
ultimately decides to perform the pieces without any cuts.
</P>
<P>
   They discuss the blurb about the play that will appear in the
brochure. Irwin worries that it promises too much in the way of
humor and suggests ``a drier tone.'' Edelstein says he has a drier
version but adds that the idea is to get people to come. ``The
preference has been to do a zippier version in the season
brochure,'' he explains. ``I'm stressing witty because our season
is Nazis and capital punishment. The comedy highlight is Samuel
Beckett.''
</P>
<P>
   Appreciating this, Irwin nevertheless persists. ``I would
hate,'' he says, ``to set up a false expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   The blurb ends up being toned down.
</P>
<P>
   They go on to discuss costume designers. Will one be too busy
because she is also doing a Broadway show? Another knows period
costumes well, another has done Woody Allen films. ``You should
meet them,'' Edelstein advises Irwin, ``and make the call.'' Irwin
later decides on Anita Yavich.
</P>
<P>
   Then they talk about sound designers. Is this one ``too
composery''? And stage managers. Is that one tough enough or too
nice?
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Texts'' is a one-man show, Irwin _ whose work
includes unorthodox physical techniques _ is interested in
exploring the possibility of featuring a second set of hands that
resemble his own. This idea is later eliminated, but for now the
creative people worry about getting someone to take the job. ``I
couldn't get a 50-year-old man to play Julius Caesar,'' Edelstein
quips. ``I don't know how we're going to get a 50-year-old guy to
play a hand for half the money.''
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   George Bartenieff discovered the brown fedora in a bin at the
Barneys warehouse sale, and he is proud of the find; it is just
right, he says, to help capture the painful transformation of his
character, Victor Klemperer in ``I Will Bear Witness,'' from a
distinguished scholar to just another downtrodden Jew suffering
through the Holocaust with a yellow star sewn into his coat over
his heart. ``A professor in his society was at the top of the
rung,'' Bartenieff explains at the costume meeting in the temporary
offices the company is using while the theater is being renovated.
``Even if he went into a grocer, they would call him professor.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Classic Stage's production team gathers to talk
nitty-gritty numbers. In addition to Edelstein and Emelson, those
present are Angela Wendt, the costume designer for ``Race'' and
``Witness''; Rachel M. Tischler, the theater's new general manager;
and Ian Tresselt, production manager.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt asks what her budget will be for the two shows. ``The
whopping sum of $9,000 for both,'' Tischler reports. But Wendt, who
designed ``Rent'' on Broadway, doesn't blink. Somehow, actors,
directors and designers who work in the big time are also willing
to lend their talents to a theater like Classic Stage for
considerably less than their normal fees. Edelstein and Emelson
often say it's because they make up in personal attention what they
can't offer in compensation. But the creative people say it's
because they simply go where the good work is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most exciting forays I've every made,''
Irwin says. ``And it's as well supported here as it could be
anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mortgage,'' Irwin adds, ``will have to be paid by some
other kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Classic Stage to give a progress report to its
board. A table eeeeeeeeefor the evening meeting has been set up in
the lobby _ with hard hats as a humorous centerpiece. Emelson,
typically covered with sawdust of late, is wearing high heels and
pearls. Although ``Texts'' is to start performances in just a week
and power tools are still whirring in the background, she seems
typically upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the eternal optimist of Beth Emelson ends up
coming into play,'' she says. ``I really feel it's going to all get
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at this point hasn't been easy. Emelson and Edelstein
have been putting in 14-hour days, 7 days a week. The schedule does
not promise to get much lighter; both try to be in the lobby to
greet people at nearly every performance. ``It's important for an
audience not to perceive the theater as faceless,'' Edelstein says.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is also on to raise money; this is the time of year
that theaters make their big push to find financing. Emelson says
she has sent out 130 proposals and letters seeking support from
government agencies, corporations and individuals. In the first few
months of running the theater, Emelson and Edelstein met ``with
anybody who would open the door,'' she says. ``We were out there
all the time with our dog-and-pony show.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they have established some reliable donors, but they never
stop worrying about money and would like to build up a considerable
cash reserve ``so the panic moments don't shake the place quite as
much as they can,'' Edelstein says.
</P>
<P>
   It is working on projects like Irwin's, he explains, that makes
all this worthwhile. ``Watching Bill is an incredible treat,''
Edelstein says. ``That's why I got into this, to be around artists
like that. You watch him step onto that mountain and you can't
believe your eyes. All the rest _ waiting for permits to come,
sweating out the cash flow _ recedes far into the background when
Bill Irwin does some crazy move with his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein says there is no shortage of things to be nervous
about: Will the renovation be finished? Will the season stick? Will
people buy tickets? Will critics like the shows? Will audiences
show up? ``There's always something to keep you awake at night, to
turn your hair gray,'' says Edelstein, whose hair does seem to be
looking a little grayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sleeping because I'd much rather be awake,'' he adds.
``I love what I do when I wake up in the morning. So who needs to
sleep? I'd rather be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is a moment for Classic Stage that happens to be
full of promise, when all the pieces seem as if they might actually
have fallen into place. ``What a relief, we've got a season,''
Edelstein says. ``And there you go _ we're finished.''

 &HT;    AVIATION OFFICIALS REASSURE CONGRESS THEY ARE WORKING TO EASE
CONGESTION
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories
 &HT;    By KAVITA KUMAR
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a summer of frustrating delays, aviation
officials reassured members of Congress on Thursday they are
working to alleviate the congestion at the nation's busiest
airports.
</P>
<P>
   While the situation of the past few months _ the worst in five
years _ can be mostly attributed to bad weather and airline labor
disputes, officials said the delays passengers have experienced are
part of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather simply exacerbates the problems that airports are
already experiencing in terms of congestion,'' said Benjamin
DeCosta, general manager of Atlanta's Hartsfield, widely regarded
as the world's busiest airport. He was testifying before a House
Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more travelers take to the nation's skies every year
because of the robust economy, airports are straining to
accommodate the increased demand on their runways. And air traffic
controllers are struggling to efficiently guide planes through
increasingly crowded skies.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) forecasts that airline
passenger traffic will more than double in the next ten years. That
translates to as much as 70 percent of projected traffic growth at
the nation's 30 largest airports.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to reducing delays at Hartsfield, DeCosta said,
is its $5.4 billion expansion project which includes plans for a
fifth runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the fifth runway today, our average time of delay
would be cut in half,'' DeCosta said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., asked that FAA officials work with
Hartsfield to help get the runway approved as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will definitely work with you to help you,'' responded
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who also testified.
</P>
<P>
   But building new runways, which often are opposed by local
communities or are challenged on environmental grounds, is not a
panacea to the problem of air traffic delays, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And, it takes years for new runways to materialize. Hartsfield's
fifth runway isn't due for completion until 2005, DeCosta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on the short-term and on less controversial
things now,'' said FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. ``So we're
looking for those things _ the low-lying fruits, if you will _ that
can help us in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater said the FAA is using more advanced technologies to
modernize the air traffic control system which he said ``will
improve the controllers' ability to manage increasing levels of
traffic.'' The agency hopes to ease congestion by routing more U.S.
flights through Canadian airspace and by using lower altitude
routes which Garvey likened to ``opening up a new highway''.
</P>

   The FAA has also identified the top seven choke points _
including Atlanta _ and has developed routes, approaches and
procedures to reduce congestion in those areas.
</P>

hours in the early morning and late evening, he said. But it's
still unclear what sort of an impact this shuffling has had on
delays at Hartsfield.

``REMEMBER THE TITANS'' MAY BE THE MOST MOVING AND ENTERTAINING
MOVIE SO FAR THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
``Remember the Titans'' is set in the early 1970s, but perhaps
because it deals with race and football _ those eternal verities _
it feels as up-to-the-minute as this week's game. Some things never
change.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This would seem to contradict the point of this rousing movie,
which is all (begin ital) about (end ital) change, but really it
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   By turns hilarious, moving and action-filled, ``Titans'' is
based on a true story of the struggle surrounding a white high
school team absorbing its first black players. Its true subject,
however, is transcendence, the way personal struggle can transform
society. That the movie feels less like history than current events
doesn't invalidate its premise. It doesn't pretend change is easy;
it never says it's not an ongoing struggle.
</P>
<P>
   To speak of this movie in sociological terms is to do it a
disservice, though. Make no mistake: ``Titans'' rocks. It marries
the verve and fireworks of a popcorn movie with serious social
drama. When is the last time Hollywood made such a shrewdly crafted
tale that turned a subject so potentially dull and polarizing into
a rollicking good time?
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from getting snubbed at the Oscars for his dynamite
performance as a real-life boxer in ``Hurricane,'' Denzel
Washington is no less impressive here without beard, shaved head
and boxer's body in a human-scale role.
</P>
<P>
   He is Herman Boone, a high school football coach from North
Carolina who gets appointed assistant coach in the racially
explosive school district in Alexandria, Va. The black and the
white high schools have just been merged, and against a backdrop of
protests and rioting, he becomes an unwitting political pawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the answer to your prayers,'' he tells black
supporters. ``I'm not the savior, Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King
or the Easter Bunny. I'm just a football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But first-time screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard was smart
enough to see that in the boiling cauldron of racial integration,
in this town in his native Virginia, football (begin ital) was (end
ital) the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The sports-as-metaphor notion is nothing new. What schoolkid
hasn't been drilled on how competition builds character and
prepares one for life, yadda, yadda? But the filmmakers were
rigorous in constructing this football program to act as stand-in
for society at large. It might be obvious, but it works.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, Boone is named head coach over the much-loved Bill
Yoast (Will Patton). White players and assistant coaches
predictably rebel. The majority white school board only hired Boone
to appease angry blacks; now they're setting him up to fail.
</P>
<P>
   But as he says at a particularly low point late in the story:
``I'm a winner. I win.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone might be a tad too proud, but he's no fool. To save the
program, he asks Yoast to stay on as assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Determined that his players work together to forge a winning
team, he drives them, mercilessly, relentlessly. Watching this, you
can't help but ask whether this sort of social engineering can
work. Aren't some things beyond the scope of legislation or edict?
</P>
<P>
   What the real-life Boone found, and the movie shows us, is only
the love of the game could get his players to transcend their
differences and animosities. They hated each other's music and
everything else, but when they focused on football the rest fell
away.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who specializes in
loud, fast-paced, brain-dead action movies such as ``Armageddon''
and ``Gone in Sixty Seconds.'' He's made more serious films, too,
but the formulaic social commentary of his ``Dangerous Minds''
doesn't prepare one for ``Titans.'' It's slick Hollywood product,
all right, but it also may be the most moving and entertaining
movie so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Director Boaz Yakin and Howard have carefully weighted the moral
balance _ the movie is never black and white even though the
conflict is. The film establishes a symmetry between Boone and
Yoast by giving them corresponding scenes early in the movie, but
it never loses sight of what is just. It doesn't make the mistake
of making obstinacy seem noble.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the townspeople opposed to Boone are out-and-out racists
and easy villains, and the movie doesn't stint on portraying them
as such. Yoast, though, is a decent person caught up in difficult
times. We understand his resentment, and even when we wish he were
more understanding, we don't hate him.
</P>
<P>
   For years, movies like this distorted stories about race by
making white people the focus, even when the black side would be
more compelling. Washington is unquestionably the star of this
movie, and it's right that his Herman Boone is the focus. But
despite wavering moments, he is a solid rock. Dramatically
speaking, it is Patton's character that undergoes the more profound
change.
</P>
<P>
   Yoast is a victim here, every bit as much as the black people
who have been locked out of jobs and opportunity. Boone
acknowledges as much when he at first turns down the head coach
job. He'd been passed over too many times on account of race to be
party to it now, he says. He takes the job out of duty, because his
community demands it.
</P>
<P>
   Yoast, a church deacon, must overcome his anger and resist the
temptation to hate. His emotional growth over the course of the
movie, and that of the black and white teen-age players, is what
gives this film its heart.
</P>
<P>
   The most vividly drawn white players are angry and threatened,
and they keep lashing out at the folks they feel are taking over
their school and their team. They never become an undifferentiated
mass, though. The script introduces us to other players, whites new
to the area who don't have the same racial baggage and so are able
to relate to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers also are careful to balance the heavy moments
with humor and to balance that with football action.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics might dismiss this as just another fairy tale about a
subject rich filmmakers know nothing about. But while Hollywood
conventions do sometimes slip into view and the uplift at times
becomes strained, the story feels like it was built upon a bedrock
of truth.
</P>
<P>
   The racial brotherhood at the end seems too good to be true, but
it's hard to scoff when you're all choked up. &QL;

<P>
   The following games will be played this week in the National
Football League:
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK (SUNDAY 4 P.M.)
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (3-1) at Washington (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers lose to the Jets, and all of a sudden Tampa Bay
is the Cincinnati Bengals. Everyone relax. The Buccaneers are still
a Super Bowl-caliber team. Still, they will have a difficult time
at Washington because the Redskins are feeling more confident these
days. Linebacker LaVar Arrington gets the start, and he will make
some plays, as will quarterback Brad Johnson. But this is a bad
week to play Tampa Bay. The players are angry, especially the
defense, and feel they have something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Buccaneers, 20-12
</P>
<P>
   1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (3-1) at Cleveland (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this season, many throughout the league felt that
quarterback Tony Banks was the weak link of this team. Banks is
changing people's minds quickly. He has won 7 of his past 9 starts,
and has been a mature, patient leader the team respects. The
defense of the Ravens is finally coming around after a rough start.
Overall it has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in the past 21 games _
tops in the conference. This year Baltimore has allowed a
league-low 5 redzone trips.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Ravens, 28-6
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (1-3) at Carolina (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   The smart, yet cold-hearted, thing to do with a Cowboys offense
that is completely melting down would be to bench quarterback Troy
Aikman and start backup Randall Cunningham. Aikman is a champion
and future Hall of Famer, and he deserves respect, but the harsh
truth is the offense flows better with Cunningham at the helm.
Carolina, after a disappointing start, is due for a breakout game.
This is the week it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Panthers, 21-13
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (2-1) at Buffalo (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   After the pasting quarterback Peyton Manning and the Colts put
on a pretty good Jacksonville team, the Colts made a major
statement to the rest of the league: The Rams and Buccaneers are
good, but so are we. They would make an even bigger statement by
traveling to Buffalo and beating the Bills, which will be
difficult, but will happen, mainly because Buffalo doesn't have the
offense to keep up with Indianapolis. The game will be extremely
close because Buffalo has good corners and speedy linebackers and
has won 8 of 9 at home against the AFC East. But the feeling now is
that Indianapolis is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Colts, 16-13
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (3-0) at Detroit (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   Rookie quarterback Daunte Culpepper is for real. So are the
Vikings. The offense is clicking as usual, but it is the defense
that is the surprise. Minnesota is allowing 300.3 yards per game.
No, the Vikings aren't the Buccaneers, but that number is down from
373.7 yards a game through three games last season. The Vikings'
defense keeps the Lions in check. Minnesota Coach Dennis Green
getting a three-year contract extension gives the Vikings an
emotional edge.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Vikings, 28-21
</P>
<P>
   Giants (3-1) at Tennessee (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   On the surface this looks like a loss for the Giants. Tennessee
has won three in a row and 8 of the last 10 games. Quarterback
Steve McNair has almost fully recovered from a bruised sternum and
running back Eddie George is one of the most intimidating offensive
players in football. But here is why the Giants will win. Tennessee
makes its living running the ball, and the Giants have enough
quickness, and toughness, on defense to slow down George. And the
Giants' weakest link, its secondary, won't be challenged by a
passing offense where the tight end is the leading receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Giants, 15-13
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (0-3) at Jacksonville (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh quarterback Kent Graham is hurting all over, dealing
with all kinds of sore body parts, so expect to see backup Kordell
Stewart at some point in the game. The Steelers will take advantage
of the Jaguars' cornerbacks, playing the worst pass defense in the
conference. But Jacksonville is dominant at home and prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Jaguars, 28-12
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (0-4) at St. Louis (4-0)
</P>
<P>
   The numbers St. Louis is putting up are stunning. The offense
has scored 30-plus points 10 straight games. The Rams have scored
160 points and are on pace for 640, which would shatter the league
record set by Minnesota in 1998 by 84 points. Quarterback Kurt
Warner has thrown for four consecutive 300-yard games. With all due
respect to the Chargers and their good little defense, the team has
no chance against that kind of firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Rams, 35-16
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Miami (3-1) at Cincinnati (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   At 63, Cincinnati interim coach Dick LeBeau is the oldest rookie
head coach in 30 years. Unfortunately for LeBeau there is no time
to celebrate. He has a lot of work to do with a Bengals team that
is in total disarray after the resignation of coach Bruce Coslet.
Miami has allowed just 22 total points while Cincinnati has scored
a total of only 7. This game is ugly, ugly, ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Dolphins, 25-6
</P>
<P>
   New England (0-4) at Denver (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Denver quarterback Brian Griese has postponed possible shoulder
surgery until the end of the season, and that is good news for the
Broncos. That is, if the shoulder holds up. His backup, Gus
Frerotte, is far below average. If Griese plays the entire game,
Denver wins. If not, the Patriots get a much-needed victory.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Broncos, 22-14
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (1-2) at San Francisco (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens says he was praying when he
twice ran to midfield last week after scoring touchdowns. Lame
excuse. Owens' hot-dogging overshadowed two things. First, San
Francisco quarterback Jeff Garcia is playing well, and has four,
multi-touchdown games in his past five, and has a passer rating of
100.6, second in the conference. And Owens has three touchdowns in
his past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: 49ers, 28-17
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (0-4) at Green Bay (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Bears is that they don't know what they
want do offensively. The scheme sometimes resembles that of a
Division 1-AA college-lots of misdirection and trick plays. In
other words, it is a pubescent West Coast offense. Whatever
happened to just running the football up the middle? In eight
career home games against Chicago, Packers quarterback Brett Favre
has averaged a 97.3 passer rating and owns a 6-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Packers, 20-13
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (2-2) at Philadelphia (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Yawn. The Falcons will run the ball until Jamal Anderson can't
run any more, and then see lots of Eagles running back Duce Staley.
The Eagles have the better defense. That's why they win.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Eagles, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (2-2) at Kansas City (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   It is always difficult to win at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs
are still euphoric after their sizzling victory at Denver last
week. Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac, 11-6 as a starter
against division opponents, is playing well now. He's the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Chiefs, 18-10

IN LOCKERBIE CASE, DEFENSE TRIES DISCREDITING LIBYAN TURNCOAT AND
FBI AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ The testimony of a Libyan double-agent
considered the star witness in the Lockerbie trial ended Thursday
after defense lawyers accused him of being not only a liar, but
also a black-market currency dealer and an opportunist hoping for
the $4 million reward offered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But his closing morning on the witness stand was somewhat
overshadowed later in the day by a set of odd and hostile exchanges
between the defense and an agent of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agent, Harold Hendershot, has been part of the Lockerbie
case since the early days, watching search teams pick up pieces of
Pan Am 103 on the Scottish moors. He was called Thursday by the
prosecution, apparently to bolster details of testimony given by
Abdul Majid Giaka, the Libyan turncoat who had just been subjected
to two days of withering cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few minutes, Hendershot explained how, in an
interview aboard an American warship off the Mediterranean island
of Malta in July 1991, Giaka claimed he saw the defendants, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, in late 1988. They
were carrying a brown Samsonite suitcase through customs at the
Malta airport, Giaka said.
</P>
<P>
   The point is important because the defense asserts that Giaka
made up the incident in 1991 in a bid to get the FBI to adopt him
as a protected witness. Investigators believe that the bomb that
blew up Pan Am 103, killing 270 people, was in a brown plastic
suitcase checked in as unaccompanied luggage in Malta.
</P>
<P>
   Hendershot said he remembered that Giaka was ``very general''
about the date in his July 1991 interview, saying he had seen the
suitcase sometime between October and December 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka later became more specific, claiming to remember the exact
date and giving other details about the day.
</P>
<P>
   But when the defense began to cross-examine Hendershot, he
became vague about details of his own investigation. He even
answered that he did not remember whether one suspect he tried to
interview had spit in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Defense's questioning of Hendershot, shifted focus away from the
Libyans. The defense's theory is that Pan Am 103 was blown up by a
Palestinian terrorist cell based in Germany working with another in
Sweden. Scottish investigators have said the German group was their
prime suspects for many months, until attention shifted to the
Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorneys, William Taylor and Richard Keen, asked
Hendershot about a trip he took to Sweden in 1989 to investigate
the Palestinian group led by Mohammed Abu Talb, who was in prison
there for other bombings. He confirmed that he had asked the
Swedish police to get a warrant to search Talb's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But Hendershot repeatedly answered ``I don't recall'' to
questions about the contents of Talb's apartment: whether it
contained disassembled clocks and watches and barometric devices _
all potential bomb triggers; whether it contained clothing made in
Malta, as clothing wrapped around the Lockerbie bomb was; or
whether it contained a calendar with a circle around the date of
the bombing, Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Keen voiced skepticism about Hendershot's vague recollection and
the agent's contention that he had not taken any notes during the
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that unusual,'' Keen asked, ``for an FBI agent to attend
a search and not take notes?''
</P>
<P>
   Hendershot replied that notes might not be taken when the search
was in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   As for Giaka's cross-examination, Keen asked him at one point to
explain why he had told the CIA that he had been reduced to black
market currency trading to support his family.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka denied both having traded on the black market and denied
having told the agency that he had. When challenged with a CIA
cable noting their record, Giaka delved into a long explanation of
private currency trades in Malta and Libya, and said he had made
them, but that he didn't considered it black market trading because
he did not charge inflated commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan, who as a protected witness arrived guarded by U.S.
marshals in a small motorcade that struggled to evade
photographers, left the courthouse in midafternoon Thursday and
presumably returned to the United States, though a court spokesman
declined to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clare Connelly, a criminal law professor who heads the
University of Glasgow's team observing the trial, said Giaka's
three days of testimony had been problematic.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had ``dented his credibility'' by making him seem
motivated by a desire for money and American citizenship, she said,
``but whether that would result in obliterating all his evidence is
dependent on how the judges respond.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed it to be premature to theorize that the
prosecution's case was discredited, which was the characterization
provided Tuesday by Prof. Robert Black at the University of
Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has been sparsely attended for weeks, but the public
gallery was fairly full this week with families of the victims.

 &HT;    HOUSE PANEL APPROVES BILL TO BAN SALE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS
 &HT;    By MEGAN K. DOYLE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to reduce identity theft, a House
committee voted unanimously Thursday to prohibit the sale of Social
Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican from
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., would make it illegal to sell or purchase
Social Security numbers, which are commonly sold by financial and
credit institutions. It also would ban the use of these numbers on
driver's licenses, government checks, employer identification cards
and military ID cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This number was never intended for use as a national
identifier,'' said Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis., a co-sponsor of the
bill. ``We need to stop that use _ I call it an abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of a bipartisan effort to reduce fraud and identity
theft, the bill sailed through the House Ways and Means Committee
with little debate, but it must also pass the Commerce and Banking
committees before reaching the House floor. Congress is scheduled
to adjourn next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have literally developed a culture of dependence on the
Social Security number,'' Shaw said. ``Someone who steals your
Social Security number can literally steal your identity.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 allegations of identity theft were reported to
the Social Security Administration last year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, members of the Federal Trade Commission told a Senate
committee that identity theft is on the rise. Commissioners noted
that 400 claims of identity theft a week were reported to their
toll-free hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Col. John Stevens and his wife, Mary, of
Maryland are an example of this growing problem. They testified
before the House Social Security subcommittee in July to urge
passage of the bill. In 1997, they discovered that their Social
Security numbers had been used to open 33 fraudulent credit card
and other accounts which were used to run up more than $113,000 in
charges, thus ruining their credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody over 65 years of age and all members of the armed
forces are very vulnerable, because when you retire you get a
Medicare number that is your Social Security number plus a
letter,'' Stevens said at a news conference Thursday. ``That
Medicare number isn't always protected. It goes through so many
hands. And the Social Security number opens the gate to
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would impose criminal penalties against
individuals who misuse Social Security numbers and organizations
that misuse the Social Security benefits of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 6. 5 million Social Security recipients have their
benefits paid to organizations that help manage their benefits,
Shaw said. Organizations that misuses this money would face
liability for the misused benefits, increased fines, and
disqualification as a fiduciary service.

INCOMING MEXICAN PRESIDENT PLANS INQUIRIES ON PAST ATROCITIES AND
CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ If history is written by the winners, Mexico may
be in for a major rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vicente Fox has promised to create a
``transparency commission'' when he takes office nine weeks from
now. It could be a window into a panorama of secrets, a political
Pandora's box
</P>
<P>
   If opened, it could destroy the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI, which ruled Mexico for 71 years and
controlled the flow of information, the archives of the state and
the official version of history.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the first man to defeat the PRI for the presidency, has
said that the commission, which would have to be approved by
Congress, would ``make an accounting of the past.'' Much must be
accounted for: Many chapters of the official version are false or
full of holes, historians and politicians say.
</P>
<P>
   They say the commission would have to confront Mexico's biggest
unsolved mysteries, like:
</P>
<P>
   _ What became of billions of dollars spent bailing out banks in
1995? Was the killing of the ruling party's presidential candidate
in 1994 a political assassination?
</P>
<P>
   _ Who murdered many of the ruling party's most dangerous
opponents during the 1970s and 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   _ Who gave the orders to shoot to kill hundreds of unarmed
demonstrators _ a massacre that the leaders of the era still deny
ever happened _ 10 days before the 1968 Mexico City Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   These are dangerous questions, for Mexico as well as for the
PRI. ``There are truths which can kill a nation,'' the French
author and diplomat Jean Giraudoux once said. And the truth might
implicate a generation of past leaders _ including some former
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Fox will have the strength to do this,'' said
Lorenzo Meyer, a prominent political history professor. ``You have
to open up thousands of closets, and each probably has more than
one skeleton in it. It would be an encyclopedia of horror, of power
that answered to no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's advisers say that they cannot build public trust in
government if the past remains a minefield of secrets and lies. If
public opinion counts for something in Mexico _ and, increasingly,
it does _ digging up these skeletons would be a popular
undertaking, they believe.
</P>
<P>
   The transparency commission would be ``made up of citizens
chosen by Congress who represent all sectors of society,'' who
would ``carry out the investigations and present them to
Congress,'' said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a top adviser to Fox. Much
about the idea remains unclear, including whether the citizens
could subpoena witnesses or demand documents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that the power to rewrite the past must be in the hands
of Congress, ``because an investigation by the executive branch
lends itself to politicization and witch hunts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Society,'' he said, ``wants the past examined, but within
these limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Those promises may not be enough for the old ruling party.
Rafael Segovia, a political science professor and longtime PRI
leader, said: ``Frankly, if I were Fox, I wouldn't do it. If he
really wanted to seek justice, he would have to accuse thousands of
people of crimes. But that is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI was ``the perfect dictatorship'' _ with democratic
trappings, but ``suppressing by all means, including the worst,
whatever criticism may threaten its perpetuation in power,'' the
Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa said a decade ago. That included
the Oct. 2, 1968, massacre of demonstrators in the Tlatelolco
neighborhood of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Though witnesses say 300 or more people died and more than 1,000
were wounded, the government never gave an accurate account of what
happened. Government-printed history books erased the event. Luis
Echeverria Alvarez, then interior minister, later president from
1970 to 1976, has long been suspected of having a hand in the
killings and the coverup, but has never responded, beyond admitting
in a rambling and evasive interview by a congressional committee in
1998 that the demonstrators were ``sons and daughters of workers,
farmers and unemployed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hector Aguilar Camin, a writer who led the failed effort to
include Tlatelolco in the official histories, doubts that the
transparency commission would have the strength to exhume the
truth. ``It's got no teeth,'' he said. ``It's more of a politically
motivated idea to satisfy partisans who want to see the government
clean house once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Tlatelolco the last event of its kind. Kidnappings and
killings of dozens of real and imagined enemies of the state
continued during and after the Cold War, at the hands of military
and intelligence forces. The 1990s saw several massacres of men,
women and children in the poorest regions of Mexico, where
``military personnel and police continued to commit serious human
rights abuses,'' the State Department said in February.
</P>
<P>
   But one killing above all fires popular imagination in Mexico:
the slaying of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential
candidate, in 1994. Like the official investigation into the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the
government's lone-gunman theory in the Colosio case satisfies
almost no one.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the killing, a special prosecutor, Miguel Montes
Garcia, said seven suspects ``carried out a concerted action'' to
assassinate Colosio. The investigation then became lost in the
labyrinth of Mexico's justice system, which has often proved
incapable of doing justice.
</P>
<P>
   The financial system is a maze, too. The nation's banking laws
protect not only the privacy of deposits, but also the secrecy of
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars spent bailing out banks after the peso
plummeted in 1994 are suspected to have benefited thousands of
politically wired businessmen, whose bad debts will be paid by
taxpayers. An independent auditor hired by Congress, Michael
Mackey, found 3,300 such loans, totaling $7.8 billion, to the rich
and powerful, according to opposition lawmakers who hired a
computer hacker to dig up the data in late July.
</P>
<P>
   And the PRI, one of the world's great political machines until
its defeat in the July elections, used the national treasury as a
private purse for decades _ ``a small group in control of all
political and economic power at the cost of the impoverishment of
the citizenry,'' as Fox's party, National Action, said during the
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But two big barriers stand in the way of the transparency
commission. First, the PRI still controls a plurality of seats in
Congress and could block or hobble the commission.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a search for the truth begins, the records of the
past may not remain.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the PRI lost its majority in the lower
house of Congress, opposition politicians eagerly went looking for
the legislative archives. They were gone. The only thing that
remained on the shelves was an old encyclopedia.

   Deconstructing Deneuve
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Catherine Deneuve is a little tired. It's been a
long day, interview after interview. So much talking. She reaches
into her purse, pulls out a sweetener pellet and drops it with a
plink into the fresh cappuccino that has just been delivered to her
hotel suite, the dregs of an ice-cold espresso pushed aside. She
makes eye contact, that breathtakingly perfect, porcelain face
leaning forward to take a good, solid pull on a thin, elegant
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult, these long days of interviews,'' she
said. ``You are always talking about the same film, over and over.
And yet you must go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve, perhaps the most famous actress in French film history,
has taken to dividing her time between lavish period epics and
small quirky independent films. None, however, have been quite as
quirky as the one that took her to Beverly Hills for this long day
of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Her role as a factory worker in Lars von Trier's ``Dancer in the
Dark'' began, she said, when she saw the director's ``Breaking the
Waves'' several years ago and wrote him a letter. He wrote back,
they talked about working together and, eventually, he offered her
a role in this dark, downbeat drama _ part musical, part suicide
note _ that won the top prize at Cannes this year and opened the
New York Film Festival this month to intensely mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   She loves the film, she said. She is very proud to be a part of
it. But it is also clear that she would be happy to talk about
something else for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that I am watching too many films these days at home,''
she said. ``I much prefer to go to the cinema. There, where it is
dark and the screen is so large, you can more focus your attention.
At home, your attention can wander. And there is the sound, which I
find is often the most important part of a film.''
</P>
<P>
   She is often shocked, she says, by the poor quality of the
prints and the sound systems in the Left Bank cinemas that she
frequents. ``Often, I will leave them a note to complain or even
demand to talk to the manager,'' Deneuve said.
</P>
<P>
   On today's filmmakers: ``They are not quite like the directors
from before, they are a different sort.''
</P>
<P>
   This is spoken with clear authority. Deneuve has worked with
Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Jacques Demy, so many others, and
she vividly remembers an age, now lost, of imposing, intellectual
filmmakers. The directors today, they are a different sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think the new directors are as interested in the
storytelling as the older directors were,'' she said. ``To them, it
is more often always about emotion. Not the emotion of the
characters on the screen, but the emotion in the audience. They are
always trying to play on the emotion in the audience, to make them
scared or happy or frightened, all the time. I think perhaps I
would prefer a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience and `Titans'
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Allen Howard had just about given up, figuring he was
never going to make it as a film writer. ``When you hear no that
much, you just begin to think, `I guess they're right,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After several years writing for sitcoms and dreaming of a career
in movies, Howard thought a change of venue might help. He moved
away from Los Angeles, which he says he hates, and settled in
Alexandria, Va., near enough to Washington to provide some urban
sizzle but suburban enough to meet the slower, more comfortable
life he craved.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he could write from there as easily as from West
Hollywood. But he was never able to make anything stick, he said,
and was within inches of giving it all up and going back to school
to get a teaching certificate. Then one day when he asked his
neighbors why their corner of Alexandria seemed to be so much more
happily integrated than any other part of the Washington area, they
told him it was because of a high school football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia is second only to Texas in their fanaticism over high
school football,'' Howard said. Two decades ago the city decided to
merge two high schools, one that was predominantly black and one
that was predominantly white. But when it came time to choose the
head football coach for the new school, the administrators decided
to go with a black coach, stunning the white community. And
Howard's resulting film, ``Remember the Titans,'' with Denzel
Washington playing the black coach, opens around the country
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project was rejected by everybody, and I mean
everybody,'' Howard said. ``I was turned down by every financing
entity in the movie business.'' Then, one day, it fell into the
hands of Jerry Bruckheimer Films, best known for big-budget action
blockbusters but interested in starting up a new division for
smaller films. ``And now, 18 months later, it's a movie,'' Howard
said. ``I'm still getting used to the idea. Really, after having
the idea rejected in so many places, all I really wanted was to get
the project into development somewhere. But now it's a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   An Intimidating Father
</P>
<P>
   Jay Roach said he always envisioned ``Meet the Parents'' as a
certain kind of movie, something along the lines of David Lynch's
``Eraserhead'' or Martin Scorsese's ``After Hours'' _ a movie in
which an innocent man is drawn gradually deeper into a Kafkaesque
nightmare that is partly, but only partly, of his own making. ``I
always saw it as an anxiety dream,'' Roach said.
</P>
<P>
   Roach, best known for directing the two ``Austin Powers''
comedies, said he had some trouble getting studio bosses to see him
at the helm of a more character-driven comedy like ``Meet the
Parents,'' which opens on Oct. 6. And it was only after Steven
Spielberg had briefly flirted with the idea of directing the
project and Jim Carrey had considered starring in it that it came
back to Roach and Ben Stiller, the star Roach said he had always
envisioned in the lead role. Not long after, Robert De Niro
expressed an interest in playing the future father-in-law. ``We
always knew it would be somebody kind of scary,'' Roach said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to have the hero engage in a string of small, white
lies intended to ease his introduction to his future in-laws, only
to have them grow and gradually ensnare him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw it as having this universal quality,'' Roach
said. ``It's something that almost everyone has to go through,
meeting your future spouse's parents. You're trying too hard,
making stupid jokes, maybe bringing an inappropriate present, and
you're previsualizing disaster at every step. Which, of course,
only helps make it happen.''

A-LIST CAST GIVES `THAT'S LIFE' A LIFT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN HODGES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle  
The premise of CBS' ``That's Life'' isn't entirely new. Heather
Paige Kent plays a late-blooming college freshman just as Rhea
Perlman did on ``Pearl,'' which bombed a few seasons ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's life on television, though _ and this show has a lot more
going for it than ``Pearl'' ever did.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot airing Sunday is good enough to bring you back next
Saturday, when the show moves into its regular time slot.
</P>
<P>
   The mob from ``The Sopranos'' would feel right at home in
``That's Life's'' New Jersey neighborhood, but the members of this
loud and fractious Italian-American family are anything but Mafia
hitmen. They're hard-working blue-collar, all for one and one for
all.
</P>
<P>
   Except at times like now.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia DeLucca (Kent) is the guest of honor at a bridal shower,
where the bride is having second thoughts. Lydia's 32 years old,
and after an eight-year engagement, she's about about to marry Lou
Buttafucco (Sonny Marinelli), a lout she doesn't even love, much
less respect.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia has a dream. Since she was a little girl, she's dreamed of
going to college and making something of herself. Instead, she's
had 58 crummy jobs _ now she's a bartender _ and she's saved every
cent she's made, waiting to spend it on her wedding. If and when
Lou ever stopped dragging his feet at setting the date.
</P>
<P>
   She's told her thick-headed groom-to-be what she wants to do,
but he doesn't get it. ``You'll go back to school, graduate at 36,
go to work, and then quit to have kids and resent them,'' he wails.
So now he doesn't get her, either. The bride-to-be bolts.
</P>
<P>
   But when Lydia dumps Lou and announces she's using her bridal
dowry to pay her way through college, her family thinks she's lost
it. They close ranks on the side of the guy she's jilted.
</P>
<P>
   Casting counts here. ``That's Life'' sometimes looks better than
it is, and not just because Kent is a most appealing actress. Her
backup family is A-list, with Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino
playing Ma and Pa, Dolly and Frank DeLucca, and Keith Dillon as her
playful policeman brother, Paul.
</P>
<P>
   The only ones on Lydia's side are Bob, her shadowy barfly
confidante, and her well-cast best friends, Debi Mazur as
neighborhood beauty salon queen Jackie O'Grady, and Kristin Bauer
as Candy Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia's first day on campus is as disastrous as the hairdo that
pal Jackie creates for her to impress her new classmates.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lydia's wreck of a car gives up the ghost, and then Dr.
Victor Leski (Paul Firth), the esteemed professor of her first
class, Human Behavior 101, turns out to be the drunk she had to
throw out of her bar the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its deja vu premise, ``That's Life'' goes into this TV
life with a fair number of promising moments. What's not to like,
if the scripts can manage to come up to this solid cast, and Kent's
considerable charisma?

`DARK DAYS' PUTS FACES ON UNDERGROUND HOMELESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
The closing credits to ``Dark Days,'' the remarkable, sad, funny,
tough, vivid, new documentary about life for the homeless in New
York's subways, includes an unusual credit. Amtrak is listed among
the entities thanked for providing shelter to the filmmaking crew.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This only makes sense once you learn that the crew lived in the
subway tunnels while making the movie. The British-born Marc Singer
moved into those dank caverns and lived three months, getting to
know the inhabitants, before he even broached the subject of making
a film.
</P>
<P>
   Once he did, the movie _ his first _ became a collaborative
effort. His entire crew, from electricians to sound recorders,
consisted of original tunnel dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   The film's power resides in Singer's steadfast dedication to
honestly chronicling the lives of the people who lived underground.
So intense is his gaze that his subjects almost instantly are
pulled from the faceless horde of ``the homeless'' and become real.
</P>
<P>
   The black and white images are searing and brutal. Men descend
through holes in the ground like rats to reach garbage-strewn
shanty towns. Repeatedly, Singer cuts away to show the vermin that
live alongside them, competing for food and space.
</P>
<P>
   These men _ the movie focuses on only one woman _ are desperate
souls who have gone underground out of necessity. They find it
safer than sleeping in parks or alleys where they might be
attacked. As one man says, explaining why the filthy and
dangerous-looking tunnels are a refuge: ``Anybody in their right
minds be scared to come down here.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the folks we meet aren't in their right
minds. Tommy, a young man who says he left home in his teens to
escape an abusive environment, says most of the people down there
are drug addicts. Others have mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their problems, they have made for themselves a largely
self-sufficient community. They've built their houses from scrap
wood and furnished them with furniture, lamps, rugs and television
sets they've scavenged from above-ground dumps. They get power by
tapping into underground electric lines. We see a chess set in one
home. Another has a pen where a man keeps dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You adjust,'' says Greg, a loquacious man who scratches out a
living by scavenging in trash cans and selling what he finds. He's
lived in the tunnels for five years. ``You'd be surprised what the
human mind and the human body can adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing about this documentary is how normal so many
of the lives are, even though they are lived in extraordinary
circumstances. The stories of how some of them got there will break
your heart.
</P>
<P>
   While Singer was making his documentary, Amtrak decided to evict
the homeless and remove their makeshift community. This provides a
dramatic framework late in the movie. The subway dwellers first vow
to resist but eventually agree to move out when an advocacy group
manages to get them subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   To see these people cleaned up and living in clean apartments,
no trace remaining of their former lives, is to realize how fine
the line is between ``us'' and ``them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were dark days,'' Gregg says. ``Real dark. At the time
it didn't bother me at all, but now that I've had time to sit back
and think about it, I wonder how I could do that. How'd I let
myself go down like that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' says Ralph, a former crack addict who looks and
sounds a bit like actor John Malkovich, ``it was like it never
happened at all. It was like a nightmare, and I woke up from it,
and I'm staying awake.'' &QL;

NEW AND NOTEWORTHY MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``ALMOST FAMOUS,'' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate
Hudson and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron
Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on
his earlier career as a teen-age rock journalist overflows with
wonderful performances and memorable moments. Fugit brings the
perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of
William Miller, a San Diego teen-ager who takes to the road with a
scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone.
``Almost Famous'' isn't perfect _ it lacks a necessary dimension of
demonic sleaze _ but Crowe's smart, compassionate writing, and the
performances of Crudup, Hudson, Jason Lee and Frances McDormand
(among many others) make it hum (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``BRING IT ON,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and
Eliza Dushku. Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes). Even
though it does feature young women bouncing around in skimpy
outfits, this cheerleader comedy, directed with giddy, sometimes
sloppy pep-rally intensity by Reed from a brisk, slangy script by
Jessica Bendinger, is more than a low-minded appeal to male
lechery. Though bound by the conventions of the sports movie and
the teen-age romantic comedy, ``Bring It On'' has a fine satirical
edge, and at least glances at some serious issues of race and
sexuality. It's also a vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of
Dunst, ably supported by Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love
interest, and Dushku as his sister (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CELL,'' starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and
Vince Vaughn. Directed by Tarsem Singh (R, 110 minutes). A serial
killer named Stargher ( D'Onofrio) who abducts women and imprisons
them in a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with water has a seizure
and goes into a coma. His latest victim is trapped in his cell, and
she has to be found before the automated torture takes her life. An
FBI agent ( Vaughn) talks a child psychologist ( Lopez) into using
an experimental technique to enter the killer's subconscious.
Singh's talents haven't quite jelled into storytelling yet. He
folds this tale over and over on itself, working with a script that
blends elements of ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' ``Manhunter,''
``The Matrix,'' ``Seven,'' ``Dreamscape'' and ``Spellbound'' with
the stop-motion animation of the brothers Quay (``Street of
Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt Mahurin, the paintings
of Francis Bacon and so many other things that there's no there
there (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``DANCER IN THE DARK,'' starring Bjork and Catherine Deneuve.
Directed by Lars von Trier (R, 134 minutes). von Trier's new
musical, shot in raw, jumpy digital video, is a fascinating
exercise in brutality, mitigated by the otherworldy charisma (and
the music) of the Icelandic pop star Bjork. As Selma, a Czech
immigrant factory worker going blind in the early 1960s in
Washington State (the film was shot in Sweden), Bjork seems to be
inventing a whole new style of film acting, and her performance is
miraculous. von Trier, continuing his campaign to rescue the art of
film from complacency and convention, follows Selma's utter
annihilation with sadistic relish. ``Dancer in the Dark'' is both
stupefyingly bad and utterly overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes
within a single scene, a gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion.
Come to the theater prepared, with a handkerchief in one hand and a
rotten tomato in the other (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``DUETS'' starring Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Maria Bello,
Andre Braugher, Scott Speedman and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Bruce
Paltrow (R, 113 minutes). Paltrow's musical follows the adventures
of six lost souls looking for salvation in the demimonde of
competitive karaoke. The movie is a mess, lurching from dark satire
to soapy melodrama and punctuated with squirmingly earnest
renditions of songs like ``Bette Davis Eyes'' and ``Hit Me With
Your Best Shot.'' But ``Duets'' has its moments of brilliance, and
a certain reckless integrity. The ensemble cast features Lewis and
Paltrow, the director's daughter, but they're overshadowed by
Giamatti's over-the-top performance as an alienated businessman.
This is a very bad movie, but from time to time you catch glimpses
of a very good movie trapped inside, struggling to get out (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``GOYA IN BORDEAUX,'' starring Francisco Rabal, Jose Coronado,
Dafne Fernandez and Maribel Verdu. Written and directed by Carlos
Saura (R, 94 minutes). There's nothing subtle about Saura's
splashy, sensuous biographical montage of the great Spanish artist
Francisco Goya, whom the movie portrays as an 18th-century raging
bull. Crammed with surreal imagery that quotes from his paintings,
the movie is a series of deathbed flashbacks, many of them
recollections of his passion for the fiery Dutchess of Alba.
Gorgeously lighted and photographed by Vittorio Storaro (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``NURSE BETTY,'' starring Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris
Rock and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute (R, 112 minutes).
Alternately hilarious, poignant and gory, this modern fairy tale,
which follows an aspiring nurse ( Zellweger) suffering from
traumatic amnesia to Los Angeles to win the love of her favorite
soap-opera character, is a contemporary ``Wizard of Oz.'' Hollywood
is the Emerald City. Kinnear is the self-centered actor who plays
her heart's desire on television. Freeman and Rock are a sadly
introspective hit man and his hotheaded protege who follow her
across the country with intention to do harm. This may be the
deepest and funniest American comedy since David O. Russell's
``Flirting With Disaster'' (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY,'' starring Steve Harvey, D.L.
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike
Lee (R, 117 minutes). Filmed before a live audience on two nights
in February in Charlotte, N.C., the self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy
swagger across the stage, urban legends in resplendent outfits.
Until a couple of years ago the comedians' exposure was limited
mostly to cable television. Here their comedy gives audiences that
have never seen anything like it a hilarious window on a new world.
They display their chops when they talk about family, specifically
African-American family with roots in the South (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``SOLAS,'' starring Maria Galiana and Ana Fernandez. Written and
directed by Benito Zambrano (not rated, 98 minutes). When a simple
Spanish woman ( Galiana) makes a rare journey to the city to be
with her husband, who is having surgery, she stays with her
embittered, alcoholic daughter ( Fernandez) who works for a
cleaning service. Galiana's eloquent, utterly unsentimental
portrayal of a woman who expects little of life is an
extraordinarily moving portrait of unconditional love gradually
working its wonders (Holden). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   THE CLINTON administration's covert pressure on Panama to grant
asylum to Peru's fleeing intelligence boss, Vladimiro Montesinos,
recalls the bad old days of the Cold War, when blood-drenched
tyrants flying the flag of anticommunism could count on Uncle Sam
to procure them a safe haven in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Jimmy Carter sent the shah of Iran in 1979, at a
time when multitudes had taken to the streets of Tehran, demanding
that the shah be repatriated to pay for the crimes of his secret
police. Panama was also the destination of Haiti's uniformed
despot, General Raoul Cedras and of exiled Guatemalan general Jorge
Serrano Elias, wanted for the massacres of native people in
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   To recollect this tradition of parking exiled thugs in Panama is
to recognize why Peruvians and Panamanians alike are so angry about
Washington's role in aiding Montesinos to escape from justice back
home.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvians yearning for the rule of law see Uncle Sam playing a
familiar cynical game above their heads. Panamanians eager for
authentic independence have reason to perceive Washington's demand
for a favor as one more humiliating example of Panama's abject
fealty to the North Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the administration has acknowledged that Montesinos, the
iron fist of Alberto Fujimori's discredited regime in Peru, had a
privileged relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency, it is
safe to assume that he owes his safe haven in Panama to a
double-barreled blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   The more evident of the two was the rumored threat of a coup in
Peru, a prospect made all the more plausible because Montesinos
over the years had placed his proteges in positions of power within
the military.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the administration and its collaborators in the
Organization of American States might have argued that impunity for
Montesinos was a necessary price to pay for the flowering of true
democracy in Peru, the unspoken argument for saving his skin was
that he might otherwise reveal exactly how much Washington knew _
and tolerated _ of the torture, murder, and corruption Peru
suffered under Fujimori's rule.
</P>
<P>
   If the administration is going to protect Montesinos in Panama _
or wherever he may ultimately find asylum _ to promote democracy in
Peru, then the least it can demand of Fujimori is that he step
aside immediately and permit free and fair elections soon.
</P>
<P>
   In light of American protection of Montesinos, Fujimori should
also be told to release Lori Berenson, the American convicted by a
military tribunal on the preposterous charge of being a leader of a
terrorist group in Peru. Washington's realpolitik in Latin American
should be leavened with a touch of justice.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``SPACE COWBOYS,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and James Garner (PG-13, 105 minutes). Directed
by Eastwood. The second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant
reworking of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood
himself leading a heroic team of astronauts that also includes
Jones, Sutherland and Garner. But the first half, which consists of
the comic tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors,
is a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity.
Sutherland and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay
Harden, playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again)
the villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their
shot at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer
Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R,
180 minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances and those of Ehle and
Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and
thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful
historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TAO OF STEVE,'' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ``Steve'' in the
title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by
Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii Five-O'') and Steve Austin
(``The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and
amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic
comedy, Dex ( Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas
Aquinas and ``Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless
pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Logue's performance
as a nice-guy player _ his weight doesn't keep him from scoring
with the ladies _ makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee
over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less
interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a
steady relationship with a woman ( Goodman) whose feelings were
trampled in Dex's compulsive fox hunting. ``Tao'' can't redeem the
moves to its predictable end, but its protagonist has a great time
getting there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WATCHER,'' starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa
Tomei. Directed by Joe Charbanic (R, 93 minutes). Reeves
enunciates, Spader frets and Tomei just looks tired in this
pretentious, incoherent compilation of serial-killer cliches and
warmed-over MTV-style visual flourishes. Reeves is a sadistic,
diabolically intelligent strangler, Spader the F.B.I. agent whose
psychic torment is the killer's real turn-on and Tomei is the
agent's kindly therapist (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WAY OF THE GUN,'' starring Ryan Phillippe, Benicio Del
Toro and Juliette Lewis. Written and directed by Christopher
McQuarrie (R, 120 minutes). This film feels like a more violent and
grim version of a Coen brothers film; it could be Quentin
Tarantino's ``Raising Arizona.'' Its lead characters are small-time
criminals who tend to speak in ambitious and hilariously orotund
turns of phrase. The two, um, heroes, while visiting a sperm bank,
hatch a plan to kidnap a young woman doing surrogate-mother duty
for a wealthy couple. ``Gun'' is a stylish and intelligent film
noir built around the feelings adults have about babies, with a
birth and a lengthy gunfight and standoff (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``WOMAN ON TOP,'' starring Penelope Cruz, Murilo Benicio and
Harold Perrineau Jr. Directed by Fina Torres (R, 85 minutes). It
makes sense that the delectable Cruz would play a chef. This
romantic comedy uses an amusing conceit, that she needs a magic
spell to so enchant men that they wouldn't bother to look down at
their plates _ a case in which magic is as redundant as giving the
lethal boxer Roy Jones Jr. a third fist. Cruz flees Brazil and her
philandering husband in order to go to San Francisco. There, she
becomes the host of a cooking show, where she delights the local
male population and sambas waft in the background. Negligible but
diverting (Mitchell).

EXPANDING WOMEN'S CHOICES

<TEXT>
<P>
   THE FOOD AND DRUG Administration's overdue approval of the early
abortion pill RU-486 does not signal an end to the abortion wars,
even though it will make the wrenching choice of whether to have an
abortion more private and more accessible for many women. Medical
abortion, through the use of the drug mifepristone, should never
displace the option of surgical abortion, just as no abortion
should ever displace careful family planning and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was approved in France over 10 years ago, mifepristone
has been the object of fierce attack by the antiabortion movement,
precisely because it takes politics out of the abortion equation
and extends choices to women in remote areas where clinics have
been shut down or where they are under attack by protesting
zealots. Thanks to the steady chipping away of reproductive rights
by prolife forces since abortion became legal here in 1973, fully
86 percent of the counties in the United States have no abortion
providers today.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, since 1995 the pill has been quietly tested in
clinical trials by the Planned Parenthood Federation without
incident, including by some 200 women here in Boston. It has been
found a safe, effective, and noninvasive alternative to surgical
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA was frustratingly slow to grant its approval, but when
it finally did Thursday it was without most of the restrictions
women's health advocates had feared. The drug will be dispensed
only by a physician, but it will not have to be in a hospital.
There will be no registry of providers and patients, which would
have been a chilling requirement. And pharmacies will not be
distributing the drug, which removes the possibility of drugstore
boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, medical abortion is not for every woman. It will require
three visits to doctor's offices over two weeks, and it can be
painful and disruptive, since it mimics spontaneous miscarriage. It
can only be administered through the first 49 days of pregnancy.
Other abortion options and, most important, easy access to
contraception for women of all ages, must be continued.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action also opens the way for more FDA study of other
applications for mifepristone. The Institute of Medicine believes
it may be useful in treating ovarian cancer, endometriosis,
glaucoma, and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Few drugs have suffered so much political interference when they
show promise for so much progress. It is a good day for science
over politics when American women can finally get the benefit of
medical advances that have been available in other countries for
years.

   Blacking Out The Body Parts
</P>
<P>
   It may not be down in writing but censorious fig leaves placed
over genitals probably weren't what the Danish filmmaker Lars von
Trier had in mind five years ago when he formulated his so-called
Vow of Chastity, the set of stringent movie-making rules known as
Dogma 95.
</P>
<P>
   von Trier, whose ``Dancer in the Dark'' opened the New York Film
Festival last week, seeks to purge the frills and tricks and
anything else remotely Hollywood from the process. Presumably, that
would include the requirements of the Motion Picture Association of
America's rating system, which mandates that genitalia be covered
if a film is to receive an R instead of an NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   And covered they are in von Trier's ``Idiots,'' which will be
released on Tuesday by USA Home Entertainment. To get the R before
short theater runs in New York and Los Angeles, USA Films added
black patches when and where required in the movie, which follows a
commune of well-to-do Nordic layabouts who wander about irritating
the bourgeoisie by acting as if they are mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Often a video is released in R and unrated or NC-17 versions,
but not in this case. The black squares remain in the one and only
``Idiots,'' still rated R. A spokeswoman for USA said that there
was no consumer interest in an unrated version.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what's more idiotic,'' A.O. Scott wrote in
The New York Times, ``a director who treats his audience like
uptight prigs in need of a gratuitous shock, or an industry
organization that treats filmgoers like children.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Double Scare
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' is one of two big new
re-issues for Tuesday. The midnight staple is 25 years old, ripe
for a commemorative tape and two-disc DVD from Fox with soundtracks
enough to let one shout along with the mobs in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The other film is ``Rosemary's Baby'' (1968). ``It opens like a
Doris Day movie; that was the whole point,'' says the production
designer Richard Sylbert on a new DVD and tape from Paramount.
Having completed ``Dance of the Vampires'' (a k a ``Pardon Me but
Your Teeth Are in My Neck'') the year before, Roman Polanski, the
director, says he was looking away from horror and more toward
making a skiing movie _ Robert Redford in ``Downhill Racer,''
perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Redford was considered for the role of Guy Woodhouse in
``Rosemary's Baby'' before Polanski decided that a harder, darker
New York type like John Cassevetes would better portray the
ambitious actor who accepts Satan's help with his career in return
for letting the devil father his child.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning Rosemary was envisioned as a ``milk-fed
American girl,'' far from the gaunt young woman portrayed by Mia
Farrow. Polanski says that when he first read the script, adapted
from Ira Levin's novel, he thought it was a soap opera. The film
still has a remarkably sunny look. ``The great horror film without
any horror in it,'' Sylbert says.

   East-West
</P>
<P>
   Lured home by promises of Soviet citizenship, Russian emigres
returned after World War II only to be caught in a Stalinist purge
that led them to death and disaster. Aleksei Golovine and his
rebellious French wife, Marie (Oleg Menchikov and Sandrine
Bonnaire), are spared because he is a doctor who decides that his
own good behavior is the best way to protect his family. With its
old-fashioned American big-movie feeling, Regis Wargnier's moving
film, A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, ``may justly be
faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in the catharsis of
melodrama, but it also uses the resources of melodrama to shed
light on forgotten history.''

moving his cameras around very cramped spaces and uncomfortably
close to his actors'' (Elvis Mitchell).

   Joe Gould's Secret
</P>
<P>
   Ian Holm is ferociously front and center as the title character
in Stanley Tucci's otherwise rather somnolent film adapted from
Joseph Mitchell's New Yorker profiles of 1942 and 1964, ``Professor
Sea Gull'' and ``Joe Gould's Secret.'' An unstable Harvard
graduate, Gould came to New York in 1916 and started panhandling
while supposedly beginning his masterwork, the million-word-plus
``Oral History of Our Time.'' Or so he maintained during raucous
decades being the Greenwich Village character twice examined by
Mitchell, played credibly by Tucci. But lacking dramatic tension,
the film settles for being an atmospheric biography of someone's
most unforgettable character. ``It could have been so much more''
(Stephen Holden).

   About to take off with his classmates on a senior trip to Paris,
Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a strong enough premonition of
disaster to rear up from his seat and demand to be taken off the
plane, which explodes on takeoff. For the rest of the film, he and
several other survivors try to stay ahead of the grim reaper who,
having been cheated once is now picking them off one by one in a
series of bizarre accidents. ``But even by the crude standards of
teen-age horror, `Final Destination' is dramatically flat''
(Holden).

CASE AGAINST FORMER INDONESIAN LEADER   IS DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ An Indonesian court dismissed the
government's corruption case against former President Suharto on
Thursday after court-appointed doctors declared him medically unfit
to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling immediately touched off violent clashes outside the
auditorium where the trial was being conducted between hundreds of
supporters and opponents of Suharto, whose 32-year rule ended in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   As two busloads of his defenders arrived, anti-Suharto student
demonstrators pelted them with rocks. The police said that one
Suharto supporter was beaten to death and two were severely
injured, and that a bus was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling, even though it may be legally correct, sends the
wrong message to the average person: that there's still no justice
in Indonesia,'' said Indira Samego, a political analyst. ``It says
that politics in Indonesia are still run by the same old forces,
and that's what people are going to believe until the government
proves otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a major setback for Indonesia's democratically
elected government, which sought to bring the ailing 79-year-old
Suharto to justice for human rights abuses. The government had also
charged him with embezzling $590 million from state charities while
in office.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors testified on Thursday that he had suffered three
strokes last year that left him unable to understand or answer
complex questions. One doctor said Suharto had the communications
skills of ``a kindergartner'' and took up to a minute to answer
basic inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman expressed deep disappointment
with the court's ruling, saying the justice system had failed the
people. ``The thing that we aimed for, which was to truly obtain
justice for the people, was not achieved,'' said Darusman, who had
insisted Suharto was well enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would appeal the decision, but they
acknowledged that Suharto's declining health made it unlikely they
would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption case was more than a reckoning with the former
president and his cronies for enriching themselves at public
expense. It was seen as a litmus test for restoring the rule of law
and a sense of equality to Indonesia, where corruption permeated
nearly every aspect of society under Suharto's government.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, along with his six children, is believed to have stolen
billions of dollars through a broad network of deals in which his
family made money from almost every sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The justice ministry on Thursday ordered the detention of
Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, who is known as Tommy
Suharto, after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision
and sentenced him to an 18-month prison term for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Suharto has been in the public eye since President
Abdurrahman Wahid first ordered him arrested on Sept. 15 after a
spate of bomb explosions in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the decision not to prosecute the former president
spread, hundreds of protesters converged on his house in central
Jakarta, where they were met by dozens of police officers who fired
tear gas and plastic bullets into the stone-wielding crowds. The
situation remained tense Thursday evening as large numbers of
officers were brought into the capital to maintain order. Many
people expressed fear of increasing violence in the aftermath of
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Suharto had been under house arrest for more than four
months during the legal and judicial gyrations of the government's
case. His lawyers and doctors had repeatedly said he was too sick
to attend the trial. But government physicians maintained that he
was capable of understanding the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   After he refused to appear for two earlier court sessions,
judges ordered an independent checkup, which was released on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the new administration of Wahid, losing the case could not
have come at a worse time. Indonesia, with the fourth-largest
population, is struggling to forge a new democracy despite a weak
economy, political infighting and growing sectarian violence that
has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who was elected in October in the country's first
contested election, and Darusman are now under pressure to show
that they can bring Indonesia's former regime to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government doesn't do something to make up for the loss
of the Suharto case, it will handicap the entire process of
political and economic reforms, especially the sense of enforcing
law and order,'' said Teten Masduki, coordinator for Indonesia
Corruption Watch. ``Like it or not, despite the good that he might
have done for the country, Suharto remains the focus of people's
hatred.''

&HT;     ABORTION FOES ASSAIL ABORTION PILL'S APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anti-abortion leaders condemned the Food and Drug
Administration for its decision Thursday to allow RU-486, the
abortion pill, to be sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is unprecedented.'' said Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., a physician who says he has delivered 3,500 babies in his
career and 400 while in Congress. ``Never before has the FDA
approved a drug intended to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstetrician said the FDA ``bowed to the political pressure
of the abortion lobby and the White House and approved the drug
with inadequate patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates split over the wisdom of the FDA's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush criticized the
decision, saying the abortion pill ``will make abortions more and
more common, rather than more and more rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Al Gore said the FDA's decision wasn't
political but ``about the health and safety of American women and a
woman's fundamental right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., called for Senate hearings into the
FDA's approval process. Coburn vowed to introduce legislation that
could block the drug. However, it appeared unlikely there would be
any action until next year because Congress is rushing to adjourn
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes claim the long-term effects of Mifeprex aren't
known. ``This unprecedented act of turning women into guinea pigs
is a payoff by the Clinton administration to the abortion
radicals,'' said Gary Bauer, president of American Values _ a
conservative advocacy group _ and one-time aspirant for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approving a drug that we know kills one person and may harm a
second just shows how wedded the Clinton administration is to the
abortion lobby,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates hailed the FDA's approval of RU-486 as
a step that will revolutionize abortions in America, by making the
procedure more private and accessible to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mifepristone's approval is one of the most significant
advances in women's reproductive health that we have seen in
decades,'' said Kate Michelman, president of NARAL. ``Its approval
is yet another milestone on the long road to women's reproductive
freedom and equality in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a leader among congressional
advocates of abortion rights, said RU-486 ``provides a method that
avoids invasive surgery. Today is a day that women should remember
because their health and their choices are finally being
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA limited the use of the RU-486 abortion pill to pregnant
women within 49 days of their last menstrual period. The drug,
which has the chemical name mifepristone and will be marketed in
the United States as Mifeprex, could be available within a month.
The pill has been available in France for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion pill is actually three separate pills, each
containing 200 milligrams of mifepristone. The woman takes all
three pills at the same time. The pills block progesterone, a
hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy. Without progesterone,
a woman's uterine lining thins, preventing an embryo from receiving
nourishment, remaining implanted and growing.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, she takes two other pills _ each containing 200
milligrams of misoprostol. This drug induces uterine contractions
to expel the embryo.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approval requires that the drugs can only be prescribed
by physicians qualified to determine the age of a patient's
pregnancy and detect ectopic, or tubal, pregnancies. In those
instances, the FDA said, the pills cannot be used because usage
could cause complications.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA, physicians who prescribe the drug must
also be able to provide or arrange for ``surgical solutions'' in
cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Women should return for a follow-up visit 14 days after taking
the second set of pills.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA cautioned that chemical abortions can cause painful
cramping and bleeding, which typically last between nine and 16
days. One in every 100 women might experience bleeding so severe it
requires a surgical procedure, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The pills fail to work in about 5 to 8 percent of women,
requiring surgical abortions to complete the process, according to
the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the abortion pill say the complications are less
severe than those with surgical abortions.

   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been approved in France since 1988 and has been
used since 1992 by women in England, Sweden and France, Mifeprex
has only been available to American women through limited clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, President Clinton directed the FDA to start clinical
trials on the drug and later was instrumental in urging Roussel
Uclaf to donate U.S. patent rights to the not-for-profit Population
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Population Council had trouble finding a manufacturer for
the drug because potential makers feared public criticism from
abortion foes. The council, a not-for-profit New York-based
organization that supports population control, eventually selected
Danco Laboratories, a New York start-up company, to develop the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the FDA said mifepristone was safe and effective, but
approval was delayed after the original U.S. manufacturer of the
drug dropped out. The approval process was further delayed because
Danco Laboratories _ the new manufacturer _ had to meet federal
manufacturing and labeling requirements.

 &HT;    NUMBER OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPS
 &HT;    With HEALTH-INSURANCE-DATA, for a box/chart, which has moved.
 &HT;    ATTN TEXAS EDS: Your state tops the list in the proportion of
uninsured.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 2 million Americans, half of them children,
obtained health-care coverage last year, the first time in 12 years
that the number of people without health insurance dropped, the
Census Bureau says in a report to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The country's low jobless rate and broader health-care coverage
offered by employers contributed to the turnaround. The number of
people without health insurance declined by 1.7 million between
1998 and 1999, from 44.3 million to 42.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured children fell by more than 1 million to
10 million, from 15.4 percent to 13.9 percent of all children, its
lowest level since 1995. About 567,000 poor children gained health
insurance in 1999, stemming in part from a Clinton administration
push to increase government health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the number of uninsured Americans, particularly among the
working poor, remained high. About 15 of every 100 Americans
remained without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains last year, the number of uninsured has
increased by nearly 8 million since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a morning drizzle after a prolonged drought,'' Ron
Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a non-profit consumer
advocacy group on health-case issues, said of the 1999 decline in
the number of uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults and immigrants were the least likely to have
coverage. Minorities were less likely than whites to have
insurance, though coverage increased across all racial and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Texas topped the list of states with the highest share of
uninsured, 24.1 percent when statistically averaged from 1997 to
1999. Minnesota had the lowest rate of uninsured people, 8.8
percent of its population without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans _ 63 percent _ were covered by a health insurance
plan linked to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving force behind this improvement was an increase in
the likelihood of people having employment-based health
insurance,'' said Robert Mills, author of the Census Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said two vulnerable groups remained worrisome:
low-income working people not eligible for Medicaid or other
government-subsidized health care coverage and young adults unable
to obtain or afford coverage from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   One of every three people in poverty was not covered by a health
plan in 1999, virtually unchanged from the previous year. While
Medicaid covered 12.9 million poor people during at least part of
1999, another 10.4 million people below the poverty line had no
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Only 71 percent of young adults, ages 18-24, had health
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton took office in 1993 pledging health insurance
for all Americans. In the next five years, the ranks of the
uninsured grew by more than 4.5 million as administration efforts
to convince Congress to approve a comprehensive health care
proposal failed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress and the White House have agreed over the years
on a string of incremental measures to expand coverage. Overall,
about one of every four Americans has some form of government
insurance through Medicaid, Medicare or other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and the uninsured has been a major issue in the
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore would expand the federal Children's Health
Insurance Program and provide tax credits for low-income families
and the elderly. Republican George W. Bush has proposed a $2,000
refundable health credit for low-income families not covered by
Medicaid or an employers' health plan to be able to purchase their
own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have promised to make health insurance more
affordable for small businesses who cover their employees. Most new
jobs are created by small businesses, which are less likely to
offer employee health benefits because of the high cost of
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The non-profit Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation has been
studying uninsured families since 1995 and finds that many forego
medical care or wait until a health condition makes it absolutely
necessary to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see so visibly is that the uninsured are working
families living on the edge _ a major illness or accident can push
them over the edge,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's figures are based on its annual population
survey of 50,000 American households.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lower-income Americans were less likely to have health
insurance. About 24 percent of households with annual incomes of
less than $25,000 had no health insurance. (The poverty line is
defined as an income of $17,029 for a family of four and $13,290
for a family of three). About 8 percent of households with incomes
of $75,000 or more were without coverage. But overall, coverage
rates increased for households with incomes of less than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whites were much more likely than minorities to be covered by
health insurance. One of every three Hispanics, or 33.4 percent,
was without health insurance compared to 11 percent for
non-Hispanic whites. About 21 percent of African Americans and
Asian Americans were not covered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workers at large companies were twice as likely to have health
insurance than those employed by small businesses. About 31 percent
of workers at firms with 25 or fewer employers had coverage while
at companies with 1,000 or more employees, 68 percent of workers
had health insurance. (The estimates do not account for employees
that may be covered by another family members job-based insurance
policy).
</P>
<P>
   _ The share of population without health insurance fell in 15
states _ Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North
Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas. Meanwhile, eight states
saw an increase in the proportion of uninsured: Hawaii, Illinois,
Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
The results are based on statistical comparisons of two-year
averages from from each state for 1997-98 and 1998-99.

LYNCH CASHES IN SOME FIDELITY SHARES FOR $53 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments legend Peter Lynch has sold a
slice of his shares in the privately held mutual fund giant for $53
million, according to a regulatory filing.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch sold 60,566 shares _ more than 1 percent of the shares in
Fidelity's parent company, FMR Corp. _ between Dec. 1, 1998, and
Aug. 31, 2000, according to the filing. He received $9 million in
cash and a promissory note for $44 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that Lynch, 56, sold the stock as part of a
planned compensation arrangement, under which executives hold
Fidelity shares for a certain number of years and agree to sell
them back to the company on a specified date.
</P>
<P>
   They reap gains on the shares based on the growth of Fidelity's
value.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity shares cannot be held by outsiders. The company's
chairman, Edward ``Ned'' Johnson III, his daughter, Abigail, and
their families own 49 percent of the voting shares.
</P>
<P>
   Other top executives, including Lynch, also hold voting shares.
</P>
<P>
   Nonvoting shares are held by a broader group of managers.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's shares were sold through the Peter S. Lynch Revocable
Trust, as first reported by InvestorForce.com. The sale was
revealed in a proxy statement for one of Fidelity's cash reserve
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity declined to comment on Lynch's sale. A spokeswoman said
there was no change in Lynch's role with the firm, where he is vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch became famous for running Fidelity's flagship Magellan
fund for 13 years, until May 1990, and for delivering huge returns
to shareholders. He has since been featured nationally in a
Fidelity advertising campaign.

RIVALS AWAIT SINGAPORE AIRLINES' BIG PURCHASE OF BIGGEST PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The battle between Boeing and Airbus Industrie for
the future of large-scale jetliners could reach a decisive point on
Friday when Singapore Airlines, the profitable and prestigious
Asian carrier more famous for its flight attendants than its
financial muscle, announces a plan to buy new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus and Boeing have been courting Singapore Airlines for
months in hopes of winning its endorsement of their rival visions
of a new superjumbo aircraft capable of carrying at least 500
passengers halfway around the world without refueling.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is struggling to generate enough orders to justify
production of its 550-seat A3XX. Boeing has countered with a
stretched version of its familiar 747 jumbo. Singapore Airlines has
said it will announce its choice by the end of next month, but
industry executives were speculating that it would do so at a
Friday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has remained silent on just what purchase it will
announce. Even the two rival manufacturers will not be told until
shortly before the announcement. Singapore Airlines is also in the
market for smaller midrange jets to replace 15 older Airbus
A310-300s it now uses across southern Asia. Whatever purchases the
carrier announces, ``it's going to be a big order,'' said Rick
Clements, a Singapore Airlines spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing 15 midrange aircraft could represent billions of
dollars in new orders and might indicate whether Singapore Airlines
is consolidating its fleet toward a single manufacturer to cut
costs, as are many other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But a decision on the superjumbo would send a powerful signal
about the future of air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is only Asia's seventh-largest airline, Singapore
Airlines is regarded as an industry bellwether. Profitable despite
offering a premium service and one of the industry's youngest
fleets, Singapore Airlines heralded its global ambitions last year
when it announced it would pay nearly $1 billion for 49 percent of
Virgin Atlantic, which is controlled by Richard Branson.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier is considering buying as many as a dozen superjumbo
aircraft, according to some people in the industry. A giant order
in and of itself, the carrier's choice could influence a debate
that has so far centered on whether airlines need larger planes to
fly farther, or smaller planes to fly more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's 747 has been the biggest jetliner for the last 30
years, and is still the only aircraft capable of carrying more than
400 passengers. Airbus hopes to end the jumbo's reign this year by
building the A3XX, which it envisions as an airborne cruise ship,
complete with a casino and gym.
</P>
<P>
   An order from Singapore Airlines would be crucial: Airbus needs
at least 40 orders by some estimates to justify the $11 billion
cost of producing its new behemoth. So far, it has orders for 22
A3XXs from Air France, Emirates Airlines and the International
Lease Finance Corp. Singapore Airlines' biggest competitor, Qantas
of Australia, is also considering a purchase of the aircraft, said
Sean Lee, regional communications director of Airbus in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing says the market for such huge airships is not big enough
to justify making them. It has opted for tweaking the 747 to
satisfy customers who need more than 500 seats per flight and
concentrating on its 380-seat 777's for those airlines that want to
fly to more destinations.

&HT;     GROUPS CALL ON CONGRESS TO APPROVE HATE CRIMES LAW FOR GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Hilary Shelton is CQ)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Religious leaders and civil rights advocates urged
Congress Thursday to pass a hate crimes bill following the shooting
rampage last week in a Roanoke, Va., gay bar by a gunman who
announced he was there to ``waste some faggots.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a park across the street from the White House, some
150 people called on House and Senate negotiators to approve
legislation that would extend special federal protections to gays
and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has the power to stand up and do something,'' said
the Rev. Neff Powell, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of
Southwestern Virginia. ``How many more of our citizens must be
beaten and killed,'' he said, referring to the killing of Danny Lee
Overstreet in Roanoke.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet, 43, was killed and six people were wounded last
Friday when a gunman opened fire in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Ronald Edward Gay, 54, told the police he was upset
that his last name made him the brunt of homosexual jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Candace Shultis, an avowedly gay minister at a
Washington church, said ``we are gathered here today to say that
enough is enough that hate is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Sapperstein, director of the Washington-based
Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said the legislation is
essential to stopping future hate crimes. It ``is not simply
feel-good legislation,'' he said. ``It will make a real difference
to Americans whose safety is continually threatened because of
their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Shelton, director of the Washington branch of the NAACP,
said lawmakers should approve ``sane and sensible hate crimes laws
to prevent this from ever happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the hate crimes legislation as an amendment
to the annual military spending bill. The House expressed support,
but in a non-binding resolution. House and Senate conferees are
hashing out the voluminous defense bill, which typically deals with
the numbers of weapons to be purchased and military research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles S. Robb, D-Va., who supports the measure and is a
member of the Armed Services Committee, said it was not certain
that the hate crimes measure would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not by any means a done deal,'' Robb told the crowd
across from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would expand the existing federal hate crimes
law to cover crimes motivated by sexual orientation, gender or
disability. The current law encompasses crimes in which the
victim's race, religion or national origin are the motivation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill would give states the latitude to ask the
federal government for help investigating and prosecuting hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who supports the legislation, has accused
Republican leaders in Congress of blocking the legislation for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what the deal is here,'' Clinton said earlier this
week. ``The Republican majority does not want a bill that
explicitly provides hate crimes protections for gay Americans. And
I think they think it will split their base.''

 &HT;    Drugs, sex and scandal - Welcome to the Olympics
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ On a night where she won her second gold medal, her
disgraced husband was banished to the stands and her own reputation
came under question, Marion Jones was handed a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered Olympic star turned out to be nothing but a
warm-up act for the two women who shared the medal stand with her,
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Jones just may owe them her Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Davis-Thompson and Susanthika Jayasinghe _ who finished
second and third in the 200 meters _ did for Jones what the
ratings-conscious NBC apologists, her own public relations hacks,
Johnny Cochran and Nike could not.
</P>
<P>
   The pair drew the attention away from the American sprinter, so
much so that both Jones and the hundreds of international media who
had muscled into a post-race press gathering could only sit back
and get led on an unexpected, wild ride of race, sex, drugs and a
red sports bra.
</P>
<P>
   If you want Olympic scandal, the revelation of positive drug
tests by Jones' husband _ shotputter C.J. Hunter _ barely hold a
candle to the drug dilemma of Jayasinghe.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she felt about winning a bronze medal for her native
Sri Lanka, the 24-year-old sprinter _ using the English she knew _
shocked the crowd:
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped my training, I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. They
gave me a terrible time. When I go back October 2 with my bronze
medal, they will be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, she used to be known as ``The Dazzling Gazelle.''
After winning a silver medal in the 200 meters at the 1997 World
Championships in Athens, Greece, she returned home, where
newspapers proclaimed she had ``showered the motherland with glory
and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when she tested positive for nandolene _ the
same steroid an International Olympic Committee official said
Hunter tested positive for four times this year _ and she was
condemned by the government and press. Although cleared of all
charges after a legal fight, she is still labeled a drug cheat by
many at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem started because the sports minister wanted sex
from me and I refused,'' Jayasinghe said once she stepped away from
the microphones. ``After that I was called for a drug test. But
they did not seal the sample. I asked them to sign a letter saying
it was not sealed. They kept refusing. I knew there would be
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thy did something to it. I am a clean girl, but it took me a
long time to prove it. They damaged my character . . . That's why I
moved to Los Angeles last year with no money, no sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she continues to run for Sri Lanka, she shrugged:
``What am I to do? You find me another country and I'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jayasinghe had begun her tale on stage, Jones sat there
wide-eyed . . . and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The American star only had to answer a few questions about her
husband, whose Olympics credential had been lifted by the United
States Olympic Committee. Instead of spending the night in the
athletes' area of Olympic Stadium _ as he had Saturday night when
his wife won the 100 meters just as easily as the 200 _ he sat in
the grandstands, a couple of rows from the track, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones made her victory lap _ after clocking a 21.84 to
Davis Thompson's 22.27 and Jayasinghe's 22.28 _ she stopped and
went into the seats, where she gave her husband two quick kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about him later, she said: ``He has been a good
supporter through my whole quest for five. Just because this came
up, he's not going to hide in his apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested the revelations of Hunter's failed drug
tests had become an almost unmanageable burden, Jones disagreed:
</P>
<P>
   ``What went on the past couple of days could suddenly have
swayed me, but it didn't. I've been dreaming about this for years
and to let one event in my life _ as dramatic as it might be _ stop
me wouldn't be worth it. I think about all the days my mom drove 4
and 5 hours to take me to a track meet. I think of the days my
brother picked me to be on his hide-and-seek team. I wasn't going
to let one event ruin all that. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether her own reputation now was besmirched, she shook
her head: ``People who know me, who support me, who coach me know
that I am a clean athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Thompson then took over center stage and Jones didn't
argue. Instead of enduring a stressful grilling, she would be able
to relax on the eve of Friday's long jump competition, the one solo
event in which she seems vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being on guard, Jones soon was laughing as she
listened to the outspoken, 34-year old Bahamian, who is competing
in her fifth Olympics and had just won her first individual medal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she had thought about on the medal stand, Davis
Thompson first mentioned her deceased father and then, out of
nowhere, the sister of her high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I was about 14, I was what you call heavy-busted and
had a big butt,'' she said. ``(The coach's sister) was sitting in
the stands at a meet in Jamaica when she heard other coaches say,
'That girl will never amount to anything as a runner because of her
chest.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day we drove all over Jamaica until she found me one
of those old- style sports bras. She got me a hideous color _ it
was red _ and I had to strap myself in it. She told me I had to
wear it day and night. I slept in it. I never ever took it off.''
</P>
<P>
   As she went into more candid detail, she soon had the whole room
laughing. ``Anyway,'' she said, 'it worked because here I am
today.''
</P>
<P>
   She told one story after another. On first meeting Cathy
Freeman, the Aboriginal Australian who has become her close friend,
she said: ``The first thing I asked her was, 'Girl, just what color
are you?'''
</P>
<P>
   As she talked of her pride in representing the Bahamas _ ``A
little country of just 275,000,'' _ she laid down the gauntlet to
Jones, whom she'll face again in the 400 meter relay: ``In 1996, we
won the Olympic silver medal. In 1999, we took the world
championships. We put three Bahaman girls in the 100 meter finals
here. We are still the underdog, but we love it. It will just make
our victory a little sweeter, Marion. We are going to give you one
hell of a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in private, Davis-Thompson offered the real challenge of
the Games:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disillusioned with my sport now. A lot of today's
athletes are taking drugs because they want fame and glory now.
They don't want to pay the price, don't want to persevere. It's for
the love of money and it has to be now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't realize they're hurting their own bodies and
killing our sport. It most definitely is endangering the Olympics.
We need to clean up our sport. I think one strike and you are out.
No second chances. You know what you are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I heard about Ben Johnson (testing positive at the
1988 Olympics) I cried. With Merlene Ottey, I cried, too. But when
I heard about C.J., I didn't cry. I think it's because I'm finally
numb.
</P>
<P>
   ``In private athletes talk about who they think is cheating and
who is not. I've never confronted the ones I think are cheating,
but I've given them that look. It says, 'Shame. . . shame. . .
shame. It says I'm disgusted in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Thompson continued to hold court well into the night.
Although Jones was long gone, something she said earlier rang true.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her Olympic experience, she said she had lay awake
many nights dreaming about what it would be like. But those dreams,
she said, couldn't compare to the reality.
</P>
<P>
   From the Opening Ceremonies to stepping out into the massive
sold-out stadium to going to seeing other competitions and meeting
the athletes, she said she'd been struck by one thing:
</P>
<P>
   ``All this seems so much bigger than one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night it was.
</P>
<P>
   And because of it, Marion Jones' Olympic Games may have been
saved.

RACIAL HARMONY MESSAGE LOOMS LARGE IN `TITANS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sad fact about most Hollywood movies that pay lip service to
racial harmony these days is that, overall, they convey the exact
opposite message, telling us the races are very different indeed
and we have a great deal to fear from one another.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Denzel Washington's new movie, ``Remember
the Titans,'' is that _ unlike so many of his films (``Malcolm X,''
``The Hurricane'') _ it really does communicate an optimistic sense
that race is irrelevant and we can all live happily ever after
together.
</P>
<P>
   It's essentially a remake of the milestone 1971 TV-movie,
``Brian's Song,'' which told the true story of the friendship that
developed between two professional football players _ a bigoted
white Southern and a Northern black _ when they were forced to room
together on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the same year as ``Brian's Song'' and also based on a
true story, the football team here is the first squad produced by a
newly integrated Virginia high school, commanded by a hard-as-nails
black coach (Washington) who got his job thanks to affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the film fast-forwards through the inevitable locker
room race-baiting scenes as the boys learn to trust one another and
become friends rather quickly. The bulk of the movie deals with
conflict between the now racially harmonious team and its larger
Southern community.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``Remember the Titans'' is pretty much your standard
``Rocky''-style competition movie, with some gripping gridiron
moments and some agreeable rise-to-the-occasion heroics but no real
surprises on its way to the big, fourth-quarter finish for the
state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the film was made for super-producer Jerry
Bruckheimer's new low-budget unit, it has an over-produced quality
about it, and, I suspect, exaggerates the Jim Crow mentality of
Alexandria, Va., in 1971 _ more than 15 years after the birth of
the Civil Rights Movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the script is very good in convincingly portraying the way
the teammates learn to trust one another, overcome their prejudices
and even laugh at the absurdity of racism. And director Boaz Yakin
(``A Price Above Rubies'') keeps the sentimentality in check,
filling his scenes with a succession of small, deft touches that
bring the film to life.
</P>
<P>
   The adult stars are subordinated to the team ensemble, but Will
Patton is just right as the white coach who gets his consciousness
raised, and Washington is even better as a complex, ambitious,
never completely sympathetic character who is a big step away from
the one-note martyrs he's been playing lately.

 &HT;    'The all-or-nothing agony of John Capel'
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ John Capel, the man who quit Steve
Spurrier's Florida football team in April to work full time on
winning an Olympic gold medal, believed he had the perfect game
plan for Thursday night's wide-open 200-meter final.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fumbled the snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing to Tennessee up there on a missed field goal in
overtime in front of 100,000 people, that's about the only thing I
can compare it to,'' said Capel, who wasn't comfortable in the
starting blocks and was rocking back when the starter's gun
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Lose to Tennessee, no matter how humiliating the experience, and
there's always a chance to get it right next September. Guess wrong
at the Olympics and there are four years of frustration to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Capel, who ran fastest in the semifinal but finished dead last
when the medals were on the line, rushed to see a replay of the
race. He wanted to see if there should have been a second chance,
to see if the recall starter blew it by failing to see Capel's
movement and failing to signal a false start in response.
</P>
<P>
   Thus convinced, the open-field sensation Spurrier calls John
John returned to a small gaggle of Florida-based reporters and
talked his way all the way into the next Olympics. Konstantinos
Kenteris of Greece may have shocked the world by winning the
200-meter gold medal in 20.09 seconds, but Capel made certain that
he too would be noticed. Here is where the track world gets a load
of Trash Talk 101, college football style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys that beat me in that race,'' said Capel, ``they
will never beat me again. Ever. What they ran tonight, I jog.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, but Capel did have time to look back twice in
his semifinal to see if Ato Boldon or anybody else was coming up on
him. They weren't, and the preacher's kid from Brooksville, a small
town north and east of Tampa, coasted home in 20.10. That was
three-tenths faster than his second-round time and 39-hundredths
faster than his first round. Capel was building toward something
big, all right, perhaps as big as the 19.85 he ran to win the U.S.
Olympic Trials in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran in one of the slowest 200 meters ever at the
Olympics,'' said Capel, ``and I lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell it like it is, Johnny. This was the slowest gold-medal time
since the U.S.-boycotted Moscow Olympics in 1980, and Capel did
waste a beautiful opportunity. Remember, Michael Johnson and
Maurice Greene weren't in this race. They both went down with
injuries during the Olympic Trials final that Capel won so handily
at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I win every 200-meter race until the next Olympics, I
will not step on a football field,'' said Capel, who until this
moment had planned to re-enroll at Florida in January and return to
the Gators as a running back and kick returner in the fall of 2001.
``It's pitiful. I ran a stupid race. I will not step onto a
football field until I win the 2004 gold medal, and I promise you I
will win that 200 meters.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Wells, manager of Capel's professional track career,
raised an eyebrow at that one. He was a sprinter, too, long ago at
Arizona State. He understands the mentality, the challenge of
training month after month at the risk of a 20-second flameout.
Capel's anger, he said, was troublesome because it is so
uncharacteristic.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics have a way of doing that, coaxing tears and tirades
from the most stoic of athletes. It's the infrequency of it all,
the four-year gap between a runner in his prime and a dreamer lost
in a world where mulligans are always honored and justice always
prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a competitor,'' Wells said. ``He doesn't ever want to
lose, but to lose on a technical point, it's real tough for him. He
had a chance to definitely get the gold medal. If the recall
starter is doing his job properly, it should have been restarted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a sprinter. I've been caught like that, too. Boom,
everybody's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone to glory, and leaving you in a cloud of disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Capel, 21 and good to go with the Gators for a couple more
seasons, may rethink his decision on football once the adrenaline
drops back to a manageable level. What he said 10 minutes after
Thursday's race, however, that won't change. It's what he believes.
It's what he knows to be true, that the flags of Greece and Great
Britain and Trinidad and Tobago shouldn't be flying over an Olympic
sprint medal ceremony, and that the two representatives of the
U.S., Coby Miller and John Capel, shouldn't be the last two
stragglers to cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson's catty comment on the morning of the race, a
prediction to reporters that Capel wouldn't medal, may have been
based on something like this, something that comes from
inexperience in monumental meets like this.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's Capel's fault for not being ready to fly at the one
moment, perhaps in his entire lifetime, that the sky was the limit.
Can't blame that on anybody else. But there has to be some kind of
psychological safety net for one who falls so far, so fast. Lousy
officiating, that's the alibi that's most common to the players and
the fans of college football.
</P>
<P>
   Had Capel been back at Knoxville with the Gators a few weeks
back instead of running track in Sydney, he would have heard it
coming from the Tennessee throng, 110,000 strong and in complete
agreement that Florida beat their Vols on a bad call.
</P>
<P>
   That same number of passionate sports fans watched Thursday's
Olympic track meet with a more discerning eye and a broader
perspective. They had the effervescent Marion Jones to watch and a
long jump competition to figure out and Marla Runyan, a legally
blind 1,500-meter runner, to wish and hope around the track. And,
hey, if some mystery guy from Greece is running for the finish line
ahead of all the 200-meter favorites, that was something to cheer
about, too.
</P>
<P>
   They don't share the tunnel vision of the individual Olympian,
the all-or-nothing agony of John Capel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like crap,'' he said. ``I should have been on the medal
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until they get instant replay at the Olympics. Not until a
sprinter can call timeout.

A SOUND, BUT ANNOYING, IDEA
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As someone who is always looking for ways to annoy people
without actually being there, I was thrilled to read about a New
Zealand man who has recorded 64 minutes of lawnmower noise.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Reuters story, Geoff Marsland was looking for a
way to get back at inconsiderate neighbors who partied late into
the night, presumably without inviting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do is you get up at 7 o'clock in the morning, put the
lawnmowing CD on and go out to a cafe,'' Marsland said.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners get to enjoy general lawnmower sounds along with the
occasional sound of the grass-catcher being emptied and stones
hitting the blades.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the guy who used to fire up his dragster at 2 o'clock
in the morning, I have had considerate neighbors, by which I mean
neighbors whose idea of ``partying'' is falling asleep in front of
the TV before South Park comes on. The only reason I would put the
lawnmowing CD on at 7 in the morning would be to fool my neighbors
into thinking I was actually cutting the grass. It might work once
or twice, but I'm betting they would eventually catch on,
especially if the grass grew high enough to obscure the house.
</P>
<P>
   But I think Marsland is on to something with this pre-recorded
noise business. His previous album, titled ``Urban Assault,''
featured motorcycle noise, car alarms and, most inspired of all, a
baby crying.
</P>
<P>
   I am betting that the rate of teen pregnancy _ and the rate of
pregnancy for all age groups, for that matter _ would go way down
if people were made to sit in a room and listen to a squalling
infant for 64 minutes. You wouldn't have to worry about another
Baby Boom threatening Social Security or taxing our elderly care
facilities; in fact, the only problem might be handling all the
requests for sterilizations.
</P>
<P>
   A pre-recorded CD would come in handy during those times when
you would rather be someplace else. Take Little League baseball
games, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   These games can be torturously slow to the point it can take
several days to complete a single inning. Instead of sitting there
for hours on the hard bleachers waiting for the pitcher to throw a
strike, why not play a CD while you go home for a much-needed nap?
</P>
<P>
   Pre-recorded comments could include: ``Good eye!,'' ``You'll get
'em next time,'' ``Way to wait for your pitch,'' ``Just play
catch'' and, of course, ``Keep your head in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   (Given the violent behavior of certain Little League parents
lately, you might want to record the sound of a police siren, just
in case.)
</P>
<P>
   Holiday gatherings can be uncomfortable for some, but not if a
CD player is taking your place. Pre-recorded comments could
include: ``So, I see you've put on weight,'' ``Did I tell you that
my daughter just graduated from medical school?,'' ``We used to
live in an old house like this,'' ``That's not meat, is it?,''
``Mind if I smoke a cigar?'' and, of course, ``You don't mind if we
stay over for a few days?''
</P>
<P>
   Given the vague, uninspiring content of their campaign speeches,
the two major presidential candidates may as well convey their
messages via CD. It would consist of a 64-minute repetition of the
words, ``Trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   And we voters could listen via CD, too. The only difference
would be that ours would consist of 64 minutes of snoring.

 &HT;    Williams duo take the Olympic doubles title
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Steffi Graf had a Golden Grand Slam year in 1988,
winning all four of tennis' major events plus an Olympic gold
medal, but she didn't get to share the experience with anyone.
Venus Williams, winner of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open earlier this
summer and singles champion of the Sydney Games, won the Olympic
doubles title with sister Serena Thursday afternoon and had so much
fun in the process that a new Grand slam agenda may be in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the world's best players will compete in the 2004
Athens Olympics, which may conflict with the U.S. Open, Venus said,
``Oh, yeah, I tend to think so. Most of us players hold the
Olympics high. Four years is a long ways to go, but I hope that
everyone will make the effort to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Lindsay Davenport won the gold medal at
Atlanta, Venus was 16 and just beginning to test the WTA tour with
limited success. Serena, 14 at the time, wasn't quite ready to turn
pro. Today they are the hottest names in tennis, both individually
and as a pair. Thursday's 6-1, 6-1 crushing of the Dutch team of
Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans was the 22nd straight doubles
victory for the Williams sisters, Southern California girls who
live now in Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   They won five matches in Sydney and were pushed to a third set
only once, when Russia's Elena Likhovtseva and Anastasia Mysinka
won the opening set of a second-round match but got steamrolled
6-2, 6-3 thereafter. And all this happened in Venus' spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Her top priority was winning the singles gold, a six-match
mission that included three-set wins over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
and Monica Seles and concluded Wednesday with a 6-2, 6-4 win over
Russia's Elena Dementieva in the title match. Venus is the first
woman since American tennis legend Helen Wills Moody in 1924 to win
gold in singles and doubles at the same Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very strong,'' Dementieva said. ``One year ago she just
had a very good serve and a few shots. Now she's doing
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And quickly, too. Venus and Serena won the Wimbledon doubles
gold-medal match in 49 minutes. It took Venus just six minutes more
to win the gold-medal singles match the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's five-set men's gold-medal singles match, which went
on before the Williamses, was won by Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov
over Germany's Tommy Haas in three hours and 34 minutes. That meant
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch couldn't stay long enough to
present the medals, but the Williams sisters didn't need that to
thoroughly enjoy the ceremony and the joyous conclusion of a
harried summer schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very happy moment for me actually to watch Venus win,
and to have the same opportunity today, it was great,'' said
Serena, who experienced this situation in reverse at the 1999 U.S.
Open by winning the singles title and teaming with Venus to win the
doubles. ``We went out there prepared and we came out gold
medalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that preparation was an intense practice session on a
side court while the men's singles match dragged on inside the main
tennis stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to this match really serious,'' Venus said. ``We
practiced for an hour and 10 minutes to warm up, which is very
unusual for us. We practice all types of doubles drills. Then when
we went out there, we went for every point. We really, really
focused and it really paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Venus and Serena are not the first set of sisters
to represent the U.S. in Olympic tennis. Marion and Georgina Jones
both played in the 1900 Paris Games, with Marion winning the silver
medal in singles.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, U.S. players have swept every Olympic medal
available to women. Jennifer Capriati won the singles gold in 1992
and Davenport won in 1996. The team of Mary Joe Fernandez and Gigi
Fernandez, not related, won the doubles gold each year.

EUROPEANS CALLED LIKELY TO BLOCK ONE TIME-WARNER DEAL, APPROVE
ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ European antitrust regulators plan to block
Time Warner's joint venture with the British music conglomerate EMI
Group but are much closer to approving Time Warner's $135 billion
merger with America Online, people close to the talks said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Monti, the European antitrust commissioner, issued
recommendations on both deals on Wednesday in a closed meeting with
antitrust regulators from individual European countries, these
people said.
</P>
<P>
   European officials said Thursday that neither Monti nor most of
the national competition regulators were satisfied with EMI's
proposed concessions, which include selling a few of its small
record labels as well as the logistical operations that physically
distribute music products around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   European officials object that a deal between EMI and Time
Warner would reduce the number of worldwide music distributors to
four from five, and they are pushing for divestitures that the
companies are loath to offer.
</P>
<P>
   But they are increasingly comfortable with Time Warner's
acquisition by America Online, especially if Time Warner abandons
the EMI venture. That, European officials say, would reduce
anxieties that America Online could use its new power in the music
business to cement its dominance in online services.
</P>
<P>
   One national regulator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said the AOL merger could win approval fairly easily if Time Warner
either makes big new concessions on EMI or abandons the deal
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the problems with the EMI deal were resolved either way,
then that would remove the major impediment'' to approval of the
AOL merger, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed, at least implicitly, by German competition
regulators. Ulf Boege, head of Germany's cartel office and a member
of the advisory group that met on Wednesday with Monti, has
publicly warned that the EMI deal would severely restrict
competition in the music industry. By contrast, Boege has been
silent about the Time Warner merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's spokesman in New York, Edward Adler, broadly
acknowledged Thursday that the company's prospects for approval of
its deal with AOL looked good while those for the EMI deal were
more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding America Online, Adler said that discussions with the
European Commission were ``nearing an end''' and that ``we are
confident they will be concluded successfully.'' But regarding EMI,
Adler said only that ``the process is continuing and is
constructive.'' The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also reviewing
the EMI deal, but it has not issued an opinion yet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though both Time Warner and America Online are U.S.
companies, the European Commission has the right to block their
proposed merger because the companies conduct more than 250 million
euros a year of business in European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
   If the European Commission does approve the AOL-Time Warner
combination, the deal still faces tough scrutiny from regulators at
two federal agencies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the FTC have hinted that they would move to block
the deal unless the companies agree to a broad range of rules
intended to foster competition, including opening Time Warner's
high-speed Internet cable lines to rival Internet service providers
on nondiscriminatory terms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the FTC have also been examining whether the proposed
merger would lead to AOL moving away from using high-speed
telephone lines, as one company memorandum suggested. America
Online executives have denied that would be part of their strategy,
but the FTC is exploring whether to impose conditions requiring
AOL, the world's largest Internet service provider, to continue to
make use of high-speed telephone lines as well as Time Warner's
cable network.
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Communications Commission, officials announced
Thursday that they had begun a proceeding to determine whether to
issue industrywide rules to force all high-speed Internet companies
to open their lines to rival service providers on equal terms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the commission's decision to invite comments
from the industry over the so-called open access rules had been
prompted by conflicting court opinions on the subject and did not
necessarily mean that new rules would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that final decisions about whether to
impose new rules would not be made by the FCC until sometime next
year. By then, the agency is likely to have several new
commissioners and possibly a different chairman, making it
impossible to predict whether the agency intends to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The officials emphasized that the decision to invite comments
about possible new rules had no effect on the review of the
proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of those companies have said that they would
volunteer to keep their cable systems open to rivals, but that it
would be unfair for the government to impose such conditions on
them without also imposing them on other cable companies, like
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Under its rules, the European Commission must decide on the EMI
deal by Oct. 18 and on the America Online merger by Oct. 24. But
both the companies and their opponents have already submitted their
comments and proposed compromises, and European officials are
widely expected to reach a decision much sooner than the official
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and EMI executives said they had not given up hope
of winning approval for their deal, but the difficulties will be
hard to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Under the European Commission's rules, companies are supposed to
offer their proposed ``remedies'' no later than one month before
the deadline for a final decision. That deadline passed last week.
And while there is room for bargaining, companies are not supposed
to submit entirely new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the companies do propose new compromises, both Time
Warner and EMI appear reluctant to give up major record labels in
order to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely the union of Warner Music's strength in the
United States with EMI's base in Europe that made the joint venture
attractive to them.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry rivals of Time Warner, notably at Walt Disney Co.,
are still lobbying hard for Brussels to reject both the EMI and
America Online deals.
</P>
<P>
   One critic called AOL's proposed remedies a ``joke,'' saying
they provided no assurances of open access for rivals to its
network. Disney officials have argued that they want guarantees of
open access, without any discrimination in terms of pricing or
technical conditions, for independent suppliers of entertainment
and information as well as simply independent Internet service
providers.

ISRAELI POLICE STRUGGLE TO CONTROL RIOTERS AT HOLY SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli riot police Thursday fired rubber bullets at
hundreds of Palestinian rock-throwers at a site holy to both
Muslims and Jews and squarely in the way of an Israeli-Palestinian
peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The clash immediately followed the visit of Israel's hard-line
opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, to the 30-acre shrine known to
Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders said the visit by Sharon, one of the Israeli
leaders most reviled in the Arab world and a vehement opponent of
any concessions on Jerusalem, was a clear provocation. Palestinians
shouted, ``Murderer, get out!'' as Sharon, backed by about 1,000
Israeli troops, passed the ancient stone ramparts of the compound
in Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black Ray Ban sunglasses and surrounded by security
guards and soldiers, Sharon smiled as he greeted reporters outside
the compound, even as the first round of gunshots cracked in the
air and rioting ignited inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here with a message of peace. . . . I came here to the
holiest place for the Jewish people to see what happens here,''
Sharon said, explaining that the visit was intended to demonstrate
Israeli sovereignty over the site.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called Sharon's visit ``very
dangerous'' and said that Arab and Islamic nations should ``move
very fast'' in protecting the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, about 200 Palestinian
university students reacted to Sharon's visit by clashing with
Israeli troops and carrying a banner that read, ``Jerusalem is the
capital of Palestine. Sharon get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli supporters of the peace process characterized as a
dangerous stunt Sharon's expedition to what Jews call the Temple
Mount, where the Temples of Solomon and Herod once stood and which
today is the most sacred site in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was aimed at increasing Sharon's visibility as
leader of the Likud Party at a time when the party's former leader,
deposed prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was cleared of
corruption charges and poised to regain party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Likud has vowed to topple the fragile One Israel coalition
government of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and call for early
elections, largely in reaction to concessions Barak has made to
find a formula to share sovereignty over Jerusalem, which both
Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been in stalemate over the
issue of Jerusalem, and specifically over who will have sovereignty
of the site holy to both faiths. Currently, Muslim clerics have
autonomy in administering the site, and Israeli police assert
control over security.
</P>
<P>
   The rival claims to the site are often couched in apocalyptic
rhetoric by religious extremists, and the holy shrine has been the
site of deadly clashes. In 1996, about 80 people, most of them
Palestinians, were killed in riots after the Netanyahu government
opened an archeological tunnel under the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our holy place,'' Sharon said Thursday. ``There will
be problems if Jerusalem is divided as the prime minister wants.
Many problems will be caused here.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Sharon used the phrase, ``The Temple Mount is in
our hands,'' a reference to the legendary words of the late Israeli
army officer Motta Gur when Israeli paratroopers captured
Jerusalem's Old City in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sharon even finished his appearance before the television
crews, the first Israeli soldier to be wounded in the violence was
rushed out on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the brief clash, 12 Israeli riot police were
slightly wounded and two were seriously wounded. At least three
Palestinians were wounded. Four other Palestinians, including two
senior government officials, were beaten with police batons.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, who describes himself as ``not religious,'' wore a blue
knitted kippa, or Jewish prayer cap, Thursday when he visited the
Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharon visited, dozens of religious Jews wearing prayer
shawls surrounded him and cheered before the massive Herodian stone
wall that is all that remains of the Second Temple, destroyed by
the Romans in AD 70.
</P>
<P>
   But Chaim Meiselman, 21, an ultra Orthodox Yeshiva student,
expressed a view common among many religious Jews that it is
forbidden for Jews who are not ``ritually pure'' to enter the
Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even during the time of the Temple, only the high priests were
permitted inside the courtyard,'' explained Meiselman, as he
watched the TV cameras swarming around Sharon. ``He is not a
religious Jew. I don't know what kind of Jew he thinks he is. It is
good that he shows he has a feeling for how important this site is
for the Jewish people, but he has to remember that it is against
Jewish law to enter the compound.''

<P>
   Day 14 at the Olympics and journalists and volunteers alike are
starting to exhibit as much energy as the notoriously somnolent
koala. I read somewhere that koalas sleep as much as 20 hours a
day. That would be a good week's worth of rest for the Olympic
family.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell the torrid pace is starting to take its toll on
people. A friend of mine fell asleep in the boarding area of the
Sydney airport. He made his flight only because gate agents rang
his cellular phone and then followed the sound of the ringing to
his slumped person.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend sat down on a bench amid a couple hundred
thousand revelers at Sydney Olympic Park to read a newspaper and a
half-hour later woke himself up snoring.
</P>
<P>
   It's a marathon, but there's no pacing yourself. Not when the
world's best athletes are at your feet. &QL;

FIELD'S DEBUT NOT `BEAUTIFUL,' BUT HAS A NICE PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beauty pageants have been around for a long time and Hollywood
has done its best to expose their dark comedic side in such films
as ``Smile,'' ``Miss Firecracker'' and ``Drop Dead Gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Sally Field takes a more intimate slant,
chronicling the journey of Mona Hibbard (Minnie Driver), an
ambitious, self-absorbed young woman who believes she'll find
acceptance and love by becoming a pageant queen. Instead, Mona
finds respect by facing up to the responsibility of parenting her
neglected, illegitimate daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg).
</P>
<P>
   For her entire life, Mona _ cast aside by her mother and stepdad
_ has wanted to be a beauty pageant winner and will stop at nothing
to achieve her goal. She's burned bridges in every county enroute
to the prestigious Miss American Miss contest and even fobbed
Vanessa off on her loyal best friend, Ruby (Joey Lauren Adams), to
raise because the pageant won't allow a candidate to be a mother.
She must be a perfect icon in order to be deemed ``beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' takes some risks because it presents a drastically
extreme character who is largely unlikable and asks us to go along
with her on her voyage. And Driver dives into the part, chewing up
the scenery along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Beautiful'' doesn't have the complexity of a classic
anti-heroine film and the script by Jon Bernstein is often clunky
and excruciatingly unsubtle.
</P>
<P>
   Some subplots involving the angelic Ruby grind and sputter;
they're essentially creaky mechanisms designed to eliminate the
character for a block of screen time. Too, we're left wondering if
Mona isn't similarly stranded, shedding one archaic fantasy for
another by acknowledging the inevitable maternal instinct as well
as the desire to be a beauty queen.
</P>
<P>
   All these oversights are obvious by the time Mona realizes she's
not sure if she ``wants to be a role model for thousands of little
girls or just a role model for one little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful,'' for all Field's sturdy, no-nonsense direction and
Driver's brutality, suffers because of these lapses. It's a better
film when it keeps its heart in cold storage and shows what drives
a woman to compete against her peers. In the end, dark comedy
drives the film, but it's overwhelmed by a desire to be liked,
really liked.

BUSH, GORE CROSS ECONOMIC SWORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Dueling over a theme that could well determine
the election, George W. Bush and Al Gore each pledged Thursday to
nurture the booming economy and cast his opponent as a wasteful
spender who cannot be trusted with the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a familiar Republican battle cry, Bush described his
opponent as a ``tax and spend'' Democrat who has shed his
once-moderate views. Gore, in turn, accused Bush of jeopardizing
the ongoing prosperity with his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut.
``That is why, 40 days from now, prosperity itself will be on the
ballot,'' the vice president declared in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of economic speeches, each candidate emphasized his
``priorities,'' suggesting the other candidate would be unable to
manage the $4.6 trillion federal budget surplus projected over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to employees at a Green Bay manufacturer, was
clearly seeking to blunt the political benefits of that surplus and
the nation's prosperity, issues that have been central to the Gore
campaign. In a speech that focused on attacking Gore, the Texas
governor made a distinction between Gore and the current
administration, painting his opponent as an unreconstructed liberal
out of sync with his own president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president's spending plan proposes three times more
in new spending than Bill Clinton did in 1992,'' Bush said. ``If
the vice president gets elected, the era of `big government being
over' is over. And so too, I fear, could be our prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared the death of big government in his 1996 State
of the Union address, the culmination of years of trying to rid the
Democratic Party of its image as wasteful and inefficent. Gore and
his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, were prominent
members of the so-called New Democrat movement, favoring
more-centrist views and urging government ``reinvention'' to trim
unwieldy bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   But in running for election, Gore ``cast his lot with the old
Democratic party,'' Bush said _ a Republican refrain that was
prominent in his father's first presidential race against Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is proposing the largest increase in federal spending in 35
years, since the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson,'' Bush told
the group of several hundred gathered in a warehouse of Tosca, a
cheese-container manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him, big government has never really been dead. It has
simply been biding its time, waiting for its next chance. The vice
president would like that chance to come next January,'' Bush said.
``But we have come too far, and have learned too much, to go back
to the old ways of tax and spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush even gave detailed and dire statistics: That under Gore,
the nation would see more than 200 new or expanded federal
programs, at least 20,000 more ``Washington bureaucrats,'' a total
of 412 new Medicare regulations, and ``more IRS agents, because
targeted tax cuts means targeted audits.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush said his tax cut would foster further economic
progress and stave off a recession. He also said his plan for
Social Security would prove better for the economy, allowing
younger workers to invest some earnings in the stock market. Gore,
Bush said, would saddle a younger generation with bonds to pay for
Social Security, and potentially raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, while I have ruled out no new Social Security taxes,
my opponent hasn't. There are only 40 days left in the campaign,
and I think he ought to make his intentions clear,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor made the pitch at the start of a two-day
swing through Midwestern battleground states. Friday he is planning
to outline his energy policy, an effort to turn the ongoing
controversy over oil prices to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway across the country, Gore highlighted his pledge to pay
off the national debt by 2012. In a speech at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank, Gore also accused Bush of
being a big-spender by proposing a $1.3 trillion tax cut that the
vice president argued would have the greatest benefit for the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice we make in the next 40 days could well shape our
future for the next 40 years,'' said Gore, wearing a gray business
suit and reading off a TelePrompTer. ``Now is the time to pursue
economic policies that are good for our families and good for
business. This is not the time to invite new deficits and high
interest rates that could stifle both our growth and our hopes.
That is why this issue is so important. That is why, 40 days from
now, prosperity itself will be on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president recounted that when he and President Clinton
took office in 1993, the federal budget was running a $290 billion
annual deficit and the national debt was the largest in history.
Now the country is expected to post a $268 billion surplus next
year. Gore has also pledged to use the bulk of projected surpluses
over the next decade for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   He labeled interest payments on the national debt ``the
third-largest federal program,'' behind Social Security and
national defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it: We spend more on interest payments than we
spend on Medicare,'' Gore said. ``It's a waste of your money, and
we get nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also advocated his brand of targeted tax cuts, tailored to
help families saving for such things as college or paying
child-care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep the right priorities, then we can cut taxes for the
middle class, the people who have the hardest time paying and
saving for the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the tables on Bush, the vice president cast his opponent
as a spendthrift. His biggest complaint was about the governor's
$1.3 trillion tax-cut proposal, which would cost $1.6 trillion over
10 years if debt repayment was slowed so that tax cuts could be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider this fact,'' Gore asked his audience of academics,
college students, and political supporters. ``The other side's plan
gives more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent _ $665 billion
of the surplus _ than all the new money that they would invest in
education, health care, prescription drugs, and national defense _
combined.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated the line for emphasis, adding: ``That's not tax
relief; that's a massive tax on America's potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also accused Bush of proposing ``hundreds of billions'' in
spending on programs, transition costs for his plan to privitize a
portion of Social Security, and a proposal for a ``Star Wars''
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a hardened decision maker, the vice president
said: ``I've said many times that the presidency is not a
popularity contest. Sometimes you have to be willing to spend your
popularity. Sometimes you have to be willing to do what's difficult
or unpopular. It's always easier to spend money you don't have
rather than save for a rainy day. That's how we ended up with a
multitrillion-dollar national debt in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brookings speech was Gore's only public appearance of the
day. He spent much of the day preparing for his debate with Bush
next Tuesday. Friday Gore is speaking in Chevy Chase, Md., close to
the vice president's residence, as he spends the bulk of his time
in debate preparations.

ATTACK ON CELTICS STAR CAST IN CONTRASTING LIGHT AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Was it a brutal attack on a helpless victim, set upon
by men who cut him with glass, pinned him to a pool table, and
knifed him repeatedly?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it instead a barroom brawl that went too far, with the
inevitable flying bottles, fists flailing in both directions,
followed by a botched investigation leading to the wrong suspect?
</P>
<P>
   As Boston Celtics forward Paul Pierce walked out of a hospital
Thursday, a prosecutor and a defense attorney offered starkly
different images of the stabbing that left Pierce with numerous
wounds moments after he showed up at a Theater District nightclub
in the early morning hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In describing a vicious, unprovoked attack on Pierce,
prosecutors offered no motive to explain what prompted the three
suspects to attack Pierce, a star player for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happened inside the second-floor poolroom of the
Buzz Club/Europa, one thing seemed evident as two of the suspects
faced a judge in Boston Municipal Court: The Pierce matter is
unfolding unlike any ordinary assault case, heightened by Pierce's
celebrity, and clouded by old tensions between police and a rap
group often associated with Boston's gangland past.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the two men turned themselves in to police, Trevor
Watson and Tony Hurston turned their backs to news cameras in
Boston Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Both Watson, 34, and Hurston, 31, pleaded not guilty to charges
of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Hurston, who was met by police at Logan Airport Wednesday night,
allegedly struck Pierce in the face with a bottle. Watson, who
surrendered at a downtown police station Wednesday night, is
charged with stabbing Pierce in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A third man, William Ragland, also accused of taking part in the
stabbing, is still at large and wanted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Watson nor Hurston are members of Made Men, a three-man
group with its own record label and a financial stake in a leading
national hip-hop magazine, The Source.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hurston found himself represented by Made Men's attorney,
John Swomley.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Swomley has said that whatever the actions of
Made Men associates _ real or self-styled _ none of rap group's
three members was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he extended that innocence to include Hurston, a Made
Men associate and close friend of the group's frontman Raymond
``Raydog'' Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``He denies any involvement,'' Swomley said of Hurston, who has
no criminal record but had an outstanding warrant for speeding and
driving without a proper license.
</P>
<P>
   While Hurston was at the club that night, Swomley said, his
client got up and left as soon as he saw the commotion near the
pool table. He also said Hurston did not know Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Trading sharp words with the prosecutor in the case, Swomley
accused police of targeting the group without cause and compiling
photographs of anyone in their entourage.
</P>
<P>
   And he raised questions about how police used photo arrays to
identify his client as the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet dollars to Dunkin' Donuts that (police) took
anyone and everyone associated with Made Men and showed their
photographs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors sought $50,000 cash bail for Hurston, Swomley
said the amount did not fit the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this wasn't a Boston Celtic, (the bail) would be $5,000,
not $50,000,'' Swomley said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Raymond Dougan set bail for both Watson and Hurston at
$15,000 cash.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for a higher bail, Assistant District Attorney John
Pappas laid out a scenario of a vicious, unprovoked attack against
Pierce just moments after he stepped into the Buzz Club/Europa with
two friends in for an after-party.
</P>
<P>
   As Pierce stood with his back to the bar, facing two pool tables
and talking to a woman, Pappas said, Jurston approached Pierce,
hooked his arm, and struck him in the head, sending the player
falling to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pierce was down, Pappas said, Hurston bashed him across the
face with a bottle, escalating an attack that later drew in Ragland
and Watson, the two accused stabbers.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing Pierce around the neck from behind, Pappas said, Watson
and Ragland stabbed Pierce at least nine times in the back, face
and neck, with one cut going seven inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the stabbing, Watson was under supervisory
release from a 1995 conviction as a felon in possession of a
firearm. He will now face a judge in US District Court in Boston
for violating federal probation. He could return to federal prison
and serve up to two years before serving any time if convicted in
Pierce's stabbing.

   BRITAIN: NO APPEAL OVER TWINS
</P>
<P>
   The parents of 7-week-old twins joined at the pelvis have
decided not to appeal a Court of Appeal decision giving doctors
permission to separate the infants in an operation that will
sacrifice the life of one to save the other. The couple, from the
island of Gozo, near Malta, had argued that their Catholic faith
compelled them to let nature take its course although it meant the
probable death of both children. But their lawyer said that after
two court decisions against them, ``they feel they have done the
best they can for both daughters.''

   GERMANY: UNITED AGAINST NEO-NAZIS
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the main political parties united in calls to combat
right-wing extremism, which has led to a wave of neo-Nazi violence
against foreigners. The Bundestag president, Wolfgang Thierse, said
such attacks were an assault on a democratic society's values, and
should not be regarded just as a problem in eastern Germany. A
government working group is considering the possibility of banning
the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party.

   Eight people were arrested on charges of selling child

``The embargo has become odious and all people call for its

 &HT;    NUMBER OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPS
 &HT;    With HEALTH-INSURANCE-DATA, for a box/chart, which has moved.
 &HT;    ATTN TEXAS EDS: Your state tops the list in the proportion of
uninsured.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 2 million Americans, half of them children,
obtained health-care coverage last year, the first time in 12 years
that the number of people without health insurance dropped, the
Census Bureau says in a report to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The country's low jobless rate and broader health-care coverage
offered by employers contributed to the turnaround. The number of
people without health insurance declined by 1.7 million between
1998 and 1999, from 44.3 million to 42.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured children fell by more than 1 million to
10 million, from 15.4 percent to 13.9 percent of all children, its
lowest level since 1995. About 567,000 poor children gained health
insurance in 1999, stemming in part from a Clinton administration
push to increase government health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the number of uninsured Americans, particularly among the
working poor, remained high. About 15 of every 100 Americans
remained without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains last year, the number of uninsured has
increased by nearly 8 million since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a morning drizzle after a prolonged drought,'' Ron
Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a non-profit consumer
advocacy group on health-case issues, said of the 1999 decline in
the number of uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults and immigrants were the least likely to have
coverage. Minorities were less likely than whites to have
insurance, though coverage increased across all racial and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Texas topped the list of states with the highest share of
uninsured, 24.1 percent when statistically averaged from 1997 to
1999. Minnesota had the lowest rate of uninsured people, 8.8
percent of its population without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans _ 63 percent _ were covered by a health insurance
plan linked to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving force behind this improvement was an increase in
the likelihood of people having employment-based health
insurance,'' said Robert Mills, author of the Census Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said two vulnerable groups remained worrisome:
low-income working people not eligible for Medicaid or other
government-subsidized health care coverage and young adults unable
to obtain or afford coverage from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   One of every three people in poverty was not covered by a health
plan in 1999, virtually unchanged from the previous year. While
Medicaid covered 12.9 million poor people during at least part of
1999, another 10.4 million people below the poverty line had no
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Only 71 percent of young adults, ages 18-24, had health
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton took office in 1993 pledging health insurance
for all Americans. In the next five years, the ranks of the
uninsured grew by more than 4.5 million as administration efforts
to convince Congress to approve a comprehensive health care
proposal failed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress and the White House have agreed over the years
on a string of incremental measures to expand coverage. Overall,
about one of every four Americans has some form of government
insurance through Medicaid, Medicare or other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and the uninsured has been a major issue in the
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore would expand the federal Children's Health
Insurance Program and provide tax credits for low-income families
and the elderly. Republican George W. Bush has proposed a $2,000
refundable health credit for low-income families not covered by
Medicaid or an employers' health plan to be able to purchase their
own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have promised to make health insurance more
affordable for small businesses who cover their employees. Most new
jobs are created by small businesses, which are less likely to
offer employee health benefits because of the high cost of
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The non-profit Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation has been
studying uninsured families since 1995 and finds that many forego
medical care or wait until a health condition makes it absolutely
necessary to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see so visibly is that the uninsured are working
families living on the edge _ a major illness or accident can push
them over the edge,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's figures are based on its annual population
survey of 50,000 American households.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lower-income Americans were less likely to have health
insurance. About 24 percent of households with annual incomes of
less than $25,000 had no health insurance. (The poverty line is
defined as an income of $17,029 for a family of four and $13,290
for a family of three). About 8 percent of households with incomes
of $75,000 or more were without coverage. But overall, coverage
rates increased for households with incomes of less than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whites were much more likely than minorities to be covered by
health insurance. One of every three Hispanics, or 33.4 percent,
was without health insurance compared to 11 percent for
non-Hispanic whites. About 21 percent of African Americans and
Asian Americans were not covered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workers at large companies were twice as likely to have health
insurance than those employed by small businesses. About 31 percent
of workers at firms with 25 or fewer employers had coverage while
at companies with 1,000 or more employees, 68 percent of workers
had health insurance. (The estimates do not account for employees
that may be covered by another family members job-based insurance
policy).
</P>
<P>
   _ The share of population without health insurance fell in 15
states _ Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North
Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas. Meanwhile, eight states
saw an increase in the proportion of uninsured: Hawaii, Illinois,
Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
The results are based on statistical comparisons of two-year
averages from from each state for 1997-98 and 1998-99.

 &HT;    Atlanta hero to advise Gore on debate issues
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Rescue hero Matt Moseley of the Atlanta Fire
Department is adding another skill to his resume: presidential
debate coach.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley, who carried a crane operator to safety last year in a
daring rescue, has been asked by Vice President Al Gore's campaign
to help Gore prepare for his upcoming debates with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley, 31, is one of 12 ``ordinary Americans'' who Gore hopes
will give him advice about issues that probably will come up during
the debates, the first of which is scheduled for Tuesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Moseley will fly to Sarasota, Fla., where Gore will
be holed up with his family and advisers preparing for the debates.
He'll meet with Gore on Sunday and Monday, and attend the Boston
debate as one of Gore's guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a surprise,'' Moseley said Thursday. ``It's
quite a step. You have to stretch your legs out for a step that
long, but hopefully I'll be able to offer up some advice which he
will be able to take into consideration, which I'm sure he will.
He's obviously wanting to listen to the regular people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Harvard-educated son of a Tennessee senator, has at
times struggled to portray himself as a sympathetic leader in touch
with average Americans. The campaign's selection of a dozen
citizens to supplement the paid advice Gore gets from a team of
Washington advisers is Gore's latest attempt to project a populist
image.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley struck up an acquaintance with Gore on April 12, 1999,
the day he dangled from a helicopter and rescued Ivers Sims from
atop a construction crane next to the burning Fulton Bag and Cotton
Mill in Atlanta's Cabbagetown. Gore, who watched the rescue on CNN,
called Moseley to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley met Gore a month and a half later when the vice
president visited Georgia. Last month, Moseley was one of several
law enforcement officers and firefighters recognized at the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since he got the call from the Gore campaign, Moseley said he
has been asking around the firehouse _ Atlanta's Squad 4 _ for any
issues that he should bring up with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare reform, Medicare, Medicaid and the budget deficit topped
the list, he said. In addition to that, Moseley said, he wants to
bring up gun control, an issue about which he has mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really that much in favor of it, but I'm not against
it, either,'' he said. ``I do think there needs to be some reform
in the laws, because I don't believe the ones on the books now are
that effective.'' On Thursday, Moseley was scrambling to find
colleagues who could trade work days with him so he could make the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day that you get asked by a presidential
candidate to give an opinion on issues,'' he said.

LAW OFFICERS QUESTION FBI'S RELATIONS WITH MOBSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For decades, FBI and Justice Department officials
likened the Italian-America Mafia to a national cancer that had to
be eradicated at any cost. But for many in law enforcement, the
mind-numbing number of murders attributed Thursday to gangsters
James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen Flemmi suggests that -- at
least in Boston -- the cure was worse than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi and Bulger, who for years informed on their Mafia rivals
as part of the FBI's controversial, ultra-secret Top Echelon
informant program, were charged with committing 18 murders between
them and ordering three others, most while the two Winter Hill Gang
leaders were working as FBI informants. Some of their victims were
fellow informants in a position to incriminate them.
</P>
<P>
   As the two gangsters were helping the FBI make cases against
their Mafia competitors, prosecutors charge that they were killing
at a frightening pace. Even officials who have long defended the
use of hardened criminals as informants say the scope of these new
murder allegations shock the conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally unheard of,'' said Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, a
former FBI Executive Assistant Director and number two official at
the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern called the indictment ``a deep stain
on the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were at least as bad and at least as violent as the
Mafia,'' Stern said. ``Certainly, based on what we now know, it was
a horrible mistake for these guys to be used as informants.''
</P>
<P>
   According to longtime prosecutors and defense attorneys who have
worked on organized crime cases, members of the Patriarca crime
family, New England's Mafia franchise, were charged with as many as
a dozen murders during the years that Bulger and Flemmi were
members of the FBI's Top Echelon program -- a half- dozen less than
Bulger and Flemmi are charged with committing.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials caution against a strict numerical comparison
because there has been a more complete accounting of the Winter
Hill Gang's crimes because two of its top associates, Kevin Weeks
and John Martorano, are cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the murders believed to have been committed by Patriarca
family members are still unsolved, making an accurate estimate
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many officials, including Stern, are now pronouncing
the two groups equally deadly, a remarkable admission, they say,
given the fact that the Mafia was targeted and villified while
Bulger and Flemmi were coddled and allegedly protected by their FBI
handlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cure was worse than the illness,'' said one former Boston
FBI agent who was against using Bulger and Flemmi as informants.
``Evidence is showing that, giving them a pass was not a good
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Both groups, court records show, were equally capable of
sadistic cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Bulger and Flemmi tortured legendary
burglar Arthur ``Bucky'' Barrett by pulling his teeth one by one to
learn where he kept his loot, before killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo ``Hole in the Head'' Patrizzi, meanwhile, was allegedly
hogtied by Patriarca family soldiers in such a manner that he
slowly strangled himself to death while locked in the trunk of a
car.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a difference, the former Boston agent said, it was
that the Mafia's murders were more predictable, more based on the
code of the underworld, than Bulger and Flemmi's.
</P>
<P>
   Patrizzi had vowed revenge for his brother's killing and was
perceived as a threat. Legendary hitman Joseph Barboza was killed
by Patriarca family captain Joseph ``J.R.'' Russo for working with
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi, on the other hand, appear to have been
``emboldened'' and ``enabled'' by their relationship with the FBI
and killed seemingly without regard to underworld taboos, the
former agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became almost serial murderers,'' the former agent said.
``That is the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Among their alleged victims were Flemmi's girlfriend, Debra
Davis, and Deborah Hussey, the daughter of Flemmi's longtime
companion.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives of Bulger and Flemmi's alleged victims say they
believe the FBI bears equal responsibility for their deaths.
Several families have said they plan to file wrongful death claims
against the FBI in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys they took down in the North End are 10 times the
men these rats were,'' said Davis' brother, Victor. ``Taking down
the Italian mob in Boston was more important than my sister's
life.''

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>

   What Rhymes With Tweak?
</P>
<P>
   Confirming rumors that first emerged online, the producers of
``Seussical'' said Thursday that the director and choreographer Rob
Marshall will be brought in to help doctor the highly anticipated
musical.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse two-sentence statement the producers said: ``Rob
Marshall will be joining the `Seussical' rehearsals to lend an
additional pair of eyes to the show. We're glad to have him with
us.'' Frank Galati will remain the director.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes after several weeks of heavy tinkering
with the show, inspired by Dr. Seuss, which retreated to New York
on Sunday after a bumpy monthlong tryout in Boston. In recent weeks
the show's costume designer has been replaced, blocking and lyrics
have been dropped and added, and the first Broadway preview was
pushed back three days, to Oct. 18. The producers have sought a
positive spin, saying no musical is born wart-free and pointing to
the show's early sales (some $4.5 million).
</P>
<P>
   News of Marshall's involvement first leaked through a theater
Web site, Broadway.com. Marshall, whose credits include the recent
revivals of ``Cabaret,'' ``She Loves Me'' and ``Damn Yankees,''
joins his sister on the creative team of ``Seussical''; Kathleen
Marshall is the show's choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Young British Anguish
</P>
<P>
   Between plays like Jez Butterworth's ``Mojo'' and Mark
Ravenhill's ``Shopping and ...,'' New York stages in recent years
have been awash in the angst of young British playwrights. Now
comes news of two more imports from two of Britain's most touted _
and twisted _ young talents.
</P>
<P>
   Second things first. Beginning in late January audiences will
see the return of Martin McDonagh, who has already had three major
productions in New York, most famously ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane,'' the tale of a wretched old woman and her impulsively
homicidal daughter. (A stove poker was involved.)
</P>
<P>
   That play, which won four Tony awards on Broadway, was the first
of three that McDonagh, a 30-year-old Londoner, set in the soggy _
and fictional _ Irish town of Leenane. In 1999 he returned to New
York with ``The Lonesome West,'' the trilogy's third segment, which
followed the lives of two brothers at war in a dank room. It fared
less well with critics but featured one of the greatest demolitions
of a stove in stage history. (A gun was involved.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the Roundabout Theater Company has announced it will produce
the second installment of the Leenane Trilogy: ``A Skull in
Connemara,'' which, like its predecessors, promises lots of dark
humor and a felony or two. (No weapons have been announced.) The
play had its U.S. debut at A Contemporary Theater in Seattle in
July. The New York production, at the Gramercy Theater, will
include much of Seattle's creative team, including the director
Gordon Edelstein.
</P>
<P>
   Several months before McDonagh's return, another British
playwright will make a posthumous debut under more somber
circumstances. She is Sarah Kane, the onetime enfant terrible of
the British theater whose short career ended last year when she
committed suicide in a London hospital. She was 28.
</P>
<P>
   Kane scandalized and electrified audiences in London in 1995
with her first play, ``Blasted,'' the story of a tabloid journalist
who lures a mentally retarded girl into his home. Kane followed
that work with several other provocative scripts, including ``4:48
Psychosis,'' her final play. Its subject? Despair.
</P>
<P>
   A small Greenwich Village theater, the Axis Company, will stage
the U.S. premiere of one of Kane's most highly praised plays,
``Crave'' (1997), the story of four voices warring for an
individual's soul. One of those voices may sound familiar to fans
of 1980s-era pop: Deborah Harry, the lead singer of Blondie, will
play one of Kane's troubled spirits. Performances are scheduled to
begin on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Aged, That Aquarius
</P>
<P>
   Three months after taking over as artistic director of Encores!,
the annual concert series at City Center, Jack Viertel is ready to
announce his productions for next spring. He's not sure of the
order or the directors, but considering the nature of one of his
choices, that's cool, man.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``Hair,'' the seminal 1968 anti-war musical, which ran
1,750 performances on Broadway and set the standard for nudity long
before ``The Full Monty.'' (No word if Encores! will re-create the
original, um, mise-en-scene.)
</P>
<P>
   Also on tap this season are two earlier gems, including ``A
Connecticut Yankee,'' the 1927 Rodgers and Hart tale (revised in
1943) about a bumbling bachelor who suddenly finds himself at play
in King Arthur's Court (or so he believes).
</P>
<P>
   And finally there's ``Bloomer Girl,'' with music by Harold Arlen
and lyrics by E.Y. Harburg, from 1944. The musical is the story of
an irrepressible suffragette, played by Celeste Holm in the
original. No word yet on who might fill the bloomers this time
around, but Holm herself is busy, and at City Center, no less. She
is to join Joanne Woodward, Edward Herrmann and Alec Baldwin in a
reading of ``Arsenic and Old Lace,'' the inaugural production of
the new Voices! series, on Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   `Slightly Ragged Writer'
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's is the final performance of ``Middle Finger,'' a
little-noticed production by a prolific young writer with some big
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   He is Han Ong, who won a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant
worth $200,000 in 1997 at the ripe old age of 29. Ong, the author
of three dozen plays, says that while the award was a ``huge
shock,'' it has done little to enhance his name recognition. ``I
think I received a sum total of zero offers,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   His current effort, at the Blue Heron Arts Centerin Manhattan,
is produced by Ma-Yi, a company devoted to work about and by
Filipino-Americans, and tells the story of two young men suffering
through puberty.
</P>
<P>
   And while not much attention has been paid, Ong isn't
discouraged; his next play will be produced by Ma-Yi in the spring,
around the time that his first novel is published. ``I'm a prolific
but slightly ragged writer,'' he said. ``I can't imagine spending a
year on anything.''

CLINTON EXTENDS LIBERIANS' STAY IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton Thursday authorized a one-year extension
that will allow Liberian refugees to stay in the US until next
October _ hours before they would've become illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-hour save brought a sigh of relief to Liberians, many
of whom had received letters notifying them that they would be
losing their jobs Friday. But many view it as a Band-Aid approach,
and the wounds will be reopened again next year at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful to the president for giving us another
extention but, you know, people cannot spend their whole lifetime
living on extensions,'' said Torli Krua, president of the Liberian
Community Association of Massachusetts. ``Life is short.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 Liberians have been living in the US since
civil war broke out in their West African country Christmas eve,
1989. An estimated 4,000 of them live in New England. Though the
war ended in 1997, the country, and the region, remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has determined that voluntarily returning
Liberian refugees at this time could lead to further instability in
their country or in the region,'' said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman
for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley added that Clinton would welcome legislation that would
allow Liberians to remain as US residents. The only way to solve
the problem permanently would be for Congress to pass a law
allowing Liberians to adjust from their Deferred Enforced Departure
status.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed has sponsored such a bill, which
he is hoping will pass before the end of the session.

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Chuck Rand was sipping his morning coffee at
the only restaurant in his tiny Illinois hometown when the owner
said Rand's wife was on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck, I need you,'' is all Eleanor Rand managed to say.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed home to find his wife of 38 years sprawled on her
favorite reclining chair _ her eyes rolled back, vomit covering her
blouse.
</P>
<P>
   He took her to the hospital, where doctors said nearly half of
her liver looked like it had been through a shredder. It was April
1998, nine months after she started taking the drug Rezulin for her
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Rand watched as doctors drained fluid from his wife's abdomen,
bloated by her dysfunctional liver. He helped her eat, bathe and
roll over in bed, until she got so big he couldn't roll her
anymore. He stayed by her side as her other organs _ kidneys,
heart, lungs _ also started failing. She died in May 1999 at age
58.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a sledgehammer hitting me upside the head,'' said
Rand, also 58, who has sued Parke-Davis, which developed Rezulin in
Ann Arbor. ``I wish they would have to see what it was like to go
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Rand was one of at least 63 people nationwide whose
deaths have been linked to Rezulin, with some doctors saying the
figure could be 10 times higher. Many more patients had to undergo
liver transplants or be placed on waiting lists, possibly meaning
that thousands were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In March, three years after the drug went on the market and two
years after the first death was reported, Parke-Davis withdrew
Rezulin at the federal Food and Drug Administration's request.
About 1.9 million people had taken it, bringing in nearly $2
billion in sales. Typically it costs about $500 million to bring a
drug to market.
</P>
<P>
   Parke-Davis is a division of Warner-Lambert Co., which this year
merged with Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Ann Arbor News reviewed thousands of documents obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act and interviewed key figures
involved in Rezulin's approval. The newspaper's three-month
investigation found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rezulin was granted fast approval despite warnings about liver
dangers from some FDA staff members.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first FDA medical officer assigned to Rezulin was removed
from the case at Parke-Davis' request after he recommended that the
drug not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   _ An FDA doctors committee that recommended approval of Rezulin
was not told about all the data showing potential liver problems.
The company's presentation to the committee omitted key parts of
the data, but the company said it gave all the information to the
FDA staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parke-Davis and the FDA were reluctant to pull Rezulin from
the market even in the face of mounting evidence that it
contributed to deaths and liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least two members of the FDA doctors committee and a key
National Institutes of Health doctor were paid consultants of
Parke-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johns Hopkins University Hospital, one of the nation's
foremost medical centers, never placed Rezulin on its list of
approved drugs due to concerns about liver problems _ even though
the FDA had approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors say the story of Rezulin, one of at least eight
drugs pulled off the market in the past three years, illustrates
broader issues of drug safety.
</P>
<P>
   While all drugs come with side effects, the FDA has no formula
for deciding if a drug is too risky to approve or whether it should
be pulled off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many mistakes in such a short period of time raises the
question of whether the FDA has allowed the pharmaceutical industry
to gain too much influence,'' said Thomas Moore, a George
Washington University health policy analyst and long-time FDA
observer.
</P>
<P>
   It is buyer beware, said Dr. Jose Francisco Cara, a children's
diabetes specialist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who sat on an
FDA panel that approved Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you use any drug, you really should be thinking about
the benefits and risks of the medication,'' Cara said. ``If you
don't, you're following the Pied Piper and ultimately getting
yourself into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials denied repeated interview requests, but have
said in the past that Rezulin helped hundreds of thousands of
people. Like all diabetes drugs, Rezulin presented risks as well as
benefits, the company said, adding that it gave appropriate
warnings of Rezulin's risks.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   As FDA-appointed doctors gathered around a Bethesda, Md.,
conference table in December 1996 to decide whether to approve
Rezulin, they talked about possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Enlargement of the heart. Weight gain. Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Little was said about liver problems, except that a few research
patients had high liver enzyme levels, a warning sign of possible
liver failure. One of them had jaundice, a yellowing of the skin
that signals liver trouble, according to the meeting minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, assembled as an FDA advisory committee, didn't
learn that 2 percent of 2,500 study patients had liver enzymes
three times higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't learn that 24 patients had to stop taking Rezulin
because of liver problems _ five of them with liver enzymes 30
times too high, two with jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   They also didn't learn that Rezulin's first FDA medical
reviewer, who was concerned about liver problems, was pulled off
the case after recommending that Rezulin not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meeting came less than five months after
Parke-Davis submitted its Rezulin application to the FDA. Most drug
reviews take at least a year. But Rezulin was on a ``fast track''
process of no more than six months, meant to bring cutting-edge
drugs to patients quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fast track'' concept began in the mid-1990s following
pressure from Congress, which was responding to patients with AIDS
and other diseases. They argued that the FDA took too long to get
life-saving drugs to dying people.
</P>
<P>
   FDA's Dr. Alexander Fleming opened the December 1996 meeting by
explaining that Rezulin was slated for quick approval because it
offered a new approach to treating Type II diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, affecting some 15 million U.S. adults, can cause
heart problems, kidney damage, blindness and death. Rezulin worked
by allowing the body to make better use of the insulin it has,
instead of trying (as other drugs do) to get the pancreas to
produce more insulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should explain why we are here earlier than might
otherwise be the case,'' Fleming told the committee. ``Does this
mean that we lower the bar at the same time? Let's be clear about
this: absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of Parke-Davis officials told the committee that Rezulin
had kept blood sugar levels under control during trials, so much so
that many patients were able to reduce or even stop daily insulin
injections. The lower blood sugar levels would result in fewer
complications from diabetes, Parke-Davis promised.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randall Whitcomb, a Parke-Davis clinical research director,
was in charge of delivering bad news about Rezulin. Heart
enlargement and cancer were possible side effects. Fourteen
patients in one study had slightly elevated liver enzymes,
including one with jaundice. But the enzymes returned to normal
after the patients stopped taking the drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research patients who took a sugar pill instead of Rezulin had
the same rate of liver problems as those taking the drug, Whitcomb
said, moving on to other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, the FDA's staff member in charge of giving the
committee all salient information on Rezulin, didn't mention liver
enzymes in his presentation. He only briefly noted some liver
tumors in female lab mice.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming did say that the FDA generally likes to have more than
twice as much patient data as Parke-Davis had submitted before
approving a drug.
</P>
<P>
   After the committee voted unanimously to support Rezulin, FDA
staff followed suit, as it usually does, by approving the drug on
Jan. 29, 1997. It hit the market that March.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't the FDA doctors hear all the information about liver
problems at the December 1996 meeting?
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to The Ann Arbor News, Parke-Davis officials said
they notified FDA staff of all the data.
</P>
<P>
   One FDA staff member said the agency got the data but may not
have sorted it out completely before the meeting because it was
buried in stacks of documents. The company, he said, should have
highlighted the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge there is no basis for an assertion that
Parke-Davis withheld information,'' said the staff member, who was
closely involved in the case but who would speak only on condition
his name not be used. ``On the other hand, putting a few pieces of
paper (about the liver problems) in an application that has several
hundred volumes is only doing what is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, the Ralph Nader consumer advocate group, filed a
petition with the FDA in July 1998 asking that Rezulin be taken off
the market. Last March, just before the drug was withdrawn, the
group requested criminal prosecution of Parke-Davis for covering up
liver data. According to Public Citizen, that spawned an FDA
investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bradbard of the FDA said she couldn't confirm or deny such
an investigation. There has been no criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   At least one FDA official seemed to be aware of enough data to
warrant rejection of Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Gueriguian was the first FDA medical officer assigned
to Rezulin. In 1996, he recommended against approving it, he said
in a recent interview. ``There was a very high probability for
severe liver toxicity,'' Gueriguian said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed skepticism to Parke-Davis officials during a
September 1996 meeting. Shortly thereafter, Parke-Davis complained
to the FDA that Gueriguian had acted inappropriately during the
meeting by using offensive language.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA removed him from the case and any other dealings with
Parke-Davis. He retired in 1998 and now works as a drug industry
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept everything they say about my behavior,'' Gueriguian
said. ``But that has nothing to do with the fact that this drug is
toxic to the liver ... . There must be hundreds, more probably
thousands, who have died _ and tens of thousands severely
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gueriguian would not discuss specifics of the liver data that
convinced him the drug wasn't safe. But when asked why he drew
attention to the data while other FDA staff apparently downplayed
it or didn't see it, he responded: ``I'm competent and honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Rezulin-related death was made public in October 1997.
By the early months of 1999, the death toll had reached 33, despite
three label changes suggesting more blood tests and meant to
prevent more liver injury. Members of Congress started asking tough
questions. Doctors started wondering if they should pull patients
off the drug.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, 1999, the FDA took the unusual step of convening
the advisory committee a second time to discuss Rezulin. The
doctors met again in Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission: to decide whether to expand Rezulin's use,
require more warnings or take the drug off the market.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Rezulin opponents spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   Moore told the committee that Rezulin's benefits paled before
its risks, especially since there were several other diabetes drugs
on the market. ``We are gambling with people's lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Pearson, a Johns Hopkins University pharmacist, said
doctors at his hospital had never accepted Rezulin into their
approved list of drugs. ``We were all acutely aware of the liver
toxicity that was associated with the product,'' Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   The most incriminating remarks came from someone within the FDA
itself, when epidemiologist David Graham recommended that Rezulin
be pulled from the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy presentation, he said that only 15 percent of
Rezulin patients had been properly monitored by their doctors with
blood tests, despite the repeated warnings. He said the reported
deaths and liver problems likely amounted to only about 10 percent
of what was actually occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said one in 1,800 patients on Rezulin likely were
experiencing liver failure. Since about 1.9 million people
eventually took the drug, that translates to a prediction of about
1,000 liver failures.
</P>
<P>
   Parke-Davis officials responded with plenty of
counter-arguments. They said reports of jaundice had dropped
following the label changes. Factors other than Rezulin contributed
to some patients' liver damage; one man who developed jaundice had
consumed 12 beers daily for 20 years. Using a different formula
than Graham's, they said the rate of liver failure was only one in
45,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Parke-Davis representatives also presented a doctor survey
saying 82 percent of patients were properly monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors voted 11-1 to keep Rezulin on the market, and the
FDA made a fourth label change, again requiring more frequent blood
tests.
</P>
<P>
   It would be another year before the FDA would request that
Parke-Davis withdraw the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, less than two months after that vote, Eleanor Rand
died, ending her quiet life in the pastoral farmland of Latham,
Ill., a whistlestop of 400 people between Decatur and Springfield,
the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Rand developed diabetes in the mid-1970s. Her daily
insulin shots didn't control her blood sugar very well, and she
sometimes nearly slipped into diabetic comas.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, her doctor spoke highly of a new pill, Rezulin.
She started on it right away.
</P>
<P>
   The drug worked wonders for her blood sugar. But after several
months, she grew tired and couldn't walk from her recliner to the
kitchen without stopping to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Rand was concerned, so he took her in for a blood test to
check liver enzymes. Her levels were normal.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, she placed the terrified call to him at
the restaurant and had the vomiting episode that sent her to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She was in such bad shape, doctors said she wouldn't survive a
liver transplant. About all they could do was drain fluid through
her groin to counteract the bloating. At first, the draining
procedures were scheduled every four months. But the fluid kept
building up. The procedures had to be repeated more frequently.
Finally, they were being done every week, with the last one coming
the day after Mother's Day and containing both clear fluid and
blood.
</P>
<P>
   She died a day later.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Rand still hears his wife's voice calling for help in the
middle of the night. Well over a year after her death, he still
begins many sentences with ``We.''
</P>
<P>
   At least once a month _ sometimes weekly _ he drives an hour to
Mattoon, to the cemetery where Eleanor Rand is buried. Five
generations of his family are there.
</P>
<P>
   When nobody is looking, he sits on her gravestone and weeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very emotional person,'' he said. ``If I have to go into
court and testify, I don't know if I'll be able to handle it. But
Parke-Davis has to know what they did to us.''

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Chuck Rand was sipping his morning coffee at
the only restaurant in his tiny Illinois hometown when the owner
said Rand's wife was on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck, I need you,'' is all Eleanor Rand managed to say.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed home to find his wife of 38 years sprawled on her
favorite reclining chair _ her eyes rolled back, vomit covering her
blouse.
</P>
<P>
   He took her to the hospital, where doctors said nearly half of
her liver looked like it had been through a shredder. It was April
1998, nine months after she started taking the drug Rezulin for her
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Rand watched as doctors drained fluid from his wife's abdomen,
bloated by her dysfunctional liver. He helped her eat, bathe and
roll over in bed, until she got so big he couldn't roll her
anymore. He stayed by her side as her other organs _ kidneys,
heart, lungs _ also started failing. She died in May 1999 at age
58.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a sledgehammer hitting me upside the head,'' said
Rand, also 58, who has sued Parke-Davis, which developed Rezulin in
Ann Arbor. ``I wish they would have to see what it was like to go
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Rand was one of at least 63 people nationwide whose
deaths have been linked to Rezulin, with some doctors saying the
figure could be 10 times higher. Many more patients had to undergo
liver transplants or be placed on waiting lists, possibly meaning
that thousands were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In March, three years after the drug went on the market and two
years after the first death was reported, Parke-Davis withdrew
Rezulin at the federal Food and Drug Administration's request.
About 1.9 million people had taken it, bringing in nearly $2
billion in sales. Typically it costs about $500 million to bring a
drug to market.
</P>
<P>
   Parke-Davis is a division of Warner-Lambert Co., which this year
merged with Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Ann Arbor News reviewed thousands of documents obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act and interviewed key figures
involved in Rezulin's approval. The newspaper's three-month
investigation found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rezulin was granted fast approval despite warnings about liver
dangers from some FDA staff members.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first FDA medical officer assigned to Rezulin was removed
from the case at Parke-Davis' request after he recommended that the
drug not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   _ An FDA doctors committee that recommended approval of Rezulin
was not told about all the data showing potential liver problems.
The company's presentation to the committee omitted key parts of
the data, but the company said it gave all the information to the
FDA staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parke-Davis and the FDA were reluctant to pull Rezulin from
the market even in the face of mounting evidence that it
contributed to deaths and liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least two members of the FDA doctors committee and a key
National Institutes of Health doctor were paid consultants of
Parke-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johns Hopkins University Hospital, one of the nation's
foremost medical centers, never placed Rezulin on its list of
approved drugs due to concerns about liver problems _ even though
the FDA had approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors say the story of Rezulin, one of at least eight
drugs pulled off the market in the past three years, illustrates
broader issues of drug safety.
</P>
<P>
   While all drugs come with side effects, the FDA has no formula
for deciding if a drug is too risky to approve or whether it should
be pulled off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many mistakes in such a short period of time raises the
question of whether the FDA has allowed the pharmaceutical industry
to gain too much influence,'' said Thomas Moore, a George
Washington University health policy analyst and long-time FDA
observer.
</P>
<P>
   It is buyer beware, said Dr. Jose Francisco Cara, a children's
diabetes specialist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who sat on an
FDA panel that approved Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you use any drug, you really should be thinking about
the benefits and risks of the medication,'' Cara said. ``If you
don't, you're following the Pied Piper and ultimately getting
yourself into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials denied repeated interview requests, but have
said in the past that Rezulin helped hundreds of thousands of
people. Like all diabetes drugs, Rezulin presented risks as well as
benefits, the company said, adding that it gave appropriate
warnings of Rezulin's risks.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   As FDA-appointed doctors gathered around a Bethesda, Md.,
conference table in December 1996 to decide whether to approve
Rezulin, they talked about possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Enlargement of the heart. Weight gain. Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Little was said about liver problems, except that a few research
patients had high liver enzyme levels, a warning sign of possible
liver failure. One of them had jaundice, a yellowing of the skin
that signals liver trouble, according to the meeting minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, assembled as an FDA advisory committee, didn't
learn that 2 percent of 2,500 study patients had liver enzymes
three times higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't learn that 24 patients had to stop taking Rezulin
because of liver problems _ five of them with liver enzymes 30
times too high, two with jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   They also didn't learn that Rezulin's first FDA medical
reviewer, who was concerned about liver problems, was pulled off
the case after recommending that Rezulin not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meeting came less than five months after
Parke-Davis submitted its Rezulin application to the FDA. Most drug
reviews take at least a year. But Rezulin was on a ``fast track''
process of no more than six months, meant to bring cutting-edge
drugs to patients quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fast track'' concept began in the mid-1990s following
pressure from Congress, which was responding to patients with AIDS
and other diseases. They argued that the FDA took too long to get
life-saving drugs to dying people.
</P>
<P>
   FDA's Dr. Alexander Fleming opened the December 1996 meeting by
explaining that Rezulin was slated for quick approval because it
offered a new approach to treating Type II diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, affecting some 15 million U.S. adults, can cause
heart problems, kidney damage, blindness and death. Rezulin worked
by allowing the body to make better use of the insulin it has,
instead of trying (as other drugs do) to get the pancreas to
produce more insulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should explain why we are here earlier than might
otherwise be the case,'' Fleming told the committee. ``Does this
mean that we lower the bar at the same time? Let's be clear about
this: absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of Parke-Davis officials told the committee that Rezulin
had kept blood sugar levels under control during trials, so much so
that many patients were able to reduce or even stop daily insulin
injections. The lower blood sugar levels would result in fewer
complications from diabetes, Parke-Davis promised.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randall Whitcomb, a Parke-Davis clinical research director,
was in charge of delivering bad news about Rezulin. Heart
enlargement and cancer were possible side effects. Fourteen
patients in one study had slightly elevated liver enzymes,
including one with jaundice. But the enzymes returned to normal
after the patients stopped taking the drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research patients who took a sugar pill instead of Rezulin had
the same rate of liver problems as those taking the drug, Whitcomb
said, moving on to other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, the FDA's staff member in charge of giving the
committee all salient information on Rezulin, didn't mention liver
enzymes in his presentation. He only briefly noted some liver
tumors in female lab mice.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming did say that the FDA generally likes to have more than
twice as much patient data as Parke-Davis had submitted before
approving a drug.
</P>
<P>
   After the committee voted unanimously to support Rezulin, FDA
staff followed suit, as it usually does, by approving the drug on
Jan. 29, 1997. It hit the market that March.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't the FDA doctors hear all the information about liver
problems at the December 1996 meeting?
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to The Ann Arbor News, Parke-Davis officials said
they notified FDA staff of all the data.
</P>
<P>
   One FDA staff member said the agency got the data but may not
have sorted it out completely before the meeting because it was
buried in stacks of documents. The company, he said, should have
highlighted the data.

&HT;     BUSH SET TO ROLL OUT ENERGY PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capitalizing public anxiety over rising fuel prices, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush plans Friday to unveil an energy policy that calls
for new government policies to encourage oil exploration and
refining.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to outline steps to speed up construction of
refineries that process oil. The rise in gas prices, the Bush
campaign says, is partly attributable to the nation's oil
refineries running at virtually full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   He will deliver the speech in Saginaw, Mich., one of several
Midwestern states crucial to Republican hopes of retaking the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also will call for greater incentives to increase oil
exploration and drilling. And he will argue that because he and his
running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, have worked in
the oil business, they have the expertise necessary to pressure
oil-producing nations to boost output.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate has used fuel prices to
hammer Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said President Clinton's recent decision _ at Gore's
urging _ to release up to 30 million barrels from the strategic
petroleum reserve was a political move calculated to divert
attention from what he has called a faulty energy policy. The
reserve was created to provide oil in the event of an energy
emergency or military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One energy policy historian questioned whether government
efforts to spur production would yield more oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good politics because the issue is worrying people,''
said Allen Matusow, a history professor at Rice University in
Houston. But ultimately ``the best policy is no policy. In time,
high prices will stimulate exploration if the government will stay
the heck out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher prices at the pump have coincided with higher poll
numbers for Bush. The Texas governor had trailed Gore since the
Democratic National Convention in mid-August, where Gore fine-tuned
a populist message, casting himself as the candidate of the people
and Bush as the candidate of the rich. But over the past two weeks
Bush has caught up with Gore and even taken a narrow lead in some
polls.
</P>
<P>
   At Voter.com Battleground 2000 poll released Thursday showed
Bush ahead of Gore 39 percent to 35 percent. The poll of 1,000
likely voters from Sept. 21 to Sept. 26 had a margin of error of
3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But a CNN/USA Today/Gallup tracking poll, released Thursday,
showed Bush and Gore both at 46 percent. The same poll on Wednesday
gave Bush a two-percentage-point advantage, 46-44 percent. That's
dead even in statistical terms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lindsey, Bush's senior economic adviser, told the
Washington Post that high oil prices represent the Bush campaign's
``best issue right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, the author of ``Earth in the Balance,'' intends to
pump the energy issue for what he thinks its worth Friday as the
walks the nature trails at the Audubon Naturalist Society in Chevy
Chase, Md., just outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, is
scheduled to speak on air pollution in Houston in an effort to link
Bush to polluters. Houston is now ranked as one of the nation's
most polluted cities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's energy plan is built around tax breaks and incentives
that would reduce foreign-oil dependency through fuel-efficient
cars, buses and trucks; energy-saving manufacturing and power
plants; and turning production of pollution-preventing devices into
a growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail last week, Gore called Bush and Cheney the
``big oil dream ticket.'' His advisers are gambling that by
highlighting an energy policy focused on increased oil exploration
and refining, Bush will give Gore more populist ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail Thursday, Gore and Bush traded shots over
who has the best plan to guide the economy into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president gets elected, the era of big government
being over is over,'' Bush said in Green Bay, Wis., another
Midwestern state crucial to his victory strategy on the electoral
map.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``is proposing the largest increase in federal spending in
35 years _ since the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to undercut Gore's economic plan at a time when the
economy continues to be robust, Bush ticked off new federal
programs, hiring and regulations proposed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this could amount to over $2 trillion in bigger government
in 10 years _ costing about $20,000 on average for every household
in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Gore
reiterated his call to pay down the national debt in 12 years,
saying it would eliminate interest payments that represent the
government's third largest program behind Social Security and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty days from now, prosperity itself will be on the
ballot,'' Gore said. He said Bush's $1.3 billion tax cut would
disproportionately benefit the wealthy, giving ``too much to too
few at the expense of too many.''

   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Officials at Pfizer Inc. denied repeated
requests to be interviewed for this series. But in response to
certified letters from The Ann Arbor News outlining the main
allegations raised in the stories, Pfizer issued a three-page
statement. Parke-Davis, as a division of Warner-Lambert, became
part of Pfizer when the latter two companies merged this year.
</P>
<P>
   The statement didn't directly respond to some of the
allegations, but it touched on several points.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Rezulin's review by FDA, Warner-Lambert disclosed the
risk of adverse liver events to the FDA, to the FDA Advisory
Committee, and to the medical community, based on the clinical
study research data before the drug was commercially marketed,''
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months after marketing of the drug began,
Warner-Lambert received reports of severe adverse liver events,
including acute liver failure leading to transplant and death,
which had not occurred during the clinical testing of the drug.
These post-marketing adverse event reports were timely disclosed to
the FDA, and the Rezulin label was revised to reflect the new
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the statement:
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitoring: The company relied on drug label changes calling
for more blood test monitoring to keep Rezulin on the market
because that allowed physicians to detect an important warning
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liver-function monitoring afforded this opportunity,
potentially enabling a physician to direct the patient to
discontinue Rezulin to stop the progression of, and reverse, an
incipient injury. ... Dozens of other FDA-approved drugs are also
labeled with recommendations that patients taking those therapies
have periodic liver-enzyme monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rezulin's withdrawal: Parke-Davis kept Rezulin on the market,
even after growing reports of deaths, because the FDA advisory
committee in March 1999 recommended that it stay on the market,
saying the benefits still outweighed the risks.
</P>
<P>
   But by March 21 of this year, two other similar drugs _ Avandia
and Actos _ had been approved, with fewer side effects. So Rezulin
was withdrawn. ``Just as Rezulin's introduction in January 1997
represented an advance over previously available therapies, it now
appeared that the newer drugs may have superseded Rezulin.''
</P>

APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL BRINGS MIXED REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Security at abortion clinics and federal offices across the
nation was heightened Thursday in the wake of the US Food and Drug
Administration's approval of the abortion pill RU-486, a decision
that ends a tumultuous decade-long political struggle over the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's green light marks a milestone in
reproductive health, giving women, for the first time, a
widely-available abortion option that takes the procedure out of
the operating room and into the quiet of the doctor's office. The
drug is expected to be available to women within a month.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486, quite simply, makes abortion a more private affair, with
the expulsion of the embryo most likely occurring in a woman's
home. This transformation of what is certainly an emotional
procedure, was seized upon by both sides, with pro-abortion
advocates hailing it as the most significant abortion rights
triumph since Roe v. Wade, while anti-abortion activists decried
the pill as an easily-wielded tool of infanticide.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also drew into stark contrast the abortion
positions of the two candidates running for president, as Vice
President Al Gore quickly expressed his support for the FDA's
decision, while Texas Governor George W. Bush denounced it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, FDA commissioner Dr. Jane E. Henney said, the
decision was removed from the political swirl and based on a
rigorous set of scientific and safety considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA's review and approval of this drug has adhered
strictly to our legal mandate and mission as a science-based public
health regulatory agency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the RU-486's 12-year journey has been an intensely political
one, with numerous stops and starts, as US drug companies
unanimously refused to manufacture the controversial pill. Instead,
an international abortion rights group, the Population Council,
teamed with a small New York drug company, Danco Laboratories LLC,
to make the proposal that won the FDA over.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 became available in France in 1988, and in much of
Western Europe, China and Israel since then, but did not stand a
chance on these shores until President Clinton lifted the
Reagan-Bush ban on importation of the drug from abroad. This paved
the way for clinical testing, which led to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486, also called mifepristone, can be used by women up to the
49th day of pregnancy, and involves three visits to a physician's
office over a two-week period. The drug can be prescribed by
obstetricians and gynecologists, as well as any physician with the
training to properly diagnose pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The studies presented to the FDA showed RU-486 is about 95
percent effective in causing abortions. A small percentage of women
suffered side effects of bleeding, cramping, nausea and diarrhea.
One percent of the women tested suffered from serious bleeding that
required hospitalization. The FDA will require any doctor that
prescribes the drug to have ready access to a hospital surgery
room.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the official announcement broke, phone calls, faxes
and e-mails flew from both sides of the abortion divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this for a long time. This is a
historic moment. It's comparable to the arrival of birth control
pills 40 years ago,'' said Dianne Luby, president and CEO of
Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the political spectrum was Ted Furton, an
member of the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Boston, which
helps local clergy sort through ethical dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hardening of the heart, further callousness toward the
unborn,'' he said. ``The fact that it can be done in the privacy of
one's home is a terrible thing. The home is the place of newborns,
the place of life, the place of family. This negates all those
values.''
</P>
<P>
   But while political activists debated the merits of the FDA's
decision, doctors across the country prepared for a significant
change in their practices. About 1 million women seek surgical
abortions annually but, with the availability of RU-486, women's
health experts expect this to drop, as women begin opting for the
less-intrusive option of the abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely will suggest it to my patients,'' said Dr.
Fredric Frigoletto, chief of obstetrics at Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``From the point of view of patient privacy, it is a
distinct improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who request RU-486 will first have to sign a form
indicating they understand its risks. Then they will be given three
200 mg tablets. The drug blocks the secretion of the hormone
progesterone, which prepares the lining of the uterus for a
fertilized egg. It is possible this alone will cause an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   If not, at a second visit three days later, women will be
prescribed another already-available drug, misoprostol. It causes
contractions, eventually expelling the embryo within several days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a third follow-up visit within nine days is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this requires a certain kind of patient, one who is able
to recognize pregnancy early, and one who can access the system,''
said Frigoletto.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that women without health insurance and non-English
speakers will be less likely to request, and successfully complete,
a RU-486 abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Frigoletto, and most pro-abortion activists interviewed, were
pleased with the FDA conditions placed on RU-486. During
negotiations between the FDA and Danco, the manufacturer, the
agency had considered only allowing abortion doctors in suburban or
urban areas to prescribe the pill, said people familiar with the
negotiations. Danco and others wanted RU-486 available outside of
abortion clinics, which are often the site of noisy, occasionally
violent, protests. Thursday, the FDA granted them this, allowing
not only abortion doctors, but hospital-based obstetricians and
gynecologists, as well as properly-training primary care doctors,
to prescribe RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   These doctors will purchase the drug directly from Danco. The
emergence of this somewhat secretive company was a key development
in RU-486's journey through the approval process. Though Clinton
opened the door for the drug's entry into the US, no pharmaceutical
company would touch the controversial pill. So the pill's champions
were unable to demonstrate to the FDA that they could reliably
produce the drug, a key component in getting the agency's seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The French company that developed RU-486, Roussel-Uclaf, sold
the rights to the drug to the Population Council in 1995. But they
struggled to find a manufacturer. Finally, they helped found Danco,
which is run by a former executive from drug giant Merck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical tests were initiated. Those, combined with numerous
studies from France, convinced the FDA, in 1996, to declare the
drug basically safe. But they wanted more detail on the
manufacturing and distribution process. This was dramatically
complicated by the political controversy surrounding RU-486, which
had come to be known as the ``morning after'' abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   These complications intruded into negotiations right down to the
wire, said people familiar with them.
</P>
<P>
   Danco will market RU-486 as Mifeprex, and has spent over a
million dollars preparing a marketing strategy and training
programs for doctor, said the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and our partners in the women's health community have
worked long and hard for this day,'' said Dr. Richard Hausknecht,
Danco's medical director. ``I am excited and very proud to be part
of this.''

&HT;     GORE AND BUSH RUN NECK AND NECK ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Education, as teachers say, may be the ticket to a
brighter future, and for Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, it could be the key to the White House door.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are knocking themselves out trying to one-up the
other on the issue, which, along with health care and Social
Security, tops the list of voters' concerns in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats traditionally have had an advantage on education, but
Bush's five-year record of overhauling schools in Texas has helped
make him competitive with Gore on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's proposals, which would dramatically boost
Washington's oversight of classroom academic quality as well inject
more federal aid into local school districts, represent a sharp
break with Republican orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Just four years ago Bob Dole, the GOP presidential candidate,
ran on a platform of abolishing the Department of Education and
leaving education totally in the hands of state and local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail last week, Bush said proudly that
disadvantaged minority students in Texas have closed the learning
gap with white students during his years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Amy Wilkens, principal partner at the nonpartisan
Education Trust here, says, ``It takes some political courage to be
a Republican candidate and say `I'm concerned about minority kids.'
This isn't a backdoor agenda for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore would spend much more on education, and he
fundamentally differs with Bush on how best to improve public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the vice president would expand elementary and
secondary spending by $115 billion over 10 years. Bush would boost
such spending $47.6 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration have produced an
``education recession'' during which the test-score gap between
white and minority youth has widened, Bush charges. Gore replies
that Bush's tax cuts would yield their own ``education recession,''
forcing Washington to cut education spending 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gore and Bush seek the same destination: high
academic standards and student achievement plus standardized tests
to measure progress. But they are polar opposites on the
controversial idea of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would create nationally the system of school requirements,
rewards and punishments that he champions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He would require states to measure student achievement through
standardized tests, with sanctions for states and school districts
that don't measure up. The most prominent sanctions are vouchers,
which would enable parents of children in failing schools to seek
alternatives, including private religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, backed by teachers' unions, opposes vouchers. He contends
they could ultimately destroy public schools and that such federal
aid to religious schools would be unconstitutional. In Gore's plan,
failing schools would be shut down and reopened under new
principals and new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush, states would have to test children in every grade
from three through eight. Under Gore, states would be required to
administer a national test _ the National Assessment of Education
Progress _ to children in 4th, 8th and 12th grades. Both would make
federal education aid contingent on showing test-score progress.
</P>
<P>
   In a Bush administration, states would have to develop
curriculum standards in science, history, reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   Now, states must have standards only for reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also wants to guarantee high educational
standards and student progress through testing, but he dismisses
Bush's proposal by saying that much of it is already in place,
thanks to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has given states and school districts $460
million a year to put standards and testing in place, according to
Michael Cohen, an assistant secretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in campaign speeches Bush emphasizes local control of
schools and pledges to consolidate 60 federal education programs
into five.
</P>
<P>
   Some education experts see a contradiction in the Bush approach.
Jack Jennings, director of the nonpartisan Center for Education
Policy here, says, ``What Bush is proposing is a logical next step
to improve American schools, but he's not calling it what it is,''
that is, a big federal program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's defenders say he is trying to balance Washington's role
with local control. Colorado's Republican governor, Bill Owens, a
longtime friend of Bush, told reporters recently, ``There have to
be some strings attached to the billions of dollars the federal
government spends. To have no strings attached would be fiscally
imprudent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens of the Education Trust said that under Bush, Washington
would not dictate to states on how to run schools. According to
her, ``Bush (in essence) is saying, `This is the goal. I'm holding
you accountable. Achieve it however you want to.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of education:
</P>
<P>
   _Gore would raise salaries, recruit a million new teachers over
10 years and test all of them to make sure they meet national
standards. Bush does not set a numerical goal for additional
teachers but would give states money to ensure teacher quality. He
would also boost funding to recruit former military personnel into
the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not advocate teacher testing or pay raises. But he
would allow teachers to deduct out-of-pocket classroom expenditures
from their taxes. Both candidates would expand a federal
loan-forgiveness program to attract college science and math majors
to public school teaching.
</P>
<P>
   _Guided in part by his wife Laura, a former teacher and
librarian, Bush proposes a ``reading first'' program to ensure that
disadvantaged children can read by third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says the government's Head Start program for pre-school
children does little to prepare children for school. He would shift
it from the Department of Health and Human Services to the
Department of Education to focus the program more on teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does not specifically address reading, but his education
plan would make preschool available to all four-year-old children
and raise the number of spaces allotted to three-year-olds. On Head
Start, Gore says it began putting more emphasis on school
preparation two years ago when Congress re-authorized the program.
</P>
<P>
   _Through federal grants and interest-free loans, Gore would
repair and rebuild schools. Bush dismisses that idea, charging that
Gore is focused on ``bricks and mortars'' while he, Bush, is
concentrating on the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Both candidates stress school discipline, safety and moral
values. Both would require states to issue safety and discipline
report cards so that parents could judge the schools their children
attend.

CLINTON EXTENDS LIBERIANS' STAY IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton Thursday authorized a one-year extension
that will allow Liberian refugees to stay in the US until next
October _ hours before they would've become illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-hour save brought a sigh of relief to Liberians, many
of whom had received letters notifying them that they would be
losing their jobs Friday. But many view it as a Band-Aid approach,
and the wounds will be reopened again next year at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful to the president for giving us another
extention but, you know, people cannot spend their whole lifetime
living on extensions,'' said Torli Krua, president of the Liberian
Community Association of Massachusetts. ``Life is short.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 Liberians have been living in the US since
civil war broke out in their West African country Christmas eve,
1989. An estimated 4,000 of them live in New England. Though the
war ended in 1997, the country, and the region, remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has determined that voluntarily returning
Liberian refugees at this time could lead to further instability in
their country or in the region,'' said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman
for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley added that Clinton would welcome legislation that would
allow Liberians to remain as US residents. The only way to solve
the problem permanently would be for Congress to pass a law
allowing Liberians to adjust from their Deferred Enforced Departure
status.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed has sponsored such a bill, which
he is hoping will pass before the end of the session.

   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Chuck Rand was sipping his morning coffee at
the only restaurant in his tiny Illinois hometown when the owner
said Rand's wife was on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck, I need you,'' is all Eleanor Rand managed to say.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed home to find his wife of 38 years sprawled on her
favorite reclining chair _ her eyes rolled back, vomit covering her
blouse.
</P>
<P>
   He took her to the hospital, where doctors said nearly half of
her liver looked like it had been through a shredder. It was April
1998, nine months after she started taking the drug Rezulin for her
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Rand watched as doctors drained fluid from his wife's abdomen,
bloated by her dysfunctional liver. He helped her eat, bathe and
roll over in bed, until she got so big he couldn't roll her
anymore. He stayed by her side as her other organs _ kidneys,
heart, lungs _ also started failing. She died in May 1999 at age
58.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a sledgehammer hitting me upside the head,'' said
Rand, also 58, who has sued Parke-Davis, which developed Rezulin in
Ann Arbor. ``I wish they would have to see what it was like to go
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Rand was one of at least 63 people nationwide whose
deaths have been linked to Rezulin, with some doctors saying the
figure could be 10 times higher. Many more patients had to undergo
liver transplants or be placed on waiting lists, possibly meaning
that thousands were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In March, three years after the drug went on the market and two
years after the first death was reported, Parke-Davis withdrew
Rezulin at the federal Food and Drug Administration's request.
About 1.9 million people had taken it, bringing in nearly $2
billion in sales. Typically it costs about $500 million to bring a
drug to market.
</P>
<P>
   Parke-Davis is a division of Warner-Lambert Co., which this year
merged with Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Ann Arbor News reviewed thousands of documents obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act and interviewed key figures
involved in Rezulin's approval. The newspaper's three-month
investigation found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rezulin was granted fast approval despite warnings about liver
dangers from some FDA staff members.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first FDA medical officer assigned to Rezulin was removed
from the case at Parke-Davis' request after he recommended that the
drug not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   _ An FDA doctors committee that recommended approval of Rezulin
was not told about all the data showing potential liver problems.
The company's presentation to the committee omitted key parts of
the data, but the company said it gave all the information to the
FDA staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parke-Davis and the FDA were reluctant to pull Rezulin from
the market even in the face of mounting evidence that it
contributed to deaths and liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least two members of the FDA doctors committee and a key
National Institutes of Health doctor were paid consultants of
Parke-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johns Hopkins University Hospital, one of the nation's
foremost medical centers, never placed Rezulin on its list of
approved drugs due to concerns about liver problems _ even though
the FDA had approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors say the story of Rezulin, one of at least eight
drugs pulled off the market in the past three years, illustrates
broader issues of drug safety.
</P>
<P>
   While all drugs come with side effects, the FDA has no formula
for deciding if a drug is too risky to approve or whether it should
be pulled off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many mistakes in such a short period of time raises the
question of whether the FDA has allowed the pharmaceutical industry
to gain too much influence,'' said Thomas Moore, a George
Washington University health policy analyst and long-time FDA
observer.
</P>
<P>
   It is buyer beware, said Dr. Jose Francisco Cara, a children's
diabetes specialist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who sat on an
FDA panel that approved Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you use any drug, you really should be thinking about
the benefits and risks of the medication,'' Cara said. ``If you
don't, you're following the Pied Piper and ultimately getting
yourself into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials denied repeated interview requests, but have
said in the past that Rezulin helped hundreds of thousands of
people. Like all diabetes drugs, Rezulin presented risks as well as
benefits, the company said, adding that it gave appropriate
warnings of Rezulin's risks.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   As FDA-appointed doctors gathered around a Bethesda, Md.,
conference table in December 1996 to decide whether to approve
Rezulin, they talked about possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Enlargement of the heart. Weight gain. Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Little was said about liver problems, except that a few research
patients had high liver enzyme levels, a warning sign of possible
liver failure. One of them had jaundice, a yellowing of the skin
that signals liver trouble, according to the meeting minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, assembled as an FDA advisory committee, didn't
learn that 2 percent of 2,500 study patients had liver enzymes
three times higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't learn that 24 patients had to stop taking Rezulin
because of liver problems _ five of them with liver enzymes 30
times too high, two with jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   They also didn't learn that Rezulin's first FDA medical
reviewer, who was concerned about liver problems, was pulled off
the case after recommending that Rezulin not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meeting came less than five months after
Parke-Davis submitted its Rezulin application to the FDA. Most drug
reviews take at least a year. But Rezulin was on a ``fast track''
process of no more than six months, meant to bring cutting-edge
drugs to patients quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fast track'' concept began in the mid-1990s following
pressure from Congress, which was responding to patients with AIDS
and other diseases. They argued that the FDA took too long to get
life-saving drugs to dying people.
</P>
<P>
   FDA's Dr. Alexander Fleming opened the December 1996 meeting by
explaining that Rezulin was slated for quick approval because it
offered a new approach to treating Type II diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, affecting some 15 million U.S. adults, can cause
heart problems, kidney damage, blindness and death. Rezulin worked
by allowing the body to make better use of the insulin it has,
instead of trying (as other drugs do) to get the pancreas to
produce more insulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should explain why we are here earlier than might
otherwise be the case,'' Fleming told the committee. ``Does this
mean that we lower the bar at the same time? Let's be clear about
this: absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of Parke-Davis officials told the committee that Rezulin
had kept blood sugar levels under control during trials, so much so
that many patients were able to reduce or even stop daily insulin
injections. The lower blood sugar levels would result in fewer
complications from diabetes, Parke-Davis promised.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randall Whitcomb, a Parke-Davis clinical research director,
was in charge of delivering bad news about Rezulin. Heart
enlargement and cancer were possible side effects. Fourteen
patients in one study had slightly elevated liver enzymes,
including one with jaundice. But the enzymes returned to normal
after the patients stopped taking the drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research patients who took a sugar pill instead of Rezulin had
the same rate of liver problems as those taking the drug, Whitcomb
said, moving on to other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, the FDA's staff member in charge of giving the
committee all salient information on Rezulin, didn't mention liver
enzymes in his presentation. He only briefly noted some liver
tumors in female lab mice.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming did say that the FDA generally likes to have more than
twice as much patient data as Parke-Davis had submitted before
approving a drug.
</P>
<P>
   After the committee voted unanimously to support Rezulin, FDA
staff followed suit, as it usually does, by approving the drug on
Jan. 29, 1997. It hit the market that March.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't the FDA doctors hear all the information about liver
problems at the December 1996 meeting?
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to The Ann Arbor News, Parke-Davis officials said
they notified FDA staff of all the data.
</P>
<P>
   One FDA staff member said the agency got the data but may not
have sorted it out completely before the meeting because it was
buried in stacks of documents. The company, he said, should have
highlighted the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge there is no basis for an assertion that
Parke-Davis withheld information,'' said the staff member, who was
closely involved in the case but who would speak only on condition
his name not be used. ``On the other hand, putting a few pieces of
paper (about the liver problems) in an application that has several
hundred volumes is only doing what is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, the Ralph Nader consumer advocate group, filed a
petition with the FDA in July 1998 asking that Rezulin be taken off
the market. Last March, just before the drug was withdrawn, the
group requested criminal prosecution of Parke-Davis for covering up
liver data. According to Public Citizen, that spawned an FDA
investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bradbard of the FDA said she couldn't confirm or deny such
an investigation. There has been no criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   At least one FDA official seemed to be aware of enough data to
warrant rejection of Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Gueriguian was the first FDA medical officer assigned
to Rezulin. In 1996, he recommended against approving it, he said
in a recent interview. ``There was a very high probability for
severe liver toxicity,'' Gueriguian said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed skepticism to Parke-Davis officials during a
September 1996 meeting. Shortly thereafter, Parke-Davis complained
to the FDA that Gueriguian had acted inappropriately during the
meeting by using offensive language.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA removed him from the case and any other dealings with
Parke-Davis. He retired in 1998 and now works as a drug industry
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept everything they say about my behavior,'' Gueriguian
said. ``But that has nothing to do with the fact that this drug is
toxic to the liver ... . There must be hundreds, more probably
thousands, who have died _ and tens of thousands severely
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gueriguian would not discuss specifics of the liver data that
convinced him the drug wasn't safe. But when asked why he drew
attention to the data while other FDA staff apparently downplayed
it or didn't see it, he responded: ``I'm competent and honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Rezulin-related death was made public in October 1997.
By the early months of 1999, the death toll had reached 33, despite
three label changes suggesting more blood tests and meant to
prevent more liver injury. Members of Congress started asking tough
questions. Doctors started wondering if they should pull patients
off the drug.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, 1999, the FDA took the unusual step of convening
the advisory committee a second time to discuss Rezulin. The
doctors met again in Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission: to decide whether to expand Rezulin's use,
require more warnings or take the drug off the market.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Rezulin opponents spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   Moore told the committee that Rezulin's benefits paled before
its risks, especially since there were several other diabetes drugs
on the market. ``We are gambling with people's lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Pearson, a Johns Hopkins University pharmacist, said
doctors at his hospital had never accepted Rezulin into their
approved list of drugs. ``We were all acutely aware of the liver
toxicity that was associated with the product,'' Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   The most incriminating remarks came from someone within the FDA
itself, when epidemiologist David Graham recommended that Rezulin
be pulled from the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy presentation, he said that only 15 percent of
Rezulin patients had been properly monitored by their doctors with
blood tests, despite the repeated warnings. He said the reported
deaths and liver problems likely amounted to only about 10 percent
of what was actually occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said one in 1,800 patients on Rezulin likely were
experiencing liver failure. Since about 1.9 million people
eventually took the drug, that translates to a prediction of about
1,000 liver failures.
</P>
<P>
   Parke-Davis officials responded with plenty of
counter-arguments. They said reports of jaundice had dropped
following the label changes. Factors other than Rezulin contributed
to some patients' liver damage; one man who developed jaundice had
consumed 12 beers daily for 20 years. Using a different formula
than Graham's, they said the rate of liver failure was only one in
45,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Parke-Davis representatives also presented a doctor survey
saying 82 percent of patients were properly monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors voted 11-1 to keep Rezulin on the market, and the
FDA made a fourth label change, again requiring more frequent blood
tests.
</P>
<P>
   It would be another year before the FDA would request that
Parke-Davis withdraw the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, less than two months after that vote, Eleanor Rand
died, ending her quiet life in the pastoral farmland of Latham,
Ill., a whistlestop of 400 people between Decatur and Springfield,
the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Rand developed diabetes in the mid-1970s. Her daily
insulin shots didn't control her blood sugar very well, and she
sometimes nearly slipped into diabetic comas.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, her doctor spoke highly of a new pill, Rezulin.
She started on it right away.
</P>
<P>
   The drug worked wonders for her blood sugar. But after several
months, she grew tired and couldn't walk from her recliner to the
kitchen without stopping to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Rand was concerned, so he took her in for a blood test to
check liver enzymes. Her levels were normal.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, she placed the terrified call to him at
the restaurant and had the vomiting episode that sent her to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She was in such bad shape, doctors said she wouldn't survive a
liver transplant. About all they could do was drain fluid through
her groin to counteract the bloating. At first, the draining
procedures were scheduled every four months. But the fluid kept
building up. The procedures had to be repeated more frequently.
Finally, they were being done every week, with the last one coming
the day after Mother's Day and containing both clear fluid and
blood.
</P>
<P>
   She died a day later.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Rand still hears his wife's voice calling for help in the
middle of the night. Well over a year after her death, he still
begins many sentences with ``We.''
</P>
<P>
   At least once a month _ sometimes weekly _ he drives an hour to
Mattoon, to the cemetery where Eleanor Rand is buried. Five
generations of his family are there.
</P>
<P>
   When nobody is looking, he sits on her gravestone and weeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very emotional person,'' he said. ``If I have to go into
court and testify, I don't know if I'll be able to handle it. But
Parke-Davis has to know what they did to us.''

&HT;     TV CAMERAS MISS A BIG HUG

<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Television cameras don't lie, but they
often fail to tell the whole story. Take the image of wide receiver
Jerry Rice bellowing at San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
during Sunday's 41-24 49ers win in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   What cameras didn't capture was Rice going up to Mariucci
shortly after his outburst and giving Mariucci a hug. Rice, who
appears embarrassed by the incident, refused to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm focused on Arizona,'' Rice said of the 49ers'
opponent this weekend at Candlestick Park. ``I'm past all that.
It's ancient history.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mariucci thought television treatment of Rice was unfair.
``I guess I would prefer that it wouldn't end up on television like
it did, because they don't show the whole story,'' Mariucci said.
He also said Rice apologized right after his outburst and then
hugged his head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Television) doesn't tell the accurate story either, you can
really get your imagination going,'' Mariucci said. ``It was a
little bit different than it was perceived, I think. I wish the
hugs and kisses would have been on television, too, because he
bounced back real fast.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Rice has exploded at Mariucci and then
apologized both in the media and to Mariucci. He did so in 1998,
during a Monday night 45-10 thrashing of the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he feels like he wants to be more productive towards the
win,'' Mariucci said. ``It was like a quick hurricane and then it
was over. I think he does it to get himself going.''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst began with Rice upset after dropping a wobbly pass
from Jeff Garcia. Rice, a noted perfectionist, was first angry with
Garcia and then turned on Mariucci when the coach asked what was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Rice apologized repeatedly.

opposition thinks it has a president in Vojislav Kostunica, but it
also has a problem: how to get the incumbent, President Slobodan
Milosevic, out of power. The problem is more than technical:
Milosevic shows no signs of wanting to go. So Kostunica and the 18
party leaders who support him decided Thursday night to call a
rally for Friday in Belgrade's Square of the Republic, where they
will ask the people of Yugoslavia to perform ``any act of civil
disobedience they have at their disposal'' until Milosevic leaves

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ When Parke-Davis and federal Food and Drug
Administration officials were faced with a growing number of deaths
linked to the diabetes drug Rezulin, they turned to the same
solution four times.
</P>
<P>
   Tweak the fine print on the drug's label by suggesting more
blood tests, they said, and liver injuries would be prevented. They
also sent letters to doctors recommending the tests.
</P>
<P>
   But physicians don't pay much attention to such warnings,
leaving patients largely responsible for themselves, some experts
say. At least 63 deaths were linked to Rezulin during its three
years on the market. The drug was developed by Parke-Davis of Ann
Arbor, which then was a division of Warner-Lambert and is now part
of Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will guarantee you that the number of patients who read the
labels is probably 0.01 percent,'' said Dr. Jose Francisco Cara, a
physician at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who was on the FDA
advisory committee that reviewed Rezulin. ``For doctors, it might
be 0.02 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors read the side effects on a drug's initial label, but
they're too busy to closely scrutinize follow-up warnings, said Dr.
Doug Greene, the former head of diabetes research at the University
of Michigan who sat on the FDA advisory committee before Rezulin
was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ```Dear Doctor' letters don't work,'' Greene said. ``It's always
more difficult to change physician behavior after a drug is
launched.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Parke-Davis should have been more aggressive in
warning doctors and patients about liver problems, Greene said. The
company should have developed public service announcements or
bought ads to announce the warnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Moore, a George Washington University health policy
analyst who closely observes the FDA, called the label changes the
most shocking aspect of the Rezulin case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was virtually a charade,'' Moore said. ``An essential
safety precaution was a total illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Pfizer and the former Parke-Davis denied repeated
interview requests for this story. But Pfizer issued a statement
saying Parke-Davis appropriately warned of Rezulin's risks.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests were important because they were the only way for
doctors to detect high liver enzyme levels, a warning sign of
possible liver failure. Other clues include symptoms such as
nausea, stomach pain and jaundice, but they often appear too late
for the liver to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   When Rezulin was approved in January 1997, no blood tests were
required. In the nine months following the first patient death
report in October 1997, Parke-Davis and the FDA made three label
changes, each requiring more frequent blood tests. The labels were
lengthy, in fine print and full of complicated medical jargon.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile death in May 1998 of a high school teacher from
East St. Louis, Ill., escalated the debate about labels and blood
tests. Audrey LaRue Jones, 55, didn't have diabetes. But she
enrolled in a diabetes prevention trial led by the National
Institutes of Health, taking Rezulin to help gather data that might
help diabetics like her son.
</P>
<P>
   Jones received frequent blood tests, as the FDA had ordered. But
her liver failed anyway, suggesting that monitoring couldn't
prevent all casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of Jones' death, the FDA in March 1999 took the
unusual step of convening its physician advisory committee a second
time to discuss Rezulin. The group had met in December 1996 to
approve the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Parke-Davis officials told the committee that 97 percent of
patients were getting liver enzyme blood tests before starting
Rezulin and 82 percent were receiving monthly blood tests while on
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be expected to further ... decrease the incidence
of liver-related death and transplant,'' Dr. Mark Pierce of
Parke-Davis told the committee, according to minutes of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But David Graham, a top FDA epidemiologist, said only 15 percent
of patients were receiving the appropriate blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Graham said, the blood tests sometimes weren't
catching high liver enzymes early enough. He told of one patient
who tested normal just before traveling to Italy on vacation. After
becoming nauseous on the trip, the patient returned to the United
States. Five days later, his liver shut down. He had a liver
transplant but died _ less than 15 days after his normal readings.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient's blood test showed high liver enzymes, so her
doctor took her off Rezulin. But her enzymes continued to soar, and
she too had to get a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Saul Genuth, an FDA committee member, seemed to agree that
blood tests weren't working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think logistically there's no monitoring scheme that can be
dictated from above that will be carried out perfectly enough to
prevent liver deaths earlier,'' he said during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Parke-Davis and the FDA responded by issuing a fourth label
change that increased blood tests once again.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Zimmerman, a diabetes specialist at the Mayo Clinic
and a past president of the American Diabetes Association, said in
an interview that the government should have taken more action
after that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should have been some thought at the FDA of requiring
monitoring, not just suggesting it,'' Zimmerman said. Pharmacists
could have been forced to ask patients for evidence of monthly
blood tests before refilling prescriptions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Bell, a diabetes doctor at the University of Alabama
at Birmingham, said the FDA should have withdrawn Rezulin at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there were several cases where monitoring didn't stop
it,'' Bell said. ``They had enough information then.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question surrounding Rezulin is whether it really was a
breakthrough drug. Its purported novelty is why Parke-Davis asked
for, and the FDA granted, a ``fast-track'' approval of six months,
less than half the usual time period.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was the first of a new group of diabetes drugs. Two
other drugs in the same class were approved in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   All diabetes medications aim to control blood sugar levels by
balancing the body's production of glucose (or sugar) and insulin,
which breaks down glucose. Because diabetics don't produce enough
insulin, their blood sugar often soars, which can damage vital
organs.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs on the market prior to Rezulin's approval either
stimulate insulin production by the pancreas, decrease glucose
production by the liver or delay absorption of glucose into the
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin acted differently by encouraging fat and muscle cells to
better absorb glucose, therefore making the body use insulin more
efficiently. But the result was the same as the other drugs: It
reduced blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeff Sanfield, a diabetes specialist at St. Joseph Mercy
Hospital in Ann Arbor who helped run a clinical trial of Rezulin,
said the drug didn't live up to its expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a major breakthrough,'' Sanfield said. ``The end
result was disappointing. The clinical effectiveness was modest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, of Alabama, said Rezulin was no more effective than other
drugs. ``It wasn't as novel as Parke-Davis marketing would have
liked us to believe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But several other diabetes doctors, along with the American
Diabetes Association, told the FDA advisory committee in 1999 that
Rezulin allowed many diabetics to control blood sugar better than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Edelman said he successfully treated 500 diabetics
with Rezulin at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't buy this drug back from these individuals because it
has helped them to achieve and maintain control over their diabetes
where previously it was not possible despite intensive efforts,''
Edelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the doctors who gave positive testimonials to the FDA
advisory committee were paid consultants for Parke-Davis, raising
conflict-of-interest questions that also apply to some FDA
committee members and National Institutes of Health officials.
</P>
<P>
   No rules ban doctors who speak before the FDA committee from
accepting money from drug companies. But it's clear that at least
one FDA committee member, who is not known to have received money,
was influenced more by the testimonials than by FDA staff who
wanted Rezulin pulled off the market.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 meeting, at which the committee voted to keep
Rezulin on pharmacy shelves, Dr. Robert Kreisberg, a committee
member from Birmingham, Ala., said: ``I'm going to rely very
heavily on valued colleagues who practice and take care of patients
with diabetes on a day-in and day-out basis. I think this
information is as valuable or more valuable than the theoretic
issues that have been brought up here (by FDA staff).''
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Rezulin decision makers also had financial ties
to Parke-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the FDA advisory committee met in 1999, the FDA
appointed two physicians to the panel who had served on the
education council of the National Diabetes Education Initiative,
which is partly funded by Parke-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   One of those doctors didn't attend the meeting. The other, who
voted to keep the drug on the market, was one of four people on the
12-member panel who received an FDA waiver allowing them to vote.
That means each had potential conflicts of interest that FDA
administrators deemed not serious enough to prohibit participation.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA will not say what the conflicts were, said spokeswoman
Laura Bradbard, citing privacy laws. One of the four doctors who
received a waiver was Henry Bone, a Detroit physician who chaired
the committee and also voted for Rezulin. He declined an interview
request.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the man who reigned over the NIH diabetes
prevention trial in which the East St. Louis teacher died also was
a paid consultant for Parke-Davis. Dr. Richard Eastman accepted
money for two years from the company and its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   He and Dr. Jerrold Olefsy, who also helped oversee the NIH
trial, were investigated for potential conflicts of interest by the
inspector general's office of the federal Department of Health and
Human Services. But the investigators found no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   While some criticize the potential conflicts, others say it is
common for government pharmaceutical advisers to have ties to the
drug industry. Such people often hone and apply expertise by
working with drug companies on studies and seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you began to exclude everybody in a certain field who had
at any time been a consultant or a speaker for a pharmaceutical
company, you would lose the ability to find qualified members,''
said Greene, the former Michigan diabetes research director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experts are sought after by the agency and the companies.
It's a fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rezulin story illustrates the many struggles faced by the
FDA when weighing the risks and benefits of any drug, said Cara,
the Henry Ford doctor who was on the FDA advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make `guesstimates' of the pros and cons of the
medication long-term, when all we have is short-term data to base a
decision on. That's the balance the FDA is always trying to come to
grips with.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jules Hirsch, a retired professor at Rockefeller University
in New York who also sat on the FDA panel, said the short-term data
often don't reflect the eventual real-world experience of a drug.
Research patients are screened so they don't use other medications
that might cause cross reactions, for example, while everyday
patients may be popping over-the-counter pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few thousand people in well-controlled trials are not
necessarily a cross-section of the American public,'' Hirsch said.
So some side effects aren't discovered until after a drug is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't the FDA require longer clinical trials, with more
patient data?
</P>
<P>
   It would be cost-prohibitive, Cara said. A recent 10-year NIH
diabetes trial cost $177 million, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a drug company be responsible for a study like that?
We wouldn't have any drugs being submitted for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Cara said, he wouldn't have recommended fast-track
approval for Rezulin. ``When you do fast-track, there are always
going to be situations when you can make mistakes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't think the fast-track concept should be dropped,
because it's important to get real breakthrough drugs to high-risk
patients quickly, he said.

FEDERAL RESEARCH SAFETY CHIEF SETTING HIGH GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE DEMBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's top cop for research safety and ethics laid out his
goals Thursday for the first time, promising he will not back off
from enforcing rules to protect human reseach subjects but will
focus more on prevention than punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Koski, the former Partners Healthcare administrator in
Boston who is now director of the Office for Human Research
Protections, said he plans to professionalize the way research is
conducted and policed at a time when science seems increasingly
profit-driven and plagued by ethical lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The problems became national news last year when a young man was
killed in a Pennsylvania gene therapy experiment conducted by
researchers who stood to profit if the test was a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go beyond a culture of compliance to a culture of
conscience and responsible conduct,'' he said. ``And we need to
create a climate where the public is sufficiently educated to be a
full partner in the practice of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Koski, 50, of Holliston, is bringing to the nation a philosophy
of collaboration and education he practiced for the last five years
as director of human research affairs at Massachusetts General
Hospital and then Partners.
</P>
<P>
   He started his federal job this month overseeing experiments
involving hundreds of thousands of people at more than 5,000
universities and hospitals that get federal research funding.
</P>
<P>
   The political climate will test the patience and diplomacy he is
known for in Boston. Congress is pressing for stronger protections
of people who are used as research subjects amid questions about
why Koski's predecesser was pushed aside after getting tough; he
halted research at eight institutions in the last two years where
patients were put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human
Services, renamed the research protection office, moved it under
her control and hired Koski. Although Koski is respected locally
for his balanced handling of human research issues, he is not
well-known nationally and some fear a pullback on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Koski said, ``There will be no backing off on
compliance and enforcement activities.'' He said the investigative
staff had tripled from two to six and that institutions that harm
research subjects would be barred from doing research.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I don't believe we will benefit in the long run
from simply stopping research.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said his office is working with other federal
agencies to streamline rules, set minimum education standards for
researchers and create voluntary accreditation for institutional
review boards, which apply research rules at the local level. Those
boards have been roundly criticized for paying more attention to
procedure than content.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers can expect both more federal spot checks and more
federal assistance, and the public will have greater access to help
through a hotline and more educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Koski said, he believes the local review boards
should be replaced by specialized or regional boards free of
institutional biases.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates have questioned Koski's own biases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can someone from the academic community truly be independent
in his evaluation of ethical violations'' by other academics, asked
Vera Hasner Sharav, president of Citizens for Responsible Care and
Research, which advocates for research safety.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Koski dismissed that concern. ``I feel absolutely no
obligation to the academic community to do anything other than make
the system work for all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koski said he will recuse himself from any case involving
Partners and direct those cases to a superior. The office is
currently investigating one case involving Brigham &AMP; Women's
Hospital and two involving MGH, both part of Partners. Thursday,
Koski refused to discuss those cases or others that occurred on his
watch in which patients were harmed by rogue investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a cardiac anesthesiologist at Harvard Medical School,
Koski taught at Boston University and Harvard and practiced
medicine primarily at MGH. He also conducted human research himself
in anesthesiology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he was tapped to become a member of MGH's Institutional
Review Board, and, he says, found his ``calling.'' At Partners, he
is credited with streamlining the review process, which has made
securing approval of new experiments quicker for researchers and
drug companies. Community representatives on the review board say
that was done without jeopardizing patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very fair,'' said Rev. Colin B. Gracey, Episcopal
chaplain at Northeastern University and a community review board
representative. ``He's not one to sacrifice the claims of the human
subjects to the needs of science. He constantly tries to come to
some balance.''
</P>
<P>
   David Blumenthal, director of the MGH Institute for Health
Policy and a strong critic of researchers' conflict of interest,
said, ``I trust Greg Koski's judgment on issues of values and
ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Koski's former department chairman at MGH, Dr. Warren Zapol,
said, ``I'm delighted to see him go forward to clean up a national
mess. If anybody has the political skills to help us do it, Greg
Koski does.''

 &HT;    WebMD to cut 1,100 `redundancy' jobs
 &HT;    By Andy Miller and Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of Atlanta-based WebMD soared 24 percent
Thursday after the company announced it will cut 1,100 jobs and
take a pretax charge of up to $45 million to streamline operations
after a flurry of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts, representing about 20 percent of WebMD's work
force, will be completed by the end of 2001. WebMD, which is trying
to link doctors, patients and health insurers online, expects
annualized savings of about $250 million from its integration plan
by the fourth quarter of 2001. The company will also consolidate
offices and reduce marketing and promotional expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The job redundancies have resulted from WebMD's rapid
acquisition pace _ nine deals in 10 months. With mergers this month
involving Medical Manager, CareInsite and OnHealth, WebMD jumped to
6,000 employees from about 3,000, said co-Chief Executive Jeff
Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got tremendous redundancy as a result of our recent
acquisitions,'' said Arnold. ``We've got multiple sales forces,
multiple legal, finance and HR departments. The cuts are going to
be pretty much across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said the company is ``realizing the synergies of moving
the companies together so we can get profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD lost $518 million, or $2.64 a share, during the three
months that ended June 30. Arnold said the company is on track to
become profitable in 2001, however, and that annual revenue will
approach $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD's corporate headquarters is in Atlanta, and the company
has 600 employees here. Arnold would not say how many of those jobs
will be eliminated. The company still plans to consolidate its five
Atlanta locations.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold shares the CEO title with Martin Wygod, who was chairman
of Medical Manager and CareInsite.
</P>
<P>
   The pretax charge of $35 million to $45 million will be taken in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's announcement of 100 job cuts is part of the 1,100
reduction. Laid-off workers will get severance packages and job
placement counseling, the company said. WebMD will also divest its
plastics and filtration technologies subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Shares rose $2.75 Thursday to $14 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Sean Wieland of Prudential Securities linked the stock
jump to ``management fulfilling its commitment to the Street, to
cut costs and reduce redundancies.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD's medical management system, which handles day-to-day
transactions in physicians' offices, may soon provide a financial
breakthrough for the company, Wieland said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst James Kumpel of Raymond James said Wygod's presence at
WebMD ``has provided a sense of relief to investors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern previously was that it was a very unfocused
company, making announcements in any number of fields,'' Kumpel
said. ``Marty is introducing a regimen and a discipline and focus
that wasn't there before.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kumpel added: ``This doesn't necessarily mean that there's
smooth sailing ahead. The company is recognizing the realities of
the marketplace'' _ that hospitals and doctors don't react that
quickly to change.

<P>
   A third of American women who had lumpectomies or other
breast-conserving operations for early-stage breast cancer from
1990 to 1995 did not get other needed treatments, a new study says.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the women did not get radiation or
lymph-node biopsies, both called for by standard treatment
guidelines. Such incomplete treatment can double a patient's risk
that the cancer will come back, and it is of particular concern
because more and more women are having lumpectomy instead of
mastectomy, said Dr. Ann Butler Nattinger, a professor of medicine
at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and lead author of
the study, which is being published Friday in The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   Nattinger's study, based on the records of nearly 145,000 women
treated from 1983 to 1995, did not explain why the recommended
procedures were sometimes skipped. Nattinger said she could only
guess the reasons, and suggested that some doctors might not know
the treatment guidelines, or might disagree with them or disregard
them in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that there is a real possibility of
undertreating at least some of these women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The current recommendations for treating early-stage breast
cancer, issued by the National Institutes of Health in 1990, call
for either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery like lumpectomy.
But neither procedure is sufficient by itself. Both operations are
supposed to include lymph node biopsies, to see if the cancer has
spread and the patient needs chemotherapy. Women who have
mastectomy usually do not need radiation, but lumpectomy, even for
tiny tumors, is supposed to be followed by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast conserving surgery is a more complicated treatment,''
Nattinger said. ``But if you're going to do a more complicated
therapy, you've got to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the best way for patients to protect themselves was to
learn as much as possible about breast cancer, seek second opinions
and get their treatment from a team of doctors that included
specialists in radiation and chemotherapy as well as surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Nattinger and her colleagues based their conclusions on medical
records of 144,759 women 30 and older from around the United States
who were treated for early breast cancer from 1983 to 1995. The
data were taken from a registry of cancer patients created by the
National Cancer Institute, and showed the patients' diagnoses and
treatments given.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1983, only about 15 percent of patients had breast-conserving
surgery, while the rest had mastectomy. By 1995, 50 percent had
breast-conserving procedures. The proportion who also had radiation
and lymph-node biopsy increased over time, but by 1995, 35 percent
still lacked one or both of the additional procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at the National Cancer Institute, which provided
the raw data for the study, questioned the findings and said that
their own analysis of the numbers, not yet published, indicated
that far fewer women were missing out on needed treatments and that
the percentage of women receiving them was actually increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel Ballard-Barbash, associate director of applied
research in the division of cancer control and population science
at the cancer institute, said, ``There have been substantial
improvements in appropriate therapy, but there is still room for
further improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard-Barbash said she thought 35 percent might be too high
because women in the study were counted as having received
radiation only if they got it within three months of their surgery.
But some may have received it later, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nattinger and other researchers said that it was not realistic
to expect 100 percent adherence to any set of medical guidelines,
and that in some cases there might be legitimate reasons to chart a
different course. In particular, they said, for very elderly
patients, especially those with other illnesses, the odds of living
long enough to worry about a recurrence of breast cancer might not
be high enough to justify the pain and inconvenience of radiation
and lymph node biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Borgen, a breast cancer surgeon at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in
the research, called Nattinger's study a wake-up call. ``It's such
an important national snapshot,'' he said. ``This type of exercise,
taking a look at what we are actually doing as a nation, treating a
disease that's a huge health problem, is valuable and important. We
need to try to do it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Borgen said the study confirmed his personal observation that
many patients got incomplete treatment. He said he saw women
``every week, all the time,'' who had received incorrect therapy at
other hospitals. ``It's very common,'' he said, adding that many
sought second opinions after talking to other patients or joining
support groups and discovering they were the only one in the room
who had not been given radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is when they come in because they have a
recurrence, and you find out they had no radiation, no lymph node
dissection and therefore they didn't get chemotherapy,'' he said.

 &HT;    LOW-KEYED JIM LEHRER TO MODERATE HIGH-POWERED PRESIDENTIAL
DEBATES
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, Oct. 1
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 1960s, Walter Cronkite was known as ``the
most trusted man in America'' _ a reputation rooted largely in the
evenhandedness he brought to the anchor desk at CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Jim Lehrer to moderate all three presidential
debates this year suggests that the low-keyed PBS news anchor may
have taken on that same role _ if not in all of America, then at
least in the political realm of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer, after all, has only a fraction of the TV audience
Cronkite once commanded when the Big Three networks were the Only
Three networks and held the attention of nearly all viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' reaches about 3.1 million
viewers each evening. Oprah Winfrey, by comparison, has an audience
of 22 million each afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And outside of politics and journalism, Lehrer is hardly known:
he hasn't shown up yet on a poll of most admired or most trusted
Americans as has, again, Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be the secret of Lehrer's success. And certainly it
is the reason behind his selection by the Commission on
Presidential Debates to moderate the three face-to-face meetings of
presidential rivals Al Gore and George Bush this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted someone who is not going to be competing with the
candidates from the point of star quality or trying to show how
smart they are vis a vis the candidates,'' Frank Farenkopf Jr., the
commission's co-chairman and a former chair of the Republican
National Committee, said in an interview. ``We wanted someone who
has the ability and the manner to go after the issues, but not in
such a way that they are trying to show up the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   And that someone, in the judgment of the debate commission, is
Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch 'NewsHour' and there's no spin, no in-your-face and
some of the snideness you might get on other outlets,'' Paul Kirk,
the former Democratic National Committee chief who shares the
debate commission chairmanship with Farenkopf, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, what New York University communications
professor Todd Gitlin calls ``the anti-Russert,'' a reference to
NBC ``Meet The Press'' host Tim Russert, a lawyer by training and
former political adviser who often turns the spotlight on himself
with his aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's debate, Lehrer has unprecedented authority to
direct the flow of the debate between Gore and Bush. He has sole
responsibility for the questions in the first two debates _ the
third debate will feature questions from voters as well Lehrer _
and he is free to follow up on any remarks by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty awesome responsibility for one person,'' said
Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lehrer is the new Walter Cronkite is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others have to make that judgment,'' said Lester M. Crystal,
Lehrer's longtime executive producer at ``NewsHour.'' ``But
clearly, Jim Lehrer is highly trusted as a journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Lehrer is good, though hardly the god he is now heralded
as being,'' said Larry Sabato, a politics and media expert at the
University of Virginia. ``If he were, maybe more Americans would
watch the sparsely seen 'NewsHour'.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer is, in many ways, an anachronism in today's broadcast
journalism, which promotes attitude as much as accuracy, edginess
as much as evenhandedness. He avoids opinions and biases to the
extreme: he hasn't even voted since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time chain smoker, Lehrer gave up cigarettes after a heart
attack and bypass surgery in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 66, he professes journalistic ideals that, by today's
standards, seem almost quaint: he refuses to use anonymous sources
or unattributed quotes; he carefully separates opinion and analysis
from straight news stories; and he assumes there is at least one
other side or version to every story.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer declined all requests for interviews this past week,
devoting his extra time to preparing for the first presidential
debate, set for this Tuesday at the University of Massachusetts in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments about his craft have been remarkably similar
over the years, underscoring his reputation as hard-working,
diligent, productive, questioning, sometimes droll, and perhaps
sober to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an entertainer,'' he has declared on more than one
occasion. And after the commission announced his selection as
debate moderator last month, he told The Boston Globe: ``I really
don't have any politics. I love politics. I admire the people who
put themselves on the line. But I never take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Five nights a week for the last 25 years, Lehrer has been
interviewing politicians and world leaders in Washington, first on
``The Robert McNeil Report,'' then ``The MacNeil-Lehrer Hour'' and,
since McNeil's retirement in 1995, ``The NewsHour with Jim
Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   His questions are often considered ``soft'' _ that is, polite,
by news show standards. But the questions are also open-ended,
focused and short. ``The longer the question, the easier it is to
evade,'' Lehrer reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer was born in Wichita, Kan., and spent much of his
childhood in the state. His family moved to San Antonio, Texas,
when he was a teenager. His father worked for a bus company, and
today, Lehrer's office in suburban Virginia is decorated with bus
company logos and terminal signs.
</P>
<P>
   After the University of Missouri and a stint in the Marines, he
landed a job writing obituaries at The Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be like Ernest Hemingway,'' he told the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette last spring. ``I wanted to write stories, and
Hemingway said if you want to do that, got get a job as a
newspaperman.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Hemingway, Lehrer did not settle for the who, what,
when, where, how and why of daily journalism. He also wrote
fiction. And in 1970, while working as city editor for the
now-defunct Dallas Times Herald, he wrote a novel, ``Viva Max!'',
which became a Peter Ustinov movie.
</P>
<P>
   He quit his job at the paper to write fiction full time, but
then took part-time job at the Dallas public TV station. Two years
later, he and his wife, novelist Kate Lehrer, and their three
daughters moved to Washington just in time for the Watergate
scandal, which led to the rewriting of many of the rules of
journalism, most notably the use of unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer continues to write fiction. He published his eleventh
novel this year, ``The Special Prisoner,'' a yarn about Japanese
atrocities during World War II that poses the question of whether
homicide is ever justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   His 1995 novel, ``The Last Debate,'' is about a conspiracy in
which journalists use unsubstantiated charges of child and spousal
abuse to destroy a presidential candidate during a live TV debate.
It grew out of Lehrer's experience moderating one of the three
presidential debates in 1992 and one in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer also moderated the two debates between President Clinton
and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the Republican
challenger, in 1996. And despite strict rules governing the
debates, he succeeded in gently breaking some in order to make the
debate more free flowing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at one point, Lehrer was temporarily stymied by the
no follow-up rules Clinton and Dole had set. So, Lehrer asked a
follow-up disguised as a new question: ``Mr. President, the senator
mentioned drugs. He suggested that you are _ you bear some
responsibility for the rise in drug use of teen-agers in the United
States. Is he right?''
</P>
<P>
   As the sole question in this year's debates, Lehrer has great
latitude to direct the flow and content of the events. But it's
unlikely he will exploit his powerful role to make himself the
center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more important to Jim Lehrer than to get the
information from the candidates and to the audience,'' said
Crystal. ``And there's nothing less important to Jim Lehrer than to
show off Jim Lehrer.''

PERU PRESIDENT VISITS WASHINGTON TO SEEK U.S. SUPPORT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Embattled Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori paid
a surprise visit to Washington Thursday in an effort to gain
backing during a tumultuous time in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived so suddenly that U.S. officials were caught
flat-footed when asked when and with whom he'd meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that has come up rather quickly,'' said
State Department Spokesman Philip Reeker at an afternoon briefing.
``It wasn't something we were anticipating as we put together
schedules for the week or even for the days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori met with the secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, Cesar Gaviria, for about 45 minutes at OAS
headquarters Thursday evening but had no comment afterwards. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The State Department arranged a meeting with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said U.S. officials plan to emphasize the Clinton
administration's support for a peaceful and democratic transition
of power and ``for the continuation of OAS dialogue that has been
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Andean nation has been rocked by fears of a military coup
following an announcement by Fujimori earlier this month that he
will step down next spring after new elections. The fears were
heightened Thursday when a member of the Peruvian Congress charged
that the military was trying to force lawmakers into a plot to
provoke a coup. But Reeker said the administration had no knowledge
of an imminent coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peruvian armed forces issued a statement last (Wednesday)
night denying outright rumors of army-led efforts to organize a
coup. And I think that statement very much reaffirms the support
previously voiced by the military in Peru for maintaining
constitutional order, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent forced departure to Panama of Fujimori's disgraced
former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, after charges arose that he
bribed a legislator failed to calm jitters that the nation's
fragile democracy was faltering.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos had strong support inside the Peruvian army, fueling
rumors that he was instigating a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Fleischer, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, said Fujimori was visiting
Washington in hopes of securing support from the OAS and the State
Department, both of which have been critical of him since he was
elected for an unprecedented third term in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess he is shopping around for international backing
for his plans to hold elections next year,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   One senior congressional analyst said Fujimori's sudden visit
may be intended to gain the backing of the United States and the
OAS as he prepares to ``portray himself, ironically, as the savior
of Peruvian democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory, Fujimori is taking advantage of, and perhaps
even heightening, speculation in Peru that former spy chief
Montesinos is working to set up a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   That speculation has grown following unsubstantiated reports
that Montesinos backers inside the military were replacing junior
officers viewed as not loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our read is that a coup is very doubtful at this point,'' said
the congressional expert. ``There would be very little support for
it in Latin America beyond (Cuban President Fidel) Castro and maybe
(Venezuelan President Hugo) Chavez.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, many people inside and outside of government believe
that a coup is not a possibility. One expert, retired Gen. Daniel
Mora, said the military command would destroy itself it it tried to
take power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a clear leader and cohesion in the ranks for
a coup to happen, and both conditions are missing,'' Mora said.
``Two other conditions, popular support and international
acquiescence, are also absent. It wouldn't work and the generals
know this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori may have surmised that his sudden departure to the
United States could create jitters in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   He would then tell U.S. and OAS officials that he needed their
strong, explicit backing in order to calm the volatile situation.
</P>
<P>
   If he secured that backing, Fujimori could then return to Peru
clearly in charge, and would have bought time until the new
election he has promised for next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said, ``That is a plausible scenario. He may well be
telling people in Washington that a smooth, successful transition
to democracy is up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, opposition politicians ended a two-week boycott of
Congress Thursday. Lawmakers unanimously passed a law eliminating
the intelligence service, which was headed by Montesinos. The law
calls for the service to be deactivated beginning in 15 days and
set up an oversight board that includes civilian participation.
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were counted the chamber exploded in applause,
with representatives from both sides of the aisle congratulating
themselves for working together.

LIEBERMAN A HOT TOPIC AS ROSH HASHANA BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabbi Daniel Judson will be eating his words this weekend, and
perhaps he should be eating his yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, Judson stood before his congregation and
scoffed at the leaked list of potential Democratic vice
presidential candidates, predicting that Vice President Al Gore
could not choose Senator Joseph I. Lieberman to be his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said there would be no way they would nominate Lieberman,
and I actually said I would eat my `kippah' if they did,'' Judson
said, using the Hebrew word for skullcap. ``Almost every member of
my congregation agreed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as Jews gather to celebrate Rosh Hashana, Judson
will again be before his congregation in Canton, Mass., but this
time he'll be seeking to draw moral and historical lessons from
Lieberman's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Judson, like rabbis in synagogues across the nation, will be
addressing the same fundamental questions: What does Lieberman's
nomination and his public and proud proclamation of his faith mean
for American Jews?
</P>
<P>
   Not since Egypt and Syria invaded Israel on Yom Kippur of 1973
has there been such broad consensus about what to talk about in
synagogues during the High Holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for a modern rabbi not to address this
during the High Holiday season, because it has become clear that it
is an epochal event in American Jewish history,'' said Rabbi Noam
E. Marans of Temple Israel in Ridgewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Judson, rabbi at Temple Beth David in Canton, will suggest that
the positive reaction to Lieberman's nomination reflects a decline
in anti-Semitism in the United States, while the apparent
acceptance of his religiosity offers an opportunity for American
Jews to rethink their views on public expressions of Jewishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is, `How come the Jews thought there was no way
they were going to do it, but the Democrats did it?' '' Judson
said. ``We have overestimated the level of anti-Semitism in this
country, and we need to re-evaluate our sense of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Many rabbis will be focusing on Lieberman's religiosity, which
runs counter to a secular trend in American Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at this level of possible power has been as Jewish as
this Jew,'' Marans said. ``Does his role-modelling break the
stereotype that somehow Jews who are completely immersed in their
Judaism are at a disadvantage in climbing the secular mountain?''
</P>
<P>
   Most rabbis will be combining those themes, suggesting that the
Lieberman nomination is a chance to reflect on the attitudes of
America generally, and American Jews in particular, toward Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wider society is expressing more than a passing curiosity
in traditions that an un-identified Jew had long since dismissed as
antiquated and irrelevant,'' said Rabbi William Hamilton of
Congregation Kehillath Israel in Brookline, Mass. ``All of a sudden
America seems to respect the Jewish way, so what's an un-identified
Jew to do?''
</P>
<P>
   One of Lieberman's own rabbis, Barry Freundel of Kesher Israel
in Washington, will also choose this theme, saying ``he (Lieberman)
challenges those who assume Jews can't really be comfortable in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The High Holidays _ Rosh Hashana, which marks the start of a new
year in the Jewish calendar, and Yom Kippur, which is the day on
which Jews atone for sins against one another and against God _ are
the most stressful points of a rabbi's year, because many more
people show up at synagogue to mark those holidays than on any
other occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Christians come for Christmas and maybe for Easter,
Jews tend to come for the High Holidays,'' said Rabbi Ruth Alpers,
a professor of practical rabbinics at Hebrew Union College, the
seminary for Reform rabbis. ``In many congregations, High Holidays
are the one chance rabbis have to reach the most number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis often agonize about High Holiday sermon topics, with some
attending workshops for ideas, or waiting until the last minute to
choose from a number of alternative speeches they have prepared.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, ``Gore took care of all of us rabbis by
selecting Senator Lieberman,'' said Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous interviews about their sermons, rabbis repeatedly
compared Lieberman to baseball players Hank Greenberg and Sandy
Koufax, both of whom drew attention for their refusal to play ball
on Jewish holidays. Lieberman has refused to to campaign on the
Jewish sabbath, and he is taking time away from his campaign this
weekend to celebrate Rosh Hashana at his synagogue in New Haven and
next weekend to mark Yom Kippur, most likely at his synagogue in
the Georgetown section of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But rabbis said the nomination of Lieberman is the first truly
American event to be of such broad interest in the diverse Jewish
community, which previously has coalesced largely around issues
involving Israel. (Many rabbis this year will also give sermons
that touch on the Middle East peace talks, and some will touch on
topics from ``Survivor,'' a hit television show, to ``Jew vs.
Jew,'' a new book on Jewish factionalism in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all rabbis will be talking about Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, home of Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush, Rabbi Steven Folberg of Congregation Beth Israel and Rabbi
Martin J. Pasternak of Congregation Agudas Achim will both be
talking about other subjects. Bush has close ties to the Jewish
community in Austin, where some leading Republicans are Jewish and
where Bush has been known to show up at a Passover seder on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reason is I'm not really sure that there's an
ultimate religious message in Lieberman's candidacy that is weighty
enough for these days in which people are hungering for a spiritual
message and at a time when I have the largest audience of the
year,'' Pasternak said. ``But my second reason is that I'm in
Austin, Texas, and I've got Republicans out there (in the
congregation). I don't want to endanger my status with them as a
rabbi, so that they might feel uncomfortable with me or not come to
me because politics is such an emotional issue.''

<P>
   Computers have driven this economy to the longest expansion
ever. Computer stocks have racked up some of the biggest gains of
the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   But all good things must end someday, and the signs are growing
that the end may be here. September has been a horrid month for
computer-stock investors. If the growth of the computer industry is
slowing, as seems to be happening, that has significant
implications for corporate profits and for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of alarm had not spread very far on Wall Street before
Thursday night, although bad news from Apple may change that.
Intel, the dominant maker of personal computer chips, is down 41
percent this month since its disclosure that revenue is running
well below forecast. But much of the commentary on Intel focused
not on the implications for the industry, but on explaining away
the price drop. Some said that the market would have reacted more
calmly if Intel had quietly prepared analysts, but that it was
prevented from doing so by a new regulation of the Securities and
Exchange Commission barring selective disclosure _ a rule not yet
in effect, as it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Such analysis insults investors and analysts, who are presumed
to be able to handle bad news only if it is whispered rather than
announced. And it overlooks the fact that many computer-related
stocks have declined. Apple, for example, was down 12 percent this
month before its bad news came out _ sending it down 45 percent
more in after-hours trading. Microsoft rallied briefly after the
Supreme Court decided not to hear the company's antitrust appeal
immediately, but the shares soon fell to their lowest level since
November 1998. (Microsoft, which went public in 1986, had never
before traded at a 22-month low.)
</P>
<P>
   Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm,
notes that movements in computer-stock prices have been a leading
indicator of trends in computer-equipment orders. ``These stocks
are now pointing to a big slowdown in computer investment,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   If that indication is accurate _ and the government's durable
goods figures make it clear that growth in computer orders is
slowing sharply _ then slower economic growth is likely. Much of
the growth in recent years has reflected the surge of investment in
computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   That investment has been even more important to corporate
profits because money spent on computers counts as revenue for the
seller _ thus raising profits _ but is treated as an investment by
the buyer, thereby not harming that company's immediate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Why the slowdown? Many companies accelerated their spending in
recent years to replace computers rather than deal with year-2000
issues in the older equipment. Spending for Internet-related
strategies remains strong _ EMC, the biggest company in data
storage, is still setting new highs _ but other areas are
weakening.
</P>
<P>
   At the low end _ the home and small-business markets _ computers
may be starting to resemble cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody says things are slowing, maybe you wait a year to
buy a new auto, or a new computer,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief
economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Slower growth for computers does not spell doom for the economy,
or for the companies involved. But it does call into question the
high multiples that computer stocks have come to enjoy. Even now,
Intel trades for 33 times historic earnings. That is double the
multiple it fetched a few years ago _ and four times that of
General Motors.

 &HT;    Russians knock U.S. out of gold-medal contention
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The improbable run by the U.S. women's volleyball team
ended in the Olympic semifinals Thursday when Russia proved too
tall an order.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian players averaged about 6-foot-3 at the net and
looked like street performers on stilts. They were overpowering on
serves and blocked effectively to win 25-15, 23-25, 25-15, 26-28,
15-8 after the United States fought off two match points in the
fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some moments of greatness,'' said U.S. player Kerri
Walsh. ``Our comeback in Game 4 was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The final set was tied at 7 before the Russians closed out the
match at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Saturday, Russia will
play Cuba, the dominant team for the past decade, for the gold,
while the United States will play Brazil for the bronze. Brazil
defeated the U.S. in four sets during group play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to win the match, but it didn't happen,'' said
Tara Cross-Battle, 32, one of two remaining members of the 1996
Olympic team, which placed seventh. ``A lot of people didn't think
we would get this far, but we knew that we could.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. players upset South Korea in five sets to gain a
semifinal berth, then had to readjust their game to the Russians,
who formed a virtual iron curtain at the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team came here kind of unknown, but they knew what they
came here to do,'' said coach Mick Haley. ``And once we got into
the medal round, it became very clear to all the players that the
gold medal was the thing they cherished the most. You could see by
their fighting spirit that they did not give up at any point in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the team will be upset if it doesn't come away with a
medal. ``No one wants to lose the last match,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Haley, ``We came here to win a gold medal. There's not
much difference between fourth and eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, Nikolai Karpol, has coached the Russians for 20
years and is compared to Bobby Knight for his fiery temperament.
When he yelled at one player, an American spectator called out,
``Awww, leave her alone,'' and other members of the crowd booed.
</P>
<P>
   Karpol's daughter Nadia is engaged to marry U.S. assistant coach
Jeri Estes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Maybe your dad will give you an early wedding
present,' '' said Robert Gambardella, director of the U.S. program.
``He's an intense guy. As much as he hollers at them, he really
loves the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team couldn't match the Russians' experience, as 10 of
the 12 were newcomers to the Olympics. Danielle Scott, the other
'96 veteran, will turn 28 Sunday. She doesn't regret sticking
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I gave up too much coming back. . . . a little
taxing on the body,'' she said, ``but I think it was worth it. And
I'm not finished yet. I have one more match to go.''

   SOUR NOTE FOR K-TEL: Music retailer K-Tel International, a once
high-flying Internet stock that has since been grounded, has been
delisted by Nasdaq for failing to meet minimum requirements to
trade on the exchange. The company, which is known for its
repackaging of hits from the '70s and '80s (remember ``Play That
Funky Music''?), also said fourth-quarter revenue dropped and
losses widened. It partly blamed an ``excess inventory'' of
cassette tapes. K-Tel is now outsourcing a large part of its
e-commerce sales to Amazon.com to reduce overhead. Visitors to its
site _ www.ktel.com _ still can order custom CDs and get digital
downloads. In late 1998, K-Tel soared as high as $12.56 as day
traders snapped up shares but dumped them after investor euphoria
waned. The stock now trades at around 63 cents.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING PAINS: Garden.com plans to cut 30 percent of its work
force, or 93 jobs, as it joins a growing number of dot.coms that
are trying to cut expenses in the face of increased competition for
Internet dollars. At the same time, the company is launching a new
business division called Trellis, and it is teaming with Lowes
Companies Inc. to leverage Trellis' supply chain technology to
generate more retail and e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   WEB AUCTION IN CHINA: China will hold its first auction of
Internet companies, domain names and Web sites today, although
foreign investors aren't invited. The company is expected to have
50 million Internet users in five years. But many existing Net
companies are floundering. ``It has become almost impossible for
medium and small Web sites to sell shares to the public, and
mergers and acquisitions are good ways for them,'' Li Wenming, the
deputy secretary-general of the China Internet Web Site Auction
Committee, told Bloomberg News. The sites to be auctioned include
scrap-metal dealerships, flower suppliers and chat rooms for AIDS
patients.

AccessAtlanta.com is owned and operated by Cox Interactive Media,
which is owned by Cox Enterprises Inc. Cox Enterprises also owns
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

   FORD AT FINGERTIPS: Ford said 78 percent of its eligible member

HENDRIX FAST AT IRWINDALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some might say Rick Hendrix was a little out of his element
Saturday night racing in the USAC Three-Quarter Midget event at
Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyon Country driver usually competes on the USAC Western
Midget and Sprint circuits. He even won a Midget points title in
1998. So it shouldn't come as such a shock that he won the 20-lap
Three-Quarter Midget feature at Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that Hendrix, who is currently eighth in
points in the USAC Western Midgets standings, led all 20 laps in a
car that was relatively new to him.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix had only four days to prepare for his race at Irwindale.
Other drivers, such as series leader J.J. Ercse and Walt Johnson of
Sun Valley, have had all year to compete and prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my second Three-Quarter Midget race in five or six
years,'' the 42-year-old Hendrix said. ``These are the hardest cars
to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's been a while since Hendrix, a Glendale Hoover
High graduate, has competed in Three-Quarter Midgets, he is hardly
a newcomer to the series. He competed in Three-Quarter Midgets from
1987 to 1992 and won the series title in his final year on the
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   His return to the series was a mixture of luck and timing.
Hendrix's Sprint and Midget Car crew chief, Tony Porto, has a
friend, Dave Lampert, whose son drives on the Three-Quarter Midget
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lampert's son, Steve, recently left for college in Redding,
Calif., leaving the elder Lampert without a driver for the
Irwindale race. Dave Lampert asked Porto if he knew anyone who
could race and Porto said he could get Hendrix to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up the car on Wednesday and I knew the car was good,''
Hendrix said. ``But it wasn't right when we got there (Saturday).
By the first heat, we got it. I am really happy for Steve and
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix started on the front row and says he was never really
challenged in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get together again,'' said Hendrix, who won on
pavement for the first time this year for Lampert. ``His son likes
the dirt races and he's better on them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ercse finished second and maintained his lead in the series
standings. He leads Johnson, who finished fourth, by 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the USAC Three-Quarter Midget schedule is Nov.
18 at Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   __ Maronski rallies: Frank Maronski Jr. of Quartz Hill made up
21 spots, going from 25th to fourth, in Saturday's NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Series Star Nursery 250 at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Maronski, eighth in series points, finished one spot ahead of
Granada Hills Kennedy High graduate M.K. Kanke of Frazier Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Reed of Bakersfield won the Star Nursery 250. Series leader
Matt Crafton was third.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Southwest Series is the Snap-On 100 at
Altamont Raceway on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   __ Monster builder: Frank Schettini of Simi Valley will be
displaying his monster truck designs at the Off Road Expo 2000 on
Oct. 7-8 at the Fairplex in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top monster truck builders in the sport, Schettini
will be joining Kent Lothringer, who is preparing eight vehicles
for the Baja 2000, and Kreg Donahoe.
</P>

   __ Roush Racing tryouts: Four drivers auditioned at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway this week for two open Roush Racing seats for the
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series team.
</P>
<P>
   One of those seats is being vacated by former NASCAR Featherlite
Southwest Series champ Kurt Busch, who will drive Roush Racing's
No. 97 Ford Taurus on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit in 2001. Greg
Biffle, the other Roush Truck Series driver and current series
points leader, is moving up to the NASCAR Busch Grand National
Division in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The four drivers looking to replace Busch and Biffle are Scott
Riggs, who has 16 career Truck Series starts and one top-five
finish; Nathan Haseleu, a Re/Max Challenge Series driver; Mike
Peters, a Late Model driver from South Boston, Va., and Chuck
Hossfeld, a Street Stock driver from Lancaster, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing great,'' said Max Jones, the Roush Racing truck
team manager. ``They're all professionals in their own right. And
none of them has driven Las Vegas Motor Speedway, so it's unique.
It's going to be tough to pick a winner. They're all so close and
they're all doing a good job. They've tested with us before (at
Toledo, Ohio), so we know they were pretty good.''

FAIRY TALES CAN COME TRUE IF YOU'RE STREISAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leave it to Barbra Streisand to turn her own life
into a musical fairy tale, one with a resoundingly happy ending.
That is the essence of the farewell show Streisand brought to
Madison Square Garden for two sold-out performances on Wednesday
and Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The personal story she tells in songs and anecdotes is a
variation on any number of myths in which a lonely, gifted child
who never knew her father finds and marries a handsome prince. On
the way, she also becomes queen of the Hollywood dream factory with
her spellbinding voice.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's show even includes a child version of herself: the
gifted young singer Lauren Frost is used to fine dramatic effect
playing the singer as an adolescent girl recording ``You'll Never
Know.'' Streisand eventually chimes in, and the two join voices on
``Something's Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the most effective of several video sequences, Frost
and Streisand rejoin voices with video images (two live and one
from the movie ``Yentl'') singing ``Papa Can You Hear Me?'' The
song is the touching climax to Streisand's anecdote about being
sent a love letter her father wrote to a woman (not her mother)
when he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the show, which was taped for Home Box Office, is a
fairly straightforward career retrospective that carries the singer
from that early recording session, to nightclubs to Broadway, and
finally to Hollywood and a late-blooming romance and marriage to
the actor James Brolin. The closer it gets to the present, the more
shamelessly sentimental the show becomes. The love songs that
accompany Streisand's wedding and happily-ever-after pictures with
Brolin are pure greeting-card mush. The wonder is that Streisand's
voice can make such sing-songy romantic doggerel sound, if not
deep, at least deeply heartfelt. No pop singer invests the word
love with such a swooning sense of expectation, voluptuously
half-rolling the l, tremulously intoning the o, purring the v,
lending the silent e an aura of breathless anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   The show offers no less than two grand finales. The first finds
Streisand ascending a stairway to the stars after segueing a
quiveringly tender version of the kitsch inspirational anthem ``I
Believe'' with ``Somewhere'' (from ``West Side Story''), dressed up
with grand, thumping flourishes. During the second finale, a
gorgeously sung sequence of ballads that includes a pensive
``Before the Parade Passes By'' and ends with a triumphal
``People,'' Streisand briefly discusses her retirement from live
performance but promises to keep making records and films.
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising about Streisand's show is the degree to
which her personal fulfillment has lightened up her singing. She
has always been better in a relaxed, tender mode than in her steely
stentorian one. In her recordings, especially her more recent ones,
Streisand's perfectionist drive has tended to eradicate spontaneity
in the quest for an inhuman technical perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the singing on Wednesday conveyed a relaxed
joy, a playful tenderness that rarely makes it to Streisand's
recordings nowadays. If some of her top notes have disappeared, her
middle register has gained in fullness, and the breathless,
spinning vibrato she wields like an emotional slingshot is more
expressive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Among the show's many magical moments, some of the most
memorable were a wistful ``The Way We Were,'' a tender ``Something
Wonderful,'' ``Alfie,'' ``Send in the Clowns,'' ``Don't Like
Goodbyes,'' and a big, pumping Brazilian-flavored ``Come Rain or
Come Shine.'' Only two numbers seriously grated: the frantic disco
hit ``The Main Event'' (Cher does this stuff much better) and a
mismatched beyond-the-grave video duet with Frank Sinatra on ``I've
Got a Crush on You.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the concerts reconfirmed Streisand's status as the
last (and possibly the greatest) true believer in the old romantic
myths that are vanishing from pop. She's living proof that
schoolgirl dreams really do come true, and happy endings aren't
just found in fairy tales. If these are really her last concerts,
her happy ending is our loss.

 PERSONALS: How Hef Got His Street 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file.) &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By LEAH GARCHIK &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The city of Chicago's recent naming of a street after  &UR; Hugh Hefner &LR; 
came after tangled debate by the city's aldermen. The matter had
been approved by a transportation committee, notes a Metropolis
magazine story sent to Personals by  &UR; Craig Griffin &LR; , before that
committee noticed two witnesses who wanted to testify against it.
</P>
<P>
   So the transportation committee reversed itself, and the
renaming was brought up before the finance committee the next day.
There, it was debated in light of economics (Hefner ``has
contributed to the economic welfare of the city,'' said a
supporter), equality (``People on the South Side name streets after
Black Muslims,'' said a supporter), sophistication (Chicago ``is
not a city that is provincial and parochial in its outlook,'' said
 &UR; Christie Hefner &LR; ) and the Playboy raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hefner's success is due to one basic business service,''
said opponent  &UR; James Madigan &LR; . ``He gets women to expose their
genitalia for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderman  &UR; William Beavers &LR;  disagreed, asking Madigan to show the
committee a centerfold. Madigan said the image was ``a tool from
which men gratify themselves sexually.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee,  &UR; Edward Burke &LR; , asked Madigan's
credentials. ``I am actually gay,'' said Madigan, ``so this was my
first purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people read that,'' said Beavers. ``I don't see
them playing with themselves.'' And so on. The ayes prevailed and
the street was created hours later, with Hefner in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FLASH  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Recent news items about  &UR; Lynne Cheney &LR; 's 1981 romance novel
mentioned that the vice presidential candidate's wife's bio _ on
the Bush campaign Web site _ lists only two books, a history of the
House of Representatives and a tract about morality and politics.
The site left out two more novels, too: ``Executive Privilege,''
published in 1979, and ``The Body Politic,'' her 1988 book about
the covered-up death of a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``imp'' putting ``Changing the Climate'' bumper stickers
on SUVs contacted Personals, inviting readers to stop in at
 &LR; Changingtheclimate.com &LR; , where they can learn more about what the
imp calls ``an exciting, nonviolent and satisfying sport.''

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;

   &UR; ``It wasn't to get the Jewish vote. It was to get the Joe &LR;

 &HT;    NUMBER OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPS
 &HT;    With HEALTH-INSURANCE-DATA, for a box/chart, which has moved.
 &HT;    ATTN TEXAS EDS: Your state tops the list in the proportion of
uninsured.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 2 million Americans, half of them children,
obtained health-care coverage last year, the first time in 12 years
that the number of people without health insurance dropped, the
Census Bureau says in a report to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The country's low jobless rate and broader health-care coverage
offered by employers contributed to the turnaround. The number of
people without health insurance declined by 1.7 million between
1998 and 1999, from 44.3 million to 42.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured children fell by more than 1 million to
10 million, from 15.4 percent to 13.9 percent of all children, its
lowest level since 1995. About 567,000 poor children gained health
insurance in 1999, stemming in part from a Clinton administration
push to increase government health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the number of uninsured Americans, particularly among the
working poor, remained high. About 15 of every 100 Americans
remained without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains last year, the number of uninsured has
increased by nearly 8 million since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a morning drizzle after a prolonged drought,'' Ron
Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a non-profit consumer
advocacy group on health-case issues, said of the 1999 decline in
the number of uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults and immigrants were the least likely to have
coverage. Minorities were less likely than whites to have
insurance, though coverage increased across all racial and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Texas topped the list of states with the highest share of
uninsured, 24.1 percent when statistically averaged from 1997 to
1999. Minnesota had the lowest rate of uninsured people, 8.8
percent of its population without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans _ 63 percent _ were covered by a health insurance
plan linked to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving force behind this improvement was an increase in
the likelihood of people having employment-based health
insurance,'' said Robert Mills, author of the Census Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said two vulnerable groups remained worrisome:
low-income working people not eligible for Medicaid or other
government-subsidized health care coverage and young adults unable
to obtain or afford coverage from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   One of every three people in poverty was not covered by a health
plan in 1999, virtually unchanged from the previous year. While
Medicaid covered 12.9 million poor people during at least part of
1999, another 10.4 million people below the poverty line had no
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Only 71 percent of young adults, ages 18-24, had health
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton took office in 1993 pledging health insurance
for all Americans. In the next five years, the ranks of the
uninsured grew by more than 4.5 million as administration efforts
to convince Congress to approve a comprehensive health care
proposal failed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress and the White House have agreed over the years
on a string of incremental measures to expand coverage. Overall,
about one of every four Americans has some form of government
insurance through Medicaid, Medicare or other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and the uninsured has been a major issue in the
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore would expand the federal Children's Health
Insurance Program and provide tax credits for low-income families
and the elderly. Republican George W. Bush has proposed a $2,000
refundable health credit for low-income families not covered by
Medicaid or an employers' health plan to be able to purchase their
own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have promised to make health insurance more
affordable for small businesses who cover their employees. Most new
jobs are created by small businesses, which are less likely to
offer employee health benefits because of the high cost of
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The non-profit Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation has been
studying uninsured families since 1995 and finds that many forego
medical care or wait until a health condition makes it absolutely
necessary to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see so visibly is that the uninsured are working
families living on the edge _ a major illness or accident can push
them over the edge,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's figures are based on its annual population
survey of 50,000 American households.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lower-income Americans were less likely to have health
insurance. About 24 percent of households with annual incomes of
less than $25,000 had no health insurance. (The poverty line is
defined as an income of $17,029 for a family of four and $13,290
for a family of three). About 8 percent of households with incomes
of $75,000 or more were without coverage. But overall, coverage
rates increased for households with incomes of less than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whites were much more likely than minorities to be covered by
health insurance. One of every three Hispanics, or 33.4 percent,
was without health insurance compared to 11 percent for
non-Hispanic whites. About 21 percent of African Americans and
Asian Americans were not covered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workers at large companies were twice as likely to have health
insurance than those employed by small businesses. About 31 percent
of workers at firms with 25 or fewer employers had coverage while
at companies with 1,000 or more employees, 68 percent of workers
had health insurance. (The estimates do not account for employees
that may be covered by another family members job-based insurance
policy).
</P>
<P>
   _ The share of population without health insurance fell in 15
states _ Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North
Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas. Meanwhile, eight states
saw an increase in the proportion of uninsured: Hawaii, Illinois,
Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
The results are based on statistical comparisons of two-year
averages from from each state for 1997-98 and 1998-99.

 &HT;    Team USA used to being a target
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ They're as good as it gets in Olympic basketball, and
yet the U.S. men's team feels it can get better. Better play,
better results, better reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Team USA continues its assault on the gold
medal. In dismantling Russia 85-70 Thursday, the United States
advanced to the semifinals Friday against Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that America won by only nine points the first time
the teams met a week ago _ and the aggressiveness with which
opponents have attacked the overwhelming favorites _ another
challenging, if not difficult, outing is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for a lot of marbles, so teams are coming at us,''
said guard Vince Carter, who had 15 points and six rebounds against
the Russians. ``We're about winning, too, so we're coming right
back at them. We don't care who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way many feel about the Americans. Kevin Garnett (16
points, 11 rebounds) listened to a fan heckle him all game. When it
was over, Garnett said, he threw the man a towel in a spirit of
sportsmanship. ``And he spat on it and threw it back,'' Garnett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the feelings many fans have expressed about America's
team. Not all the time, but enough to let the players know they
must be their own support system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an NBA game, we see hecklers and get booed on the road,''
Carter said. ``So we're used to it. In this case, it's the Goliath
thing. They want to see us knocked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia was in a position to pull the upset, trailing just 46-41
at halftime. But, as usual, the United States' depth, talent and
defense won out. Which, of course, prompted boos from the SuperDome
crowd as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the fans think,'' Carter said. ``I'm not
playing for the fans. I'm playing for the gold. We're not playing
to impress the fans. We're playing to impress ourselves. I could
score 50 points and they would still boo. So we just have to take
care of our own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Seattle's Gary Payton: ``We don't care about them booing
us. They boo us, but then we get a dunk and they cheer. They're
wishy-washy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the less-than-warm reception and the shaky starts to
games, the United States has handled business quite well. And it
has managed its emotions admirably, too, for opponents have taken
to grabbing, clutching, holding, pulling and bumping even more than
expected for international play.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the first half Thursday, Carter was undercut by
Russia's Zakhar Pachoutine, which touched off some strong emotions.
Carter, Gary Payton and Antonio McDyess had to be restrained from
taking on Pachoutine and his brother, Evgueni.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deliberately undercut me,'' Carter said. ``I don't care if
you play hard. But there was no call to low-bridge me. Whenever
that happens, I can't go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The American players are mindful not to sound like whiners.
``We're not asking for any breaks,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   But they are keenly aware that teams open games strongly and
with a purpose. ``We can't get frustrated,'' Payton said. ``And I
don't think we are. I mean, we've got two more games and it's gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're coming out too relaxed, and that's because of the
young guys. They are hyped and running around instead of being
poised and coming hard. If we come out at the start the way we do
the second half, we win by 30. . . . And we'd probably get booed
for that, too.''

 &HT;    Three left for U.S. in boxing semifinals
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For U.S. boxers once heralded as the best since the
five-gold team of 1976, it's now this simple: three remaining shots
at gold, and at the chance to salvage some respectability in the
new order of world amateur boxing.
</P>
<P>
   If Jermain Taylor, Rocky Juarez and Ricardo Williams don't win
on Friday, the United States will go home without any boxing gold
for the first time since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team hasn't lived up to my expectations,'' USA Boxing
president Gary Toney said.
</P>
<P>
   That thought could easily be echoed by Cuban boxing officials,
though they tend to keep such things to themselves. Five Cuban
losses in a row between the quarterfinals and semifinals stunned
boxing's dominant power the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Cubans still beat Americans, as Clarence Vinson found out
Thursday when Guillermo Rigondeaux snapped the Cuban losing streak
with a dominating win over Vinson in the 119-pound semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get these type of things in boxing,'' said Vinson, who
will take a bronze medal home to Washington. ``He was just a better
fighter today.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams gets the last U.S. chance to beat a Cuban when he faces
Diogenes Luna in the 139-pound semifinal Friday. American boxers
are 0-2 against Cuba in Sydney and 2-10 overall in the last three
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The other Americans fighting to get into gold medal finals are
the hard-hitting Taylor at 156 pounds and Juarez at 125 pounds.
Taylor faces Yermakhan Ibraimov of Kasakstan, while Juarez fights
Russia's Kamil Dzamalutdinov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can get a couple of them through to the finals,''
U.S. coach Tom Mustin said. ``Maybe we'll get all three of them.''
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING
</P>
<P>
   KOLAT ELIMINATED
</P>
<P>
   Cary Kolat can beat the wrestlers. What he can't seem to beat is
the system in international wrestling that permits the slightest
dispute or error to alter a match result.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Kolat, who can't seem to win for losing in off-the-mat
decisions, won 3-1 Thursday over former world champion Mohammad
Talaei of Iran, but the result was protested, then Kolat lost the
rematch 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Kolat, long one of the United States' best amateur wrestlers,
later pinned Ramil Islamov of Uzbekistan in 5:52 at 138 3/4 pounds
(63 kg). However, Talaei won by injury forfeit over Islamov to win
the three-man pool, advance to Friday's quarterfinals and oust
Kolat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in four years a Kolat victory in a
world-level championship was stripped by protest.
</P>
<P>
   In amateur wrestling, no wrestler leaves the mat secure in
victory. Any loser can dispute a match on any technical point, and
all he needs is a sympathetic arbitrator to order a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Slay of the United States, for example, upset Olympic
champion Bouvaissa Saitiev of Russia at 167 1/2 pounds (76 kg)
Thursday, but was nervous about the outcome until Saitiev's protest
was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, and I've never liked it, that a point can be
awarded on the mat and allowed to stand, and somebody goes into a
back room and changes it,'' U.S. coach Bruce Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   TAEKWONDO
</P>
<P>
   BREAKTHROUGH FOR U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lopez won the United States' first gold medal in the
Olympics' newest official sport, just as he knew someday would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like I visualized,'' said Lopez, competing at 150
pounds (68 kg). ``It's just as perfect as I had imagined and
dreamt.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez got into the sport because his family was into it. His
older brother, Jean, who is also now his coach, was on the national
team with Steven in 1994 and 1996. His younger brother, Mark, was
on the team with him last year.
</P>
<P>
   After being scored on only once in his first three bouts, Lopez
had to come from behind in the final round of the title match to
defeat South Korean Sin Joon-sik.
</P>
<P>
   MEN'S TENNIS
</P>
<P>
   KAFELNIKOV TRIUMPHANT
</P>
<P>
   With a marathon performance and a jubilant heave of his racket,
Yevgeny Kafelnikov capped a stellar month for Russian tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov outlasted Tommy Haas of Germany 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-2,
4-6, 6-3 for the gold medal in men's singles, then celebrated by
tossing his racket 15 rows into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``To add a gold medal to my career, it's absolutely fantastic,''
Kafelnikov said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Russian Elena Dementieva won the silver in women's
singles. Less than three weeks ago, Russian Marat Safin beat Pete
Sampras to win the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``My country is taking over in tennis,'' Kafelnikov said.

   DOKIC OUT FOR AUSSIES?
</P>
<P>
   Upset over news reports that focus on her father's temper,
17-year-old star Jelena Dokic has vowed never to play for Australia
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph reported that Dokic was angry over an
article in the Australian Tennis magazine that suggested her
father, Damir Dokic, needed psychological help to control his
temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to speak to my Fed Cup captain Lesley Bowrey . . .
and tell her I don't want to play for Australia again,'' said
Dokic, who lost to Monica Seles in the bronze-medal match. ``I
don't care what people say and do to my poppa _ the bond between
us, my mother and (brother) Savo, no one can break.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Dokic's father was banned from women's
tennis, both as a coach and as a spectator. He also was denied
Olympic accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions came after he was tossed out of both Wimbledon and
the U.S. Open this year following confrontations with authorities.

400-meter showdown with Cathy Freeman, says fear overwhelmed her
dream of obtaining a third gold medal and she ``cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the most important rendezvous I ever had with
myself,'' she told the French sports daily L'Equipe. ``I cracked
when I shouldn't have cracked.''

FIDELITY SELLS LOCAL NEWSPAPER UNIT TO BOSTON HERALD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dramatically altering the Massachusetts media landscape
and widening his publishing battle with The Boston Globe, Boston
Herald publisher Patrick J. Purcell announced an agreement Thursday
to purchase the Fidelity Investments stable of more than 100 local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal for Community Newspaper Co. (CNC) ends
Fidelity's rocky 10-year experiment in community journalism. It
also teams the urban-oriented Herald with CNC's suburban papers
shortly after the Globe's parent company, The New York Times Co.,
purchased the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette and as the Globe itself
is expanding its suburban coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it certainly will extend the (newspaper) battle,''
said Purcell during a teleconference announcing the sale. ``This is
an extraordinary revenue generating opportunity. . . . I think it
will make the Herald combination a much more effective competitor.
Let the battle be joined.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe publisher Richard H. Gilman responded that ``I'm not
surprised that they've done this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither company was in a particularly favorable competitive
situation,'' Gilman said. ``We will continue our plans to serve our
readers and advertisers even better than we do today.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sale, expected to close by Nov. 1, goes through, Purcell
will acquire CNC's Eastern Massachusetts stable of 88 weeklies,
four dailies, 15 so-called shoppers devoted largely to advertising,
some specialty publications, and the Town Online Web operation.
</P>
<P>
   CNC, with about 1,200 employees, reports a total weekly
circulation of slightly under 600,000. The combined daily
circulation of the Herald and CNC daily papers would be about
325,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday's agreement was a well-kept secret, it was not a
complete surprise. In recent years, Fidelity had been the subject
of frequent sale rumors, many of them involving MediaNews Group
president William Dean Singleton as a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell has been actively pursuing other acquisition
opportunities, most recently making a serious bid for The Patriot
Ledger of Quincy and The Brockton Enterprise, which were suddenly
pulled off the market last week. Since its pursuit of the Ledger,
the Herald has employed several internal belt-tightening measures.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Purcell said that ``I've been talking to various folks
at Fidelity for a long time about coming together.'' Those talks
``became really serious in the summer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The principals declined to discuss a sale price, with Purcell
simply stating that the ``financing is in place.'' That led to
speculation about whether the Herald had won a bargain basement
deal for an operation that Fidelity may have come to view as a
corporate liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I ever believed it would sell as a package was at
bottom-fishing prices,'' said Jack Authelet, a newspaper
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper analyst John Morton characterized the purchase as a
``very intelligent strategy.'' But Morton added that ``a more
interesting question is about how he's financing it'' and joked
that perhaps former Herald owner Rupert Murdoch was lurking in the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the initial reaction to Thursday's announcement was
upbeat. ``It sure makes sense for Pat, because he's going to
combine his strength in the city with superb demographics in the
suburbs, which gives him a compelling story,'' said Russel
Pergament, who sold his Tab newspaper chain to CNC in 1992 and
later became a vice chairman of that company. ``And it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elfers, the retired CNC chairman who initially convinced
Fidelity boss Ned Johnson to invest in community newspapers, said:
``I have some wistfulness and I also have some joy. I think this is
an outstanding marriage between two strong, locally owned
franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his plans for personnel and synergy between the
two operations, Purcell indicated that it was too early to know
many of those answers. ``We need to get in there and better
understand'' the CNC structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question hanging over Thursday's announcement was not only
whether Purcell could reap financial rewards from his purchase, but
whether he could act as an effective steward for scores of small
community papers with intimate ties to their readers.
</P>
<P>
   The sale ``bodes well for journalism in general in the Boston
area,'' said Robert Keough, the editor of CommonWealth magazine,
who recently moderated a forum on community journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of community journalism,'' he said, the question is
whether the ``Herald is in a position to carry out an oversight
over what essentially are a million little newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's tenure had its share of rough patches. Founded in
1991, CNC patched together various local chains in the hope of
creating a muscular newspaper empire that combined the best aspects
of localism and chainwide clout.
</P>
<P>
   But early on, there was a revolving door of top executives and
frustrating bureaucratic inertia. By the mid-1990s, CNC had
invested approximately $100 million in the enterprise and still not
turned a profit. One observer compared the undertaking to ``a major
motion picture, many years in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   CNC is widely believed to have been operating in the black for
the last several years, but that has also been accompanied by a
number of cost-cutting measures. Editors were stretched thinner
during a 1999 restructuring, and the company announced the
elimination of about 150 positions earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the public forum moderated by Keough and sponsored by the the
MassInc think tank, CNC executive editor Mary Jo Meisner was
besieged by angry questions from audience members complaining about
CNC's cutbacks and the quality of their local papers.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Johnson ``wanted to do something positive, he wanted
something of civic value, and he put his money where his mouth
is,'' said Pergament. ``A few bucks later, he's decided, I think
wisely, to step out of the arena and to defer to someone who
understands the newspapers organically.''
</P>
<P>
   Said analyst Morton: ``It may be that Fidelity may have made
some mistakes in alienating some of thse communities. ``But the key
here (for Purcell) is advertising presence.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does the Herald succeed where Fidelity struggled?
Observers say Purcell will need to develop strategies for combined
advertising packages, that there are likely to be some sharing of
reporting resources, and that he needs to be acutely aware, more
aware than his predecessors, of the sensitive bond between a
community and its neighborhood paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to make some smart business decisions, no
doubt about that,'' said Authelet, who has been a sometime critic
of CNC.
</P>
<P>
   But the key is for Purcell to ``just put the responsibility back
in the hands of people at the local papers who can do the job,'' he
said. ``Every reader in CNC land should be rejoicing tonight.''

 &HT;    A small-town David verses big corporate Goliaths
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ It's not likely Rowe Brogdon instilled fear in
the corporate hearts of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and the Ford
Motor Co. in 1998 when he filed a $21 million wrongful-death
lawsuit on behalf of a Florida couple whose son died in a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon, after all, is an affable, small-town, South Georgia
lawyer who cut his lawyerly teeth on car-crash cases. Nobody
dismisses Brogdon today.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate giants settled the lawsuit right before trial was
set to begin _ much to Brogdon's satisfaction, although he would
not disclose terms. Brogdon, 46, and the tire-building
whistle-blower he discovered helped lead to Bridgestone/Firestone's
recall of 6.5 million tires.
</P>
<P>
   And, tire company documents that Brogdon fought hard to uncover
show that tires made at a plant in Wilson, N.C., prompted more
customer complaints of tread separations between 1990 and 1995 than
tires manufactured at any other Firestone plant. A U.S. District
Court judge in Brunswick ordered the documents unsealed this week.
They seem to contradict the company's earlier claims that its
problems were confined to its Decatur, Ill., plant.
</P>
<P>
   It also shifts the focus of the faulty-tire investigation from
the Midwest to the South. Georgia _ Brunswick and Statesboro, in
particular _ are in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my role as being a lawyer prosecuting a successful case
involving a defective product,'' Brogdon said in an interview this
week. ``It's exhilarating to see things ideally happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim and Michael Van Etten's son Daniel died in March 1997 when
his Ford Explorer blew a tire and crashed on I-95 in Camden County.
Daniel, a 19-year-old scholarship football player returning to West
Virginia University, was thrown from the car. The blown tire was a
Firestone radial ATX, like millions of others now being
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Kim Van Etten, she told me they picked the
wrong mother's son to kill,'' Brogdon recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon had successfully sued the Cooper Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. after
a 1993 blow-out near Claxton led to a man's ``catastrophic'' head
injury. Brogdon's reputation as a tire expert for product liability
cases was building. Brogdon compiled incidents nationwide of tire
blowouts involving Firestone/Bridgestone tires. He received
documents from the tire company which showed Brogdon where the
faulty tire was manufactured _ Wilson, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon needed more, though, somebody with inside information.
He found Alan Hogan. It wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1998, Brogdon wrote 10 or so members of the
American Trial Lawyers Association in Wilson wondering if they'd
ever had clients who'd worked at the massive tire company. Brogdon
got lucky and found one employee, but he'd worked in shipping, not
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had a friend who was willing to talk who made tires and
had tremendous knowledge of the manufacturing process,'' Brogdon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon flew to Raleigh the next morning, rented a car and drove
to the Holiday Inn Express in Wilson to meet Hogan. He discovered
Hogan, who'd worked at the plant during the early and mid-1990s,
had a ``tremendous background in engineering and an understanding
of the tire-building process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning I knew I had his attention, when he learned
somebody had been killed,'' Brogdon recalled. ``When I showed him
pictures of the tire he said, 'I can tell you exactly why that tire
came apart.' `` Firestone/Bridgestone's attorneys deposed Hogan on
March 31, 1999. He told them the plant had a ``chronic problem with
the tire separations.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys asked: ``You talked earlier about when you saw the
Van Etten tire that you thought there was something wrong with it,
that it occurred at the plant. What was it that you thought was
wrong . . .?''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan replied: ``The way the two belts came apart.'' He said he
saw ``clear indications'' that sections of the tire were
inadequately joined.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the Brunswick trial in August 1999,
Firestone/Bridgestone and Ford settled with Brogdon, his partner
James Franklin, and the Van Ettens. But the game was only half
over.
</P>
<P>
   KHOU-TV in Houston learned of Hogan's testimony. A reporter flew
the next day to interview Hogan. Officials with the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration saw Warner's report and the
tire recall soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned about the recall, the first two people I called
were Kim Van Etten and Alan Hogan,'' Brogdon said. ``We just shared
a feeling that the case had a much greater worth than any monetary
amount ever received.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon is set to go out on his own Monday. His new office is a
few blocks off the courthouse square, evidence of the distance he
has traveled, literally and figuratively, from his earlier
product-liability days.
</P>
<P>
   But Brogdon still keeps in touch with the Van Ettens and Hogan.
He represents Hogan, who claims ``intentional and malicious
interference of his business by Firestone'' as a result of Hogan's
public comments against his former employer.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon is also fielding inquiries from a couple of clients
considering lawsuits against Firestone/Bridgestone. He relishes the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-level litigation against major corporations is extremely
challenging,'' he said. ``It's a game of cat and mouse and,
unfortunately, you're the mouse. What you have to do, though,
through tenaciousness and persistence is fight, fight, fight.''

CANDIDATES SPLIT ON REACTION TO APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential candidates rarely raise the
subject of abortion. But Thursday's tempest over the government's
approval of the abortion pill RU-486 proved once again the futility
of trying to keep this emotional issue out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who supports abortion rights, said he
was ``pleased'' by the federal Food and Drug Administration's
decision to approve RU-486 for use in the United States. Texas
Governor George W. Bush, who opposes abortion, said the approval
was ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear making this abortion pill widespread will make
abortions more and more common,'' Bush said as he campaigned
Thursday in Wisconsin. ``As president, I will work to build a
culture that respects life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the support of conservative Republicans by pledging
that as president he would reverse Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme
Court decision that legalized abortion, and ban so-called
partial-birth abortions. As he has tried to woo women, who make up
a majority of the undecided voters, he has downplayed the issue.
Now, analysts say, he is in a position of opposing what many women
view as a safe and early form of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush would like to submerge his antichoice positions as he
tries to capture the presidency,'' said Betsy Cavendish, legal
director of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League. ``He should be worried about today's decision, because it
underscores that he is opposed to a woman's right to choose in the
first weeks of a pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavendish called the FDA's action ``a huge victory'' that would
energize abortion-rights activists to campaign for Gore between now
and the election. NARAL endorsed the vice president earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Reed, a Bush adviser and former head of the Christian
Coalition, said the RU-486 decision could hurt Gore, because it
will not be popular with Roman Catholics, who make up 20 to 30
percent of the voters in the hotly contested states of Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still tend to think abortion is an issue that slightly
favors Bush,'' Reed said. ``To many ethnic Catholics, the idea of
the government approving a pill that essentially causes an abortion
is deeply disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said he expected the FDA's decision to both mobilize Gore
supporters and galvanize groups that oppose abortion, such as the
National Right to Life Committee, which has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in statement released by the vice president's office
instead of the campaign, stressed that science and safety, not
politics, paved the way for the FDA's approval of the
abortion-inducing drug mifepristone after more than five years in
the agency's regulatory pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision is not about politics, but the health and
safety of American women and a woman's fundamental right to
choose,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference on Capitol Hill, a group of Republican
lawmakers and groups that oppose abortion accused the Clinton
administration of politicizing the regulatory process, and
endangering women's health, to give Gore a possible advantage with
some swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has completely politicized the
drug-approval process, proving they are more concerned with
rewarding the abortion lobby than the safety of the drugs that are
approved,'' said Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson accused the administration of pressuring the FDA to
accelerate the regulatory process and ``rushing a drug through that
will take lives instead of saving them.'' He called for Senate
hearings to probe the FDA's approval of the abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration did push for approval of the abortion
drug known as RU-486. In one of his first executive orders in 1993,
President Clinton reversed the ban imposed by President George Bush
that had blocked anyone from bringing the pill into the United
States. RU-486 was first produced in France and marketed throughout
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Clinton defended the FDA, saying it had
``bent over backwards'' in its inquiry, and he denied political
pressure was applied to the drug's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA is basically doing it's job,'' Clinton said. ``It's
now done its job. And I regret that some members of the other party
apparently have already tried to politicize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, said he
planned to propose legislation that would strictly limit which
doctors could administer mifepristone. Members said it was very
unlikely anything would happen in the waning days of this session
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Bush did not say that he would try to overturn
the decision if he is elected. But Representative J.C. Watts, also
an Oklahoma Republican, said he was ``certain'' a new
administration ``with moral leadership and a commitment to family
will reverse this Clinton-Gore decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime, congratulations, Mr. Clinton: you never cease
to amaze us in your quest to make abortion `safe, legal, and
rare.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a major blow to opponents of abortion, and
some of them will definitely try to put the issue into presidential
politics to rally the right wing of the Republican Party,'' said
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, which
spearheaded the drive for RU-486's approval. ``That just makes the
stakes higher for our side.''

NAT FEIN, WHO WON PULITZER PRIZE FOR PHOTOGRAPH OF BABE RUTH, DIES
AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nat Fein, who won a Pulitzer Prize for capturing one of the
sports world's most poignant images, a rear-view photograph of a
dying Babe Ruth receiving his final accolade at Yankee Stadium in
June 1948, died Tuesday at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood,
N.J. He was 86 and lived in Tappan, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In his three decades with The New York Herald Tribune, Fein, who
called himself ``just a human-interest photographer,'' took
thousands of pictures evoking life in New York. Using a bulky Speed
Graphic camera, he photographed circus elephants sleeping, Mayor
Fiorello La Guardia leading the Sanitation Department orchestra,
and Dr. Albert Schweitzer kneeling to shake a little girl's hand.
</P>
<P>
   On the rainy afternoon of Sunday, June 13, 1948, Fein was at
Yankee Stadium when Ruth, terminally ill with throat cancer,
appeared at home plate in his old uniform at a ceremony marking the
stadium's silver anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the dressing room, he sat beside his old No. 3
locker and we made a picture there,'' Fein wrote in an unpublished
memoir. ``Then he pulled out the belt showing how much thinner he'd
got and I wanted to make a picture then, but they told me he's
going to have all he can do to get out there _ he's a very sick man
_ and the least bother here as possible because there's going to be
a ceremony outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over to home plate. Of course, the story was No. 3
bows out, the uniform being retired and all, and as they played
`Auld Lang Syne,' I was trying to make a picture showing No. 3, but
it's only on his back. So I walked around behind with the band
still playing `Auld Lang Syne' and there was his figure, his thin
legs compared to his bulky body, and his No. 3 showing. So I made
the picture from his back.''
</P>
<P>
   The photo of Ruth leaning on a bat he borrowed from the star
pitcher Bob Feller, whose Cleveland Indians played the Yankees that
day, appeared on Page 1 of The Herald Tribune. Fein sent a copy to
Ruth, asking him to autograph it, but Ruth never responded. On Aug.
16, 1948, Ruth died at age 53.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the picture, which brought him the Pulitzer Prize
for news photography in 1949, Fein once said, ``I didn't think it
was a great shot,'' but he acknowledged that he ``got the feeling''
of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Fein was born in Manhattan, joined The Herald Tribune
as a copy boy in the early 1930s and became a staff photographer in
1939. He served as a photographer in the Army Air Forces during
World War II, then returned to The Herald Tribune and remained
there until it went out of business in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Fein's photographs appeared in Edward Steichen's ``Family of
Man'' show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1955, and a collection of
his photos was published as ``Nat Fein's Animals'' (Gilbert Press,
1955).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, David, of Tappan.

 &HT;    Lawyer: Tire builder's testimony backed
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Court documents unsealed in Brunswick validate key
testimony by a former Firestone tire builder whose allegations of
quality control problems at the company's North Carolina factory
eventually led to a massive recall, a Georgia lawyer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adjustment or warranty data confirms and corroborates the
testimony of Alan Hogan,'' Statesboro, Ga., lawyer Rowe Brogdon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, 33, is a former Firestone employee in Wilson, N.C., whose
pre-trial testimony in a wrongful death lawsuit exposed problems at
the factory. Hogan's revelations led to subsequent news reports,
prompting Bridgestone/Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon brought the wrongful death lawsuit and now represents
Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Adjustment data is information compiled by tire companies to
document how many tires were returned to retailers by unsatisfied
customers, and why refunds or exchanges were granted.
</P>
<P>
   The newly disclosed information, compiled by plaintiffs' expert
witness Dennis Carlson, shows that between 1990 and 1995, tread
separation was cited in 66.4 percent of the tires returned for
refunds at the Wilson facility; tread separation was cited in 59.6
percent for returns of tires made at all Firestone plants. This
data was revealed in four sets of Firestone documents unsealed
Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo of Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Alaimo also ordered the unsealing of even more Firestone
documents, but the judge postponed their release, giving the
tiremaker a week to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public interest is legitimate because the tire tread
separation defect concerns the health and safety of the public _
interests of the highest order,'' Alaimo wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone may appeal part of Alaimo's ruling,
spokeswoman Anne Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also strongly disputes Carlson's conclusions, Conrad
said, adding that Wilson's adjustment data is ``equal to or better
than'' all other plants. Of the more than 2.3 million tires
produced at Wilson between 1991 and 1995, only 0.13 percent had a
tread separation adjustment, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people to make a claim that there are problems with
the Wilson tire, that's absurd,'' Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is
investigating the Aug. 9 recall of the ATX, ATX II and Wilderness
AT tires. Bridgestone/Firestone has recalled all ATX tires but only
Wilderness tires made in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ford Motor Co. said it will give buyers of future
versions of its Explorer sports-utility vehicles a choice of tires
from three different companies. Customers will be able to pick
tires from Michelin &AMP; Cie. and Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co., as well
as Bridgestone/Firestone, for the 2002 model year.

PALESTINIANS RIOT AS ISRAELI LAWMAKERS VISIT RELIGIOUS SITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Angry Palestinians rioted Thursday in Jerusalem and
the West Bank following a tour by Israeli opposition leader Ariel
Sharon to the religious shrine that stands at the heart of the
Arab-Israeli dispute.
</P>
<P>
   At least five demonstrators were injured in Ramallah, 15 miles
north of Jerusalem, when Palestinian stone-throwers confronted
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Similar unrest in Jerusalem left at least a dozen Palestinians
and several Israeli soldiers wounded. The clashes flared after
Sharon and six fellow Likud lawmakers marched onto the site that
Jews call Temple Mount and Muslims the Haram al-Sharif, or the
Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's delegation stayed for about 20 minutes while dozens of
Palestinians lobbed rocks and bottles toward them. Hundreds of
Israeli police, on hand to provide security, responded by clubbing
and firing rubber bullets at the stone throwers.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing melee, at least two Palestinians were injured
when they were hit in the face by rubber bullets. Two soldiers,
slightly injured, were whisked away on stretchers. Israeli
officials said 25 troops suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the violence, Sharon announced upon leaving that he
had come on a mission of good will. ``I came here with a message of
peace,'' he told reporters. ``I am very sorry that people were
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``What provocation is there when Jews come to
visit the place with a message of peace?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's critics, however, blasted the retired general for what
they said was a poorly timed visit designed to provoke violent
confrontations over the site. Many Palestinians were angered by the
visit because it carried political significance to a sacred Islamic
site that they believe should be subject solely to Muslim
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Jews believe the site is where King Solomon built the first of
two temples some 3,000 years ago. It is Judaism's holiest shrine.
For Arabs, it is the third-holiest place of Islam. Muslims believe
the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven from there, which now is
the site of two mosques, Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the site has been at the epicenter of the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Both sides demand control over it as
part of any peace deal. Neither has shown an inclination, in public
at least, to accept a compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Camp David summit collapsed in July, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has stuck to his public demand for Arab
sovereignty over the site. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
refused to budge. The impasse has led to a variety of suggested
solutions, including sharing sovereignty over the city or agreeing
to a partial deal that would leave its future undecided.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Barak was quoted as suggesting that Jerusalem and
al-Quds, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, could be capitals for the
Israelis and Palestinians. ``It will be Jerusalem and Al-Quds, one
next to the other, as two capitals,'' he was quoted by the
Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   Against this political backdrop, Sharon's ascent to the shrine
appeared designed to highlight Israel's current hold over the site,
captured in the 1967 Middle East war, while placing Barak in the
awkward position of seeming too willing to concede it to the
Palestinians in return for a peace.
</P>
<P>
   To Palestinian leaders, many of whom confronted Sharon at the
shrine Thursday, the visit seemed calculated to provoke an angry
response.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Palestinian television in Gaza, Arafat termed the
visit ``very dangerous'' and called on Muslim nations to ``move
very fast'' to protect the Muslim shrines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous process conducted by Sharon against
Islamic sacred places,'' the Palestinian leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Announced more than a day in advance, Sharon's tour attracted
Palestinian warnings of violence and calls for strikes, and allowed
plenty of time for the Palestinian leadership to organize angry
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The tour followed a day of violence in the Gaza Strip, in which
a roadside bomb planted near a Jewish settlement detonated as an
army convoy passed by, injuring two soldiers. One later died from
his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several Arab Israeli members of the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, stood with the protesters during the Sharon
visit and declared shortly after he left that the Likud leader had
deliberately caused a bloody confrontation. Some said the police
had beaten them with clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to see more blood and to see more killing,'' Abdel
Malik Dahamsheh, an Israeli-Arab lawmaker, said of Sharon as he
walked down from the mount. ``He wants to kill the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, another Arab member of the Knesset, added: ``They
should be kept away from this place. They are responsible for any
violence that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a 33-year-old Jewish man from Maryland who refused
to give his name heckled the lawmakers. ``Go away! We don't want
you here,'' he yelled. ``Go back to Mecca!''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, the legislators chanted ``Al-Aqsa is Palestinian.''
That is the name of one of the mosques at the site.
</P>
<P>
   On the plaza below, a group of about a dozen Jews tried to
out-shout them, chanting, ``Here is the Temple Mount.''

   WASHINGTON _ Embattled Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori paid
a surprise visit to Washington Thursday in an effort to gain
backing during a tumultuous time in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived so suddenly that U.S. officials were caught
flat-footed when asked when and with whom he'd meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that has come up rather quickly,'' said
State Department Spokesman Philip Reeker at an afternoon briefing.
``It wasn't something we were anticipating as we put together
schedules for the week or even for the days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori met with the secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, Cesar Gaviria, for about 45 minutes at OAS
headquarters Thursday evening but had no comment afterwards. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The State Department arranged a meeting with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said U.S. officials plan to emphasize the Clinton
administration's support for a peaceful and democratic transition
of power and ``for the continuation of OAS dialogue that has been
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Andean nation has been rocked by fears of a military coup
following an announcement by Fujimori earlier this month that he
will step down next spring after new elections. The fears were
heightened Thursday when a member of the Peruvian Congress charged
that the military was trying to force lawmakers into a plot to
provoke a coup. But Reeker said the administration had no knowledge
of an imminent coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peruvian armed forces issued a statement last (Wednesday)
night denying outright rumors of army-led efforts to organize a
coup. And I think that statement very much reaffirms the support
previously voiced by the military in Peru for maintaining
constitutional order, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent forced departure to Panama of Fujimori's disgraced
former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, after charges arose that he
bribed a legislator failed to calm jitters that the nation's
fragile democracy was faltering.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos had strong support inside the Peruvian army, fueling
rumors that he was instigating a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Fleischer, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, said Fujimori was visiting
Washington in hopes of securing support from the OAS and the State
Department, both of which have been critical of him since he was
elected for an unprecedented third term in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess he is shopping around for international backing
for his plans to hold elections next year,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   One senior congressional analyst said Fujimori's sudden visit
may be intended to gain the backing of the United States and the
OAS as he prepares to ``portray himself, ironically, as the savior
of Peruvian democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory, Fujimori is taking advantage of, and perhaps
even heightening, speculation in Peru that former spy chief
Montesinos is working to set up a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   That speculation has grown following unsubstantiated reports
that Montesinos backers inside the military were replacing junior
officers viewed as not loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our read is that a coup is very doubtful at this point,'' said
the congressional expert. ``There would be very little support for
it in Latin America beyond (Cuban President Fidel) Castro and maybe
(Venezuelan President Hugo) Chavez.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, many people inside and outside of government believe
that a coup is not a possibility. One expert, retired Gen. Daniel
Mora, said the military command would destroy itself it it tried to
take power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a clear leader and cohesion in the ranks for
a coup to happen, and both conditions are missing,'' Mora said.
``Two other conditions, popular support and international
acquiescence, are also absent. It wouldn't work and the generals
know this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori may have surmised that his sudden departure to the
United States could create jitters in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   He would then tell U.S. and OAS officials that he needed their
strong, explicit backing in order to calm the volatile situation.
</P>
<P>
   If he secured that backing, Fujimori could then return to Peru
clearly in charge, and would have bought time until the new
election he has promised for next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said, ``That is a plausible scenario. He may well be
telling people in Washington that a smooth, successful transition
to democracy is up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, opposition politicians ended a two-week boycott of
Congress Thursday. Lawmakers unanimously passed a law eliminating
the intelligence service, which was headed by Montesinos. The law
calls for the service to be deactivated beginning in 15 days and
set up an oversight board that includes civilian participation.
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were counted the chamber exploded in applause,
with representatives from both sides of the aisle congratulating
themselves for working together.

FIELD'S DEBUT NOT `BEAUTIFUL,' BUT HAS A NICE PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beauty pageants have been around for a long time and Hollywood
has done its best to expose their dark comedic side in such films
as ``Smile,'' ``Miss Firecracker'' and ``Drop Dead Gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Sally Field takes a more intimate slant,
chronicling the journey of Mona Hibbard (Minnie Driver), an
ambitious, self-absorbed young woman who believes she'll find
acceptance and love by becoming a pageant queen. Instead, Mona
finds respect by facing up to the responsibility of parenting her
neglected, illegitimate daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg).
</P>
<P>
   For her entire life, Mona _ cast aside by her mother and stepdad
_ has wanted to be a beauty pageant winner and will stop at nothing
to achieve her goal. She's burned bridges in every county enroute
to the prestigious Miss American Miss contest and even fobbed
Vanessa off on her loyal best friend, Ruby (Joey Lauren Adams), to
raise because the pageant won't allow a candidate to be a mother.
She must be a perfect icon in order to be deemed ``beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' takes some risks because it presents a drastically
extreme character who is largely unlikable and asks us to go along
with her on her voyage. And Driver dives into the part, chewing up
the scenery along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Beautiful'' doesn't have the complexity of a classic
anti-heroine film and the script by Jon Bernstein is often clunky
and excruciatingly unsubtle.
</P>
<P>
   Some subplots involving the angelic Ruby grind and sputter;
they're essentially creaky mechanisms designed to eliminate the
character for a block of screen time. Too, we're left wondering if
Mona isn't similarly stranded, shedding one archaic fantasy for
another by acknowledging the inevitable maternal instinct as well
as the desire to be a beauty queen.
</P>
<P>
   All these oversights are obvious by the time Mona realizes she's
not sure if she ``wants to be a role model for thousands of little
girls or just a role model for one little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful,'' for all Field's sturdy, no-nonsense direction and
Driver's brutality, suffers because of these lapses. It's a better
film when it keeps its heart in cold storage and shows what drives
a woman to compete against her peers. In the end, dark comedy
drives the film, but it's overwhelmed by a desire to be liked,
really liked.

RODRIGUEZ A KNOCKOUT IN `GIRLFIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   Its punch may stem from a feminine perspective but don't
underrate the visceral wallop packed by ``Girlfight,'' a first
feature from Karyn Kusama.
</P>
<P>
   It teems with an impatient, explosive energy that's so full of
attitude that Sundance Film Festival audiences lavished it with a
best directing honor and a shared Grand Jury Prize. Subsequent
showings at the Seattle International Film Festival and Cannes
garnered additional enthusiasm for the film.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why. Kusama tells the rugged story of Diana
Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez), a young woman who takes up boxing as
an escape from life in Brooklyn's housing projects and finds
self-respect and acceptance in a male-dominated world.
</P>
<P>
   The film could easily have stumbled under the weight of a
million cliches and too-familiar ``Rocky'' references, but
``Girlfight'' is a genre-twisting surprise. It's more akin to
recent European boxing films _ ``The Boxer'' and ``247'' _ that see
the sport as a way out of poverty and didn't impossibly or
unrealistically stack the odds against their young protagonist's
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, there is a deeper emotional weight to the material
_ as it invites us to actually invest more than the mindless ``good
vs. evil'' theme that so many movies warrant these days.
</P>
<P>
   Diana isn't just an angry kid out to beat up the bad guys. She's
confused but brave and she's tired of taking heat from her abusive
father (Paul Calderon). When she picks up her little brother, Tiny
(Ray Santiago), from the gym, where he's been sent to learn to
fight, Diana realizes this is a place where she feels comfortable
and secure. And after convincing seasoned coach Hector (Jaime
Tirelli) that she has the right stuff to become a formidable
presence in the ring, he agrees to help her train, in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Their alliance gives the high school girl a sense of balance in
her disordered, formerly dead-end life. And a friendship with a
promising young boxer (Santiago Douglas) instills her with the
determination to get out of her rut and to face her familial demons
with pride and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama found her Diana in an open casting call after exhausting
other options. In Rodriguez, whom the director calls ``a wild
card'' who ``burns up the screen and holds it by sheer presence,''
she's made a real find.

STYLISH EX-CANADA PREMIER PIERRE TRUDEAU, 80, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who for 16 years as Canada's
prime minister electrified the country and captured world attention
with his aristocratic style, fierce intelligence, and dashing good
looks, died Thursday, age 80.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the cause of death as
``complications'' resulting from prostate cancer and Parkinson's
disease. He had been in frail health since a bout of pnuemonia in
January, although until July he walked daily to his downtown law
office in his hometown of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of mourners gathered outside Trudeau's landmark art
deco mansion on the slopes of Mount Royal as word of his death
spread through the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierre Trudeau, the embodiment of the dream of a just society,
has left us,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien told the grieving
nation. ``He is gone but his unfinished work remains _ our country,
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Easily the most famous and controversial Canadian leader of this
century, Trudeau's legacy _ like that of John F. Kennedy, the
American president to whom he was most frequently compared _ is
more one of style than substance.
</P>
<P>
   But the left-leaning leader presided over the restoration of the
Canada's Constitution from Britain and the creation of the
country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, equivalent to the United
States Bill of Rights. Against tremendous opposition in English
Canada, he pushed the country into enshrining French, the tongue of
his native Quebec, as the country's second official language,
giving it the same legal status as English.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversially, during the ``October Crisis'' of 1970, as
separatist terrorists exploded bombs and murdered officials in
Quebec, Trudeau imposed the War Measures Act, ordering troops into
the province and suspending civil liberties. The dramatic action
won him the undying hatred of many French Quebecers, although
repeated polls show that English Canadians consider him to be the
greatest politician in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting federal bills that made divorce easier and relaxed
laws on abortion and homosexuality _ positions that were also
deeply unpopular in predominantly Roman Catholic Quebec _ Trudeau
came up with one of his most famous phrases: ``The state has no
place in the bedrooms of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   All through his long occupation of the top political post, from
1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984, he projected a charisma
not seen before or since in a nation whose leaders are typically as
drab and dreary as the Canadian winterscape. The late Marshall
McLuhan, the media guru and Trudeau confidant, described the former
prime minister as the ideal candidate for the television age _ cool
and cerebral with ``the perfect mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was Trudeau's extraordinary popularity that he occasionally
had to run to escape shrieking legions of female fans.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's political life was mainly a progression of triumph to
triumph. But his final years were marked by searing personal
tragedy. In 1998, his 23-year-old son Michel was killed in a freak
cross-country skiiing accident, swept into a British Columbia lake
by an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The loss savaged Trudeau; virtually overnight he was transformed
from a vigorous elder statesman to a seemingly broken man.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement that surrounded Trudeau's ascent to the
leadership of Canada was called ``Trudeaumania,'' and the prime
minister, with his jaunty black beret and red rose boutonniere,
only added to the mystique when in 1971, age 52, he walked down the
aisle with Margaret Sinclair, a 22-year-old flower child whom he
courted in a sizzling romance that had started on the beaches of
Tahiti three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Trudeau's major policies, from massive deficit spending
on ambitious federal social projects to disengagement from the
United States, have largely been reversed since he stepped down
from the leadership for the last time in 1984. His rather haughty
anti-Americanism never sat too well even with his supporters, and
the free trade policies embraced by his successors have moved the
country ever closer into the American economic embrace from which
he sought to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau once told an American audience: ``Living next to you is
like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and
even-tempered the beast, one is affected by every twitch and
grunt.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Trudeau is best remembered for his tough stand
against Quebec's separatist movement as well as for ``patriating''
the Canadian Constitution from Britain _ in effect, making Canada's
federal laws and Charter of Rights and Freedoms, equivalent of the
US Bill of Rights, truly Canadian for the first time. He also
pushed the country into accepting official bilingualism, giving
French equal legal status with the English dominating all of the 10
provinces and three territories except Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Trudeau, despite his French Quebecois heritage,
remains as widely despised in Quebec as he is beloved in English
Canada. Separatist passions still burn in Quebec, and Trudeau is
bitterly recalled in La Belle Province as the hardliner who imposed
martial law on Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent poll, Canadian newspaper editors overwhelming picked
Trudeau as the country's ``newsmaker of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his popularity, Trudeau was an aloof and often arrogant
man; he was known to respond to hecklers with an upraised middle
finger. Even one of his sons spoke of him as distant and
obsessively private. ``I guess he had a kind of lonely life,''
Sacha, 25, told the CBC late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Born Oct. 18, 1919, Trudeau was raised a child of privilege
among the French- and English upper crust in this most cosmopolitan
of Canadian cities. He was the middle of three children, and
received his early education in Jesuit schools.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated with honors in 1943 from the University of Montreal
_ Quebec's most elite French language university _ with a law
degree and three years later earned a degree in political economics
from Harvard. He also studied economics, politics and law at the
London School of Economics and the Ecole des sciences politiques in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He taught constitutional law at the University of Montreal, and
his leftist writings and association with intellectuals soon
brought him to the attention of the Liberal Party. He first won
election to Parliament in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, he captivated the imagination of the world,
but also presided over a hyper-inflated economy and soaring
unemployment, partly the fruit of his socialist-leaning governmnet
with its emphasis on big government and expensive social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's marriage to Margaret collapsed in 1977. He later dated
Barbra Streisand and actress Margot Kidder. At age 71, he fathered
a daughter, Sarah Elisabeth, with his last wife, Deborah Coyne,
then 37, a marriage that also ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   When Trudeau finally resigned as prime minister in 1984, these
were his typically enigmatic farewll words: ``It seemed like a good
day to have a last day. ... I went out to see if there were any
signs of my destiny in the sky. But there weren't; there was
nothing but snowflakes.''

`REMEMBER THE TITANS': NOT SUBTLE BUT EFFECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's striking how many of the images that capture America's
struggle to overcome its legacy of racism come from the world of
sports. Think of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics, Jackie Robinson
stealing home, Arthur Ashe triumphing at Wimbledon, Tiger Woods
winning his first major tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're black or white, these moments are likely to put a
lump in your throat and inspire a justified swelling of civic
pride. On the playing field, at least, our better selves can
triumph over our baser instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans,'' based upon a less well-known episode in
the racial history of U.S. sports _ the integration of a
high-school football team in Alexandria, Va., in 1971 _ does an
awful lot of swelling.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of movie in which every big speech or heartfelt
moment _ and aside from a handful of tense showdowns at the line of
scrimmage, there's not much else to see _ is washed in on the flood
tide of a thousand violins. (Trevor Rabin's score, poured over the
action like ketchup, is mitigated a bit by the obligatory
classic-rock song selection. It was nice to hear Leon Russell's
version of ``A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,'' but I think I've heard
``Spirit in the Sky'' enough for one lifetime.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans'' is not a subtle picture: Toward the end,
a black player comes to visit his white teammate _ at first his
bitter rival, now his bosom friend _ in the hospital. The nurse
tries to shoo him away. ``Only kin is allowed,'' she says. ``Can't
you see that's my brother?'' the bedridden warrior replies. All
together now, ``He's got the whole world, in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But football is not a subtle game, and if ``Remember the
Titans'' is corny, it's unabashedly, even generously so. Directed
by Boaz Yakin from a screenplay by Gregory Allen Howard, the film
tells the true story of the T.C. Williams High School Titans in
broad, accessible shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone, who becomes the Titans'
head coach by fiat of the Alexandria school board, which has also
required the desegregation of Williams' team. Boone's predecessor,
Bill Yoast (Will Patton), one winning season away from election to
the Virginia Football Hall of Fame, swallows his pride, and brushes
off the outrage of many of the town's prominent whites, to stay on
as Boone's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the two men gradually mutates from
hostile suspicion to grudging respect to loyalty and trust, an
evolution mirrored by the players. The first, and strongest, part
of the movie takes place at a preseason camp, where, under Boone's
relentless drill-sergeant discipline (``This is not a democracy,''
he bellows. ``This is a dictatorship. I am the law.''), they meld
into a cohesive fighting unit.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scenes _ a locker-room dozens session, in which the
players achieve solidarity by insulting one another's mothers _
feel a bit phony, but Yakin uses the physical intensity of the
sport as a way of telegraphing the changing emotional texture of
the team. Brutal tackles and errant punches have a way of turning
into the hugs and handshakes of genuine camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much male bonding going on here,'' says Petey, the
Titans' cocky running back (Donald Faison). Yes, indeed. Even by
sports movie standards, there aren't a lot of women on the scene.
Boone's wife (Nicole Ari Parker) barely speaks, and white women
show up principally as opponents of the transracial bonding that
comes relatively easily to the football players.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bertier (Ryan Hurst), the white team captain whose initial
resistance to playing alongside blacks does not survive camp, must
contend with the stubborn bigotry of his mother and his girlfriend.
On the first day back at school, the students are greeted by an
angry white mob, including protesters carrying signs that say
``Mothers Against Busing.'' The strongest female presence is
Yoast's perky, blond-ringleted daughter Sheryl (Hayden Penettier),
whose passion for the sport is even more rabid than her dad's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans'' was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, whose
recent pictures include action blockbusters like ``Armageddon,''
``Bad Boys'' and ''The Rock,'' and it provides the emotional
equivalent to those movies' visceral thrills. Yakin leaps from one
big payoff to the next, and paints his characters in vivid,
cartoonish colors. There's the fat white guy who's too goofy to be
racist (Ethan Suplee); the beefy black guy who sings, jokes and
dispenses inspiration (Earl C. Poitier); and the golden-haired
hippie, a transplant from Southern California, with a throwing arm
that's also pure gold (Kip Pardue).
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the younger members of the cast form a loose, funny,
heartfelt ensemble; Hurst and Wood Harris, as his rival and comrade
Julius Campbell, are especially fine. Washington and Patton are
strong, complex enough presences to make up for the script's
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   The football played by the Titans and their opponents is the
old-fashioned, up-the-middle kind, yielding low final scores and
bruised and muddy players. ``Remember the Titans'' is similarly
solid; its satisfactions are time-tested, a little worn but
nonetheless durable.
</P>
<P>
   The football sequences themselves are in the usual slamming,
grunting Dolby, and if they don't quite shake your molars loose,
the way Oliver Stone's ``Any Given Sunday'' did, you may put a hand
to your chest from time to time to see if your ribs are still in
place. If a heart beats inside those ribs, you'll also find a lump
in your throat and an overwhelming urge to cheer.

BOSTON FIRM NAMED IN RACIAL BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Keane Inc., a Boston-based information technology company,
subjected its black employees in Philadelphia to racial
discrimination and harassment, the US Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission alleged in a lawsuit filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also accuses Keane of retaliating against employees who
complained and says that one employee was subjected to a racially
offensive Ku Klux Klan drawing while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in federal court in Boston, also claims the
employee, Michael Randolph, 43, of Atlanta, was called names and
assigned to less lucrative accounts due to his race.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph is no longer with Keane.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Vale, vice president of Keane, a leading IT services firm
that does about $1 billion worth of business annually, said Keane
is regarded as ``a good company, a fair company'' and that it will
contest the suit vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can not comment on the specifics of the complaint because
we have not seen the complaint,'' Vale said. ``However, I can tell
you that we are very distressed that the EEOC seems to believe we
discriminate. We are aware, in general, of some of the EEOC's
allegations _ and we believe they have no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Vale said he did not know how many minorities Keane employs.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC's complaint did not spell out how many employees in
addition to Randolph were allegedly affected.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Bissell, an EEOC supervisory attorney, said the agency
sued after investigating a complaint from Randolph. The EEOC took
depositions from other employees who worked at Keane over the last
three years and claimed they had not been treated fairly, Bissell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined . . . there was cause to believe laws were
violated, but we were unable to resolve the case in conciliation
meetings,'' Bissell said. ``We are hoping this lawsuit will act as
a deterrent and send a message to other employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since September 1997, the suit alleges, Keane has discriminated
against blacks by permitting racial epithets, assigning them fewer
accounts, and issuing their paychecks late.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified financial penalties and back pay.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Randolph said he was an account executive at Keane
from July 1998 to January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things drove me to leave,'' he said, ``and one was a KKK
drawing that was on a white board during my employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggested to them that they take one of those K's down or
put another one up, because I found it offensive. But the person
whose office the drawing was in said I was being overly sensitive,
and so did his boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph also alleges that a lucrative account was taken away
from him. ``I was told the client did not want to work with a black
man, and that I was better suited for accounts in inner-city
Philadelphia, as opposed to suburban accounts. After that, a series
of accounts were taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, a graduate of the University of Delaware, is now a
self-employed computer marketing consultant in Altanta.

RUNYAN CONTINUES TO SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It's terribly tiring racing one 1,500
meters, much less three in four days. If there's a silver lining
behind all that sweat, it's that runners have plenty of time to
work out the kinks in their race strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Runyan went out much too slowly in the Olympic heats of
the 1,500 Wednesday and was the second-to-last runner to advance to
the semifinal. Having learned her lesson, the Camarillo High
graduate set the early pace Thursday in a field that included her
U.S. teammate and gold-medal contender Suzy Favor-Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Favor-Hamilton passed her midway through the race and four other
runners caught Runyan on the last curve. When she finished sixth in
4-minutes, 06.14 seconds, Runyan was sure her Olympic experience
was over.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old started down the snaking line of international
television reporters, leaving a Frenchman to deliver the good news:
Nobody in the second semifinal surpassed Runyan's time, which was a
.3-second improvement over her third-place effort from the U.S.
Trials in July.
</P>
<P>
   So Runyan will run once more, in Saturday's 12-woman final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky I got to the semifinal. Now I'm lucky to get to the
final,'' Runyan said. ``I'm so excited. I'm just going to run my
heart out and enjoy running against the best in the world. I'll
have to run fast; otherwise you'll never see me in the camera
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   While Runyan was talking, competitors from the men's and women's
Olympic exhibition wheelchair races rolled by her in the mixed
zone. Runyan felt right at home, having starred at the Paralympics
in 1996 as a legally blind athlete.
</P>
<P>
   A degenerative eye disease has narrowed her vision to 20/300 in
the left eye and 20/400 in the right eye. Runyan is the first
Paralympian to make the quantum leap to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to feel pressure about that,'' Runyan said, ``and
then I thought about it and turned it around. It's not pressure,
it's an opportunity. I have the opportunity to show kids all over
the world who are losing their vision what life can be like. I hope
parents out there will say, `I'm going to let my child be whatever
she wants to be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The people who are so focused on her vision are missing the
really neat story, in Runyan's humble opinion. Runyan wanted to be
an Olympic heptathlete, but after placing 10th at the 1996 U.S.
Trials on the strength of a terrific 800 meters, she decided to
concentrate on middle-distance running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really crazy, isn't it?'' Runyan said. ``I'm really glad
I'm not throwing the shot put anymore. To go from being a
heptathlete to an Olympic finalist in the 1,500, I think, is a
pretty amazing story in itself.'' &QL;

CANDIDATES SPLIT ON REACTION TO APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential candidates rarely raise the
subject of abortion. But Thursday's tempest over the government's
approval of the abortion pill RU-486 proved once again the futility
of trying to keep this emotional issue out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who supports abortion rights, said he
was ``pleased'' by the federal Food and Drug Administration's
decision to approve RU-486 for use in the United States. Texas
Governor George W. Bush, who opposes abortion, said the approval
was ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear making this abortion pill widespread will make
abortions more and more common,'' Bush said as he campaigned
Thursday in Wisconsin. ``As president, I will work to build a
culture that respects life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the support of conservative Republicans by pledging
that as president he would reverse Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme
Court decision that legalized abortion, and ban so-called
partial-birth abortions. As he has tried to woo women, who make up
a majority of the undecided voters, he has downplayed the issue.
Now, analysts say, he is in a position of opposing what many women
view as a safe and early form of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush would like to submerge his antichoice positions as he
tries to capture the presidency,'' said Betsy Cavendish, legal
director of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League. ``He should be worried about today's decision, because it
underscores that he is opposed to a woman's right to choose in the
first weeks of a pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavendish called the FDA's action ``a huge victory'' that would
energize abortion-rights activists to campaign for Gore between now
and the election. NARAL endorsed the vice president earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Reed, a Bush adviser and former head of the Christian
Coalition, said the RU-486 decision could hurt Gore, because it
will not be popular with Roman Catholics, who make up 20 to 30
percent of the voters in the hotly contested states of Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still tend to think abortion is an issue that slightly
favors Bush,'' Reed said. ``To many ethnic Catholics, the idea of
the government approving a pill that essentially causes an abortion
is deeply disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said he expected the FDA's decision to both mobilize Gore
supporters and galvanize groups that oppose abortion, such as the
National Right to Life Committee, which has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in statement released by the vice president's office
instead of the campaign, stressed that science and safety, not
politics, paved the way for the FDA's approval of the
abortion-inducing drug mifepristone after more than five years in
the agency's regulatory pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision is not about politics, but the health and
safety of American women and a woman's fundamental right to
choose,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference on Capitol Hill, a group of Republican
lawmakers and groups that oppose abortion accused the Clinton
administration of politicizing the regulatory process, and
endangering women's health, to give Gore a possible advantage with
some swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has completely politicized the
drug-approval process, proving they are more concerned with
rewarding the abortion lobby than the safety of the drugs that are
approved,'' said Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson accused the administration of pressuring the FDA to
accelerate the regulatory process and ``rushing a drug through that
will take lives instead of saving them.'' He called for Senate
hearings to probe the FDA's approval of the abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration did push for approval of the abortion
drug known as RU-486. In one of his first executive orders in 1993,
President Clinton reversed the ban imposed by President George Bush
that had blocked anyone from bringing the pill into the United
States. RU-486 was first produced in France and marketed throughout
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Clinton defended the FDA, saying it had
``bent over backwards'' in its inquiry, and he denied political
pressure was applied to the drug's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA is basically doing it's job,'' Clinton said. ``It's
now done its job. And I regret that some members of the other party
apparently have already tried to politicize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, said he
planned to propose legislation that would strictly limit which
doctors could administer mifepristone. Members said it was very
unlikely anything would happen in the waning days of this session
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Bush did not say that he would try to overturn
the decision if he is elected. But Representative J.C. Watts, also
an Oklahoma Republican, said he was ``certain'' a new
administration ``with moral leadership and a commitment to family
will reverse this Clinton-Gore decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime, congratulations, Mr. Clinton: you never cease
to amaze us in your quest to make abortion `safe, legal, and
rare.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a major blow to opponents of abortion, and
some of them will definitely try to put the issue into presidential
politics to rally the right wing of the Republican Party,'' said
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, which
spearheaded the drive for RU-486's approval. ``That just makes the
stakes higher for our side.''

FIDELITY SELLS LOCAL NEWSPAPER UNIT TO BOSTON HERALD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dramatically altering the Massachusetts media landscape
and widening his publishing battle with The Boston Globe, Boston
Herald publisher Patrick J. Purcell announced an agreement Thursday
to purchase the Fidelity Investments stable of more than 100 local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal for Community Newspaper Co. (CNC) ends
Fidelity's rocky 10-year experiment in community journalism. It
also teams the urban-oriented Herald with CNC's suburban papers
shortly after the Globe's parent company, The New York Times Co.,
purchased the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette and as the Globe itself
is expanding its suburban coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it certainly will extend the (newspaper) battle,''
said Purcell during a teleconference announcing the sale. ``This is
an extraordinary revenue generating opportunity. . . . I think it
will make the Herald combination a much more effective competitor.
Let the battle be joined.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe publisher Richard H. Gilman responded that ``I'm not
surprised that they've done this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither company was in a particularly favorable competitive
situation,'' Gilman said. ``We will continue our plans to serve our
readers and advertisers even better than we do today.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sale, expected to close by Nov. 1, goes through, Purcell
will acquire CNC's Eastern Massachusetts stable of 88 weeklies,
four dailies, 15 so-called shoppers devoted largely to advertising,
some specialty publications, and the Town Online Web operation.
</P>
<P>
   CNC, with about 1,200 employees, reports a total weekly
circulation of slightly under 600,000. The combined daily
circulation of the Herald and CNC daily papers would be about
325,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday's agreement was a well-kept secret, it was not a
complete surprise. In recent years, Fidelity had been the subject
of frequent sale rumors, many of them involving MediaNews Group
president William Dean Singleton as a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell has been actively pursuing other acquisition
opportunities, most recently making a serious bid for The Patriot
Ledger of Quincy and The Brockton Enterprise, which were suddenly
pulled off the market last week. Since its pursuit of the Ledger,
the Herald has employed several internal belt-tightening measures.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Purcell said that ``I've been talking to various folks
at Fidelity for a long time about coming together.'' Those talks
``became really serious in the summer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The principals declined to discuss a sale price, with Purcell
simply stating that the ``financing is in place.'' That led to
speculation about whether the Herald had won a bargain basement
deal for an operation that Fidelity may have come to view as a
corporate liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I ever believed it would sell as a package was at
bottom-fishing prices,'' said Jack Authelet, a newspaper
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper analyst John Morton characterized the purchase as a
``very intelligent strategy.'' But Morton added that ``a more
interesting question is about how he's financing it'' and joked
that perhaps former Herald owner Rupert Murdoch was lurking in the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the initial reaction to Thursday's announcement was
upbeat. ``It sure makes sense for Pat, because he's going to
combine his strength in the city with superb demographics in the
suburbs, which gives him a compelling story,'' said Russel
Pergament, who sold his Tab newspaper chain to CNC in 1992 and
later became a vice chairman of that company. ``And it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elfers, the retired CNC chairman who initially convinced
Fidelity boss Ned Johnson to invest in community newspapers, said:
``I have some wistfulness and I also have some joy. I think this is
an outstanding marriage between two strong, locally owned
franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his plans for personnel and synergy between the
two operations, Purcell indicated that it was too early to know
many of those answers. ``We need to get in there and better
understand'' the CNC structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question hanging over Thursday's announcement was not only
whether Purcell could reap financial rewards from his purchase, but
whether he could act as an effective steward for scores of small
community papers with intimate ties to their readers.
</P>
<P>
   The sale ``bodes well for journalism in general in the Boston
area,'' said Robert Keough, the editor of CommonWealth magazine,
who recently moderated a forum on community journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of community journalism,'' he said, the question is
whether the ``Herald is in a position to carry out an oversight
over what essentially are a million little newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's tenure had its share of rough patches. Founded in
1991, CNC patched together various local chains in the hope of
creating a muscular newspaper empire that combined the best aspects
of localism and chainwide clout.
</P>
<P>
   But early on, there was a revolving door of top executives and
frustrating bureaucratic inertia. By the mid-1990s, CNC had
invested approximately $100 million in the enterprise and still not
turned a profit. One observer compared the undertaking to ``a major
motion picture, many years in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   CNC is widely believed to have been operating in the black for
the last several years, but that has also been accompanied by a
number of cost-cutting measures. Editors were stretched thinner
during a 1999 restructuring, and the company announced the
elimination of about 150 positions earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the public forum moderated by Keough and sponsored by the the
MassInc think tank, CNC executive editor Mary Jo Meisner was
besieged by angry questions from audience members complaining about
CNC's cutbacks and the quality of their local papers.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Johnson ``wanted to do something positive, he wanted
something of civic value, and he put his money where his mouth
is,'' said Pergament. ``A few bucks later, he's decided, I think
wisely, to step out of the arena and to defer to someone who
understands the newspapers organically.''
</P>
<P>
   Said analyst Morton: ``It may be that Fidelity may have made
some mistakes in alienating some of thse communities. ``But the key
here (for Purcell) is advertising presence.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does the Herald succeed where Fidelity struggled?
Observers say Purcell will need to develop strategies for combined
advertising packages, that there are likely to be some sharing of
reporting resources, and that he needs to be acutely aware, more
aware than his predecessors, of the sensitive bond between a
community and its neighborhood paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to make some smart business decisions, no
doubt about that,'' said Authelet, who has been a sometime critic
of CNC.
</P>
<P>
   But the key is for Purcell to ``just put the responsibility back
in the hands of people at the local papers who can do the job,'' he
said. ``Every reader in CNC land should be rejoicing tonight.''

<P>
   Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of
Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a
unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism,
died Thursday in Montreal. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau had suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate
cancer and, more recently, pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Trudeau succeeded in altering his
country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical
flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen proud
that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two
spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month
hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the
Conservatives. When, finally, in 1984 he chose to step down after a
meditative walk in the snow, he was the longest serving Western
leader of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic
electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political
equivalent to the paroxysms evoked by the rise of the Beatles.
During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of
the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation.
Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being
pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau supervised the process by which the country replaced its
ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered
economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his
country at odds with the leadership of Canada's only neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   While firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive
to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Trudeau saw to
it that the role of the French language was reinforced when the
entire country was made officially bilingual in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau recognized Communist China long before the United States
did. He led sometimes quixotic campaigns for world peace and
nuclear disarmament while allying himself closely with such
Socialist leaders as Olav Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of Germany
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Canadians, his greatest achievement was his
successful struggle against the Quebec separatist movement. After
bombings, bank robberies and kidnappings by terrorists, and after
he was scorned as an apostate to Quebec's cause, he ultimately won
the support of most Quebec voters, who sided with him in a
referendum in 1980 that took the wind out of the sails of the
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reason before passion,'' was his personal motto, and he used
it in arguing, on economic and moral grounds, that Quebec should
stay within the Canadian federation. The separatist challenge was a
major crisis in Canadian history, and his admirers say he saved
Canada by defeating the movement.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Pierre Trudeau ran his country with a panache
that was aggressively and un-Canadianly immodest. He wore rakish
hats, drove sports cars, flaunted his learning and his wit, dated
celebrities like Barbra Streisand, toured the discos, married a
former flower child much younger than himself and once, in an act
of apparent insouciance, was photographed as he pirouetted alone in
Buckingham Palace while other guests walked off to meet Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Valpy, a political columnist for The Globe and Mail,
noted in 1998 on the occasion of Trudeau's 79th birthday, the prime
minister had become impressed early in his political career by an
idea advanced by Marshall McLuhan, the philosopher of media.
McLuhan believed that the public sees prominent figures as if they
are wearing masks, and that it is the character of the mask that
the public identifies with, not the person behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Valpy, who is married to Deborah Coyne, a constitutional lawyer
who is also the mother of Trudeau's youngest child, a daughter,
maintained that the maskTrudeau selected was that of the warrior
chief. He added, ``It would require a Joseph Campbell to explain to
Canadians _ the beaver people of peace, order and good government _
why they found magic in a warrior chief's mask. But magic they
found, served up by a practiced and consummate magician.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Canadian commentator, Richard Gwynn, maintained that
Canadians were fascinated with Trudeau precisely because his image
was not the way they saw themselves but the way they wanted to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He teases, taunts, inspires and bugs the hell out of Canadians
because they know he is utterly un-Canadian _ but exactly what they
want other people to think Canadians are like,'' Gwynn wrote in a
collection of essays called ``Trudeau's Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country so devoted to understatement, Trudeau's ascendancy
marked a radical departure. His success was compared to the
transformation of presidential style and leadership that took place
eight years earlier in Washington when John F. Kennedy was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, such a change drew complaints at home and abroad.
In the United States, Trudeau's assertion of Canadian prerogatives
frequently raised eyebrows and indignation. There was the time, for
example, when he referred to a Washington bureaucrat as ``a
pipsqueak.'' There were protests in America when he tried to limit
U.S. investments in Canada, particularly in the Canadian oil
industry. And when he urged NATO to make a dovish retreat from its
first- strike nuclear strategy, the Reagan administration thought
him to be naive, dangerous and presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like all Canadian leaders, he remained preoccupied by his
country's relationship with the United States and even charmed his
critics with comments like those he offered in 1969 after meeting
President Richard Nixon in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an
elephant,'' Trudeau declared. ``No matter how friendly and even
tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by
every twitch and grunt.``
</P>
<P>
   And when Trudeau retired 15 years later, James Reston wrote in
his column in The New York Times: ``Some of us down here think he
was a good neighbor and a good friend. We liked his crusty
arrogance and the rose in his lapel. He gave us his truth as he saw
it, even if we didn't always like it.``
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Philippe Pierre Ives Elliott Trudeau was born on Oct. 18,
1919, in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Charles-Emile Trudeau, the son of French-speaking
Quebec farmers, was a lawyer then on his way to wealth as the owner
of a chain of gas stations. He would also acquire profitable mines,
the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the Royals, the city's
minor league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Grace, was of mixed Scottish and French descent.
</P>
<P>
   The family spoke mostly French at home, but Trudeau could not
remember a time when he did not also speak English.
</P>
<P>
   At a Jesuit high school where he studied Latin and Greek, he
systematically tested teachers in contrarian debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that I must never interrupt a teacher to make an
impertinent remark, because that would be certain to infuriate
him,'' Trudeau wrote in 1993 in a book he called simply ``
Memoirs.`` ``But if I waited until he paused and then I slipped in
a wisecrack, the class would burst out laughing before he had a
chance to get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the pleasure of such moments led him to a lifelong
habit of ``opposing conventional wisdoms and challenging prevailing
opinions.``
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 he entered the University of Montreal, only vaguely
aware that the war in Europe ``might constitute the most dramatic
adventure the men of my generation would ever confront.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he also observed, ``If you were a French Canadian in
Montreal in the early 1940s, you did not automatically believe that
this was a just war. We still knew nothing of the Holocaust, and we
tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the
superpowers.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he did not enlist and even rallied against
conscription of French Canadians. In 1943 he graduated with a
degree in law and after clerking in a law office, went to Harvard
for graduate study in political economy. At Harvard, he recalled,
he was made to understand the parochialism of the Quebec, meeting
professors who were refugees from Europe who did make him aware of
``missing one of the major events of the century.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Until he was 30, he spent his time in study and travel. He left
Harvard for Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris, where he roared
across the city on a motorcycle and tasted from a rich and
fashionable intellectual menu: The Christian left, the worker
priest movement, orthodox Marxism, classical liberalism,
existentialism and particularly personalism, an attempt associated
with the writer Jacques Maritain to reconcile the needs of
individuals and society.
</P>
<P>
   A year later he was studying at the London School of Economics,
principally with Harold Laski, the eminent professor of political
science who was also the chairman of the British Labor Party.
Trudeau has written that his basic philosophy of government was
established at the LSE at a time when Britain was on the verge of
instituting the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1948, Trudeau set off on a slow voyage of
discovery, ostensibly to do research for a never completed doctoral
dissertation on the interplay of Christianity and Marxism in Asia.
Actually, as he later explained, he was embarking on a different
odyssey, eager to mix with local people and to see and sense the
world.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in Arab Jerusalem on suspicion of being an
Israeli spy, and later he was detained when he crossed the new and
tense border between Pakistan and India. He hitch-hiked across an
Indochina already rent by warring factions and he was in China
during the 1949 revolution there.
</P>
<P>
   His attendance at a lawyers' meeting in Moscow led to
instructions to American immigration officials in the
anti-Communist period in the 1950s to deny him admission if he
tried to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, Trudeau returned home dismayed that the
authoritarian government of Maurice Duplessis and the local
ecclesiatical establishment that had ruled Quebec since his
childhood were still in firm control. He committed himself to work
for a ``democratic revolution'' in the province, seeking separation
of church and state, electoral reform and educational changes. He
founded an intellectual quarterly, Cite Libre, and used its pages
to call for a coalition of democratic forces against the Duplessis
regime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 he became a law professor at the University of Montreal,
which earlier had steadfastly shunned him for being too radical and
anticlerical. By this time a quiet revolution was well underway in
Quebec, with urban, cosmopolitan and secular values rising to
challenge the old culture and the old politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 Trudeau joined the Liberal Party and won election to the
House of Commons. In Parliament, he sympathized with many
grievances of the French Canadians, advocating support for their
language and culture. But at the same time he steadfastly opposed
any legislative action that would give them special status. He was
a federalist, and he despaired of any separatist solutions that
suggested ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``French Canadians must refuse to be enclosed within Quebec,''
he wrote in one of his essays. ``The die is cast in Canada: There
are two main ethnic and linguistic groups; each is too strong and
too deeply rooted in the past, too firmly bound to a mother culture
to engulf the other. But if the two will collaborate at the hub of
a truly pluralistic state, Canada could become the envied seat of a
form of federalism that belongs to tomorrow's world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, he was quickly singled out by Prime Minister Lester
Pearson, who named him to his cabinet in 1967 as minister of
justice and concurrently attorney general. He produced legislation
expanding social welfare, tightening gun control and liberalizing
laws relating to divorce, abortion and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   When Pearson announced his intention to resign, Trudeau competed
with 19 others for the post of party leader, which carried with it
the prize of prime minister. Trudeau was victorious and on April
20, 1968, he was sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister and its
third of French descent.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later he dissolved Parliament, calling for general
elections. Trudeau campaigned on the promise of ``a Just Society,''
urging that the country's richer provinces pay for programs in the
poorer ones . He conceded that the expanded government programs he
wanted would mean higher taxes, but declared ``if you want pie in
the sky, you'll have to vote for another party.''
</P>
<P>
   It all went over with the voters, and on June 25, propelled by
``Trudeaumania,'' the electorate gave the Liberals a clear and
comfortable majority.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria was shattered in 1970 when a terrorist group, the
Front de la Liberation de Quebec kidnapped James Cross, a British
diplomat, and a week later, seized Pierre Laporte, a minister in
the Quebec provincial cabinet. As a condition of their freedom, the
Front demanded the release of members who had been imprisoned on
charges or convictions of murder, bank robbery and bombings carried
out in the pursuit of separatism.
</P>
<P>
   While demonstrators rallied in support of the Front and
nonviolent supporters of separatism called stridently for full
appeasement of the kidnappers, Trudeau painfully and reluctantly
invoked Canada's War Measures Act to protect Canada from what the
``cancer of an armed, revolutionary movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Using provisions of the act, he sent thousands of troops to
Montreal and canceled some civil liberties, including the use of
legal writs. Some 400 people were arrested and detained without
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Oct. 17, a message from the Front told
authorities where they could find the body of LaPorte. Four men
were eventually charged with his murder and imprisoned. Cross was
then released and his captors were allowed to leave for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After the crackdown, terrorism effectively ceased in Quebec.
Trudeau's tough responses proved highly popular.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of separatism for Quebec did not disappear. Indeed
it kept growing, advanced no longer simply by terrorists but by
popular politicians of the Parti Quebecois, notably Renee Levesque,
an old friend of Trudeau's who was to become his chief opponent on
the issue. By 1976 the party had taken control of the Quebec
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was the success of Trudeau's policies toward
Quebec that led to his brief ouster from office in the elections of
May 1979. With the risk of Quebec's secession seemingly ended by
his efforts, the western provinces were encouraged to lash out
against Trudeau's party, which they viewed as favoring federal
power at the expense of the authority of their provinces. The
Liberals won no seats west of Winnipeg, and Joe Clark, the leader
of the Progressive Conservative Party, became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But then Levesque inadvertantly came to Trudeau's rescue.
Realizing that the elections had removed the strongest proponent of
federalism from power, Levesque felt it opportune to prepare a
referendum that would ask the people of Quebec whether they wanted
to empower provincial officials to begin negotiations on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But by that act he strengthened Trudeau's support throughout the
country. Some of those who had voted against him thinking the
separatist danger had ended, now openly missed his voice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And Clark quickly stumbled. He lost a vote of no confidence and
new elections were ordered. Trudeau rallied impressively, and by
March 1980, he was once more prime minister, and immediately set
off to challenge the Parti Quebecois in Levesque's referendum,
scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
   The debate became personal and nasty, with Levesque, who was
seeking a yes vote, at one point dismissing the prime minister's
arguments against the proposition. ``His name is Pierre Elliott
Trudeau and this is the Elliott side taking over, and that's the
English side, so we French Canadians in Quebec can't expect any
sympathy from him,`` said Levesque.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister counterattacked. He listed the Ryans, the
Johnsons and the O'Neills _ who despite their Anglo-Saxon names
were famous French Canadian political families. Then he declared,
``Of course my name is Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Elliott was my
mother's name. It was the name borne by the Elliotts who came to
Canada more than 200 years ago. My name is a Quebec name. But my
name is a Canadian name also.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. On May 20, 1980, 59.6 per cent of the electorate
voted ``non.'' In the showdown over the destiny of Quebec,
Trudeau's vision had overwhelmed Levesque's hopes of pulling an
independent Quebec out of the Canadian federal system. Though only
the foolhardy could claim that Trudeau's victory over the forces of
separatism was permanent, none could dispute that it was profound.
</P>
<P>
   There were other successes. In 1982 he succeeded in repatriating
the Constitution by having the British Parliament pass an act that
ceded full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter to
Ottawa. He saw bilingualism and multiculturalism become national
programs. And his vision of Canada as a compassionate and
benevolent government open to the rest of the world yet different
from the United States has survived his term of office.
</P>
<P>
   There were setbacks over nuclear disarmament and on his attempts
to limit foreign involvement in the economy. But it was in his
private life where he proved most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, at the Club Med in Tahiti, the 51-year-old Trudeau met
Margaret Sinclair, 21, the daughter of a Liberal party politician
from British Columbia. They were married the next year and by 1975
they had three sons, Justin, Alexander and Michel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after campaigning with her husband in the 1974 elections,
Trudeau suffered exhaustion and was hospitalized. When she emerged
from the hospital, she became a photographer, following rock
musicians and frequenting nightclubs, where she was herself often
photographed in ways that were humiliating to her husband. Her
friendship with Mick Jagger and other pop icons provided more grist
for tabloid gossip columnists on several continents.
</P>
<P>
   The couple separated in 1974 and were divorced in 1984 with
Trudeau getting custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down as prime minister, Trudeau moved to Montreal
where he kept largely to himself, avoiding interviews or public
appearances. He suffered from Parkinson's disease but even before
the symptoms of his illness intensified, he kept close to home. He
was always considered an aloof, insular man, and his former wife
had once said that he was ``destined for eternal solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   His public mask, the one he had crafted, seemed to have slipped
away and friends who had known him for years described him as an
increasingly unhappy man. In 1998, his youngest son, Michel, a
23-year-old microbiologist who had worked as a ski instructor, was
swept to his death in an avalanche in British Columbia. Trudeau
grieved privately. He was close to his surviving sons and until his
last illness frequently visited with his daughter by Coyne.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, despite the aloofness of his last years, memories
of the warrior chief persisted in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years after he left office, when a sampling of
Canadians were polled about which public figure they would most
want to have dinner with, Pierre Trudeau came in a close second.
The only Canadian who was more popular than he was Wayne Gretzky.

<P>
   Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of
Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a
unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism,
died Thursday in Montreal. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau had suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate
cancer and, more recently, pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Trudeau succeeded in altering his
country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical
flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen proud
that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two
spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month
hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the
Conservatives. When, finally, in 1984 he chose to step down after a
meditative walk in the snow, he was the longest serving Western
leader of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic
electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political
equivalent to the paroxysms evoked by the rise of the Beatles.
During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of
the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation.
Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being
pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau supervised the process by which the country replaced its
ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered
economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his
country at odds with the leadership of Canada's only neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   While firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive
to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Trudeau saw to

<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Last Feb. 22, Gov. George W. Bush lost the
Michigan Republican primary to Sen. John McCain of Arizona, thanks
to a notably poor showing among independents, moderates and women.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, in this same pivotal Great Lakes state, he
is again having trouble attracting independents, moderates and
women in his race against Vice President Al Gore. The race is close
here, with Gore very narrowly ahead. Demographically very similar
to the United States as a whole, Michigan has seen a Bush lead, a
Gore bounce and now a bit of a Bush comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Bush arrived in the state for a pair of fund raisers
Thursday night in Oakland County, just north of Detroit, and an
appearance Friday in Saginaw, he was still searching for ways to
ratchet his campaign up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republicans have plenty of suggestions to offer him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to cloak himself in McCain in this state,'' said
Jerry Roe, a former executive director of the state GOP, who backed
McCain in the primary. ``The moderates and the independents were
terribly disappointed when he chose Dick Cheney for vice president.
A town hall meeting with McCain, maybe two, in crucial counties
like Macomb and Oakland, might do the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican officials think Bush should carry the fight
more directly to the vice president by attacking him as a threat to
the auto industry, which is still Michigan's lifeblood (although
much of the action has switched from the Big Three automakers to
dozens of small, innovative engineering outfits along the
expressways fanning out from Detroit.)
</P>
<P>
   Anything that cut into Gore's union support here would be
invaluable to the Texan. Almost a third of Michigan's likely voters
live in union households, and Gore leads among them by 55 percent
to 28 percent, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,145
registered voters between Sept. 22 and 25. Bush leads among
non-union voters.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which had a margin of sampling error of three
percentage points, showed Gore ahead by seven points among all
registered voters, but only four points ahead, 45-41, among likely
voters. And if the numbers are adjusted to account for past turnout
patterns, the race is even.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, who publishes ``Inside Michigan Politics,'' a
highly regarded newsletter, said that Bush's ``character'' campaign
against Gore had failed, and that the focus of the campaign had
switched to issues. On the most important ones, he asserted, the
vice president has the advantage, with ``a more understandable
prescription-drugs plan and a tax plan that's selling because it
helps pay down the deficit and puts more resources into the kind of
programs that people here want.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, interviews with voters in the state suggest,
Gore has been damaged by a tendency to exaggerate or even to
fabricate, and his staunch advocacy of protecting the environment
can cut both ways.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Earth in the Balance'' Gore described the internal
combustion engine as ``a mortal threat to the security of every
nation _ more clearly than that of any military enemy we are again
likely to confront.'' Sensing a big opening for Bush, Rusty Hills,
the Michigan Republican chairman, who is a close associate of Gov.
John Engler, said on Wednesday: ``That is just plain nutty. If we
can tell every autoworker Gore said that, we can win this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to do so would be in television commercials, but 35
percent of Michigan voters, the Times/CBS poll shows, already view
Bush's ads as negative, compared with 21 percent who view Gore's as
negative. Probably not coincidentally, 48 percent said the vice
president's commercials had given them an improved image of him,
while only 32 percent thought better of Bush after watching his
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   As in a half-dozen other states, voters here have been
completely immersed in the campaign, though the effect is not yet
clear. Well over three-quarters of the respondents in the polls
said they had seen commercials for the presidential nominees _ a
surprisingly high figure more than five weeks from Election Day _
and the news is jam-packed with politics. Yet four out of ten of
each man's backers expressed reservations about their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer volume of advertising, back to back, day after day,
the constant political palaver, may have reached some kind of limit
of influence,'' said Hugh McDiarmid, political columnist for The
Detroit Free Press. ``It may be a wash. At any rate, nothing is
producing any marked changes so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this kind of situation, I think the debates could count a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   David W. Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State
University in East Lansing, argued that this election differs from
many in the last two decades in its fluidity. In 1980, with an
unpopular incumbent, Jimmy Carter, the result was more or less
foreordained, he said, as it was again in 1996, with a popular
incumbent, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he said, ``with no incumbent and both candidates
relatively moderate in relation to their parties, you get the
feeling that nothing is locked in for the 10 percent that drifts
back and forth _ exactly the kind of race where the outcome could
be affected by a dramatic event like the debates, especially the
first one.''
</P>
<P>
   That will take place next Tuesday in Boston, with two more
later.
</P>
<P>
   The uncommitted and uncertain voters in this state tend to be
ticket-splitters, a phenomenon evident as long ago as 1964, when
President Johnson, a Democrat, carried the state by a million
votes, while George Romney, a Republican, was winning the
governor's race by 300,000 votes. So local politicians would not be
even slightly surprised to see Gore and Sen. Spencer Abraham, a
Republican, pulling off the same trick in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in other respects Michigan has changed radically. The state
is no longer singing the Rust Belt blues, and its population, 9.3
million in 1990, is now approaching 10 million. Both its politics
and its economy, long static, have entered a dynamic era, marked by
widespread innovation and reform.

NEW INDICTMENT NAMES BOSTON GANGSTER IN MURDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He's been lauded as an invaluable FBI informant and
denounced as a vicious gangster, but Thursday, for the first time,
fugitive South Boston gangster James ``Whitey'' Bulger was charged
with being a killer _ an indiscriminate hitman who brutally
murdered 16 men and two women.
</P>
<P>
   A sweeping federal racketeering indictment also charges Bulger's
longtime sidekick and fellow informant Stephen Flemmi with teaming
up with Bulger on 10 of the murders _ including those of Flemmi's
longtime girlfriend and the daughter of his live-in companion. The
indictment also includes three other murders linked to the Bulger
group, which Bulger and Flemmi didn't participate in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims include strangers who happened to be in the wrong
place, longtime criminal associates, friends, and others whom they
believed might provide information to law enforcement or could
otherwise threaten their organization,'' said US Attorney Donald K.
Stern during a press conference Thursday at the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   When approached by the FBI to become an informant in 1975
against his rivals in the New England Mafia, Bulger had already
allegedly killed seven people and wounded five others during a
violent power struggle with another gang, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Prouty, who recently took over as special agent in
charge of the FBI's Boston office, said the FBI is revising its
informant guidelines and has enacted several new programs as a
result of the Bulger case.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I do want to make very clear is this in itself is
repugnant to all FBI employees,'' Prouty said. ``Ninety-nine
percent of the FBI's employees are honest, hardworking employees
who often put their lives on the line and every one of us are just
very, very disturbed, disappointed, feel betrayed and are upset by
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 victims that Bulger allegedly killed during the time he
was an FBI informant include a Tulsa millionaire who suspected
Bulger's crew of skimming money from his company, three men who
were cooperating with the FBI against Bulger, and two women who
were considered a ``threat'' to Flemmi. One man was simply giving a
ride home to a man on Bulger's hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Stern called this latest wave of indictments, ``perhaps the most
important step in what has been a relentless pursuit of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Layer upon layer of myth, fear and protection have been
stripped away,'' Stern said, ``leaving a chilling and profoundly
distrubing core of shakedowns, drug dealing, corruption and
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The new charges are part of a superseding indictment that adds
Bulger and Flemmi to an existing racketeering case returned last
November against longtime Bulger associates, Kevin P. O'Neil and
Kevin Weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It also charges Bulger and Flemmi with extortion, money
laundering and shaking down drug dealers and bookmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks was dropped from the case in July after pleading guilty to
other charges. Since January, he's led investigators to three
burial sites in and around Boston where the remains of five victims
have been unearthed and a sixth is still being sought.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, who is charged with racketeering and money laundering,
is now trying to strike a deal with prosecutors, according to
sources, and could provide information against former FBI agent
John Connolly, Bulger and Flemmi's longtime handler.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger has been a fugitive since his 1995 indictment on federal
racketeering charges and Flemmi remains jailed without bail while
awaiting trial in that case. The trial has been delayed by lengthy
hearings that exposed Bulger and Flemmi's relationship with the FBI
after Flemmi claimed agents had promised them immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Last December Bulger and Flemmi were charged in a second
racketeering indictment along with Connolly, who is accused of
tipping them off to investigations and warning Bulger to flee on
the eve of his January 1995 indictment.
</P>
<P>
   While the indictment doesn't name Connolly as a defendant, it
alleges that Connolly and Flemmi ``coordinated'' a plan for Flemmi
to ``shield'' Connolly by lying about who tipped him off to the
1995 indictment when he testified in federal court in 1998 before
US District Judge Mark L. Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment claims that Flemmi lied when he testified that
former FBI supervisor John Morris tipped him and Bulger to the 1995
indictment in a bid to protect Connolly, who was the real tipster.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, which charges Flemmi with obstruction of
justice, alleges that Weeks was the go-between, carrying messages
between Connolly and Flemmi, who was in jail at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Morris admitted taking $7,000 in bribes from Bulger and Flemmi
while testifying under a grant of immunity, but denied tipping the
pair to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Tracy Miner, who represents Connolly, said, ``John
Connolly absolutely did not tip anyone to the indictment. It's not
surpriseing to me that the government would try to use one of its
rats to bolster the credibility of another of its rats. But they
can't escape the fact that it was John Morris who took money and
not John Connolly.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Connolly could have used Bulger and Flemmi as
informants while they were serial killers, Miner said, ``John
Connolly was in no better position to know that than anyone else in
the FBI. If he should have known, then other people should have
known.''
</P>
<P>
   The new charges come after two former Bulger associates, Weeks
and John Martorano, a confessed hitman, struck deals with federal
prosecutors and implicated Bulger and Flemmi in numerous murders
that occurred between 1973 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, investigators continued to dig along the banks of the
Neponset River in Quincy, just outside Boston, for a sixth victim,
Flemmi's longtime girlfriend, Debra Davis. She was 26 when she
vanished on Sept. 17, 1981 after planning to leave Flemmi for
another man.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges Bulger and Flemmi with killing Davis
because they believed she was ``a threat'' to Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   They're also accused of killing Thomas King, a Bulger rival,
whose disappearance in November 1975 remained a mystery until his
remains were unearthed at the Quincy site last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger is also accused of killing Paul ``Paulie'' McGonagle, of
South Boston, whose remains were discovered earlier this month in a
grave at the edge of Tenean Beach in the city's Dorchester section.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that Bulger and Flemmi kidnapped and
killed three people whose remains were unearthed in January from a
makeshift grave across from Florian Hall, adjacent to a major
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Those victims included John McIntyre, 32, of Quincy, who
vanished on Nov. 30, 1984 after implicating the Bulger gang in drug
smuggling and an ill-fated effort to ship guns to the Irish
Republican Army; Arthur ``Bucky'' Barrett, of Quincy, who was
involved in the 1980 Memorial Day weekend burglary of Depositors
Trust in Medford; and Deborah Hussey, 26, of Milton, the daughter
of Flemmi's longtime girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment reveals that the three Florian Hall victims had
been buried in the basement of a South Boston home, then exhumed by
Bulger, Flemmi and Weeks in October 1985 because the house was
about to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the house was the East Third Street home
of longtime Bulger associate, Patrick Nee. It was owned by Nee's
relatives until December 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi are also charged with killing Revere nightclub
owner Richard Castucci on Dec. 30, 1976, after learning that he had
told the FBI about the whereabouts of two of Bulger's pals who were
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi are also charged with orchestrating the May
27, 1981 murder of Roger Wheeler, chairman of Telex Corp. and owner
of World Jai Alai, who was gunned down outside a Tulsa country club
because he suspected Bulger's gang was skimming money from his
business.
</P>
<P>
   When Brian Halloran told the FBI that Bulger and Flemmi were
involved in Wheeler's slaying, Bulger gunned down Halloran outside
a Boston restaurant in May 1982, also killing bystander Michael
Donahue, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Bulger and Flemmi allegedly hired Martorano to
kill John Callahan, a former Jai Alai executive, in Florida because
they feared he'd cooperate with investigators, the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims of Bulger and Flemmi include James Sousa, who was
involved in a botched robbery attempt and killed in 1974, and
Edward Connors of Dorchester, who reportedly had information on the
murder of James O'Toole, who was killed by Bulger in 1973. Bulger
is also charged with killing Francis ``Buddy'' Leonard, a close
friend of King in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Thomas Butters, who represents O'Neil said, ``Kevin
O'Neil is not alleged to be involved in any murders, which is what
we've been saying all along, and he's not charged with anything
additional.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prosecutors dropped a charge that alleged O'Neil
participated with Bulger and Flemmi in extorting a South Boston
liquor store from Stephen and Julie Rakes in 1984. Bulger and
Flemmi are charged with that extortion.

RAHAL COULD LEAD AMERICAN REVOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when only Michael Andretti and Jimmy Vasser have
full-time rides in CART, is it any wonder there are no American
drivers competing in Formula One?
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, does Bernie Ecclestone's ``Flying Circus''
actually need an All-American boy to ensure F1's continued success
at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway?
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the enthusiastic, record-setting crowd that attended
the inaugural SAP United States Grand Prix on Sunday, the answer to
the latter is a resounding no. Drivers at both ends of the grid _
from double world champions Michael Schumacher of Germany and Mika
Hakkinen of Finland to backmarkers Pedro de la Rosa of Spain and
Gaston Mazzacane of Argentina _ seemed genuinely stunned by their
receptions in Indy, home to American oval-track racing and its
larger-than-anything heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lack of an American driver in F1 was a topic that
took on a life of its own at the Speedway. Michael Andretti's
aborted 1993 season with Team McLaren remains the last shot given
an American. Andretti blew it, but there were extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that Andretti was teamed with Brazil's Ayrton Senna, a
three-time world champion and arguably the best F1 driver ever.
Suffice it to say that team orders were not going to be an issue
for Ron Dennis, McLaren's team principal.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many seasoned F1 observers still maintain that Andretti's
refusal to move from Nazareth, Pa., to England was a mistake, one
that effectively cast him as a rent-a-driver in the eyes of the men
who regularly toiled over their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis said Mikey's biggest fault simply may have been lousy
timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no driver that's going to climb into F1 and be an
immediate success story,'' Dennis said. ``When Michael came to our
team, it was at a time when we had the most sophisticated Formula
One car ever made. We were reprogramming the suspension several
times in every corner, an extremely complex process to optimize the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to learn the circuits, learn to drive the car, and in
the end it was quite a handful for him. And it was, indeed, very
difficult for him to come to terms with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Time has taken the sting out of Andretti's failure to emulate
father Mario, the 1978 F1 world driving champion. And events of the
last week indicate that Europe's freeze on even considering
Americans is beginning to thaw.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's decision to hire Bobby Rahal, the Championship Auto
Racing Teams' interim president and chief executive officer, to
lead the company's Jaguar Racing program for the next three years
looms as a potentially huge break for an American aspiring to get
noticed by F1's powerbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, I'd like to see an American driver make it in the
big-time,'' said Neil Ressler, chairman and current CEO of Jaguar
Racing, and like Rahal, a native of Ohio. ``I think in the
foreseeable future that will require that that American driver go
compete in Europe. That's the competition, those are the venues
that produce world champion drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ressler noted that Jag Racing includes a Formula Three team,
with two empty seats for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we develop our Formula Three program, we'll give Americans
_ maybe even this year _ a crack at it to see whether they can get
started,'' Ressler said. ``I've asked Bobby to think about whether
we would want to test an American driver among the collection.
We're going to try to hold a seat, at least one seat, in the open
test. If an American comes in and is best, he gets the drive.
That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ressler warned, however, that the journey into F1 for any
American likely will take two years. Five years might prove to be
more realistic. Whatever, some current F1 stars are curious to see
how it all turns out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's different,'' said Hakkinen, referring to the
Andretti episode. ``And if one driver makes a mistake, you don't
want to say every driver makes a mistake. But American drivers ...
they need to change their way of life, the mentality, the
preparation to be in grand prix racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Irishman Eddie Irvine, lead driver at Jaguar, said it is easy
for talented Americans to race and live quite comfortably in the
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is big enough to be its own self-contained thing,''
Irvine said. ``But whatever way the sport is organized here, they
ain't coming up through. There's got to be good guys here.
Americans are good at every sport there is, so there must be good
drivers here, as well.''
SPOTLIGHT ON...
Labonte rolling toward Cup title
With a minimum of fuss, native Texan Bobby Labonte is barreling
toward his first NASCAR Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   His fifth-place finish in Dover, Del., on Sunday allowed Labonte
to open a 249-point lead over seven-time Cup champion Dale
Earnhardt with seven races remaining. Labonte, younger brother of
two-time Cup champion Terry Labonte, took over the top spot with a
second-place finish at the California Speedway on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has posted an amazing 15 top-five and 19 top-10 finishes
in 27 starts in the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix.
If Labonte finishes sixth or better in each of the remaining races,
he will clinch the championship regardless of any other driver's
performance. Five of the remaining seven events will be contested
on tracks visited earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Those venues, with Labonte's finish first time around:
Martinsville Speedway, 12th; Lowe's Motor Speedway, second;
Talladega Superspeedway, 21st; North Carolina Speedway, first;
Atlanta Motor Speedway, second.
</P>
<P>
   True to his roots, Labonte said the toughest thing he has had to
deal with lately are the never-ending questions about this title
quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, I haven't really seen a whole lot different,
to be honest with you,'' said Labonte, who drives for car owner Joe
Gibbs. ``It's just what you want to make out of it. I haven't made
anything out of it, other than that it's a whole lot better leading
than it is running second because it's more exciting. You're
focused more on one thing than on other things maybe. Trying to
play catch-up, you've got to think of a lot of things as you're
trying to proceed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me personally. Not everybody has the same comment. But
this is a lot more fun. I've enjoyed it. I don't think it's been
any big deal. Not saying it won't change because it probably will.
But so far I can't say that I've seen anything that's been harder,
been more difficult or been frustrating or challenging or anything.
It's been focus, focus, focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said he likes the mindset of this team, in that it is
being rewarded for its hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the last two years it's pretty much been the
same,'' said Gibbs, recalling that Labonte finished second to
reigning champion Dale Jarrett by 201 points in 1999. ``We realize
that you only get opportunities like this every now and then. You
only get a driver that is at his peak for so many years, and the
team and everything to go around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it started last year. That was the first time we could
seriously say that we raced for a championship. We could win races
and everything, but to seriously be a championship contender _ that
came last year. We always look at each week saying, `Is there
something we can do to improve the team? Is there anybody we can
add? Is there any way we can make ourselves a better race team?'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been going on for the last two years.''
PIT STOPS CART invades Houston The most closely contested driver's
title chase in the 22-year history of the Championship Auto Racing
Teams is scheduled to resume on the streets of Houston this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 points separate leader Gil de Ferran from sixth-place
Kenny Brack after 17 events heading to the 1.527-mile temporary
street circuit set up for the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of
Houston. A maximum of 66 points are available in the remaining
three events in Houston, Australia and at Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tracy, the defending race champion, is fourth overall with
122 points, 15 behind De Ferran. With 20 points available for a
victory, Tracy could take the lead with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Franchitti, Tracy's teammate, won the inaugural Houston
race in 1998. Tracy led 85 of 100 laps last year to continue the
domination for Team KOOL Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineers have hit on a setup for the street circuits, and
we've won Houston two years in a row,'' said Tracy, a three-time
winner this season. ``I intend to do everything I can to make it
three.'' Ray staying put Plano's Greg Ray says some driving
opportunities outside the Indy Racing Northern Light Series have
crossed his path lately. But Ray is planning to return to Team
Menard in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm signed and ready to go,'' said Ray, the 1999 series
champion who failed to duplicate his dominating form this year.
``There's still a lot of interesting opportunities that are arising
late in the season, and I don't think you never say never. But I
would say my plans are pretty well focused on staying with Menard
for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray is in the second year of a five-year contract with
Wisconsin-based businessman John Menard, with each subsequent year
an option. The team suffered a shake-up when Thomas Knapp, Ray's
longtime friend and Menard's team manager, left the organization in

 PONTIAC, Mich.: and reform. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The change is particularly noticeable here in the belt of
suburbs, exurbs and edge cities north of Detroit. Macomb County is
no longer dominated by the party-switching Democrats who helped
Ronald Reagan win a majority of the union vote in 1984, and Oakland
County, the state's second largest, after Wayne (Detroit), is no
longer as automatically Republican as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fate in Michigan may well depend on how he does in Macomb
and Oakland, both of which were carried by his father in 1988 and
1992. Former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas lost both, and Michigan, four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sander Levin, a Democrat whose district includes parts of
both counties, said he thought that Gore had ``managed to hack his
way through most of the thicket of negative Clinton associations,
like Monica and Whitewater, which has allowed prosperity to pop
through as the leading issue.'' In his area, he said, ``virtually
everything has gotten better for most people, though not everyone,
over the last eight years, from better schools to better race
relations to considerably better pay and conditions on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Levin said, only 10 percent of the
children in Macomb County went to college, and their parents felt
left out of the American success story. Now, more than half get
degrees, he said, and their parents ``have joined the rest of us in
the scramble of middle-income life.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. William G. Milliken, a moderate Republican, said he
thought that despite Bush's promise of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' Bush was having trouble fitting into the pattern of
economic conservatism and moderation on social issues that seems to
succeed best in the suburbs. Specifically, Milliken mentioned as
problems Bush's opposition to campaign finance reform, as espoused
by McCain, and his steadfast opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Engler ran Bush's campaign against McCain, promising to erect a
firewall against the insurgent. He and the wall were torched. Now
he is once again at the helm, with assistance from Warren K.
Erdman, a former aide to Sen. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, who
was sent into the state when Bush began slipping. But this time,
Engler's profile is lower.
</P>
<P>
   Rohde of Michigan State said the best the governor could do for
Bush in any event was ``some small influence on the Republican
turnout, roughly equal to the impact of the labor unions on the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush has promised larger public roles for, and better
coordination with, Republican governors in two neighboring Midwest
states _ Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and Bob Taft of Ohio. But
so far at least, there has been no evidence that he is planning to
push Engler out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush doesn't want to turn this into another referendum
on a controversial governor,'' said Ballenger, the newsletter
publisher, ``and pull the independents out to cast protest votes
for Al Gore in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, a ballot proposal that would legalize the use of state
funds for private and parochial schools through a system of
vouchers has complicated the Michigan situation for the national
Republican ticket. Engler opposes vouchers, which has split
Republican ranks wide open; Elisabeth DeVos, who strongly supports
them, resigned as the state party chairman in order to back the
campaign for the ballot initiative, which is known as Proposal 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll shows 2-1 backing for vouchers. Private
schools were explicitly prohibited from using them in a 1970
amendment to the state constitution. Television campaigns, pro and
con, are just beginning, but the Roman Catholic church, under
Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit, is said to have set aside $1.5
million to support the proposal. Hundreds of thousands of yard
signs have already been ordered by opponents of the proposal, so it
seems inevitable that the issue will soon loom large in voters'
minds.
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Cheney did not even mention the subject in a speech in
nearby Troy on Wednesday, and Bush, an eager advocate of vouchers,
was not expected to use the ``v-word'' here either.

 &HT;    FOR NBC'S ``WEST WING,'' ART ISN'T FAR FROM REALITY
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (e)
entertainment categories
 &HT;    Advance for release Sunday, Oct. 1
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He's one of the best known media figures in the
nation, but that didn't cut any ice with a local judge when Joe
Lockhart showed up for jury duty earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Learning that the case would likely last three months, the
normally unflappable Lockhart struggled for a tactful way to say
that he couldn't take that much time away from his job as White
House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a lawyer in the case approached the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge, he's C.J.,'' the attorney explained, as the judge
suddenly nodded knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, 'Oh, I get it,''' Lockhart recalled, explaining how
the mere mention of C.J. Cregg, the fictional White House press
secretary in the popular television series ``West Wing,'' cleared
up matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got me off the hook,'' shrugged Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In a company town whose business is politics, it's often hard to
tell where real life ends and theater begins.
</P>
<P>
   The line has become even more blurred for White House staffers,
though, in the year since NBC's ``West Wing'' took the airwaves by
storm, popularizing a bevy of fictional characters whose real-life
counterparts find much to admire, and even envy, about the
television versions of their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a much harder job,'' Lockhart, a former television
news producer, joked in a comparison to actress Allison Janney, who
plays Cregg in the ``West Wing'' cast. ``I can't believe she got
the Emmy.''
</P>
<P>
   Janney's Emmy for best supporting actress in a television drama
series was one of nine of the coveted awards ``West Wing'' won
Sept. 10 for its debut season last year.
</P>
<P>
   Its special two-hour season premiere airs Wednesday night. It
picks up on an episode that closed last season amid the terrifying
mayhem of an attack on the presidential entourage by skinheads with
pistols.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional assault takes place as ``West Wing'' President
Josiah Bartlet exits a town hall-style meeting with college
students at the Newseum in Rosslyn, Va., just across the Potomac
River from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will learn Wednesday night the answer to the question
left hanging in the season finale _ who got shot, a matter of
widespread speculation in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Toby,'' suggested one White House staffer, speaking on
the kind of background basis ordinarily reserved for inside gossip
on the status of high-stakes congressional battles, senior staff
changes or forward-leaning news on President Clinton's future
travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Richard Schiff received an Emmy nominated for his
portrayal of Toby Ziegler, the bleary-eyed but brilliant
communications director on the ``West Wing'' staff.
</P>
<P>
   The real life White House communications director, Loretta
Ucelli, cut the striking figure of a starlet the other day,
standing quietly in the shadows as her boss, President Clinton,
faced the cameras in an auditorium in the Old Executive Office
Building, where the bulk of the White House senior staff actually
works.
</P>
<P>
   Polite yet professional, Ucelli is a far cry from the
perpetually rumpled and easily agitated Ziegler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some similarities,'' though, she said. ``We're both
big Yankee fans.''
</P>
<P>
   White House staffers generally describe Ucelli's job as less
knee-jerk political than Zeigler's character. But again, Ucelli
finds much in common with her television counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy who has to step back a bit and take a look at an
issue that's coming down the pike, and that's similar for me,''
Ucelli said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the fast and often unpredictable pace of White
House life reflected in ``West Wing'' strikes too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president just walked in,'' real life White House
speechwriter Josh Gottheimer also likened by some to Zeigler's
character interjects during a quick phone interview. ``Can I call
you back?''
</P>
<P>
   The star of ``West Wing,'' veteran actor Martin Sheen, plays
Bartlet, a New Hampshire Democrat descended from a signer of the
Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, funny and decisive, Bartlet's character has much in
common with the real thing _ President Clinton _ but Sheen has said
he's modeled the role more after former President Jimmy Carter, a
move reflected in the lofty moral posture Bartlet often assumes on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlet's close, almost fatherly relationship with his personal
aide, Charlie Young, played by the actor Dule Hill, is largely on
target, said Kris Engskov, who spent seven years as a White House
assistant, including two and a half as Clinton's personal aide.
</P>
<P>
   Around a year ago, in fact, Hill and Engskov met over a brunch
arranged by Dee Dee Myers, Clinton's one-time press secretary and
now a consultant to ``West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a lot about the job and how a young person in that
job would operate around some of the people I had to operate
around,'' said Engskov, who left the White House last summer to
work for a venture capital company in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a lot of thought into the role,'' said Engskov. ``He's
kind of fascinated by the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, in fact, Hill arranged with his current White
House counterpart, presidential aide Doug Band, for an insider's
tour of Air Force One, while Clinton was in Los Angeles for some
political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy,'' Hill told reporters after touring the world's
most famous plane, sitting in the president's chair and copping a
small signature box of M&AMP;Ms given out aboard the presidential
aircraft. ``I can't believe I was actually on the real Air Force
One.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hill's character appears to have been closely modeled on
Engskov, there is one striking difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dates the president's daughter on the show. I always
thought that was a bad idea, partly for job security reasons,''
said Engskov, whose cool blue eyes and boyish good looks helped
endear him to some members of the White House staff, though he
regarded First Daughter Chelsea as strictly off limits.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Staff John Podesta has much in common with his ``West
Wing'' counterpart, Leo McGarry, played by actor John Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the television Chief of Staff, Podesta is a close
political confidant to Clinton and is the man in charge of keeping
the real West Wing characters in some semblance of orbit, while
keeping the president in touch with the pulse of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The template, though, only goes so far.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer plays a straight-talking, combat-hardened manager who is
fiercely loyal to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta has a no-nonsense side to him _ he's even given his
split personality a name, his ``evil twin, Skippy'' _ and he's not
afraid to take his tough side public, as he did two weeks ago in
threatening Japan with sanctions for its seasonal whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta favors, though, a more playful air and a mischievous
sense of humor, taking particular delight in lampooning his
Republican foes.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, for instance, Chief of Staff Podesta led his
office team for a three-mile morning road race near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Team Podesta was ready to suit up in T-shirts that had the words
``The Lame Ducks'' air-brushed across the back. The day before the
race, though, The New York Times broke the story about the
subliminal message _ ``Rats'' _ flashing ominously across the
screen of a campaign ad by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the moment, Podesta pulled his joggers' uniforms and
sent them back to the shop, where a skillful artisan sprayed a line
through ``The Lame Ducks'' and wrote underneath, ``The Rat Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``West Wing'' characters lack a precise White House
analog.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Bradley Whiteford, for example, plays the ruthlessly
calculating political tactician Josh Lyman, youthful deputy chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Podesta has two deputies _ Maria Echaveste and
Stephen Ricchetti _ both of whom spend more time on policy missions
than pouncing at the political jugular.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``West Wing'' characters are something like hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Rob Lowe, for instance, plays deputy communications
director Sam Seaborn.
</P>
<P>
   His character is likened by many White House staffers to two
people.
</P>
<P>
   One is former political strategist Doug Sosnik, a diminutive
senior aide who stuck so close to Clinton over the course of his
impeachment travails that the White House press corps nicknamed him
``Mini Me''. The other is Sidney Blumenthal, the elegant confidant
of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton who has played a key role in
helping to manage the White House image and message machinery that
seeks to cast the Clintons in the best possible public light.
</P>
<P>
   White House staffers tend to watch ``West Wing'' when they're in
town and able to get home by its 9 p.m. air time _ which isn't
often for many of them. And, not surprisingly, they generally
approve of the favorable light in which their characters are cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had made C.J. a clown, people would think I'm a
clown,'' said Lockhart. ``But she's smart, she's plugged in and she
tries to get it right, and, what's the most realistic thing, she
doesn't always get it right, because that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart concedes, though, that issues seldom get worked out
with the dispatch portrayed on the television show. Few viewers
would tune in, he said, if the script mimicked reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot slower and a lot uglier,'' in the White House, he
said. ``And I mean that literally and figuratively. The people are
a lot slower and a lot uglier.''
</P>
<P>
   What White House staffers like most about ``West Wing'' is the
positive image it portrays of public servants in earnest pursuit of
the public good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really as glamorous as the TV show, but we like
working here because we feel that there is generally a sense of
purpose to the place,'' said Lockhart's deputy, Jake Siewert, who
stages his own debut this week as Clinton's press secretary,
replacing Lockhart, who left the White House on Friday to look for
work in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert rises to stretch his lanky frame as much as possible in
the closet-like hovel that deputy White House spokesmen use as an
office behind the press briefing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offices are a lot nicer,'' Siewert said of the ``West
Wing'' set.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Buddy, the president's three-year-old chocolate
Labrador Retriever, wandered down to Siewert's office and scrounged
outside his office door, much like reporters often do, in search of
scraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't have a dog,'' Jake said, pausing for a moment's
reflection. ``They should have a dog. It could make a good plot.''

move reflected in the lofty moral posture Bartlet often assumes on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlet's close, almost fatherly relationship with his personal
aide, Charlie Young, played by the actor Dule Hill, is largely on
target, said Kris Engskov, who spent seven years as a White House
assistant, including two and a half as Clinton's personal aide.
</P>
<P>
   Around a year ago, in fact, Hill and Engskov met over a brunch
arranged by Dee Dee Myers, Clinton's one-time press secretary and
now a consultant to ``West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a lot about the job and how a young person in that
job would operate around some of the people I had to operate
around,'' said Engskov, who left the White House last summer to
work for a venture capital company in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a lot of thought into the role,'' said Engskov. ``He's
kind of fascinated by the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, in fact, Hill arranged with his current White
House counterpart, presidential aide Doug Band, for an insider's
tour of Air Force One, while Clinton was in Los Angeles for some
political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy,'' Hill told reporters after touring the world's
most famous plane, sitting in the president's chair and copping a
small signature box of M&AMP;Ms given out aboard the presidential
aircraft. ``I can't believe I was actually on the real Air Force
One.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hill's character appears to have been closely modeled on
Engskov, there is one striking difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dates the president's daughter on the show. I always
thought that was a bad idea, partly for job security reasons,''
said Engskov, whose cool blue eyes and boyish good looks helped
endear him to some members of the White House staff, though he
regarded First Daughter Chelsea as strictly off limits.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Staff John Podesta has much in common with his ``West
Wing'' counterpart, Leo McGarry, played by actor John Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the television Chief of Staff, Podesta is a close
political confidant to Clinton and is the man in charge of keeping
the real West Wing characters in some semblance of orbit, while
keeping the president in touch with the pulse of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The template, though, only goes so far.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer plays a straight-talking, combat-hardened manager who is
fiercely loyal to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta has a no-nonsense side to him _ he's even given his
split personality a name, his ``evil twin, Skippy'' _ and he's not
afraid to take his tough side public, as he did two weeks ago in
threatening Japan with sanctions for its seasonal whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta favors, though, a more playful air and a mischievous
sense of humor, taking particular delight in lampooning his
Republican foes.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, for instance, Chief of Staff Podesta led his
office team for a three-mile morning road race near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Team Podesta was ready to suit up in T-shirts that had the words
``The Lame Ducks'' air-brushed across the back. The day before the
race, though, The New York Times broke the story about the
subliminal message _ ``Rats'' _ flashing ominously across the
screen of a campaign ad by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the moment, Podesta pulled his joggers' uniforms and
sent them back to the shop, where a skillful artisan sprayed a line
through ``The Lame Ducks'' and wrote underneath, ``The Rat Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``West Wing'' characters lack a precise White House
analog.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Bradley Whiteford, for example, plays the ruthlessly
calculating political tactician Josh Lyman, youthful deputy chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Podesta has two deputies _ Maria Echaveste and
Stephen Ricchetti _ both of whom spend more time on policy missions
than pouncing at the political jugular.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``West Wing'' characters are something like hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Rob Lowe, for instance, plays deputy communications
director Sam Seaborn.
</P>
<P>
   His character is likened by many White House staffers to two
people.
</P>
<P>
   One is former political strategist Doug Sosnik, a diminutive
senior aide who stuck so close to Clinton over the course of his
impeachment travails that the White House press corps nicknamed him
``Mini Me''. The other is Sidney Blumenthal, the elegant confidant
of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton who has played a key role in
helping to manage the White House image and message machinery that
seeks to cast the Clintons in the best possible public light.
</P>
<P>
   White House staffers tend to watch ``West Wing'' when they're in
town and able to get home by its 9 p.m. air time _ which isn't
often for many of them. And, not surprisingly, they generally
approve of the favorable light in which their characters are cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had made C.J. a clown, people would think I'm a
clown,'' said Lockhart. ``But she's smart, she's plugged in and she
tries to get it right, and, what's the most realistic thing, she
doesn't always get it right, because that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart concedes, though, that issues seldom get worked out
with the dispatch portrayed on the television show. Few viewers
would tune in, he said, if the script mimicked reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot slower and a lot uglier,'' in the White House, he
said. ``And I mean that literally and figuratively. The people are
a lot slower and a lot uglier.''
</P>
<P>
   What White House staffers like most about ``West Wing'' is the
positive image it portrays of public servants in earnest pursuit of
the public good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really as glamorous as the TV show, but we like
working here because we feel that there is generally a sense of
purpose to the place,'' said Lockhart's deputy, Jake Siewert, who
stages his own debut this week as Clinton's press secretary,
replacing Lockhart, who left the White House on Friday to look for
work in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert rises to stretch his lanky frame as much as possible in
the closet-like hovel that deputy White House spokesmen use as an
office behind the press briefing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offices are a lot nicer,'' Siewert said of the ``West
Wing'' set.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Buddy, the president's three-year-old chocolate
Labrador Retriever, wandered down to Siewert's office and scrounged
outside his office door, much like reporters often do, in search of
scraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't have a dog,'' Jake said, pausing for a moment's
reflection. ``They should have a dog. It could make a good plot.''

ISRAELI'S VISIT TO TEMPLE MOUNT SETS OFF CLASHES IN JERUSALEM AND
WEST BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Tightly guarded by an Israeli security cordon, Ariel
Sharon, the right-wing Israeli opposition leader, led a group of
Israeli legislators onto the bitterly contested Temple Mount on
Thursday to assert Jewish claims there, setting off a
stone-throwing clash that left several Palestinians and more than
two dozen policemen injured.
</P>
<P>
   The violence spread later to the streets of East Jerusalem and
to the West Bank town of Ramallah, where six Palestinians were
reportedly hurt as Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets and
protesters hurled rocks and firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought a message of peace,'' Sharon said after a one-hour
tour that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, condemned as a
``dangerous action'' against Muslim holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, known to Muslims as Haram al Sharif, or the Noble
Sanctuary, contains Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, sacred
shrines of Islam. It is revered by Jews as the site of the First
and Second Temples as well as the place where Abraham was prepared
to sacrifice his son, Isaac. A dispute about sovereignty over the
area, in Jerusalem's walled Old City, has created an impasse in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Jews and Arabs can live together,'' Sharon
declared as stones and rubber-coated bullets flew at the holy site.
``It was no provocation whatsoever,'' he said of his visit. ``It's
our right. Arabs have the right to visit everywhere in the Land of
Israel, and Jews have the right to visit every place in the Land of
Israel.'' Injured Palestinians and police officers were carried off
on stretchers minutes after the visit ended.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Israelis can visit the Temple Mount like any other
tourists, although most Orthodox rabbis have forbidden Jews to
enter because of the area's special sanctity under Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon, who has a provocative reputation among Palestinians,
is no ordinary Israeli. Among other things, he owns a home in a
Muslim neighborhood of the Old City. The house, which flies an
Israeli flag, has occasionally been a focus of confrontation
between Palestinians and police officers guarding it.
</P>
<P>
   While Sharon used his visit to criticize what he called
concessions on Jerusalem by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the tour
seemed no less an attempt to upstage Benjamin Netanyahu, the former
prime minister who could challenge Sharon in coming primaries for
the leadership of the Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu returned to Israel on Thursday from the United States
after Israel's attorney general announced on Wednesday that there
was insufficent evidence to prosecute him on corruption charges,
clearing the way for a possible political comeback. However, Sharon
asserted on Thursday that he would remain party leader, and that he
had asked Netanyahu to join him in efforts to topple Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's tour was meant to assert Israeli sovereignty over the
Temple Mount, but the vast security operation organized for the
visit suggested that he had anything but free access to the
compound, which is effectively run by Islamic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon entered as a police helicopter clattered overheard and a
thousand armed policemen were positioned in and around the Temple
Mount, including antiterror squads and ranks of riot officers
carrying clubs, helmets and plastic shields. Throughout the tour,
Sharon was ringed tightly by agents of the Shin Bet security
service.
</P>
<P>
   Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, said
that the extraordinary police deployment belied Israeli claims of
sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which was captured along with
the rest of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. ``Israel
has no sovereignty here,'' Husseini said. ``They have military
might, they have the power of occupation, but not sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon went into the compound through a gate used by tourists
above the Western Wall, a remnant of a wall that surrounded the
ancient temple plaza. His head was barely visible in the crush of
security men and police officers around him. Inside, police
officers kept Palestinians behind barriers as Sharon and his
entourage walked around, pausing to listen to explanations by an
Israeli archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   Scuffles broke out when a few hundred Palestinian youths
shouting ``God is great!'' and ``With soul and blood we will redeem
you, Al Aksa!'' surged against police lines in an attempt to reach
Sharon. Palestinian officials and Israeli Arab lawmakers who were
in the crowd said that they were pushed and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharon left, dozens of youths hurled stones, chairs and metal
objects at the police, who responded with rubber-coated bullets and
riot sticks. At least four Palestinians were later reported to have
been treated for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon was trailed by Israeli Arab legislators who shouted
``Murderer, get out!'' and ``Al Aksa is Palestinian!'' Palestinians
remember Sharon as the architect of Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon, during which Christian militiamen allied with Israel
massacred hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee
centers in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man of blood,'' said Ahmad Tibi, one of the Israeli
Arab lawmakers. ``His history says that he is not interested in
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The clashes at the Temple Mount spilled outside the Old City
walls to Salah a-Din Street, the main shopping thouroughfare of
East Jerusalem, where youths hurled stones at police and Israeli
vehicles, lightly injuring a bus passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's visit was ``a direct attempt to derail the peace
process and an attempt to inflame the whole region,'' Husseini
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peace efforts were further shadowed by an overnight bombing in
the Gaza Strip that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded another.
Two roadside charges were detonated near an army-escorted convoy of
cars heading for the Israeli settlement of Netzarim.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unrest and injuries in Jerusalem, Sharon said, his
visit had been worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry about the casualties, and I wish the wounded a
speedy recovery, but a Jew in Israel has the right to visit the
Temple Mount,'' he said. ``The Temple Mount is still in our
hands.''

U.S. INDICTS FOR MURDERS A MOBSTER IT PROTECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment Thursday
charging Boston's most infamous, and elusive, mobster and his
longtime associate with involvement in the deaths of 21 people
between them _ from rivals to strangers in the wrong place at the
wrong time to their own girlfriends _ in ``a reign of intimidation
and murder that spanned some 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, said U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern, the main
defendant, James ``Whitey'' Bulger, had never been charged with
murder, though he was indicted on racketeering charges in 1995. But
in the course of a long and complex investigation, Stern said,
``Layer upon layer of myth, fear and protection have been stripped
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that protection came from the FBI. Bulger, 71, and his
longtime associate, Stephen J. Flemmi, 66, were ``top-echelon
informants'' from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s, the agency
has acknowledged, and helped vanquish the local arm of La Cosa
Nostra. Also charged in the indictment is Kevin P. O'Neil, another
associate of Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, prosecutors now say, was that while the FBI was
protecting Bulger, Flemmi and their Irish-dominated mob from other
law enforcement agencies to keep their information coming, the two
men were committing crimes as frightening as anything their Italian
rivals might have contemplated. The case has raised serious
questions about the often-murky relationships between law
enforcement officials and criminal informers.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is in prison awaiting trial since 1995 on racketeering
charges. The relationship between Flemmi, Bulger and the FBI
emerged in Flemmi's pre-trial motions, because he has argued that
the FBI promised him and Bulger immunity for any crimes short of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger has been on the run since 1995, and is considered one of
the most wanted men in America, with $250,000 offered for his
capture. The authorities say he may be using the name of Mark
Shapeton. He is believed to be traveling with his girlfriend,
Catherine Greig, who was reportedly seen in January in Fountain
Valley, Calif., having her hair done.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A bit more than a year ago, the outlook for prosecutors appeared
bleak, and critics said they might not be able to make their case
against Flemmi and Bulger stand up. But Stern said Thursday that
they had made great progress, in particular by making deals with
associates of Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, at least two associates, John Martorano, a
confessed hit man, and Kevin Weeks, who has been described as
Bulger's top lieutenant, have been given deals for crimes of their
own in exchange for information. With it, the authorities unearthed
five bodies of victims that they are now charging Bulger and Flemmi
with murdering. Thursday, excavation was still under way as
authorities searched for a body in the Boston suburb of Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's indictment charged Bulger and Flemmi with committing
a pattern of violence meant to protect their criminal dealings.
Their crimes ranged, prosecutors said, from murdering potential
witnesses against them to corrupting law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says that the two killed their girlfriends
because they thought their knowledge posed a threat; other victims
were killed, the indictment charges, to gain control of their
business, to eliminate rivals, and, in one case, out of revenge for
losing a fight. It also accuses them of drug-trafficking,
extortion, money laundering and more.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said Thursday that the crimes in the indictment were not
eligible for the death penalty in Massachusetts and the federal
system, but that prosecutors would seek life in prison for both
men.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth J. Fishman, Flemmi's lawyer, said he could not comment
because he had not yet discussed the indictment with his client.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more damaging accusations surface about Bulger,
officials acknowledge that the FBI's protection of him looks worse
and worse. The case had already prompted sweeping internal
investigations of the bureau's Boston branch and a months-long
policy review by the Justice Department, which has moved to tighten
its rules for handling such informers.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, prosecutors also indicted a retired FBI agent,
John J. Connolly Jr., accusing him of racketeering and, in
particular, of warning Bulger of his impending arrest in time for
him to escape.

MILOSEVIC'S OPPONENTS, CLAIMING VICTORY AT POLLS, WILL PRESS HIM TO
LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Serbia's democratic opposition thinks
that it has a president in Vojislav Kostunica. But it also has a
problem: how to get the incumbent, President Slobodan Milosevic,
out of power.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is more than technical. Milosevic shows no signs of
wanting to go.
</P>
<P>
   So Kostunica and the leaders of 18 parties that support him
decided Thursday night to call a rally for 2 p.m. Friday in
Belgrade's Square of the Republic, where they will ask the people
of Serbia to perform ``any act of civil disobedience they have at
their disposal'' until Milosevic leaves office, Zarko Korac, a
party leader, said after Kostunica and the opposition met Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Talking of rolling strikes, the closing of roads, cinemas,
theaters, shops and schools, Korac said: ``We know it's a high-risk
game, but we know we have no alternative. Through the rigging of
votes, Milosevic is clearly challenging us, and since we are being
pushed into the street, we must accept it. It is Milosevic who has
declared war. We'll start tomorrow and see how we end up and how
far we have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to some 3,000 people who had gathered spontaneously in
the square Thursday night, Zoran Djindjic and other opposition
party leaders said they would start at 2 p.m. and remain in the
square until Milosevic leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years, we have to show that we are ready to defend
our will and overthrow one regime,'' Djindjic said. Another party
official, Slobodan Orlic, said: ``See you tomorrow at 1400. He can
do nothing to us. He is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is hoping that his special police, which he has built
up and paid well at the expense of the army, will stand by him in
the face of what could be widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's Federal Election Commission, in an announcement
early Thursday morning, confirmed its preliminary results and
declared that Kostunica, while running 10 percentage points ahead
of Milosevic, had failed to win more than 50 percent of the votes
in Sunday's elections, meaning he and Milosevic would have to face
each other in a runoff on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica and the democratic opposition, backed by the United
States and the European Union, have cried fraud, and say that their
count shows clearly that he won more than 52 percent of the vote
and that there is no need for a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has ruled out a second round, saying that to
participate would be to accept electoral fraud and betray the votes
of the people. ``If we bargained, then we would acknowledge a lie
instead of the truth,'' he told a huge rally of more than 200,000
people in downtown Belgrade on Wednesday night. ``If we bargained,
we would admit that one man's will is greater than the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to boycott has given Milosevic an opportunity.
On Thursday, he met the main officials of his Socialist Party and
those of his allies, and announced that he would run in a second
round _ displaying himself on television for the first time since
Sunday's vote. And if Kostunica does not run, Milosevic may win by
default _ unless the opposition can force him to recognize his
defeat in the meantime, through legal efforts in dubious courts or
through popular pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is clearly buying time. He is hoping to hold his
party, his coalition and his security forces together, while
dividing the opposition _ and the outside world _ with the idea
that a second round is hardly undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   But Kostunica and other opposition leaders believe that a second
round would be a trap, and that Milosevic would have more time to
prepare an enormous vote fraud or to find a pretext to cancel or
annul a second round, and thus remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not going to recognize the true results from the first
round and leave office, why should he recognize the results from
round two?'' an opposition leader asked.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked in an interview on Wednesday whether he saw risks in his
boycott strategy and might allow Milosevic to remain in power,
Kostunica shrugged. ``I won't exclude that risk,'' he said. ``But
risk is all round us. Living in a country with Slobodan Milosevic
is risky. But he is buying time, and this is something that cannot
last long. People know I won these elections, and why should I
betray them?''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica found moral support Thursday from the Serbian Orthodox
Church, which recognized his election victory and addressed him as
``president elect.'' And the leader of the Radical Party, Vojislav
Kostunica, until recently a Milosevic ally, also congratulated
Kostunica on his election, called for a reshuffle of the Serbian
government and the firing of Milosevic's powerful interior
minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, the anti-Milosevic prime minister, Filip
Vujanovic, also recognized Kostunica as president.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leaders of the 18 parties met twice Thursday to
discuss strategy, with some leaders more radical than others. They
decided on following two tracks: first, a legal track, which
Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, insists upon, challenging the
findings of the Federal Election Commission in the courts. The
second track is people power _ popular pressure through a mixture
of rallies, strikes and other demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing except random gatherings Thursday, with a few
thousand people gathering in Belgrade and more substantial
spontaneous rallies in Novi Sad and Cacak. In Gornji Milanovac,
high school students went on strike, saying they would not return
to school until Milosevic left office. In Krusevac, which was a
Socialist town, the local television and radio started showing news
from independent Radio B2-92 and Radio Free Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are angry, but our dilemma is how to organize their
protests without burning people out,'' Korac said. He said leaders
were discussing a mix of protests, rallies, strikes and
encouragements to those allied to Milosevic to abandon a sinking
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has been reluctant to provide an early provocation to
the police, but he says he believes that in the end the police and
the army will not act against the will of the nation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A general strike in Serbia, suggested early this morning by
Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party, is problematic, given
the poverty of people and the high level of unemployment anyway.
But the opposition is discussing general strikes in one city at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its case before the courts and world opinion, the
opposition says it has clear evidence of fraud, including the
sudden disappearance from the rolls of 600,000 voters, the
inclusion of invalid ballots to lower Kostunica's percentages and
the counting of ballots from polling stations in Kosovo that
apparently never opened.
</P>
<P>
   To the opposition's outrage Thursday night, the election
commission declared that its work for the first round was done,
refused to hear opposition complaints and, in a final statement,
took away four seats from the opposition's totals in the lower
house of the federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition efforts to get large numbers of the permanent
government-appointed commissioners to resign apparently failed,
although there were reports that Bojan Pudar, the commission's vice
president, had quit.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said they thought that Milosevic would not
succeed in holding on to power and that his government was already
crumbling. But experts here noted that Milosevic appeared to
encounter no dissent at the meeting of his party's main board or a
second meeting of the leaders of his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, Milosevic can keep power only by killing Serbs,''
a diplomat said. ``But the police and the army know that people
voted for Kostunica, and many of them voted for him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Thursday urged Milosevic to honor the
results of the election. ``The people of Yugoslavia have spoken
loud and clear in support of democratic change,'' Clinton said in
Washington. ``It is time for Milosevic to heed the call of the Serb
people, step down, and allow a peaceful democratic transition to
take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the European Union, with France in its
revolving presidency, are pressing Russian President Vladimir Putin
to help make Milosevic yield. French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine was in Moscow on Thursday, and there were reports that the
Milosevic government sent copies of its electoral material to
Moscow _ where Milosevic's brother, Borislav, is the Yugoslav
ambassador _ to try to convince Putin that a second round is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians will evaluate the evidence, and the opposition
has the better evidence,'' a Western official said. ``No one has a
veto over the fact that change will come. There is an opportunity
for the Russians to help this along more quickly and easily and
leave fewer scars in Serbia, to be a player and help other Slavic
peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Moscow
``stands firmly for the peoples of Yugoslavia to have full freedom
to express their will without internal or external pressure'' and
urged other nations ``not to allow destabilization of the
situation.''

FDA DECISION ON ABORTION PILL OPENS A RIFT BETWEEN PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (with FDA-ABORTION-PILL) 
 By ROBIN TONER     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abortion rights supporters celebrated a long-sought
victory on Thursday, with the Food and Drug Administration's
approval of the abortion pill RU-486, but acknowledged that it
could be an exceedingly fragile one.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents denounced the administration and the agency
for pushing through a drug ``that will take lives instead of saving
them,'' as Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., put it. They vowed to keep
fighting, legislatively and politically.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed on one thing: the drug agency's ruling
highlights the stakes for November's election, with stark
differences between the two parties on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this is a sweet victory, it could be short-lived if we
elect an anti-choice president,'' said Kate Michelman, president of
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, which
has endorsed Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House Republican Conference and
an abortion opponent, declared in a statement that he was confident
that a new administration ``with moral leadership and a commitment
to the family will reverse this Clinton-Gore decision.'' He
asserted, ``Do-it-yourself abortion has no place in a civilized
society.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday, other
anti-abortion legislators, including Hutchinson, called for
committee hearings on what they described as the FDA's
``questionable approval process in regard to RU-486.'' Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., asserted that the FDA's decision ``was pushed by
politics and not by health,'' while Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.,
described the drug as ``baby poison.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years RU-486 has been a symbol of the differences
between the two parties on abortion _ President George Bush blocked
its importation; President Clinton lifted that ban just days after
taking office. The reaction from the presidential candidates on
Thursday, while brief and careful, highlighted those differences
anew.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush issued a statement declaring that he
believed the FDA's decision was `'wrong,'' and feared that it would
make abortions ``more and more common, rather than more and more
rare.'' He added, ``As president, I will work to build a culture
that respects life.'' Bush supports a ban on abortion except in
cases of rape, incest, or when the life of a woman is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   When asked specifically what Bush would do about the FDA action,
a spokesman, Scott McClellan, responded: ``It appears the president
does not have the authority to order drugs off the market. As
president, he would order a careful review to ensure that the FDA
considered all the risks and did not do this as a result of
political pressure from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore issued a statement declaring that he was
``pleased'' with the FDA's decision. ``Today's decision is not
about politics, but the health and safety of American women and a
woman's fundamental right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration, meanwhile, dismissed the notion that the FDA
acted because of political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   For all the political furor on Thursday, it was not clear how
much it would push the abortion issue into a campaign debate that,
until now, has been dominated by the concerns of moderate swing
voters, like health care, Medicare and education.
</P>
<P>
   But Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, argued that it could
make a difference with ``independent and Republican-leaning women
who are pro-choice,'' who ``might feel perfectly comfortable with
Bush on a whole host of other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that battle for the center, opponents of abortion
focused much of their fire on Thursday on the FDA's approval
process, the dangers they asserted the drug would present to women,
and the notion that it will increase the number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of RU-486 have long hoped that it would, eventually,
make abortion far more accessible, private and harder to target by
opponents. The struggles so long centered on the nation's abortion
clinics would, some of these advocates suggested, slowly fade as
the abortion pill took hold.
</P>
<P>
   David Garrow, a historian of the abortion rights movement and a
professor at Emory University, argued that while FDA's decision was
a victory for abortion rights, ``people in the past have perhaps
created an exaggerated climate of expectations for RU-486.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that many women may not want the multiple
doctor visits that RU-486 entails, and thus still choose surgical
abortions. Moreover, he added, many women may not discover their
pregnancy and decide to abort it early enough to use the abortion
pill.
</P>
<P>
   As for a waning of the political struggle, there were few signs
of that on Thursday, at least in the short term. Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., who has tried to block RU-486 in the past, declared that
Thursday's announcement was unprecedented: ``Never before has the
FDA approved a drug intended to kill people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, at a news conference of Democratic women from the
House, Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California declared of the FDA action,
``It's about time!'' and added that the decision ``has taken women
further away from the back alleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Hutchinson of Arkansas reflected, ``The idea that it so
normalizes the process that it's no longer a question, I don't
think that's going to happen. The human life issue is too important
to too many people; it's going to continue to be a divisive and
very front-burner issue.''

   &QR;  Debating the Web impact of `Big Brother'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HBO to get ant's-eye view of undiscovered films
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Trippy movie site a `Dream' in the making
</P>
<P>
   HITS &AMP; MISSES: Tonight's ``Big Brother'' finale could be one of
the Web's great events or a bust. It depends on whom you ask. ``I
think this show will be a benchmark for convergence,'' says Regina
Lewis, the show's on-the-air online adviser, referring to the
cross-pollination between the CBS show and America Online, the
Internet service provider that has carried the program's 24/7 Web
site. Adds David Card, an analyst with Internet research firm
Jupiter Communications: ``This is a show that is perfectly tuned to
the Internet. If you're really interested in watching those boring
guests, you can watch them all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   The stats: AOL and CBS won't project how many will watch the
finale on the Web, but Nielsen/NetRatings reports that the number
of unique visitors since the show's July 5 premiere topped 9.4
million through Wednesday. Other stats:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bigbrother2000.com was the top new site in July, with more
than 4.2 million visitors, reports Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Traffic dropped to 2.3 million in August.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visitors averaged 12 minutes at the site in August.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The unofficial site, www.bigbrotherblows.com, has had fewer
than 100,000 visitors each day, compared with 400,000 daily
visitors to the survivorsucks.com parody site.
</P>
<P>
   Euro versions: Paul Sims, who maintains the ``Brother'' parody
site, says the CBS-AOL experiment hasn't lived up to its potential
or the hype. ``This was a reality show that needs more reality in
terms of what they were showing on the Internet,'' Sims says. The
original Dutch and German versions had more access to the inner
workings of the housebound contestants, he says, adding, ``On the
American version, they quashed interactivity. They tried to be `Big
Brother' in the house and on the Net as well.''

   PEEKABOO: HBO has a new first-look deal with anteye.com that
allows the cable company exclusive access to the talent and
concepts that feed anteye's ``virtual studio engine.'' Anteye
harvests film and video material from undiscovered filmmakers.
Since launching in March, anteye has received more than 1,000
submissions. Says Chris Albrecht, president of HBO Original
Programming: ``HBO will now get the first look at some of the Web's
hottest filmmakers.''

   OUT OF SITE: Take a trip to the site for the upcoming movie
``Requiem for a Dream'' and you may wonder if you've stumbled into
Wonderland or Oz. This is not your usual movie promotional Web
site, but then ``Requiem'' director Darren Aronofsky isn't your
usual filmmaker. What's there: Mixes of movie scenes, excerpts from
the book and sound bites is an upbeat, somewhat confusing scene.
But when you try to interact, colors fade, error messages pop up
and you're directed into weird places. If you don't know any
better, you'll think there's something wrong with your computer.
The site, says Artisan, the movie's distributor, is meant to be an
extended mind trip that mirrors the characters' quest for happiness
and their ultimate disappointment.

 &HT;    Tackling HIV/AIDS' grip on black women
 &HT;    By Gracie Bonds Staples
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She struggles to put her fear into words, but Mardis
Andrews knows perhaps better than anyone what the AIDS epidemic
means to her and her children, an 11-year-old daughter and a baby
not yet born.
</P>
<P>
   Death and dying tumble up out of a familiar dark place as she
remembers the funerals of her only sister, Angela, and her
daughter's father, Tyrone Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone was the first to go, then Angela six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She takes a deep breath as if still in disbelief and confides
that in addition to the medicines she takes to fight off the AIDS
virus, she must take an additional pill for depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in a world different from everybody else,''
the 33-year-old Atlanta mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Mardis Andrews isn't. She has never been.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, 82 percent of women with AIDS are African-American,
just like her. And African-American children represent 62 percent
of all new HIV/AIDS cases in the United States, just like her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   CHILLING COMPARISON TO AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   But if these numbers are lost on Andrews, they weigh heavy on
the 3,300 representatives from HIV/AIDS advocacy groups and service
providers who are expected to meet here next week for the U.S.
Conference on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   People like Pandora Singleton, executive director of Project
Azuka in Savannah, and Nyrobi Moss, resident manager and social
services coordinator of SisterLove Inc. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   They know that Georgia has the eighth-highest number of AIDS
cases in the United States; that African-American women account for
54 percent of all new HIV/AIDS cases in the United States; and that
here in Georgia, AIDS is the leading cause of death for
African-American women ages 20 to 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one word that comes to mind is devastating,'' said
Singleton, who is also treasurer for the National Minority AIDS
Council and co-chairwoman of the Georgia host committee for the
AIDS conference. ``This is what I remember Africa looking like
before the epidemic took hold there. I see people dying in the
prime of their lives, so we're losing valuable and needed skills.
Children are being orphaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're extending people's lives, I would like us to
be more proactive, especially with young women. We can't cure AIDS,
but we can work on trying to stop it from spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   This is but part of the message Singleton hopes to get out at
the four-day conference, which will convene Sunday and run through
Wednesday at the Hyatt Regency downtown. The conference, sponsored
by the National Minority AIDS Council, will feature daily plenary
sessions on everything from housing to fund-raising to nutrition to
public safety to prevention and treatment research.
</P>
<P>
   Special guests will include Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell; Sandra
Thurman, presidential envoy for AIDS Cooperation; and U.S. Surgeon
General David Satcher.
</P>
<P>
   OUTREACH TARGETS MINORITIES
</P>
<P>
   Satcher has made educating, motivating and mobilizing minority
communities his theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans and Hispanics make up well over 50 percent
of new people with full-blown AIDS,'' he said in a telephone
interview last week from Dallas, where he had spent the morning at
a conference of the American Academy of Physicians. ``Among people
with new HIV infections, African-Americans alone make up over 60
percent, and people under 15 make up over half of the new HIV
infections. So it's becoming more heterosexual, it's involving more
women.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, Satcher said, new strategies are needed to reach
these communities, especially people of color.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while there has been some progress noted in slowing
the spread of the disease _ from 150,000 new infections a year in
1988 to about 40,000 a year today _ getting from today's numbers to
zero is the tough part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not seen an epidemic like this before in recorded
history,'' Satcher said. ``Many of the people being infected today
won't know, unless they are tested, that they are infected, because
there are no symptoms for at least 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   This is often true especially for women of color, said Moss,
citing poverty and drugs as major culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us can't afford to give much attention to preventative
health care,'' she said. ``Our families come first, especially with
African-American women. We don't go to the doctor until we're
bleeding and dying or pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews was two months pregnant with her 11-year-old when she
discovered she was HIV-positive. In the beginning, she said, she
was in denial about her HIV status. When she realized she had
passed it on to her daughter, ``I was hurt. I felt guilt. Scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has tried to give her daughter as much support
as she can and teach her to take care of herself as best she can.
``I know she lives off of my support,'' she said, ``because I live
off of hers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new pregnancy was unplanned, but an abortion was out of the
question. And so each day she takes a combination of three
medicines, including AZT, to prevent the transmission of the deadly
virus to her unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just pray and have faith that this baby won't be positive,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sometimes Andrews is depressed about her life, especially
about relationships. She doubts she'll ever have a husband, and she
worries what might become of her children if she becomes no longer
able to care for them or dies.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP IS LABOR OF LOVE
</P>

   Singleton said Andrews' story is typical of many she has heard
since starting Project Azuka 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to have a family with more than one person
infected with the AIDS virus, sometimes a mother and child,
sometimes a husband and wife, sometimes cousins or aunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some families where there may be two or three sisters
infected,'' she said. ``It's kind of why our organization even came
into existence.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Singleton was doing testing for the public health
department in prenatal clinics and discovered there were no
gender-specific services for women or their families.
</P>
<P>
   She resigned her job and started Project Azuka, which serves
about 2,100 women annually.
</P>
<P>
   She admits she thought she would be in the unemployment line by
now, not looking to retire with the epidemic on her heels. But
Singleton's hopeful all of it will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 21-year-old daughter,'' she said, ``and I want her to
be able to live in a world without AIDS.''

 &HT;    Coaches: Let's take a look
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's still September and already a number of games
have been decided on questionable calls. As a result, the hottest
topic is whether college football should follow the pros and use
instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many of the aggrieved coaches are for it.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer saw his football team lose on a
catch/non-catch call in Florida's 27-23 win Sept. 16 in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer complained to the SEC about the call. ``I don't know all
the ramifications of having replay, but after some of the recent
things that have happened, I would be for researching it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama coach Mike DuBose was grousing Sunday after a pair of
calls in Arkansas' final drive helped beat the Crimson Tide 28-21.
In one case, the drive was kept alive by a late defensive holding
call DuBose thought was questionable. In another, Arkansas had 12
men on the field on a key third down.
</P>
<P>
   After two missed calls late in a 35-31 loss to Michigan
Saturday, Illinois coach Ron Turner asked the NCAA to consider
instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Turner got some surprising support from a coach considered to be
a traditionalist. ``I think it's certainly worth discussing,'' Penn
State's Joe Paterno said. ``You're going to get some bad calls, but
you hate to see a bunch of kids who have played so hard lose a game
because the officials blew a call _ not that they do it on
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much pressure on the coaches and kids,'' Texas
coach Mack Brown said. ``There's too much at stake. There's too
much pressure on officials to not make sure the call was right. I
think that would help the officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bobby Gaston, the SEC supervisor of officials, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a perfectionist and so are my guys,'' Gaston said. ``First
and foremost, they want to get the call right. If the technology is
there to help, they'd be for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is why it probably won't happen. The budgets of athletics
department are stretched tight. An instant-replay system like that
of the NFL for each of the nation's 115 Division I-A football
stadiums would have to be outfitted with a minimum of eight cameras
wired into video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some schools would have those kind of resources, but many do
not,'' ACC commissioner John Swofford said. ``And unless you can do
it for every (I-A) team, you can't do it at all. It simply isn't
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing worse than having no instant-replay system would
be to have one that didn't cover all the angles, Gaston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not getting the coverage you want, then you'd be
trying to make a decision without the right information or the
right look at the play,'' he said. ``That would be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all coaches are for instant replay. ``You're going to have
calls that go for you and calls that go against you,'' Ohio State's
John Cooper said. ``That's part of college football. Officials are
just like coaches and players. Most of the time they are right, but
they make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are concerned that college play already is too slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got games lasting too long as it is,'' Swofford said.
``I think what we have to do is accept that there are going to be
some bad calls. There is a human element to the game. I don't think
it helps college football to move in the direction of the NFL.''

 &HT;    Asian champions play a different style
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The road to the women's basketball gold medal game has
been rougher than expected for the United States, which meets South
Korea in the semifinals Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans outlasted Slovakia 58-43 Wednesday in the
quarterfinals after shooting only 40 percent in a rugged encounter.
Now they face a Korean team that got within a respectable 14 points
of them in their Olympic pool opener Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning Asian champions upset European power France in the
quarterfinals to match their best showing n world competition. The
Koreans, less physical but better outside shooters than the other
teams still in contention, mesmerized the French with backdoor cuts
and surprisingly easy moves to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that we played them once,'' U.S. coach Nell Fortner
said, ``because their style is different than anyone else in this
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal Friday, Australia meets Brazil, which
upset gold-medal threat Russia in the quarterfinals. Australia beat
Brazil 81-70 when the teams met in pool play.

SOUTH CAROLINA STORES DROP A SAUCE OVER MAKER'S RACIST WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The sauce itself is an act of defiance: a
thick, yellow mustardy glaze that dares to call itself a barbecue
sauce despite its utter lack of tomatoes. South Carolinians are
among the only humans known to allow it upon their meat.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the racial notions of its maker, not its formula,
that led to the banishment of Maurice's All Natural Gourmet Blend
BBQ Sauce from the grocery shelves of six major retailers in the
Southeast in the last two weeks. The sauce, like the huge
Confederate battle flag that flies over its manufacturer's
headquarters, has become a redolent symbol of the change in the
attitudes in the South, a change that infuriates the sauce's
namesake.
</P>
<P>
   With a white sport coat to match his hair and mustache, Maurice
Bessinger even looks like the South of the 1950s, a time when he
was a forceful advocate for segregation, and at quiet moments he
seems almost wistful for a time when he could state plainly his
feelings about race without suffering financially for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say my restaurant never served blacks, but that's just
not true,'' he said, sitting in the headquarters office of
Maurice's Piggy Park, a chain of restaurants that has come to
define South Carolina barbecue. ``We just served them on a
segregated basis, like every other restaurant did. What the blacks
didn't realize was that they got the best food, because their
dining room was actually in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bessinger spent much of the 1950s and '60s attacking
race-mixing, running the National Association for the Preservation
of White People and refusing to let blacks into his main dining
room, long after most other restaurants had given in. The Supreme
Court eventually forced him to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, he became a born-again Christian and said he
put aside his notions of racial superiority. He set up a religious
mission next to his main restaurant, in West Columbia, and began
distributing tracts that combined his love of the Confederacy with
his religious beliefs, and it is those tracts that have now landed
him in trouble. The one attracting most attention is entitled
``Biblical View of Slavery,'' by John Weaver, a Baptist minister
from Fitzgerald, Ga., and argues that slavery is not inherently
evil because it is permitted in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone try to load you with guilt and say you need
to make reparations for what your forefathers did,'' says the
tract, which is on sale for $1 at the restaurant, alongside Bibles
and Confederate memorabilia. ``No! What our forefathers did was not
evil in and of itself. That doesn't mean that some of our
forefathers did not act evilly, wickedly themselves, and if they
did, they are responsible for their own sins.
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlet also argues that many African slaves ``blessed the
Lord'' for allowing them to be enslaved, because their life in
slavery was better than in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas came to light last month when they were printed by
John Monk, a columnist at The State, Columbia's daily newspaper.
Bessinger had already been in the news for lowering the American
flag over his headquarters and replacing it with the state and
Confederate battle flags after the State Legislature voted to
remove its Confederate flag from the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   These events led the stores _ including Winn-Dixie, Bi-Lo,
Kroger and Wal-Mart _ to stop selling Bessinger's immensely popular
condiment and boxes of his frozen barbecued pork. The stores have
apparently decided that the number of Southerners likely to be
offended by Bessinger's beliefs is now greater than the mustard and
Confederate traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   Bessinger's business activities ``are unacceptable to us as a
company and to many of our customers,'' said a statement issued by
Bi-Lo Supermarkets, which has 286 stores in the South and is based
in Mauldin, S.C. ``We believe that removing his products from Bi-Lo
stores will reinforce our belief in the dignity of each individual
who shops with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stores cited similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bessinger said that more than 40 percent of his business came
from retail sales of his sauce and packaged barbecue, and warned of
layoffs among his 250 employees if he cannot distribute his
products. He says his religious rights are being violated, though
he acknowledged that the stores had a right to choose which
products to sell, and he said that the South Carolina Chamber of
Commerce had organized a politically correct conspiracy against
him. (The chamber, which was active in getting the flag removed
from the Capitol dome, denied a similar role in the sauce's
disappearance.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not pro-slavery,'' he said, ``but no man on earth can
make me deny what the Bible says about slavery. The stores are just
yielding to outside pressure from people who want to destroy the
Constitution and remake America to fit their globalism strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only notable defender of Bessinger so far has been Pat
Buchanan, whose presidential campaign has established its state
headquarters in the Piggy Park building.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the building, in the Food Lion grocery
store, there is a wide empty space on the barbecue-sauce shelf that
was once filled by Carolina Gold, as Bessinger sauce is sometimes
known. Eddie Miles, the store manager, said dozens of people had
complained about the missing sauce, but only a few on ideological
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most of them even know about it,'' he said.
``They just like the sauce. You know, it's the only one that has
mustard in it.''

 &UR; SHARKS:  &LR; Jim Beck cautiously entered the shark cage in the chilly
waters surrounding this desolate marine outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old electrician had driven through the night from
his home in Southern California for this chance to get up close and
personal with one of the most fearsome predators on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to dive with a great white,'' Beck had
explained earlier, during the predawn, two-hour boat ride from
Alameda. ``It's one of the most beautiful, graceful fishes in the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   He gazed into the murky green sea surrounding the aluminum cage.
Visibility was limited to about 15 feet. A huge great white shark
could have been just yards away _ watching, calculating _ and Beck
wouldn't have known.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes ticked by, punctuated only by the hissing sound of
the regulator as Beck took long swallows of compressed air. He saw
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's frustrating experience last week underlines the unique
challenge of marketing nature as a tourist attraction. The simple
fact is this: Nature doesn't always cooperate.  &UR; By David Lazarus &LR;  &QL;

FRANK WILLS, 52, WATCHMAN WHO FOILED WATERGATE BREAK-IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., S.C.)   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Wills, the night watchman who discovered the 1972
Watergate burglary that ultimately led to the resignation of
President Richard M. Nixon, died Sept. 27. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Wills, who struggled with celebrity and joblessness after being
hailed as hero, died at University Hospital in Augusta, Ga. Friends
told The Augusta Chronicle that he had suffered from a brain tumor.
He lived in North Augusta, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Wills, a 24-year-old security guard at the Watergate office
building, was working the midnight shift on June 17, 1972. He
discovered tape over a lock on a basement door. Thinking that an
employee had left it there to make getting in and out easier, he
removed it.
</P>
<P>
   On another inspection round, he found the lock taped over again,
and called the police. They locked the doors, turned off the
elevators, and started checking darkened offices. About 2 a.m., at
the sixth floor headquarters of the Democratic National Committee,
they found five men: Bernard L. Barker, Virgilio Gonzales, Eugenio
Martinez, James W. McCord Jr. and Frank Sturgis.
</P>
<P>
   As Wills put it in a 1997 interview with The Florida
Times-Union, ``When we turned the lights on, one person, then two
persons, then three persons came out, and on down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   They five men were arrested for what Ronald L. Ziegler, Nixon's
press secretary, tried to dismiss as a ``second-rate burglary.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House saw to their being paid hush money. But after
the men were convicted before U.S. District Judge John. J. Sirica
the following January, McCord began talking to prosecutors and told
them that Nixon's campaign committee, the Committee for the
Re-Election of the President, had been behind the burglary.
</P>
<P>
   When White House tapes made it clear that Nixon had played a
central role in the cover-up attempt, and he was faced with
impeachment and conviction, he resigned on Aug. 9, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Wills had quit his job soon after the event, believing he did
not get the raise he deserved. As the cover-up was unraveling in
1974, he made a little money talking about his historic moment, but
his appearances cost him jobs because he was away from work. Most
of the jobs paid not much more than minimum wage, although Wills
did better than that when he played himself in the 1976 movie about
Nixon's downfall, ``All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills was convicted of shoplifting in 1983. For some years he
worked for Dick Gregory, the comedian, who was promoting a diet
product, and lived in the Bahamas. He moved back to North Augusta
in 1990 to care for his mother, who died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Angel Brown of Aiken, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by The Washington Star-News on the day Nixon
resigned, Wills said, ``We treat the president like a king, when he
should be a man for all the people.'' He complained that in Nixon's
resignation speech the night before, the president had failed to
describe his role in the cover-up. ``I think he should have been a
little more specific,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee gave Wills an award that fall,
and Robert S. Strauss, its chairman, said he had played ``a unique
role in the history of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most eloquent description of his role came when Rep.
James Mann, D-S.C., casting a difficult vote for impeachment on the
House Judiciary Committee, said on July 29, 1974: ``If there is no
accountability, another president will feel free to do as he
chooses. But the next time, there may be no watchman in the
night.''

&HT;     POLICE POWER, ENVIRONMENT, SPEECH ISSUES TOP COURT'S DOCKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After tackling such volatile issues as gay rights
and late-term abortion during its last session, the Supreme Court
opens a new season Monday with far-reaching but less dramatic cases
involving police power, the environment and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the fireworks, once-in-a-decade kind of term,
whereas this time around the court has slowed things down and is
looking at less controversial issues,'' says John Roberts Jr., a
Supreme Court expert here.
</P>
<P>
   But he notes that the court still has time to add high-profile
cases. The court docket now has 47 cases. Typically, it ends up
with around 75.
</P>
<P>
   As its term begins, the court itself has become a major
political issue. Since the next president will likely nominate two
to four justices, whoever wins in November could shape the court,
now beginning its 15th year under Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   Four cases focusing on police power lead the current docket.
Julie O'Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor, says they
``may not have high visibility, but for most people, they may have
more of an impact'' than some of last term's hot-button cases.
``They may burden the law-abiding, as well as the law-breaking,''
she explains.
</P>
<P>
   In one case from Lago Vista, Texas, Gail Atwater was driving her
two children home from soccer practice in 1997 when a toy fell off
their pickup truck. Atwater then drove slowly around the
neighborhood, letting the children stand on the seat to look out
the window for it.
</P>
<P>
   When a police car passed her truck, Atwater said later, she knew
she was going to get a ticket for failing to buckle the youngsters'
seatbelts. What she didn't expect was that the police would
handcuff her in front of the children and search her vehicle.
Although they found only soccer equipment, the officers took
Atwater to the local police station, where she was booked,
photographed and put into a holding cell. She later paid a $50
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater filed a federal lawsuit against the city, attacking its
policy allowing such searches after minor traffic violations. A
federal judge ruled for the city, but the 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals overruled the decision, saying the search policy was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here concerns everyone because it looks at how far
can police go after picking someone up for something minor, which
sooner or later happens to most people,'' says Steven R. Shapiro,
national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   In an Indianapolis case, the court will look at the use of
police roadblocks on city streets in which an officer checks
licenses and registration while a drug-sniffing dog walks around
the stopped cars in search of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the checkpoints,
saying they were not designed to ensure highway safety, which would
have made them legal, but were used as ``a pretext for a dragnet
search for criminals.''The Supreme Court in 1990 upheld
drunken-driving roadblocks as a legal method of removing hazardous
drivers from the roads, but lower courts have disagreed about the
constitutionality of drug roadblocks, which seek to detect illegal
trafficking, not drug-using drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In another case under the Fourth Amendment's ban on
``unreasonable searches and seizures,'' the court will examine the
controversial practice of prosecuting pregnant women who use drugs
or engage in other practices that might endanger their babies. The
court will review the policy of a Charleston, S.C., city hospital
that allows tests of pregnant patients suspected of drug use and
then turns the results over to police if they test positive.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the practice, ruling
that the health problems caused by maternal drug use outweighed the
intrusion suffered by the women whose urine was tested for drugs
without their consent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the justices will go high-tech when they consider
whether Florence, Ore., police needed a search warrant before using
a thermal-imaging device to detect heat patterns inside a house.
</P>
<P>
   The imaging device has become popular with police trying to
detect indoor marijuana-growing operations that use high-intensity
lights to speed the plants' growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court also will wade into environmental issues in
two cases that will test the constitutional limits of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the Environmental Protection Agency's
adoption in 1997 of tough new rules on smog-causing ozone and soot
under the 1990 Clean Air Act. The regulations, which would have
thrown hundreds of urban counties out of compliance, were
challenged by a coalition of industry representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia ruled that the EPA had acted unconstitutionally in
imposing sweeping air-quality standards for those pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, the Supreme Court also will consider whether the
government must take costs into account as well as benefits to
society before it sets national air quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   The other environmental case stems from an effort by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers to prevent 24 communities near Chicago from
dumping garbage into a proposed landfill. The area now has inland
waters that are home to blue herons and other migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Corps has
jurisdiction over the area and may protect it under the federal
government's authority to regulate interstate commerce. The court
said the wetlands area contributes to the economy because many
out-of-state travelers drive there each year to hunt and view the
birds.
</P>
<P>
   In a First Amendment free-speech case, the justices will decide
whether people may be sued for disclosing the contents of telephone
calls that were illegally intercepted and recorded by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilkes-Barre, Penn., case is expected to help define the
balance between the First Amendment rights of Americans to
disseminate information and state and federal wiretapping laws
aimed at preventing people from intercepting private conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The case involve a tape recording made illegally of a cell phone
conversation that was later given to radio station WILK, which
broadcast it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The case could have an important impact on the press because
news reporters sometimes use information that may have been
obtained by third parties through questionable means.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision could also affect a lawsuit brought by Rep.
John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, against Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, a Florida couple illegally taped a cell phone
conversation in which then House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Boehner and
other Republican leaders were heard discussing matters related to
an ethics case against Gingrich. The couple gave the tape to
McDermott, who passed it on to the House ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several news organizations published transcripts of the
conversations. A U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia later ruled that the Boehner suit could go forward.
</P>
<P>
   In another case with First Amendment implications, the justices
will examine a voter-initiated amendment to the Missouri
Constitution that required the state's 11-member congressional
delegation to either support a term-limits amendment to the U.S.
Constitution or be labeled on future ballots as having
``disregarded voters' instruction on term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the law to be a form of
government-compelled speech that violates the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In a Tennessee case, the justices will examine whether a state
high school association can bar coaches at private schools from
recruiting athletes from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court ruled that the association's policy
violated the coaches' First Amendment rights to free speech.
However, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati reversed
the district court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In another case involving athletes, the justices will decide if
the Professional Golf Association violated the Americans with
Disabilities Act when it barred Casey Martin _ a partially disabled
golfer _ from riding a cart during tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the PGA argument that
all tournament golfers must play by the same rules, which includes
walking about five miles a day on sometimes hilly courses.
</P>
<P>
   The high court will also explore a distinction in federal
immigration law between out-of-wedlock children born overseas to
American mothers and those born to American fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a child born to an unmarried American mother is
considered a U.S. citizen at birth. But a child whose mother is a
foreign national and whose father is an American is considered a
noncitizen. For the child to become a citizen, the American father
must formally acknowledge paternity before the child is 18 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves a 31-year-old man born in Vietnam and raised
by his American father, who never asked the government to make him
a citizen. Now the son faces deportation to Vietnam after being
convicted on an assault charge. The father challenged the statute,
saying it violates the constitutional requirement that laws treat
men and women equally.

DENMARK'S REJECTION OF EURO MAY SIGNAL DEEPER DISCONTENT WITH
INTEGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark _ Denmark voted Thursday not to join
Europe's common currency, the euro, undermining an already fragile
monetary experiment and disdaining the rapid European political
integration championed by France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the first popular test for the euro, introduced last year
without such democratic consultation in 11 nations of the 15-member
European Union, Danes voted to preserve the krone rather than join
Europe's ambitious experiment with a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Final results showed about 53 percent of the electorate
rejecting the euro, with about 47 percent in favor. The result was
a blow to Social Democratic Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen,
who campaigned vigorously with a message that Danes should accept
the euro or face isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection appeared to contain an ominous warning to European
leaders that they may have raced ahead of their electorates in
adopting the euro, pressing for the political cooperation needed to
support it, and talking of European federalism.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``democratic deficit'' is now heard often in
discussions of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am generally pro-European, but I voted no to register my
protest at the lack of democratic openness in the way a united
Europe is being built,'' said Ebbe Kloevedal Reich, a writer, as he
stood in the misty rain in Copenhagen on Thursday. ``It is simply
not a democratic process at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote may reflect a broad political trend in European
countries toward the rediscovery of national identity and away from
Europeanism, at least as currently envisioned. Pia Kjaersgaard, a
nationalist Danish leader, has been a leader of the campaign
against the euro, and will now likely find her political position
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the day Thursday the euro traded at about 88 cents
to the dollar, slipping only slightly after the vote to about 87.5
cents in New York trading.
</P>
<P>
   This relative stability reflected several factors: the rejection
by Danes had already been factored in by many currency traders,
plus the limited size of Denmark's economy and recent European
Central Bank intervention that has demonstrated that monetary
authorities will not let the currency slip much below this level.
</P>
<P>
   But just 21 months ago, at its introduction, the euro bought
$1.17 and the Danish rejection suggested that the currency's
chronic weakness is not about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting such weakness may require the support of something
as big as a federal government spanning the European Union, but the
Danes, among others, have shown that many Europeans do not want
that _ at least for now. A tension seems certain to persist between
a common currency and the absence of common fiscal and other
policies to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of Britain and Sweden joining the euro seems less
likely after Denmark's vote. And the absence of Britain's
participation in the euro is particularly discomfiting to European
monetary authorities, given the size and strength of that country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a no from the Danes, there would certainly be a loss of
confidence in the euro,'' said Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher, a member of
the governing council of the German Bundesbank, before the final
results were announced. He suggested that further intervention by
the European Central Bank to stabilize the euro was possible.
</P>
<P>
   However, a sharp fall in the euro's value appears unlikely in
part because it has begun to hurt the earnings of large American
corporations in Europe. Sales in euros now translate into fewer
dollars. The Federal Reserve has joined the European Union in
supporting the euro and a consensus regarding it's value appears to
exist.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The euro was always a political project, adopted in haste soon
after German unification a decade ago as a means to tie a united
Germany forever to its European neighbors and advance the vision of
a United States of Europe held dear by Germany's former chancellor,
Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   It is this vision, imposed from above and without a voice that
that seem to be a concern for many of the 375 million residents in
the European Union's member countries worried about the loss of
national identity and national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Danes voicing concern Thursday was Louisa Jacobsen,
a lawyer who said she had favored European integration in the past.
But recent developments _ particularly the imposition by 14
European Union governments of sanctions on Austria for including
Jorg Haider's rightist Freedom Party in a governing coalition _
have angered her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Austria was a scandal, and that it why I
voted no,'' she said, clearly troubled, like many Danes, by the
idea that ``Europe'' could punish a small country for its
democratic choice. ``We need a break, a pause, in a process of
integration that is going much too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian sanctions were lifted earlier this month, but not
before damage had been done to the pro-euro campaign in Denmark, a
nation of 5.3 million people. This small nation has long been
divided over European integration, and swing voters like Jacobsen
have proven decisive on such votes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a combination of the rightist nationalism of
Kjaersgaard and a wide range of anxieties over the future of
Denmark's welfare state and the nature of democracy in a united
Europe clearly coalesced to produce the rejection. This combination
outweighed the solidly pro-euro sentiments of Denmark's business
community.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Social Democrats, by far the largest party with 35
percent of the vote, were unable to deliver their voters to the
pro-euro cause because of widespread concern among them that
pressure for lower taxes from European monetary authorities would
eventually make Denmark's comprehensive welfare state unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts and deregulation are favored by the European Central
Bank to spur pan-European economic growth to a point where it can
begin to compete with the vigorous American economy, making the
euro more attractive.

 NATURE CALLS THE SHOTS WHEN CHASING GREAT WHITE SHARKS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARALLON ISLANDS, Calif. _ Jim Beck cautiously entered the shark
cage in the chilly waters surrounding this desolate marine outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old electrician had driven through the night from
his home in Southern California for this chance to get up close and
personal with one of the most fearsome predators on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to dive with a great white,'' Beck had
explained earlier, during the predawn, two-hour boat ride from
Alameda, Calif. ``It's one of the most beautiful, graceful fishes
in the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   He gazed into the murky green sea surrounding the aluminum cage.
Visibility was limited to about 15 feet. A huge great white shark
could have been just yards away _ watching, calculating _ and Beck
wouldn't have known.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes ticked by, punctuated only by the hissing sound of
the regulator as Beck took long swallows of compressed air. He saw
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's frustrating experience last week underlines the unique
challenge of marketing nature as a tourist attraction. The simple
fact is this: Nature doesn't always cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's wonderful about wilderness is its
unpredictability,'' said Josh Nowlis, a senior scientist at the
Center for Marine Conservation in San Francisco. ``We can't expect
nature to provide guaranteed results on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a challenge faced by all those who seek to bring people
and creatures into contact, from whale-watching services to African
safari organizers.
</P>
<P>
   It also raises ethical questions about how far an entrepreneur
can or should go to facilitate close encounters with the wild
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of great white sharks, there are just three places
in the world where intrepid divers can tour known feeding grounds _
Australia, South Africa and the Farallons, located about 25 miles
west of the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   September and October are when the Farallons teem with dozens of
great whites, which come in search of the elephant seals and sea
lions that frequent the area.
</P>
<P>
   While commercial divers and charters have been visiting the
rocky islands for years, only one company offers shark-watching
tours for the general public: Alameda's Golden Gate Expeditions,
established last year by Lawrence Groth, a longtime diver and
marine-services worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see great whites,'' he said, explaining why he
invested more than $100,000 in a specially equipped boat and
establishing his own firm. ``And I think other people should see
them, too. It's an incredible creature, and it's right here in our
backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   He can take up to six passengers aboard his 32-foot vessel, the
Patriot. Each pays either $400 for weekday outings or $450 for
weekends, with typical trips lasting from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Groth, who spends the remainder of the year working on a variety
of commercial vessels, makes clear up front that he cannot
guarantee the appearance of any sharks. But that doesn't deter
those for whom even the possibility of a great white sighting is
cause for excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Pesch, a 37-year-old fire captain, flew in from Arizona for
the experience. ``It's the thrill of a lifetime,'' he said. ``If I
see a white . . .''
</P>
<P>
   His voice trailed off, as if mere words could not capture the
full splendor of such an idea.
</P>
<P>
   For many divers, confronting a great white shark, even from the
confines of a shark cage, is the Holy Grail of their sport. The
creature commands that much respect.
</P>
<P>
   The great white _ Carcharodon carcharias to shark aficionados _
can grow to more than 20 feet in length and weigh upwards of 7,000
pounds. Its ancestry as one of the ocean's most potent predators _
only killer whales and people are as deadly _ dates back 300
million years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the film ``Jaws,'' great whites are seen by many as
the serial killers of the sea (not to mention the only predators
that attack to their own universally recognized theme music).
</P>
<P>
   In reality, fatal attacks on humans are relatively rare,
occurring only about once or twce a year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fascination with these carnivores persists.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, two surfers in Australia were killed by great
whites along the same stretch of coast on consecutive days _ the
first time this has happened in more than 20 years, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at the Farallons, Groth and his dive master, Gary
Rose, tossed a pair of decoys from the stern of the boat. Each
consisted of a piece of a surfboard-size plywood covered with foam
rubber, and, according to Groth, looked distinctly from beneath the
waves like sea lions sunning on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Just a half hour later, as Beck and the other divers were
readying their gear, a flash of gray fins churned the water as a
great white went for one of the floats. In a blink of an eye, it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that?'' Groth shouted. ``A 12-footer! Easily a
12-footer!''
</P>
<P>
   Beck was inside the shark cage just moments afterward, peering
intently into the gloom. But the shark had apparently decided that
a foam-rubber decoy is not as tasty as the real thing and had
departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Beck said as he emerged, dripping and shivering,
from the 56-degree water almost an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   His chagrin was partially the result of a decision by Groth not
to use ``chum'' _ buckets of blood and meat dumped into the water _
to lure sharks in close. Chumming is a common practice among
great-white tour operators in Australia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Groth said he chummed last year at the Farallons and ran afoul
of environmentalists, who said that he was messing with the natural
feeding behavior of great whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that,'' he said, ``it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Groth said he gets the same results using decoys. Others,
however, note that while a decoy may initially attract a shark, it
won't keep the creature coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't use blood, you won't see sharks,'' said a worker
at a Bay Area dive shop who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do shark watching without any chumming, the odds are
certainly against you,'' agreed Doreen Moser, assistant director of
education for the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   But she said Groth was correct not to do it. ``The key thing
with any ecotourism is not to do anything that could affect the
animal's behavior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pyle, a biologist who has conducted research at the
Farallons for the past 20 years, said even foam rubber decoys can
influence a shark's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Given his choice, Pyle said all shark-watching tours of the
islands would be banned. ``They interfere with our research,'' Pyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Fear of Chum
</P>
<P>
   But such a ban is unlikely. Shark watchers can claim the same
rights as the numerous whale watchers who visit the area.
</P>
<P>
   A more pressing concern for some is if other entrepreneurs get
into the game, competition could intensify among shark-watching
tours of the Farallons.
</P>
<P>
   Burr Heneman, former executive director of the Point Reyes Bird
Observatory, which has jurisdiction over the waters surrounding the
islands, said he worries that such a situation would compel boat
owners to increase viewing chances by resorting to chum.
</P>
<P>
   The concern, in essence, is that, like wild bears at Yosemite,
great whites would alter their behavior to accommodate the presence
of humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best place on the planet to study white sharks,''
Heneman said. ``Chumming makes you part of the picture, and it
really throws off the research.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, caveat emptor rules the day for those who pony up
hundreds of dollars for a chance to see sharks at the Farallons.
After that one fleeting glimpse in the morning, the passengers of
the Patriot saw nary a fin for their remaining eight hours at the
islands.
</P>
<P>
   Beck said he was satisfied with having gotten at least a brief
peek at a great white. But Pesch could barely hide his
disappointment that he had so little to show for his trip out from
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the pair missed the big show by just one day.
Groth said that during his next outing to the islands, a 15-foot
shark took a bite out of one of the decoys, and an 18-footer
attacked and ate an elephant seal not far from the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' he said. ``A big, bloody mess.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as shark watching goes, it doesn't get much better than
that.

HARRY PASTER, CONSULTANT TO ADVERTISING AGENCIES, DIES AT 74 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Paster, who rose from a $60-a-week statistician to become
a valued adviser to the most rich and powerful executives of
Madison Avenue, died on Tuesday at his home in Great Neck, N.Y. He
was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to John Wolfe, senior vice
president at the American Association of Advertising Agencies in
New York, where Paster worked for 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   Paster, who spoke gruffly in a gravelly voice, was a Mr. Fix-it
for the advertising agency business, serving as a management
consultant for the members of the agency association, the principal
industry trade organization. He was on call for agencies large and
small, offering advice in realms like contracts, compensation,
mergers and acquisitions, employee benefits and succession plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the advertising business are in advertising, not in
business,'' said Jonathan Bond, co-chairman of Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP;
Partners in New York. ``He was the only person in the advertising
business in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Paster served on the advisory board of Kirshenbaum Bond and
numerous other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He practiced tough love, and he meant both parts of it,'' said
Marsha Lindsay, president and chief executive at Lindsay, Stone &AMP;
Briggs, an agency in Madison, Wis., that began working with Paster
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some tough times for us 10, 12 years ago,'' she
added, ``and he was here for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Paster joined the agency association, also known as the Four As,
in 1948. He was promoted to vice president in 1966, senior vice
president in 1978 and executive vice president in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Paster offered his advice in person, taking road trips to meet
with agency executives; on the telephone; and at workshops held
during the annual meetings of the Four As, in rooms almost always
filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque on his office wall from members of the agency
association offered a tribute that appropriately paraphrased an old
advertising slogan: ``Call Harry, he'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   After Paster retired from the Four As in 1995, he opened his own
agency consulting company at the association's headquarters in
Midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Paster is survived by his wife of 52 years, Beverly; a daughter,
Lynn Paster Offsey; a son, Ken Paster; and six grandchildren. &QL;

   LOCK AND KEY: Because CNN/SI aired footage of an obscene gesture
Keyshawn Johnson (right) made toward one of its cameras, a
statement at the Tampa Bay wide receiver's personal website says
he's putting the cable network on probation. Johnson claims the
gesture, which he made twice toward a camera during practice before
Sunday's Bucs-Jets game, was taken out of context. He says CNN
``wasn't smart enough to realize, 'We've got to deal with this guy
in the long-term future.' Believe me, they've already called a
million times trying to apologize.'' CNN/SI managing editor Steve
Robinson says the network has not called Johnson and has no plans
to because it has nothing to apologize for. The footage can be seen

COMMENTARY: UNDER THE VOLCANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Foreign Affairs)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELES CITY, Philippines _ So you get home tonight and you get
on AOL and you have a question about your bill or a technical
glitch. You go to the AOL help section and get online with an AOL
helper, who walks you through your problem, using e-mail back and
forth. Do you know who you're talking to? You're talking to a
Filipino techie working in AOL's back office, which, thanks to a
fiber-optic cable under the Pacific, is now located here at the
former Clark Air Base outside Manila, beneath the Mount Pinatubo
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL member-services center in the Philippines employs 900
young Filipino techies, who, working on computers in three
eight-hour shifts, now handle about 90 percent of the 600,000
online billing and technical questions that pour into AOL each
month. ``I got this member online one day,'' said Christine Dizon,
one of many Filipino AOL techies I interviewed here, ``and she
asked me: `Where are you?' And I said, `I'm in the Philippines.'
And she said, `You're kidding me, right?' I told her, `No, I'm
really in the Philippines.' Sometimes people ask if we're machines.
We tell them no, we're alive and kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting to visit the two-year-old AOL Philippine
center on the same day that in Prague, Czech Republic, a rogues'
gallery of communists, anarchists, protectionist unions and
over-fed Yuppies out for their 1960s fix were denouncing
globalization and trying to turn the World Bank-IMF meetings into a
molotov cocktail party. Because this AOL call center, one of many
sprouting in the Philippines, is also globalization, and, for 900
young Filipinos, it's their salvation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long waiting list for jobs here, which pay about
triple the local minimum wage, and come with a 10-kilo bag of rice
twice a month, plus health care and one meal a day. The Filipinos
here also get free Internet phone and Web access, which many use
for hours after work because they don't have home phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are afraid of globalization because they fear
being exploited,'' said Romer Recabar, an AOL techie, ``but what
they are missing is that we can use this as a chance to learn. We
have the technical know-how here, but AOL is bringing us the
knowledge and resources we need to compete, and if we don't compete
we perish. ... My parents have a family business, but I work here
so I can bring what I learn from an international company like AOL
to our family business.''
</P>
<P>
   If AOL were not here, said Judith Jane Lyons, one of the
thousands of tech grads produced by Filipino colleges each year,
``I would probably be unemployed or underemployed,'' because the
number of good tech jobs is limited, so many end up working as
clerks or in a factory, if they're lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a job for almost a year before I got in
here,'' said Jojo Echo. ``I have two brothers and one sister. My
father is not living, so I am the breadwinner. My mom is so happy
on payday, because I give her almost half my salary.''
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine the pride it produces in young Filipino techies
to know they are explaining to Americans and the world how to
operate AOL services. There are only two American AOL managers
here. All the other managers have been developed from the Filipino
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask me where I work,'' said Soc Bautista, who has
risen to training manager, ``and I tell them `AOL,' they say: `Wow!
Really?' The pride it gives is immense. Our families share in the
pride. Our families say, `My kid works for AOL. ...' This gives us
the opportunity as a Third World country to improve and be at par
(with others).''
</P>
<P>
   The AOL call center here is but one example of a simple truth _
that the best hope for alleviating poverty around the world is
through more globalization, not less, and by encouraging
governments to put in place the market-friendly policies,
institutions and environmental protections that will attract global
investment and jobs. The idea peddled by the Prague protesters that
choking off this process will help the world's poor is sheer
lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the people who should be saying that loudly, such
as the World Bank head, James Wolfensohn, have become intimidated
by the anti-globalization mob, whose only plan is to keep poor
people poor. Think of the glib, moronic sign held up by protesters
in Prague: ``Make Love, Not Trade.'' Very funny _ unless trade and
foreign investment are your only lifelines out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Yo, protesters! Come here for a visit _ or get on AOL's help
line and ask the Filipino techies what they think about
globalization. Trust me, they'll give you an earful. Trust me,
you've got mail.

R.S. THOMAS, A WELSH CLERGYMAN AND POET, DIES AT 87  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   R.S. Thomas, a Welsh clergyman and poet whose spare, often bleak
verse reflected the rugged people and landscape of his native land,
died on Monday at his home in Llanfairynghornwy, Anglesey, Wales.
He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Thomas' poems were evocative sketches of the Welsh
countryside. In ``Tares'' (1961), he included a poem titled
``Abersoch,'' in which he captured a moment at the seashore:
</P>
<P>
   There was that headland, asleep on the sea,
</P>
<P>
   The air full of thunder and the far air
</P>
<P>
   Brittle with lightning; there was that girl
</P>
<P>
   Riding her cycle, hair at half-mast,
</P>
<P>
   And the men smoking, the dinghies at rest
</P>
<P>
   On the calm tide. There were people going
</P>
<P>
   About their business, while the storm grew
</P>
<P>
   Louder and nearer and did not break.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of some 40 years as a priest, mostly in the hill
country of northern Wales, he came to identify with the villagers
who struggled to wrest their livelihood from an unforgiving land,
people he described as ``tough, materialistic, hard-working'' who
``measured one another by the acre and by the pound.''
</P>
<P>
   Strongly nationalistic, he deplored what he saw as the
cheapening of Welsh culture by a steady infiltration of vacationers
from England and elsewhere and the growing triviality and
commercialism of life. His vision remained uncompromising. In
``Funeral,'' from ``The Bread of Truth'' (1964), he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   . . .On the cheap coffin
</P>
<P>
   The earth falls more cleanly
</P>
<P>
   than tears.
</P>
<P>
   What are these red faces for?
</P>
<P>
   This incidence of pious catarrh
</P>
<P>
   At the grave's edge? He
</P>
<P>
   has returned
</P>
<P>
   Where he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was well into his 30s when he mastered the Welsh
language, although he continued to write his poems in English and
saved his Welsh for prose. He published his first book of poetry,
``The Stones of the Field,'' in 1946, followed by ``Songs at the
Year's Turning'' (1955), ``Poetry for Supper'' (1958) and ``Tares''
(1961). His later works included ``Laboratories of the Spirit''
(1976), ``Mass for Hard Times'' (1992) and ``No Truce With the
Furies'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Stuart Thomas was born in Cardiff in 1913 and grew up in
Holyhead, Anglesey, in northwest Wales. He was ordained a deacon in
1936 and became a priest in 1937. After retiring from the
priesthood, he turned to prose, publishing a series of biographical
essays.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' first wife, Mildred Eldridge, an artist, died in 1991.
He is survived by his wife, Elisabeth, and a son from his first
marriage.

RICHARD MULLIGAN, ACTOR   ON `SOAP' AND `EMPTY NEST,' DIES AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif, N.D., Calif. N.H.)   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Mulligan, who won Emmy Awards for his portrayal of
fathers on the situation comedies ``Soap'' and ``Empty Nest,'' died
Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his friend and assistant, David
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Although he achieved his greatest success in television in the
course of a career of some 40 years, Mulligan appeared frequently
in films and on the Broadway stage. He portrayed a Hollywood
producer in the 1981 Blake Edwards farce, ``S.O.B.,'' which also
starred Julie Andrews and William Holden.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan was also featured in ``The Undefeated'' (1969) with
John Wayne, and portrayed Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer in
``Little Big Man'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   Among his other films were ``Love With the Proper Stranger''
(1964), ``The Group'' (1966), ``The Big Bus'' (1976) and ``Trail of
the Pink Panther'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway in 1982, Mulligan starred with Suzanne Pleshette in
``Special Occasions,'' Bernard Slade's two-character play about a
divorced couple who keep meeting over a period of time. He also
starred on Broadway with Marlo Thomas in a 1974 Herb Gardner
comedy, ``Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   He was best known for his roles on ``Soap'' from 1977 to 1981
and on ``Empty Nest'' from 1988 to 1995. On the former, he played
Burt Campbell, a lovable screwball who was stepfather to the
character played by Billy Crystal. And on ``Empty Nest,'' a spinoff
of ``The Golden Girls,'' Mulligan played Dr. Harry Weston, a
widower with three grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly different from my role on `Soap,''' Mulligan
told The Associated Press in 1988. ``This guy's a good doctor who
cares deeply about his patients. He's a good fellow trying to take
care of his daughters. His wife died 18 months ago, and he still
can't take the ring off.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 1980 Emmy for ``Soap'' and the 1989 Emmy for ``Empty
Nest,'' each in the category of outstanding lead actor in a comedy,
Mulligan won a 1989 Golden Globe for ``Empty Nest'' for best
performance by an actor in a television series.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared in episodes of ``The Twilight Zone,''
``Charlie's Angels,'' ``The Partridge Family,'' ``Bonanza'' and
``Rat Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan, who was born in the Bronx on Nov. 13, 1932, planned on
becoming a priest before he decided to study playwriting at
Columbia University. According to Julian Myers, his longtime
publicist and a friend, it was playwriting that led Mulligan into
acting. Myers said that not long after Mulligan finished his
studies, he drove to Florida to show one of his plays to the
director of a playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived to find the director in the midst of rehearsals. And,
Myers said, ``The director said, `You'd better try out for this
role.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan was married and divorced four times.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, James, of West Lebanon, N.H., and two
brothers, James, of North Dakota, and Robert, of Connecticut, the
director of films like ``Fear Strikes Out'' and ``To Kill a
Mockingbird.''

GORE INVITES GROUP OF `REGULAR FOLKS' TO HELP HIM PREPARE FOR
DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore travels to his debate
preparation camp in Sarasota, Fla., on Saturday, he will be
accompanied by many of the usual campaign suspects _ his chairman,
his media consultant and his message guru. But he also bring along
some very unusual _ and unsuspecting _ advisers he picked up on the
campaign trail, like Erin K. Conner, a 14-year-old freshman at
Belleville West High School in Belleville, Ill., and Joyce E.
Martin, a 76-year-old retiree from Clearwater, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   At considerable expense that some Gore aides do not even want to
think about, Gore has invited 13 ``regular folks'' _ including
Conner's mother, who will chaperone her _ to help him prepare for
one of the pivotal moments in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides say the purpose is for these people, all of whom Gore
has met in campaign appearances, to help brief the vice president
about the concerns of real Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, another purpose, or at least a consequence, is to
provide fodder for newspaper and television stories during the
three days that Gore will be sequestered for mock debates and
strategy meetings. Not coincidentally, almost all of those Gore has
invited come from important swing states where newspapers and
television stations are likely to compile reports about the new
Gore advisers from back home. Three are from Michigan, two are from
Illinois, and others are from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia,
New Mexico, Maine and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   When the briefings and rehearsals end on Tuesday, Gore's guests
are to accompany him to Boston for that night's nationally
televised debate. Gore aides hope to secure tickets that will allow
them to sit in the debate hall, raising the prospect that Gore will
allude to them during his thrust-and-parry with Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Using audience members as props has become a regular feature of
presidential debates and major speeches like the State of the Union
in recent years, and Gore uses the tactic frequently. In his
acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August,
for example, he illustrated his positions on prescription drug
costs, education and a patient's bill of rights by pointing to
several people who had been planted in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Among those invited to advise Gore this weekend is Winifred
Skinner, a 79-year-old widow from Des Moines, Iowa, who has become
an overnight national celebrity since an encounter with Gore on
Wednesday at a forum on Medicare in Altoona, Iowa. Skinner told
Gore that she has to collect cans on roadsides to make ends meet
because her prescription drugs are so expensive. When Gore asked
how much she raised that way, she charmed him by responding:
``You're not going to tell the government, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner has since been inundated by network television
reporters, making appearances Thursday on NBC's ``Today'' and ABC's
``Good Morning America,'' among other shows. The Gore campaign
offered to fly her to Sarasota and Boston, but she at first
declined because her claustrophobia makes her afraid to fly. The
campaign then offered to drive her to Boston in a Winnebago. She
hesitated because she did not want to leave behind her 6-year-old
toy poodle, Bridget. She was told she could bring the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the deal breaker,'' said Jeff J. Link, Gore's Iowa
state director, who personally negotiated the arrangement with
Skinner by telephone on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said that once Bridget was accommodated _ ``she's the
only family I've got'' _ she began to get excited about her trip.
``I've never been that far east,'' she said. ``And I was a debater
in high school, so I love debates.'' She also said she planned to
sell some cans she has accumulated to provide spending money for
her trip. ``I'm no moocher,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions in Sarasota will be held at the Mote Marine
Laboratory, an 11-acre research and conference center where Gore
also prepared for his 1996 vice presidential debate. William M.
Daley, Gore's campaign chairman and the former commerce secretary,
said on Thursday that the special guests would help Gore stay
focused on the debate's audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates tend to stay fairly secluded when preparing for
debates,'' he said. ``It is a rarefied atmosphere of policy
briefings, debate rehearsals and briefing books. The presence of
these special guests is an opportunity for us all to remember
what's really important in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's guests are demographically diverse. Short biographies
distributed on Thursday by the Gore campaign point out that Joseph
Austin, a construction worker from Albuquerque, N.M., is Hispanic
and Joseph Dulin, a school principal from Ann Arbor, Mich., is an
African-American. Most of those invited were notified earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the invitees, like Donald Jalbert of Lewiston, Maine,
and Claudia Amboyer of Shelby Township, Mich., are teachers who
Gore met while staying at their homes during his various campaign
``school days.'' Conner, the 14-year-old student, caught his
attention when she introduced him during an appearance at her
school on Sept. 11. The retired Martin met the vice president on
Monday during a discussion with him about Medicare that preceded a
speech he gave in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's doctor had wanted to charge her $450 for a recent
office visit to examine an ailing wrist but accepted a $125
Medicare payment instead, she told Gore. ``If I didn't have
Medicare I'd have been out of luck,'' she said on Thursday. ``I'd
have been sitting here suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ``guest'' will be Atlanta firefighter Matt Moseley,
himself something of a celebrity since the day last year when he
dangled from a helicopter to rescue a construction worker trapped
by a raging fire. Gore called Moseley shortly after the rescue and
then met him during a trip to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley said he had been surveying colleagues at his firehouse
and other friends about the subjects they would like him to raise
with Gore. His topics so far: prescription drug coverage,
education, gun control, tax cuts and welfare reform. ``It will be
an honor to go,'' he said, ``and pretty reassuring that the person
running to be leader of the free world would want to talk to what I
would call real people in preparing for this debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one was more stunned to be asked, however, than
Connor, who is four years shy of voting age. ``I couldn't believe
it,'' she said. ``But I think he knows that teen-agers like myself
are going to be the leaders of tomorrow and without our input we
may not like the society that he forms.''

HOW RU486 IS USED TO TERMINATE PREGNANCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FDA-ABORTION-PILL) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An abortion using mifepristone, or RU486, takes place in three
steps.
</P>
<P>
   First, in a doctor's office, a woman takes three pills of
mifepristone, which blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone
required to maintain a pregnancy. She will return to the doctor's
office 36 to 48 hours later to take two tablets of a second drug,
misoprostol, a prostaglandin or hormonelike substance that will
make her uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   About 14 days after initiating the abortion the woman will
return to the doctor to be sure that she is no longer pregnant and
that no fetal tissue remains in her uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show the drug combination causes bleeding and cramping
that usually last nine to 16 days but can continue for 30 days or
more. About half the women also reported nausea and a quarter to a
third said they had headaches, vomiting or diarrhea. These symptoms
usually dissipated after three days.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 percent of the women who undergo this kind of abortion
bleed severely, sometimes requiring blood transfusions and surgical
abortions. The abortion is incomplete about 5 percent of the time,
requiring that a woman have a surgical abortion to empty her uterus
of fetal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The pills fail completely in about 1 percent of the women. They
remain pregnant and surgical abortions are urged because the pills
can cause birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   While mifepristone is a new drug in the United States, the
second drug, misoprostol, is not. It is sold by Searle, a division
of the Pharmacia Corp., under the name Cytotec, and is approved as
a treatment for ulcers. Because doctors can legally prescribe any
approved drug for any purpose, it does not require a separate
approval by the health agency for use in abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Kovitz, a spokeswoman for Searle, said the company did
not test it for use in abortions and would not promote it for that
use. Kovitz pointed out that the drug carried a warning stating it
was not to be used in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration placed several restrictions on
the use of mifepristone. Women may only use the drug for abortions
within the first seven weeks after their last menstrual period (a
third of all abortions in the United States currently take place
within this time); doctors providing the abortion pills must be
able to accurately determine the duration of a pregnancy and to
diagnose a tubal pregnancy, which cannot be terminated with the
drugs; and doctors must also be able to perform a surgical abortion
should one prove necessary or have another doctor available who can
do so.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors giving out the drugs must report any
pregnancies that are not terminated after women take the
medications and must report any serious events, like
hospitalizations and blood transfusions, to the drug's sponsor, the
Population Council, which has agreed to study the drug after it
goes on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman receiving mifepristone must sign an agreement saying
she has received and read a ``medication guide,'' which includes a
description of mifepristone's effects, how to take it, the risks
and side effects of a pill-induced abortion and a promise that she
will return in two days to take misoprostol and again in two weeks
to be sure that her abortion is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the health agency said, mifepristone will be sold directly
to doctors. The doctors or certain other health care workers, like
physicians' assistants supervised by doctors, will administer the
drug.

SENATORS DOUBT PROGRESS ON GLOBAL WARMING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Ind.)   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Republican senators expressed strong
concerns Thursday that talks to flesh out details of a global
warming treaty signed by the Clinton administration in 1998 would
never produce a document the Senate will approve.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as Frank E. Loy, undersecretary of state for
global affairs, spoke at a joint hearing of the Senate Foreign
Relations and Energy and Natural Resources committees in which he
staunchly defended efforts to transform the treaty, the Kyoto
Protocol, from a broad commitment to stem global emissions of
heat-trapping greenhouse gases into a detailed, enforceable plan.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol calls for the United States and other
industrialized countries to start by 2008 reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which comes mainly from
burning coal and oil. More than 150 countries have signed the
protocol, but it has not been ratified by any of the world's
industrial powers.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations will resume in November in The Hague, Netherlands,
on a variety of points, including defining ways for wealthy
countries to get credit toward emissions targets by paying for
projects in developing countries that help prevent releases of
greenhouse gases as those economies grow.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the energy
committee, said important aspects of the treaty were far from the
goals the Senate set in a resolution 1997, before the accord was
adopted at a Kyoto meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It would still be an unfair burden on the U.S. economy,
Murkowski said, by forcing cuts in the use of coal and oil. And, he
added, there appeared to be no requirement for developing countries
to limit future emissions. That was a specific demand of in the
Senate resolution, which passed on a 95-0 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing nations basically get a free ride,'' Murkowski
said. ``The protocol only punishes developed countries with high
energy prices and reduced economic productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Loy, the chief negotiator for the United States in recent rounds
of climate talks, said the agreement was not, and would not _ even
after further talks _ be a complete or perfect solution to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, it is an essential start, providing relatively
cheap insurance against harm if scientists' predictions of the
consequences of a warming climate prove correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we act now, the insurance premium will be far more
reasonable than if we delay and hope the problem will simply go
away,'' Loy said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there were signs that China and India, along with
other developing countries, were moving toward reducing their use
of coal or changing other practices in ways that would limit their
contribution to the greenhouse problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said there were signs in his state
that farmers would support a treaty if they got financial credits
for sopping up carbon dioxide through certain farming methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any solution until a large number of Americans see
this is in their self-interest,'' Lugar said.

`BEAUTIFUL': THE MAKING OF A MISS CONGENIALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beauty may be only skin deep, but ugly is to the bone,'' the
queen of the thunderously intoned wisecrack, Tallulah Bankhead, is
reputed to have said on the subject of appearances. But if we are
to believe ``Beautiful,'' a clumsy satire of the world of beauty
pageants, most of those involved in that world are spiritually ugly
to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Take the movie's ruthless hard-boiled antiheroine, Mona Hibbard
(Minnie Driver), a cutthroat competitor who exhibits not the
tiniest stirrings of conscience or affection for any other human
being until she has a sappy, unconvincing revelation near the end
of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Mona's notorious pranks are the stunt she pulls on a
contestant who has stolen her talent routine of twirling a flaming
baton while singing ``A Bicycle Built for Two.'' Just before her
rival goes onstage, Mona slips some glue on the baton. When the
flaming instrument sticks to the hand of the panicked contestant,
Mona just happens to be standing by with a fire extinguisher to
save the day and further humiliate her, covering her in a thick
blanket of foam.
</P>
<P>
   In another farcical moment Mona, who has recently been crowned
Miss Illinois and is desperate for photo opportunities, rushes to
the aid of a woman who has gone into labor in a supermarket.
Instructing her young daughter Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) to
keep snapping pictures, she offers an impromptu serenade of ``The
Wind Beneath My Wings'' before loading the poor woman onto a
shopping cart and wheeling her to a hospital while Vanessa follows
dutifully snapping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' is at its most promising when it satirically
scratches the eyes out of its subject, although these farcical bits
are executed with a haranguing insistence that flattens much of
their humor. Responsibility for the movie's relentless shrillness
belongs both to Sally Field, who is making her insecure
feature-film debut as a director, and to Driver, who is woefully
miscast as Mona.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying a woman who grew up in a shack in Illinois with gross
redneck caricatures for parents, Driver strives determinedly to
carry off a role that at odd moments suggests a worst-nightmare
parody of Kathie Lee Gifford. But the higher Mona rises on the
pageant circuit, the more unbelievable her ascent becomes. For
Driver, although striking looking, is simply too old for the role
and utterly lacking in the sleek, airbrushed perkiness of the
typical American beauty contestant. Her features are irregular, her
smiles less than star bright, and the aura she exudes, even when
plastering on a fake, toothy grin, can only be described as dark
and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay by Jon Bernstein rides on an implausible soap
opera conceit more appropriate to a vintage Bette Davis weepie than
to a contemporary satire. Early in her career Mona has a child who
her saintly best friend, Ruby (Joey Lauren Adams), agrees to call
her own. Mona, Ruby and Vanessa (who doesn't know the truth) live
together until Ruby, who works as a nurse in an old-age home, is
wrongfully accused of helping a patient commit suicide and thrown
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Mona is forced to be a mother to the little girl who
loathes her for very good reasons. She ends up taking the child
with her to the finals of a Miss America-like competition in
Southern California, where a vindictive, nosy television reporter
(Leslie Stefanson) plans to expose her as a single mother and
disqualify her from the pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' wants to make a statement about sexism and beauty
pageants with their phony humanitarianism, bogus talent shows and
superficial values. But the movie is so nasty to its mostly female
characters that it feels harshly misogynist. The sole angel among
these screeching harpies is Ruby. Heaven knows why she puts up with
Mona, who treats her like a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically ``Beautiful'' teeters from a noisy sitcom (only
one step removed from ``The Beverly Hillbillies''), to brickbat
satire until it collapses in a pool of redemptive mush as Mona
belatedly and unconvincingly discovers her maternal instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It
includes profanity and off-color jokes.
</P>

 &HT;    Rising health care costs a challenge for employersBy Amy Schatz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Trilogy Software Corp. gushes about its ``cool''
benefits: Friday afternoon patio parties and a free concierge
service that ferries employees' cars to and from oil changes and
picks up dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   But Trilogy's most valuable benefit may be the one employees
take most for granted: free health insurance. Trilogy faces
double-digit health care cost increases this year, but isn't
passing along the higher costs to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a cost of doing business,'' said Mark Buchsbaum,
director of compensation and benefits at Trilogy. The company may
have a hard time swallowing a 20 percent increase, he said, but in
a tight labor market, it can't afford not to.
</P>
<P>
   Other Austin workers, including those in government and higher
education, aren't as fortunate. At the beginning of September,
state workers with dependents started paying an extra $30 in
premiums each month. Federal workers will see premiums rise in
January an average of 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses large and small are facing rising health care costs.
But the way employers are handling those increases is the latest
example of the widening chasm between Austin's New and Old Economy
companies. High-tech workers aren't just earning more than Austin's
traditional workforce, they're getting better benefits, too. Some
of the area's largest employers _ the state, University of Texas
and the City of Austin _ are passing along at least some of the
costs. But many high tech firms say they can't afford to in a
market with just 2 percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of health care is a national problem. Health
care costs are expected to increase 7 or 8 percent in 2001,
according to two recent surveys. The increases are even higher in
Texas, as health insurance companies struggle toward profitability
after years of heavy losses. Employers are seeing increases of 8
percent to 20 percent, depending on the insurance plan and the
employer's size, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, workers across the state will find
out the bad news: How much premiums and co-pays are going up for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have three dynamics at the same time: a very low
unemployment rate, the difficulty in retaining workers and there's
tremendous pressure on the health plans to turn around their
financial picture,'' said Mark Bailey, a health care analyst with
William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm in Dallas. Many
high tech firms are ``unable to shift costs back to employees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the case at Bluecurrent Inc., an Austin-based
company that helps customers track and update their computer
systems. Officials there are still in sticker shock after getting
word that their health insurance costs were going up 16 percent for
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it only went up about 8 percent. I was expecting
about that this year,'' said Tony Bastwick, Bluecurrent's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   He's shopping for a different plan to cover the company's 150
full-time employees, hoping to find one that will hold the cost
increase to about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been paying most employee premiums in a
preferred provider plan. But Bluecurrent may have to encourage
employees to join an HMO, instead of its PPO, which allows more
flexibility. And the company's hope of paying all of its employees'
premiums this year has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to do is look at your overall cost of keeping an
employee at (his) desk _ or in our case, on the street,'' Bastwick
said. ``One way is in the benefits and having the best health
benefits available.''
</P>
<P>
   MANAGED CARE CAN'T MANAGE RISING COSTS
</P>
<P>
   Managed care was supposed to stop escalating health care costs,
and for a while that's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care insurance companies lowered costs by aggressively
bargaining down reimbursements to hospitals and doctors while
limiting the access patients had to expensive medical treatments.
Employers were able to contain health insurance costs by
encouraging employees to leave expensive traditional
pay-for-service insurance plans and join HMOs, whether they wanted
to or not.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, health care costs had plummeted. HMOs further
lowered costs by undercutting each other in an effort to gain
market share in key markets. From 1994 through 1998, the average
cost of providing health insurance per employee grew at less than
the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But it couldn't go on forever. Health care analysts point to
three issues to explain the current increase in prices:
</P>
<P>
   The drive for larger enrollments led to astronomical losses for
HMOs in the past few years in Texas. Last year, Prudential Health
Care Plan Inc. lost more than $200 million, according to a report
filed with the state. Humana Health Plan of Texas Inc. lost more
than $50 million in 1999, five times its 1998 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Current rate increases are a result of ``catch-up pricing by
health insurers as they attempt to restore profitability after a
period of intense price competition between 1994 and 1998,''
according to a study released this week by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation, a philanthropy devoted to health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw was an artificial depression in terms of cost,''
said Bailey, the William Mercer analyst. ``There's been tremendous
pressure on the health plans to turn their financial picture
around.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, managed care companies also have been forced to raise
rates because of a 1998 rule from the Texas Department of
Insurance, which basically said that HMOs had to charge rates that
would keep them financially sound. ``In the past, (HMOs) had filed
rates that were below their cost,'' said Leah Rummel, executive
director of the Texas Association of Health Plans, an HMO industry
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Another strain on HMO finances has been acrimonious negotiations
with hospitals and physician groups. The federal Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 cut reimbursements to hospitals and other health care
providers. Those facilities and physicians began demanding higher
reimbursements from the one place they knew they could get them:
private insurers.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most widely acknowledged cause for price hikes
has been the rising cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, prescription drug costs rose an estimated 15 percent,
according to a 1999 study by William Mercer. Similar increases are
expected this year. Many employers encourage the use of mail-order
prescription plans through lower co-pays. Another popular option is
charging higher co-pays for drugs that are not on a list of
approved preferred drugs. Drugs on the list are generally generic
drugs or cheaper alternatives to newer, more expensive
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, more than 500,000 state workers had to start
paying more for prescription drugs. Drug co-pays rose from $10 to
$20 for a 90-day supply of preferred name-brand drugs and from $15
to $40 for preferred mail order drugs. State employees with full
family coverage are paying about $30 more in premiums every month.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs rose almost 8 percent _ or $71.5 million _
this year to cover state employees and retirees. But almost half of
that came out of the system's emergency reserve funds, which are
now depleted. Future increases are likely if the Legislature
doesn't provide more funding for the health plan, state officials
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL BUSINESS FACE GREATEST INCREASES
</P>
<P>
   Because they have less bargaining power with health insurance
companies, small businesses often see the highest increases.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Triplett, chief operating officer of the Business Success
Center in Austin, said small-business owners desperately need
affordable options.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the top issue nationwide for small-business owners,''
she said. ``It's just crazy out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-business owners said they are trying to swallow the higher
costs without passing them on to their employees, since they're
also competing for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this particular climate in Austin, I would do anything to
keep the people I have on hand,'' said Max Thomas, owner of Max's
catering in Austin. Thomas said it's costing him about $1,000 a
month to provide coverage for four full-time workers. If that cost
were to double, he might be hard-pressed to keep it up, but he
would try. ``I just don't want the turnover,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Guiltless Gourmet, which makes low-fat snack foods, the
company has tried to keep rates reasonable for its 10 local
employees and their children, despite an 18 percent increase in
insurance costs from Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Still, the company
cannot afford to underwrite the cost of covering spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Kirk, the office manager, covers herself and her two
little girls for $380 a year, but if she added her husband to the
policy, the cost would be $4,754. Between child care costs, a
mortgage and her husband's efforts to launch a new business _
they've spent $24,000 on it since April _ the couple decided they
could not afford insurance for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money's not there to pick him up . . . without cutting
into the food budget or the kids,'' Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the region's public employers have more bargaining
power than small businesses, they have also seen costs rise
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The Employees Retirement System of Texas, which administers
health plans for the state workers, said recent premium hikes were
necessary to avert a fiscal crisis. State employees see the
increases first because they are on a fiscal year, not a calendar
year.
</P>
<P>
   The state is paying 10.8 percent, or $95.7 million, more this
year than last to cover employees and their dependents. About
two-thirds of that is coming from an emergency reserve fund, and
the system is asking for $697 million from the Legislature over the
next two-year budget cycle to forestall further increases.
</P>
<P>
   But employees say that a crisis as grave as a budget shortfall
looms for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state lost about 18 percent of its employees.
This year, employees are seeing health care costs devour a large
portion of the $100 monthly pay raise that lawmakers gave them in
the last session. The battle for the raise, the first in six years,
was hard-fought, and employees were angry that its real value was
pared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salaries for state employees have always lagged to varying
degrees behind the private sector,'' said Gary Anderson, president
of the Texas Public Employees Association. ``The value of benefits
used to be kind of an offset to lucrative wages in the private
sector. But the evidence is showing that the value of benefits is
decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   The news is little better in local school districts, which are
asking employees to pay more out-of-pocket for health care in the
midst of a teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, where coverage is more generous than in smaller,
rural districts, premiums for employees with dependents rose by 7
percent and prescription drug co-pays have increased from $10 to
$15 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven percent is significant, especially when teachers only
got a three-percent pay raise,'' said Louis Malfaro, co-president
of the union Education Austin. ``While the pay might not be good,
benefits would be an inducement to me to stay in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, City of Austin employees are forking over $55 a month
more in premiums to cover their families and $5 more in for
prescription drugs, said benefits manager Delia Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dell Computer Corp., which saw its health care costs rise
last year, would not disclose any information about the coming
year. Employees will find out any changes to the company's health
plan in early November, when the company starts its annual open
enrollment process, said spokeswoman Neisha Frank.
</P>
<P>
   But at Exterprise Inc., which develops software that helps match
buyers with suppliers on the Internet, company officials plan to
shoulder health insurance increases of about 9 percent this year.
The two-year old Austin startup pays health care premiums for its
160 employees. But officials now wonder how long they'll be able to
afford to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay for premiums because it helps people take the leap of
faith to join us. They expect to get competitive pay and
benefits,'' said David Hughen, vice president of human
resources.``We find that in this marketplace, you have to save
solid benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, next year the company hopes to have enough employees so
it can offer a cafeteria-style benefits plan, which gives employees
more choices but also decreases costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of folks are finding ways to share the
burden of these costs with employees,'' said Hughen.
</P>
<P>
   Absorbing double digit increases is just ``not sustainable over
time,'' he said. ``That's a very high cost of doing business.''

NUMBER OF INSURED AMERICANS UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN A

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After rising for 11 years, the number of Americans
without health insurance declined last year, to 42.6 million, a
reduction of 1.7 million from 1998, the Census Bureau reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of people without insurance also declined for the
first time since 1987 _ to 15.5 percent in 1999, from 16.3 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The robust economy and an expansion of government programs
contributed to the decline, economists and health policy experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, a 30-year low, many
employers have found that they must offer health insurance to
attract and retain workers. In addition, low-income people are
receiving coverage from government programs created or expanded in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Mills, a statistician at the Census Bureau, said,
``The driving force behind this improvement was an increase in the
likelihood of people having employment-based health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people with health insurance through their
employers rose last year by 3.4 million, to 172 million. This
change accounted for 85 percent of the increase in the number of
people with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For children, as for the population as a whole, coverage
increased last year. The number of uninsured children declined to
10 million last year, from 11.1 million in 1998. The proportion of
children without coverage declined as well, to 13.9 percent from
15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed the new data, saying: ``I am
extremely pleased with today's announcement. I believe it validates
our health care and economic policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured is still nearly 3 million higher than
when Clinton took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress rejected his proposal for universal health
insurance in 1994, Clinton has been advocating smaller steps to
expand coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau said that government programs, including
Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program, had
helped increase coverage among poor children and youngsters with
family incomes just above the poverty level ($13,290 for a family
of three).
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the bureau said, in the last year, there was no
change in the proportion of the population (24 percent) covered by
government health insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people without insurance rose by an average of
more than a million a year from 1987 to 1998. The trend puzzled and
frustrated health care experts because it persisted in a strong
economy with low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the number of Americans with
employer-sponsored health insurance has been creeping up. But the
changes received little notice because they coincided with the
erosion of other types of coverage. For example, millions of
low-income people, including former welfare recipients, were losing
Medicaid. That erosion stopped last year. The number of people
covered by Medicaid held steady around 28 million, the Census
Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Genevieve M. Kenney, an economist at the Urban Institute here,
said, ``The percentage of poor children without coverage has
dropped back to where it was in 1996,'' the year Congress passed a
landmark law limiting access to welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, many employers have seen their health
insurance premiums rise by 10 percent to 30 percent, mainly because
of increased spending on prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
consumer group, said: ``The new Census Bureau numbers are welcome
news, but no cause for celebration. It's like a morning drizzle
after a prolonged drought.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Census Bureau made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than one-fifth of all poor children, and nearly one-third
of all poor people, are still uninsured. Nearly half of poor people
who worked full-time last year were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   _ Households making less than $50,000 accounted for almost all
of the increase in insurance coverage. Among those with incomes of
$50,000 or more, there was no change in the proportion having
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hispanic people were more likely to be uninsured than any
other major racial or ethnic group. About 33 percent of Hispanic
people, 21.2 percent of blacks, 20.8 percent of Asian-Americans and
11 percent of non-Hispanic whites were uninsured last year.
</P>
<P>
   To compare states, the Census Bureau suggested using three-year
averages of data from 1997 to 1999. By this measure, the proportion
of people without health insurance ranged from a high of 24.1
percent in Texas to a low of 8.8 percent in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, New Mexico, California and Louisiana also had high
proportions of people without insurance. The comparable figures
were low for Rhode Island, Hawaii and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of people without health insurance was slightly
above the national average in New York, where 17.1 percent were
uninsured. The figures were below the national average in
Connecticut (11.5 percent) and New Jersey (15.4 percent).

MILOSEVIC'S RIVAL OFFERS A NEW VISION OF SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Should Vojislav Kostunica take office as
Yugoslavia's new president, he wants, he says, to help shape a
country with a different sense of itself and its place in the
world, less isolated and neurotic, a normal European nation with a
good dose of skepticism toward U.S. foreign-policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of conversations in recent weeks, before and after
what he and his supporters insist was his victory in elections last
Sunday, Kostunica has outlined a vision that reads broadly like
this:
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia needs to redefine itself, with its republics, Serbia
and Montenegro, working out a new relationship if they can. It also
needs to work within the U.N. Security Council resolution governing
Kosovo to find a way to allow Serbs to return there with security,
within a democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, he said that Serbia needed to confront its own
past, especially in the last decade of Yugoslavia's civil wars.
Such a self-examination, he said, has been blocked so far both by
the incumbency of Slobodan Milosevic, who helped start those wars,
and by the nature of the regime that Milosevic built: a Communist
base infused by nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica (pronounced kosh-TOON-eet-zah), a 56-year-old
constitutional lawyer, said he would favor a form of state ``truth
commission'' of independent historians and experts to examine the
crimes and victims of all the parties to the Yugoslav wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a war in the former Yugoslavia, and we must try to
face the results and consequences of this war one way or another,''
he said. ``We must look at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Kostunica traveled with a small retinue
all over Serbia, criticizing the socialist regime of Milosevic,
which he said had distorted the country's interests. His choice for
a national anthem is the Serbian one from the 19th century, he
often mentions God in his speeches, and he is proud of his family's
bourgeois and anti-Communist traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, nationalism is a natural state of mind, to be one who
belongs to a nation,'' he said. Such national feeling _ which might
be called patriotism elsewhere _ is not much different than that
felt by the British or the French, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In his criticism of the United States and its policies, there is
more than a touch of the continental European view _ often
articulated by the French _ that the ``hyperpower'' of the United
States, with its enormous wealth and capacities, is often
unconscious and unheeding of the dignity and interests of other
nations. And Americans, he has said, often presume that what they
define as good is good for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But being Serbian and European doesn't mean being
anti-American,'' Kostunica said. ``I have no stereotypes and
prejudices. What concerns me is state interests and policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, who translated the Federalist Papers into
Serbo-Croatian in 1981, does see the Hague Tribunal on war crimes
in the former Yugoslavia as ``an instrument of American policy and
not of international law.'' He criticizes the tribunal for refusing
to examine possible war crimes by NATO leaders for the bombing of
civilian targets here (as both Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch also believe). And he has said that he will not turn
Milosevic, indicted last year over alleged war crimes in Kosovo,
over to the Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica refuses to be explicit now over whether he would turn
over Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the two Bosnian Serb
leaders indicted by the tribunal. They might be the price for what
Kostunica wants: a reentry into European institutions like the
Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, and the restoration of Yugoslavia as a respected member
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech this week celebrating his apparent victory over
Milosevic, Kostunica spoke of showing the world ``that we are
worthy of the tremendous historic task, worthy of our ancestors,
worthy of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   He also speaks of the Serbian nation and of its historical
tragedies, of the enormous number of Serbian refugees inside
Serbia, of the need to help ``Serb brothers'' in the Bosnian Serb
republic, but with the clear acknowledgment that they live in a
different state, in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   And he says bluntly: ``Those who think that Serbia cannot exist
as a nation without Kosovo are wrong.'' Kosovo, like Jerusalem, he
said, ``is one of those problems without a solution, that must be
managed,'' even if it goes against ``the American view that every
problem can be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Nenad Stefanovic, a journalist for Vreme, an independent weekly,
said that Kostunica supported the Bosnian Serbs in the 1992-95
Bosnian war and _ like many Serbs _ backed their right to secede
from a Bosnia governed by Muslims and Croats. However, Kostunica
rejected the brutal expulsion and slaying of non-Serbs and never
supported paramilitary troops. ``He was a nationalist concerned for
the fate of his nation, but never against other nations,''
Stefanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party, regards Kostunica's
politics as traditionalist and even primitive, but without the
murderous and malignant nationalism manipulated by those, like
Milosevic and the late Croatian leader Franjo Tudjman, who led
Yugoslavia into disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, Djindjic said, ``is a necessary bridge'' between the
politics of the past and a more modern European future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kostunica is a strong advocate of the rule of law, of an
independent judiciary, of a free press and university, and of
constitutional agreements binding states.
</P>
<P>
   After NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia last year, Kostunica said,
``I've realized that my views can be a normal, authentic policy
that suits most of the people in Serbia,'' and not just the
democratic opposition, from which he keeps a certain distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And suddenly I find this new policy of mine is respected
abroad,'' he said this week, grinning _ ``by Europeans more, the
Americans less, but even there with some understanding.''

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   _ IOC seeks to protect Olympics' cyber future
</P>
<P>
   _ Olympic reputation unscathed by drug scandals
</P>
<P>
   IOC TOO LATE: The International Olympic Committee is waging what
many believe to be a futile corporate war in an attempt to protect
the word ``Olympic.'' The IOC has hired a British firm to monitor _
and then legally hound _ any Internet sites using ``Olympic'' in
their addresses. So far, 1,800 sites have been told to cease and
desist, and the IOC has filed suit in federal court in the United
States to protect the O-word and its five-ring symbol. ``Technology
has completely overtaken the IOC,'' Ioannis Synodinos, an official
with the Athens 2004 Summer Games, told the San Jose Mercury News.
``The Internet is a huge invasion, and the IOC is trying to stop
it, but it can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also now forbids Olympic athletes from writing
Internet diaries on their own Web sites or for their hometown
newspapers. Many Olympians have built their own sites _ aided in
Sydney, oddly enough, by official Olympic sponsor IBM _ but they
are prohibited from selling their diaries to any publication during
the Games. ``Maybe in 2004 but definitely in 2008, that will be the
first real Internet Olympics,'' says Synodinos. ``People will have
their PCs and they will watch the Olympics in the toilet _ or
anywhere else they want to. Billions of people can use a PC and you
can't deny it. It will be like radio. You won't be able to deny its
use.''
</P>
<P>
   SURVEY SAYS: Call it hypocrisy. While 98 percent believe that
the use of performance enhancing drugs is unethical only 7 percent
believe the problem has reached epidemic proportions at the Olympic
Games. So despite the recent rash of drug-use allegations, most
Americans have a favorable opinion of Olympic athletes. ``Americans
believe that steroid use is a big problem, but they feel it is more
of an international problem than an American one,'' said J. Nadine
Gelberg, Director of Harris Interactive's Sports and Entertainment
Practice, which conducted the survey.

   Michael Johnson on the apparent false start that was not called
against American John Capel in the 200 meter finals:
</P>

   ``John Capel was robbed. He false-started, and it should have
been called back. Once a runner gets in the set position, he can't
move. Capel moved, and it wasn't called back. By the time the gun
went off, he was rocking back, trying to get back to a set
position. He was totally off balance. It's very unfortunate because
I believe he would have been the winner.''

 &HT;    Pedroso edges Taurima; Americans shut out for first time
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ With apologies to Carl Lewis, Jesse Owens and Co.,
American long-jumping had never suffered a night quite like this.
Never before had U.S. long jumpers been shut out of a medal at the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough that Cuban favorite Ivan Pedroso walked off with
the gold medal that Lewis had claimed at the past four Olympics.
But the only American good enough to make the final proved to be
Dwight Phillips, a relative greenhorn in the event who finished
eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, as he stood shaking his head, world record-holder
Mike Powell offered his coaching services to get the Americans up
to speed. Maybe he'd even come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to steer some of these guys who are in the CBA
(Continental Basketball Association) to the long jump,'' Powell
said. ``I'll teach them how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the gnashing of teeth inside the Olympic Stadium,
silver medalist Jai Taurima wandered by, an unlit filtered
cigarette in his right hand, a lighter in the other. The Aussie
enjoys pack-a-day habit and isn't afraid to down a few cold
Fosters.
</P>
<P>
   It was Taurima who created a mini-stink leading up to the Games,
dismissing the ``dark'' American jumpers as a ``bunch of
dribblers'' and suggesting they collectively don't perform well in
chilly weather, or on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys write (trash) about me,'' said Taurima, his
medal hanging around his neck. ``Look who is laughing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he regretted his earlier remarks, Taurima said, ``No
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the nicotine habit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like all the other guys,'' he said. ``The long jump
is a pretty easy event to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The extroverted Taurima resembles radio shock-jock Howard Stern
with his scraggly dark hair and sunglasses. He has a handful of
tattoos, including a big S for Superman (``I think I can fly'') on
his left biceps.
</P>
<P>
   On his home stage, Taurima used the energy of the crowd to
almost steal gold from Pedroso, a three-time world champion. The
Aussie had three leads during the competition before Pedroso nailed
his winning mark on his sixth and final jump.
</P>
<P>
   Pedroso was bothered by a hamstring injury in Atlanta in 1996,
barely made the final and finished 12th. Here, the 28-year-old
Cuban won with an effort of 28 feet, 3/4-inch, just ahead of
Taurima's personal-best 27-10 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a competitor,'' Pedroso said. ``I know it is not over
until the last jump. It'd been my dream to win this medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips finished eighth with a best of 26-5 1/2, fouling on
four of his six jumps. He's considered one of the top young jumpers
after recently shifting his focus from sprinting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my best,'' Phillips said. ``I'm disappointed I didn't
win an Olympic medal, but I plan to be back in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Americans must wait to make Taurima eat his
words.

 &HT;    Final greased for Greece
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ In the men's 200 meters, Greece is the word.
</P>
<P>
   A race left wide open by a hamstring injury epidemic in the U.S.
trials was won Thursday by Konstantinos Kenteris of Greece, hardly
a sprint hotbed.
</P>
<P>
   Kenteris benefited from the absence of Michael Johnson and
Maurice Greene, as well as the belated start by U.S. trials
champion John Capel, to deliver the host nation of the 2004 Games
its fifth and least likely gold medal in Sydney. Americans Coby
Miller and Capel brought up the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared nobody,'' Kenteris said. ``From the moment I stepped
into the country, I realized the others didn't have anything better
than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Capel appeared to. He blasted through his semifinal
heat in 19.85 seconds, easily the best.
</P>
<P>
   But in the blocks for the finals, Capel rocked forward, then
back. As he was in retreat, the starting beep sounded. He ran well
but never recovered from the others' head start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I false-started,'' Capel said to his manager after
the race, meaning he expected the runners to be reset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ready to run, no question,'' Charlie Wells said of his
crushed client, a University of Florida dropout this year, where he
played wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Kenteris is a former 400-meter man who coped with injuries
during the mid-'90s, partly caused by one leg being longer than the
other. The only agony he has felt recently is from a sunken ferry
that killed scores this week in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will relieve some of the pain,'' he said.

FDA APPROVES ABORTION PILL

 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday that it had
approved the marketing of an abortion-inducing pill, the first
alternative to surgical abortion approved in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, a prescription drug, will be available to doctors in
about four weeks, its distributor said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, mifepristone, or RU-486, will allow doctors like
family practitioners and obstetricians to offer abortions outside
of specialty clinics, and it will allow women to have abortions in
the privacy of their homes up to seven weeks after their last
menstrual period.
</P>
<P>
   Although most women who seek abortions do not do so until later
in their pregnancies, the drug has taken on immense symbolic
importance for both supporters and opponents of abortion rights.
Many supporters of abortion rights have said its approval would
transform the struggle over legal abortion, making the procedure
more accessible, more private and harder for opponents of abortion
to identify women who are having the procedure and doctors who are
providing it. Approval of the drug immediately brought out the
contrasts in the views on abortion of Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Gore said he was pleased with the
decision and Bush said it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Jane E. Henney, the FDA commissioner, said in an
interview, ``Politics had no role in this decision.'' It was based,
Henney said, on persuasive data showing the drug is safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The drug will be distributed under the name Mifeprex by Danco
Laboratories of New York City, a company formed specifically to
find someone to make the drug and then to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of abortion rights said they were elated by the health
agency's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I seen anything like this,'' said Gloria Feldt, the
president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which
participated in clinical trials of the drug. ``Never has there been
a drug approval that has been through such an arduous political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldt called the drug ``the most significant technological
advance in women's reproductive health care since the birth control
pill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a setback for those who oppose abortions, and some of
them saw it as a contradiction in Clinton administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should give people pause,'' said Dr. Richard Land,
the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and
religious liberty commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how they square this with making abortions safe,
legal and rare,'' Land said, citing an oft-repeated Clinton
administration goal. ``It will make them more plentiful and less
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, the health agency set relatively few
restrictions on doctors' freedom to prescribe the drug, beyond
requiring that the doctors be able to determine the length of time
that a woman has been pregnant and that they make sure that women
who receive mifepristone have ready access to surgical abortions,
should they need them.
</P>
<P>
   Women will be given written instructions on the pill's use and
its side effects and their doctor must sign a statement saying that
they have read the instructions and will comply with them exactly.
The women must also agree to have a surgical abortion if the pills
do not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   A woman first takes mifepristone, which blocks the action of
progesterone, a hormone required to maintain a pregnancy, and 36 to
48 hours later takes a second drug, misoprostol, which makes the
uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue. In clinical trials,
the drug combination failed to result in complete abortion in about
5 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also required that the Population Council, a nonprofit
group that sponsored Danco's application to market mifepristone,
keep track of how many women suffer serious side effects and the
number of cases in which it fails to induce abortion. The council
will also audit doctors to see whether they and the women taking
the drug are signing the patient agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although advocates of abortion rights have been pushing for
approval of mifepristone for years, it is not clear how many U.S.
women will choose it. The drug can be used only until seven weeks
after a woman's last menstrual period, and just one-third of
abortions performed in the United States occur at that stage
according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that
conducts research on reproductive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, side effects like excessive bleeding are extremely
rare in first-trimester surgical abortions, and abortions are legal
even into the third trimester of pregnancy in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors said they anticipated many women seeking abortion
would prefer the surgical approach, since the procedure usually is
over in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that mifepristone is highly effective and
there are good results most of the time,'' said Dr. Warren Hern,
director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado. But. she said,
citing side effects like excessive bleeding and incomplete
abortions, ``people have a way of denying these problems with the
drug and saying it's a magic bullet. It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldt of Planned Parenthood said women in clinical trials said
they liked mifepristone abortions because they felt more natural
than surgical ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel more in charge, more in control of their personal
health,'' Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   But Olivia Gans, who is the director of American Victims of
Abortion at the National Right to Life Committee, said she worried
that women might not understand what they were getting into when
they took the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just seeking another way to deliberately end a life,''
she said. ``How honest are we going to be with the American public
about what's at stake with this drug?''
</P>
<P>
   The drug's marketer, Danco Laboratories, will not identify the
drug's maker or its location. Heather O'Neill, a Danco spokeswoman,
said that the company had not yet set a price for the drug but that
she expected that insurance companies and government programs that
now pay for surgical abortions would also pay for mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who want to use mifepristone may find that insurance
questions and FDA restrictions are just part of their requirements.
In some states, abortion laws might restrict the drug's use. For
example, many states require that abortion providers register and
report every abortion. Some have detailed requirements for the
design of offices and clinics. Some states require that fetal
remains be examined by a doctor and in North Dakota, the remains
must be cremated, incinerated, or buried, the law says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some doctors who could administer the drug may
choose not to do so. ``Any doctor who regularly does abortions in
most states has been subjected to extra scrutiny from law
enforcement _ they don't fool around with this,'' said Janet
Benshoof, the president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, a legal advocacy organization that has represented abortion
clinics in legal disputes. Benshoof said that in many states, the
laws written for surgical abortions also apply to pill-induced
abortions and that some states specifically include pill-induced
abortions in their regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite mifepristone's great potential to improve medical
services for women, anti-abortion state legislatures have already
erected a labyrinth of laws restricting all abortion,'' Benshoof
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mifepristone was first synthesized 20 years ago, in France, and
came on the market in Europe more than a decade ago. But from the
beginning its introduction into the United States was entangled in
abortion politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Land said, he went to Europe with a delegation of
opponents of abortion, like the National Right to Life Committee
and the Knights of Columbus, to tell executives at Roussel-Uclaf
SA, the drug's maker, and its parent company, Hoechst AG, that they
would face boycotts and protests if they attempted to sell the drug
in the United States. (Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc last
December and the merged company is called Aventis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Hoechst that it would be unfortunate if they were to
market the drug in the U.S. since they had an unfortunate history
when it came to death-dealing materials,'' Land said. The company
was part of a conglomerate that had a major interest in the
chemical used in German gas chambers in World War II. ``We knew and
we wanted them to know that we knew,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Roussel-Uclaf said that it would not seek
approval to market mifepristone here; without a new drug
application, the FDA could not fully assess the drug.
</P>
<P>
   When he first came into office, in 1993, President Clinton asked
federal regulators to assess whether the drug was safe and should
be sold in this country. Dr. David A. Kessler, who was commissioner
of the FDA from October of 1990 until March of 1997, prevailed upon
Roussel-Uclaf to donate its patent to the Population Council, which
wanted to sponsor clinical trials in the United States and find a
company to produce and market the drug. In May of 1994,
Roussel-Uclaf donated its patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did think that we should have a chance to evaluate
the drug,'' Kessler said. ``We didn't think that politics should
get in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Population Council presented its data on the
drug's safety and efficacy to an advisory committee of the health
agency, which recommended the drug be approved for marketing in
this country. But the Population Council still had no one willing
to manufacture the drug. As a result, the agency could not issue
final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't approve a drug unless the drug exists, unless you
can inspect the plant,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some doctors have been using a cancer
chemotherapy, methotrexate, to induce abortions. This use is legal,
but because methotrexate was not extensively tested and is not
approved as an abortion drug its use is not widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to announce the approval of mifepristone, Henney,
the F.D.A. commissioner, said, reflects the FDA's own six-month
interval to rule on applications to market a drug. Danco submitted
crucial information six months ago, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go back again to saying that politics did not play a
role in this,'' Henney said. ``The people who know me and the
people who know this agency know that we make our decisions based
on the scientific evidence that we have before us. These are
scientific decisions.''

INVESTORS, SEEING END OF TRYING QUARTER, PUSH MARKETS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reassuring comments by Procter &AMP; Gamble about
earnings helped pull stock prices out of a late-September slide
Thursday as two major gauges posted their biggest advance since May
30 and the Nasdaq market jumped 3.34 percent to regain more than
half the ground lost in the preceding five sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and investors were relieved that an unusually bloody
quarter with many warnings about reduced corporate earnings was
coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the optimism evaporated after the formal 4 p.m.
close when Apple Computer warned that its fourth-quarter earnings
would be below estimates. Shares of Apple, which had climbed $4.56,
to $53.50 during regular hours, plunged more than 24 percent to
around $29.19 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index gained 122.02 points, to 3,778.32,
narrowed its decline so far this year to 7.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which is also heavily
weighted with technology issues, gained 31.72 points, or 2.2
percent, to 1,458.29.
</P>
<P>
   For the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, which joined the
S&AMP;P in posting its biggest gain since late May, it was Procter &AMP;
Gamble and J.P. Morgan each accounting for more than 30 points of a
surge totaling 195.70 points, or 1.8 percent. At 10,824.06, the Dow
is 5.85 percent lower than at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, down $1.75, to $93.38, was the biggest drag
on the Dow industrials, with Eastman Kodak, pummeled after warning
of lower profits on Tuesday, losing another $1.19, to $41.31. Of
the 30 Dow stocks, 23 advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus Communications, which agreed to buy Global Crossing's Web
unit, lost $4.13, to $49.13.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was the most actively traded stock, with 90.5
million shares changing hands. It closed at $59.31, up $2.00, after
trading as low as $54.63.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein cut his rating of the stock
and also that of Nortel Networks. Nortel rose $3.7213, to $63.00.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial stocks were standout gainers, with Lehman
Brothers, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan up more than five points
each after it was announced that Dain Rauscher, up $13, to $92.88,
was being sold to the Royal Bank of Canada.

PIERRE TRUDEAU DIES AT 80 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a
provocative political figure who fought French-Canadian separatism,
died Thursday in his Montreal home. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   With the motto ``Reason Over Passion'' hanging above his desk,
Trudeau served as prime minister from 1968 to 1979, and again from
1980 to 1984. After retirement, he continued to decry
``unscrupulous politicians'' advocating independence for his native
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   An active canoeist and skier _ he climbed Mount Athabasca in the
Canadian Rockies in his 60s _ Trudeau suffered in recent years from
Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although sometimes unpopular, particularly in Western Canada,
Trudeau grew in stature after retiring to his Montreal law firm
with only occasional forays against separatists and those
advocating so-called ``special status'' for Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the great prime ministers of our country and
there has been an outpouring of respect even among those who
disagreed with him,'' said Iona Campagnolo, a British Columbia
educator who was a cabinet minister under Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   Former British Columbia Premier Dave Barrett, a political foe of
Trudeau, described him as ``an intellectual giant with a lovely
touch of arrogance. Humility was not his strong suit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He intellectually towered over 98 percent of Canadian
politicians, and for that matter 98 percent of North American
politicians,'' Barrett added.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was cared for in his final days by his surviving sons
Justin and Sacha, products of his 1971 marriage, at the age of 51,
to 22-year-old Margaret Sinclar of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The couple later divorced, but two years ago the family was
briefly reunited by tragedy. A third son, Michel, was killed when
swept into an alpine lake by an avalanche while on an early winter
cross-country ski trip to Kokanee Glacier Park in eastern British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute Thursday, President Clinton said Trudeau ``opened a
dynamic new era in Canadian politics and helped establish Canada's
unique imprint on the global stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was the antithesis of today's ``pander bear''
politicians. He confronted critics and confounded interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I sell the Canadian farmers' wheat?'' Trudeau once
asked an interviewer, a remark that angered the Prairies. When
surrounded by angry striking postal workers in Montreal, Trudeau
rolled down his car window and offered an earthy suggestion
regarding , told them: ``Mangez de la merde!''
</P>
<P>
   At a Liberal Party fund-raising dinner in Vancouver, many in the
audience seethed when he said that British Columbians were hiding
behind their mountains from the problems of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau displayed a sometimes-impudent humor, once performing a
pirouette behind the back of Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him once standing at the top of a ski run at
Whistler, talking to reporters,'' said Campagnolo. ``He was toying
with them, saying, `Well, you know the quality of snow in British
Columbia is never as good as in Quebec.' He was extremely clever.
His intelligence was always at play.''
</P>
<P>
   A world traveler, human rights advocate and sometime law
professor, Trudeau won election to Canada's House of Commons in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   He burst on the national scene as Justice Minister, advocating
reform of Canada's laws against abortion and homosexuality with the
famous line: ``The state has no place in the bedrooms of the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was picked as leader of the ruling Liberal Party and
became prime minister in April of 1968, in a campaign described as
``our Camelot'' by Roger Simmons, another former Trudeau cabinet
minister and Canada's consul-general in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Late in that campaign, Trudeau was watching a St. Jean-Baptiste
Day parade in Montreal. Separatist extremists began throwing rocks.
Other dignitaries scattered. Trudeau sat in his seat, staring
straight ahead, as projectiles flew past his head.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was to lead his party to four election victories, the
last coming in January 1980, nine months after he was briefly
ousted from power. He bounded onto the stage of Ottawa's Chateau
Laurier Hotel, and declared: ``Well, welcome to the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trudeau was our single combat warrior,'' author Richard Gwynn
wrote in his biography, ``The Northern Magus.'' His main
confrontations came with those who would take his native Quebec out
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   When separatist extremists kidnapped a British diplomat in
October 1970 and killed a provincial cabinet minister they were
holding, Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act. The act suspended
civil liberties and permitted police to detain hundreds of people
without charges. Troops patrolled Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The ``October Crisis'' saw a reporter verbally joust with
Trudeau over how far he would go to preserve law and order. Trudeau
ended the debate with three words: ``Just watch me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trudeau also gave Canada its own constitution and Charter of
Rights. ``Canada is a much more just society because he was prime
minister,'' Campagnolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau instituted a national policy of bilingualism, requiring
that French as well as English appear in all Canadian government
publications and in packaging. Once, at breakfast, when his then
mother-in-law objected to bilingual packaging, Trudeau told her to
just turn the cereal box around.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was sometimes impatient with fellow politicians, even
those with whom he shared the cabinet table.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treated you as an equal until you showed him you weren't,''
said Simmons. ``He would test you. He would test you very quickly.
He would always have read his briefing materials. You got one shot.
If you weren't prepared, you never got back in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau fought Quebec separatists, and lampooned those Canadian
politicians who submitted to what he called the ``blackmail'' of
demands that special status for the French-Canadian province be
enshrined in Canada's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his fellow Quebeckers, Trudeau wrote in 1996: ``They
should not look for their `identity' and their `distinctiveness' in
the constitution but rather in their confidence in themselves and
in the full exercise of their rights as citizens equal to all other
citizens of Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Trudeau give any quarter to the ``blue-eyed sheiks'' of
Western Canada who wanted riches at the expense of other provinces.
He enacted a National Energy Program to put strict controls on
domestic oil prices at a time when the world price for oil was
soaring. Oil-rich Alberta howled in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The apex of Trudeau's career as single-combat warrior came in
the 1980 Quebec referendum on a form of succession from Canada. The
separatist forces were led by Quebec Premier Rene Levesque.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, one separatist leader sneered at the prime
minister's middle name _ Elliott _ suggesting that Trudeau was not
a true Quebecker.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau lashed back against the politics of race, noting that
his mother's maiden name was Grace Elliott and proclaiming pride in
his mixed ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum went down to a resounding defeat. At the
campaign's closing rally, Trudeau stood for minutes as the
pro-Canada crowd took up a chant: ``E-l-l-i-o-t-t! E-l-l-i-o-t-t.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage that night was Canada's present prime minister, Jean
Chretien, who said Thursday: ``Pierre Trudeau, the embodiment of
the dream of a just society, has left us. He is gone but his
unfinished work remains _ our country, Canada.''

CENSUS NOTES INCREASE IN HEALTH COVERAGE FOR AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By   ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After rising for 11 years, the number of Americans
without health insurance declined last year, to 42.6 million, a
reduction of 1.7 million from 1998, the Census Bureau reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of people without insurance also declined for the
first time since 1987 _ to 15.5 percent in 1999, from 16.3 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The robust economy and an expansion of government programs
contributed to the decline, economists and health policy experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, a 30-year low, many
employers have found that they must offer health insurance to
attract and retain workers. In addition, low-income people are
receiving coverage from government programs created or expanded in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Mills, a statistician at the Census Bureau, said,
``The driving force behind this improvement was an increase in the
likelihood of people having employment-based health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people with health insurance through their
employers rose last year by 3.4 million, to 172 million. This
change accounted for 85 percent of the increase in the number of
people with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For children, as for the population as a whole, coverage
increased last year. The number of uninsured children declined to
10 million last year, from 11.1 million in 1998. The proportion of
children without coverage declined as well, to 13.9 percent from
15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured is still nearly three million higher
than when President Clinton took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau said that government programs, including
Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program, had
helped increase coverage among poor children and youngsters with
family incomes just above the poverty level ($13,290 for a family
of three).
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the bureau said, in the last year, there was no
change in the proportion of the population (24 percent) covered by
government health insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people without insurance rose by an average of
more than a million a year from 1987 to 1998. The trend puzzled and
frustrated health care experts because it persisted in a strong
economy with low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
consumer group, said: ``The new Census Bureau numbers are welcome
news, but no cause for celebration. It's like a morning drizzle
after a prolonged drought.''

 &HT;    Runyan's strategy works to perfection
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Marla Runyan was wandering through Hartsfield
International in 1996, looking for her ride into town. Through her
blurry vision, 20-300 in one eye and 20-400 in another, she spotted
one of those signs held by chauffeurs with a name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that say Marla Runyan?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The legally blind 1,500-meter runner, first Paralympian ever to
compete in the able-bodied Games, cannot detect the clock on the
scoreboard, or even the hands on her watch. But Runyan could see
that only five first-heat runners finished in front of her
Thursday, and that was sufficient for a berth in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Nos. 6 and 7 runners in the next heat bettered her time
of 4:06.14, she would have been packing clothes and visual aids and
heading home. But she earned one of two wild-card spots in the cast
of 12 after the five automatic qualifiers from each heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel so fortunate,'' she said. ``A lot of positive
forces are helping me through.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Runyan does not bolt for the lead. She did so Thursday
with a plan in mind. Even if she did not hold on, she hoped a
mid-race kick would quicken the pace enough to give her a strong
time in sixth or seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan ran the first lap in an outside lane to avoid getting
caught in traffic. She gunned to the lead halfway through, then
began to back up _ all the way to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   A late surge moved her into sixth, and into Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I made it,'' she said, grinning broadly. ``I have
nothing to lose in the final.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan was charged up after seeing some Paralympian pals in a
pair of exhibition wheelchair races sprinkled between the night's
Olympic events. Louise Savage of Australia, winner of the 800
meters on wheels, and Saul Mendoza of Mexico, slickest in the men's
1,500, have trained at the Roosevelt Institute in Warm Springs.
Mendoza lives there most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan believes she is becoming more acclimated to running with
limited sight. ``Ultimately,'' she said, ``I'm going to surprise a
lot of people (in the 1,500) in the years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan's teammate, Suzy Favor Hamilton, running better than ever
in her third Games, punched in the second-fastest 1,500. Loping
through the darkness in sunglasses, she closed in 4:05.24, behind
only Nouria Merah-Benida of Algeria.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of
Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a
unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism,
died Thursday in Montreal. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau had suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate
cancer and, more recently, pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Trudeau succeeded in altering his
country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical
flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen proud
that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two
spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month
hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the
Conservatives. When, finally, in 1984 he chose to step down after a
meditative walk in the snow, he was the longest serving Western
leader of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic
electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political
equivalent to the paroxysms evoked by the rise of the Beatles.
During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of
the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation.
Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being
pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau supervised the process by which the country replaced its
ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered
economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his
country at odds with the leadership of Canada's only neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   While firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive
to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Trudeau saw to
it that the role of the French language was reinforced when the
entire country was made officially bilingual in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau recognized Communist China long before the United States
did. He led sometimes quixotic campaigns for world peace and
nuclear disarmament while allying himself closely with such
Socialist leaders as Olav Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of Germany
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Canadians, his greatest achievement was his
successful struggle against the Quebec separatist movement. After
bombings, bank robberies and kidnappings by terrorists, and after
he was scorned as an apostate to Quebec's cause, he ultimately won
the support of most Quebec voters, who sided with him in a
referendum in 1980 that took the wind out of the sails of the
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reason before passion,'' was his personal motto, and he used
it in arguing, on economic and moral grounds, that Quebec should
stay within the Canadian federation. The separatist challenge was a
major crisis in Canadian history, and his admirers say he saved
Canada by defeating the movement.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Pierre Trudeau ran his country with a panache
that was aggressively and un-Canadianly immodest. He wore rakish
hats, drove sports cars, flaunted his learning and his wit, dated
celebrities like Barbra Streisand, toured the discos, married a
former flower child much younger than himself and once, in an act
of apparent insouciance, was photographed as he pirouetted alone in
Buckingham Palace while other guests walked off to meet Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Valpy, a political columnist for The Globe and Mail,
noted in 1998 on the occasion of Trudeau's 79th birthday, the prime
minister had become impressed early in his political career by an
idea advanced by Marshall McLuhan, the philosopher of media.
McLuhan believed that the public sees prominent figures as if they
are wearing masks, and that it is the character of the mask that
the public identifies with, not the person behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Valpy, who is married to Deborah Coyne, a constitutional lawyer
who is also the mother of Trudeau's youngest child, a daughter,
maintained that the mask Trudeau selected was that of the warrior
chief. He added, ``It would require a Joseph Campbell to explain to
Canadians _ the beaver people of peace, order and good government _
why they found magic in a warrior chief's mask. But magic they
found, served up by a practiced and consummate magician.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Canadian commentator, Richard Gwyn, maintained that
Canadians were fascinated with Trudeau precisely because his image
was not the way they saw themselves but the way they wanted to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He teases, taunts, inspires and bugs the hell out of Canadians
because they know he is utterly un-Canadian _ but exactly what they
want other people to think Canadians are like,'' Gwynn wrote in a
collection of essays called ``Trudeau's Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country so devoted to understatement, Trudeau's ascendancy
marked a radical departure. His success was compared to the
transformation of presidential style and leadership that took place
eight years earlier in Washington when John F. Kennedy was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, such a change drew complaints at home and abroad.
In the United States, Trudeau's assertion of Canadian prerogatives
frequently raised eyebrows and indignation. There was the time, for
example, when he referred to a Washington bureaucrat as ``a
pipsqueak.'' There were protests in America when he tried to limit
U.S. investments in Canada, particularly in the Canadian oil
industry. And when he urged NATO to make a dovish retreat from its
first- strike nuclear strategy, the Reagan administration thought
him to be naive, dangerous and presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like all Canadian leaders, he remained preoccupied by his
country's relationship with the United States and even charmed his
critics with comments like those he offered in 1969 after meeting
President Richard Nixon in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an
elephant,'' Trudeau declared. ``No matter how friendly and even
tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by
every twitch and grunt.``
</P>
<P>
   And when Trudeau retired 15 years later, James Reston wrote in
his column in The New York Times: ``Some of us down here think he
was a good neighbor and a good friend. We liked his crusty
arrogance and the rose in his lapel. He gave us his truth as he saw
it, even if we didn't always like it.``
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Philippe Pierre Ives Elliott Trudeau was born on Oct. 18,
1919, in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Charles-Emile Trudeau, the son of French-speaking
Quebec farmers, was a lawyer then on his way to wealth as the owner
of a chain of gas stations. He would also acquire profitable mines,
the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the Royals, the city's
minor league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Grace, was of mixed Scottish and French descent.
</P>
<P>
   The family spoke mostly French at home, but Trudeau could not
remember a time when he did not also speak English.
</P>
<P>
   At a Jesuit high school where he studied Latin and Greek, he
systematically tested teachers in contrarian debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that I must never interrupt a teacher to make an
impertinent remark, because that would be certain to infuriate
him,'' Trudeau wrote in 1993 in a book he called simply ``
Memoirs.`` ``But if I waited until he paused and then I slipped in
a wisecrack, the class would burst out laughing before he had a
chance to get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the pleasure of such moments led him to a lifelong
habit of ``opposing conventional wisdoms and challenging prevailing
opinions.``
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 he entered the University of Montreal, only vaguely
aware that the war in Europe ``might constitute the most dramatic
adventure the men of my generation would ever confront.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he also observed, ``If you were a French Canadian in
Montreal in the early 1940s, you did not automatically believe that
this was a just war. We still knew nothing of the Holocaust, and we
tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the
superpowers.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he did not enlist and even rallied against
conscription of French Canadians. In 1943 he graduated with a
degree in law and after clerking in a law office, went to Harvard
for graduate study in political economy. At Harvard, he recalled,
he was made to understand the parochialism of the Quebec, meeting
professors who were refugees from Europe who did make him aware of
``missing one of the major events of the century.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Until he was 30, he spent his time in study and travel. He left
Harvard for Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris, where he roared
across the city on a motorcycle and tasted from a rich and
fashionable intellectual menu: The Christian left, the worker
priest movement, orthodox Marxism, classical liberalism,
existentialism and particularly personalism, an attempt associated
with the writer Jacques Maritain to reconcile the needs of
individuals and society.
</P>
<P>
   A year later he was studying at the London School of Economics,
principally with Harold Laski, the eminent professor of political
science who was also the chairman of the British Labor Party.
Trudeau has written that his basic philosophy of government was
established at the LSE at a time when Britain was on the verge of
instituting the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1948, Trudeau set off on a slow voyage of
discovery, ostensibly to do research for a never completed doctoral
dissertation on the interplay of Christianity and Marxism in Asia.
Actually, as he later explained, he was embarking on a different
odyssey, eager to mix with local people and to see and sense the
world.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in Arab Jerusalem on suspicion of being an
Israeli spy, and later he was detained when he crossed the new and
tense border between Pakistan and India. He hitch-hiked across an
Indochina already rent by warring factions and he was in China
during the 1949 revolution there.
</P>
<P>
   His attendance at a lawyers' meeting in Moscow led to
instructions to American immigration officials in the
anti-Communist period in the 1950s to deny him admission if he
tried to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, Trudeau returned home dismayed that the
authoritarian government of Maurice Duplessis and the local
ecclesiatical establishment that had ruled Quebec since his
childhood were still in firm control. He committed himself to work
for a ``democratic revolution'' in the province, seeking separation
of church and state, electoral reform and educational changes. He
founded an intellectual quarterly, Cite Libre, and used its pages
to call for a coalition of democratic forces against the Duplessis
regime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 he became a law professor at the University of Montreal,
which earlier had steadfastly shunned him for being too radical and
anticlerical. By this time a quiet revolution was well underway in
Quebec, with urban, cosmopolitan and secular values rising to
challenge the old culture and the old politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 Trudeau joined the Liberal Party and won election to the
House of Commons. In Parliament, he sympathized with many
grievances of the French Canadians, advocating support for their
language and culture. But at the same time he steadfastly opposed
any legislative action that would give them special status. He was
a federalist, and he despaired of any separatist solutions that
suggested ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``French Canadians must refuse to be enclosed within Quebec,''
he wrote in one of his essays. ``The die is cast in Canada: There
are two main ethnic and linguistic groups; each is too strong and
too deeply rooted in the past, too firmly bound to a mother culture
to engulf the other. But if the two will collaborate at the hub of
a truly pluralistic state, Canada could become the envied seat of a
form of federalism that belongs to tomorrow's world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, he was quickly singled out by Prime Minister Lester
Pearson, who named him to his cabinet in 1967 as minister of
justice and concurrently attorney general. He produced legislation
expanding social welfare, tightening gun control and liberalizing
laws relating to divorce, abortion and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   When Pearson announced his intention to resign, Trudeau competed
with 19 others for the post of party leader, which carried with it
the prize of prime minister. Trudeau was victorious and on April
20, 1968, he was sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister and its
third of French descent.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later he dissolved Parliament, calling for general
elections. Trudeau campaigned on the promise of ``a Just Society,''
urging that the country's richer provinces pay for programs in the
poorer ones . He conceded that the expanded government programs he
wanted would mean higher taxes, but declared ``if you want pie in
the sky, you'll have to vote for another party.''
</P>
<P>
   It all went over with the voters, and on June 25, propelled by
``Trudeaumania,'' the electorate gave the Liberals a clear and
comfortable majority.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria was shattered in 1970 when a terrorist group, the
Front de la Liberation de Quebec kidnapped James Cross, a British
diplomat, and a week later, seized Pierre Laporte, a minister in
the Quebec provincial cabinet. As a condition of their freedom, the
Front demanded the release of members who had been imprisoned on
charges or convictions of murder, bank robbery and bombings carried
out in the pursuit of separatism.
</P>
<P>
   While demonstrators rallied in support of the Front and
nonviolent supporters of separatism called stridently for full
appeasement of the kidnappers, Trudeau painfully and reluctantly
invoked Canada's War Measures Act to protect Canada from what the
``cancer of an armed, revolutionary movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Using provisions of the act, he sent thousands of troops to
Montreal and canceled some civil liberties, including the use of
legal writs. Some 400 people were arrested and detained without
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Oct. 17, a message from the Front told
authorities where they could find the body of LaPorte. Four men
were eventually charged with his murder and imprisoned. Cross was
then released and his captors were allowed to leave for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After the crackdown, terrorism effectively ceased in Quebec.
Trudeau's tough responses proved highly popular.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of separatism for Quebec did not disappear. Indeed
it kept growing, advanced no longer simply by terrorists but by
popular politicians of the Parti Quebecois, notably Renee Levesque,
an old friend of Trudeau's who was to become his chief opponent on
the issue. By 1976 the party had taken control of the Quebec
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was the success of Trudeau's policies toward
Quebec that led to his brief ouster from office in the elections of
May 1979. With the risk of Quebec's secession seemingly ended by
his efforts, the western provinces were encouraged to lash out
against Trudeau's party, which they viewed as favoring federal
power at the expense of the authority of their provinces. The
Liberals won no seats west of Winnipeg, and Joe Clark, the leader
of the Progressive Conservative Party, became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But then Levesque inadvertantly came to Trudeau's rescue.
Realizing that the elections had removed the strongest proponent of
federalism from power, Levesque felt it opportune to prepare a
referendum that would ask the people of Quebec whether they wanted
to empower provincial officials to begin negotiations on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But by that act he strengthened Trudeau's support throughout the
country. Some of those who had voted against him thinking the
separatist danger had ended, now openly missed his voice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And Clark quickly stumbled. He lost a vote of no confidence and
new elections were ordered. Trudeau rallied impressively, and by
March 1980, he was once more prime minister, and immediately set
off to challenge the Parti Quebecois in Levesque's referendum,
scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
   The debate became personal and nasty, with Levesque, who was
seeking a yes vote, at one point dismissing the prime minister's
arguments against the proposition. ``His name is Pierre Elliott
Trudeau and this is the Elliott side taking over, and that's the
English side, so we French Canadians in Quebec can't expect any
sympathy from him,`` said Levesque.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister counterattacked. He listed the Ryans, the
Johnsons and the O'Neills _ who despite their Anglo-Saxon names
were famous French Canadian political families. Then he declared,
``Of course my name is Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Elliott was my
mother's name. It was the name borne by the Elliotts who came to
Canada more than 200 years ago. My name is a Quebec name. But my
name is a Canadian name also.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. On May 20, 1980, 59.6 per cent of the electorate
voted ``non.'' In the showdown over the destiny of Quebec,
Trudeau's vision had overwhelmed Levesque's hopes of pulling an
independent Quebec out of the Canadian federal system. Though only
the foolhardy could claim that Trudeau's victory over the forces of
separatism was permanent, none could dispute that it was profound.
</P>
<P>
   There were other successes. In 1982 he succeeded in repatriating
the Constitution by having the British Parliament pass an act that
ceded full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter to
Ottawa. He saw bilingualism and multiculturalism become national
programs. And his vision of Canada as a compassionate and
benevolent government open to the rest of the world yet different
from the United States has survived his term of office.
</P>
<P>
   There were setbacks over nuclear disarmament and on his attempts
to limit foreign involvement in the economy. But it was in his
private life where he proved most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, at the Club Med in Tahiti, the 51-year-old Trudeau met
Margaret Sinclair, 21, the daughter of a Liberal party politician
from British Columbia. They were married the next year and by 1975
they had three sons, Justin, Alexander and Michel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after campaigning with her husband in the 1974 elections,
Trudeau suffered exhaustion and was hospitalized. When she emerged
from the hospital, she became a photographer, following rock
musicians and frequenting nightclubs, where she was herself often
photographed in ways that were humiliating to her husband. Her
friendship with Mick Jagger and other pop icons provided more grist
for tabloid gossip columnists on several continents.
</P>
<P>
   The couple separated in 1974 and were divorced in 1984 with
Trudeau getting custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down as prime minister, Trudeau moved to Montreal
where he kept largely to himself, avoiding interviews or public
appearances. He suffered from Parkinson's disease but even before
the symptoms of his illness intensified, he kept close to home. He
was always considered an aloof, insular man, and his former wife
had once said that he was ``destined for eternal solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   His public mask, the one he had crafted, seemed to have slipped
away and friends who had known him for years described him as an
increasingly unhappy man. In 1998, his youngest son, Michel, a
23-year-old microbiologist who had worked as a ski instructor, was
swept to his death in an avalanche in British Columbia. Trudeau
grieved privately. He was close to his surviving sons and until his
last illness frequently visited with his daughter by Coyne.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, despite the aloofness of his last years, memories
of the warrior chief persisted in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years after he left office, when a sampling of
Canadians were polled about which public figure they would most
want to have dinner with, Pierre Trudeau came in a close second.
The only Canadian who was more popular than he was Wayne Gretzky.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With oil prices up, consumers agitated and the
winter heating season looming, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush are going at it on energy policy, seeking to draw
sharp distinctions over an issue on which both candidates have
political vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a topic that the two parties see as touching consumers
every time they fill up at the pump or adjust their thermostats,
and one that is inextricably linked to broader environmental,
foreign policy and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore forced the topic back onto the campaign agenda last week
with his call, acceded to by President Clinton, for the government
to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to head off
shortages of home heating oil _ an action that both the president
and the vice president had opposed earlier in the year. Bush, who
criticized the decision as a political ploy to drive down prices
just ahead of Election Day, is scheduled to discuss energy policy
in a speech on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic question facing the country on energy is how to
keep supply and demand in line. Bush, like most Republicans,
emphasized finding new oil and ensuring a flow from other
oil-producing nations. Gore, like many Democrats, focuses on trying
to use less energy, or at least on using existing energy supplies
as efficiently as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very simple terms, the Republicans would approach an energy
problem from the supply side: `What can we do to increase
supply?''' said Robert E. Ebel, director of the energy program at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``The Democrats
would say: ``What can we do to make better use of what we've
got?'''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of other clearly defined differences between
them. Gore sees global warming as a serious threat, and strongly
backs an international agreement reached three years ago in Kyoto,
Japan, which calls for substantial reductions in emissions of
industrial gases from burning coal, oil, wood and natural gas. Bush
acknowledges that global warming is a potential problem, but says
the Kyoto agreement would be too costly to the United States and
would not ensure that developing countries do their part.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who worked for years in the oil industry and whose running
mate, Dick Cheney, ran an oil field services company, supports
opening some environmentally sensitive areas, including the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, to oil exploration and
production. Gore opposes such steps.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has long said he is willing to pay a political price
for his environmental principles, has suggested that the United
States needs to take drastic steps, like eliminating the internal
combustion engine, a goal that is widely mocked by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to encourage conservation, Gore has also supported
higher taxes on energy consumption, including a broad-based energy
tax proposed by the Clinton administration in 1993 but never
adopted, and a 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline
tax, which became law in 1993 over the objection of every
Republican in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the two candidates are not as far apart as they
seem. For all his focus on reducing demand, Gore has supported
limited expansion of domestic exploration and production, including
in the Gulf of Mexico and on federal land. Bush backs policies that
promote conservation and energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore would rely more heavily on a government role than
Bush, both candidates see the market as the most powerful force for
addressing energy problems. Both generally support the deregulation
of the electric power industry to allow power producers to compete
in serving consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In their own way, both of them have had to manage balancing
acts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's general philosophy, and some of the specific positions he
has taken over the years, are based in part on the idea that higher
oil prices could be a good thing in holding down consumption and
encouraging conservation and use of alternative energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore has also sought to portray himself as defender of the
consumer against higher gasoline and heating costs. During the
summer, he called for a federal investigation into whether oil
companies were unfairly jacking up gasoline prices. And with winter
looming and crude oil prices rising, he tried to pre-empt a
possible spike in home heating oil prices with his call last week
for release of supplies from the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is right that there is vast potential for alternative
technologies and fuels,'' said Pietro S. Nivola, a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning research organization.
``But every time we try to manipulate or depress the price of oil,
we put off the day when some of these innovations come on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said the surge in oil prices this year has resulted
from what he says is the Clinton-Gore administration's ineptitude
in dealing with the oil-producing nations of the Middle East and on
its failure to promote new oil production and modernization of
power plants, pipelines and refineries at home.
</P>
<P>
   But his own close ties to the oil industry and problems with air
quality in Texas have sometimes left him on the defensive, and his
choice of Cheney as a running mate only exacerbated the problem.
And while Bush's advisers say his criticism of Gore for tapping the
nation's oil reserves makes the vice president look like a crass
panderer, it is unclear whether voters will appreciate that kind of
principle more than immediate action to help them deal with surging
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser, told
reporters this week that energy was the ``best issue'' for the
Texas governor in the campaign right now.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey said Bush's policy prescriptions would center on
promoting more domestic exploration and production of oil, speeding
the process of granting permits for new refineries, power plants
and pipelines, more active diplomatic efforts to persuade oil
producing nations to keep oil prices stable and at reasonable
levels and a greater emphasis on working with Western Hemisphere
oil producers, especially Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would also work with industry to promote conservation and
efficiency through innovations like time-of-day pricing, under
which energy users would pay more at peak hours of demand, Lindsey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years of neglect cannot be made up overnight,'' Lindsey
said. ``It's going to take a lot of years of work on our part to
rectify the problems that have accumulated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of speeches earlier this year, Gore set out a list
of energy initiatives. He relies heavily on tax credits _ for the
purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles and homes, use of low-polluting
fuels and solar power, investment by business in energy efficient
equipment and for production of electricity from renewable and
alternative fuel sources.
</P>
<P>
   But the core of his message is that developing
efficiency-enhancing products and cleaner sources of energy is not
an economic burden but an opportunity that can create jobs and
profits for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His plan, Gore said at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania last
week, would ``create millions of new jobs by getting out in front
of the market for these new boilers and new furnaces and new cars
and trucks and buses and revamped power plants and new technologies
that help us to conserve more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   What neither candidate is saying explicitly is that the best
policy in the long run, according to some analysts, may be to
promote prices that are substantially below the nearly $38 a barrel
level that crude oil hit briefly last week before to declining to
around $30 today, but well above the $12 level that made gasoline
so cheap a two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged as much this week. He told reporters on
Wednesday that OPEC's target range of $22 to $28 a barrel was
``reasonable,'' but that he did not want to see prices ``go back
down to $13 or $12 or $10 again because that was also disruptive.''

OPEC'S UNITY IS UNDERCUT BY THE SAUDIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ A display of unity by OPEC heads of state
at the conclusion of their summit meeting on Thursday was undercut
by Saudi Arabia, which caused a sell-off in the petroleum market
with a unilateral pledge to pump more crude in order to weaken
prices that have recently hit 10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   The price of light sweet crude oil, the benchmark grade in the
United States, tumbled nearly 4 percent, to $30.34 a barrel, and is
now nearly 20 percent below the peak of $37.80 a barrel reached
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kingdom is willing and ready to offer the amount necessary
to stabilize the world oil market,'' the Saudi crown prince,
Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, declared to other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at their meeting
here. ``We are worried today by the increase in oil prices, which
if continued permanently could lead to a negative impact on the
world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Saudi pledge has a longer-term impact on the price
of oil remains unclear. But Saudi Arabia holds the biggest reserves
among the 11 OPEC members _ and the greatest ability to influence
the direction of prices.
</P>
<P>
   An underlying cause of the run-up in oil prices, which have
tripled during the last 18 months, was a production cutback
agreement that Ali Rodriguez Araque, Venezuela's minister of energy
and now the president of OPEC, negotiated early last year with
Saudi Arabia and Mexico. But the Saudi statement suggested that the
trio's singleness of purpose may now be fraying.
</P>
<P>
   There were other indications on Thursday that the solidarity was
weakening. Mexico's energy minister, Luis Tellez, whose country is
a major oil exporter but not an OPEC member, called for world
producers to cooperate in order to keep prices at what he called
acceptable levels. Speaking in Mexico City, Tellez said he expected
prices to eventually stabilize at around $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's pledge contrasted with the tone of the OPEC
summit meeting's host, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who has
said the cartel is not to blame for the oil inflation that has
caused alarm and protests in the main industrialized consumer
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi pledge also overshadowed a call by the OPEC heads of
state for a ``constructive dialogue'' with the industrialized
countries in order to stabilize oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC is willing to dialogue at all levels'' of government and
``with all the countries and regions of the world,'' Chavez said in
his closing speech on Thursday afternoon. But oil prices, he added
later at a news conference, are ``only a small part of an infinite
globality of themes that we need to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil producers and consumer nations are already scheduled to meet
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in mid-November to discuss ways to
stabilize oil prices. But Chavez, citing a telephone conversation
Wednesday with France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said that an
earlier meeting between OPEC heads of state and their counterparts
from the rich industrialized nations or the European Union would be
useful ``if they desire it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 members of OPEC, who account for 75 percent of world oil
reserves and 40 percent of total output, have agreed to increase
production three times this year by a total of 3.2 million barrels
a day in an effort to halt spiraling prices. But their efforts have
met with little success, and President Clinton last week ordered
the release of 30 million barrels from the U.S. strategic oil
reserve in an attempt to drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis have traditionally been closer to the United States
and more cautious than OPEC members like Iraq and Libya, which are
now closely aligned with Venezuela. Mexico must balance its
interest in high oil revenue with its fears of an economic slowdown
in the United States, its most important trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC heads of state attending the meeting here spoke in one
voice, however, regarding what they regard as onerous taxes that
the governments of consuming countries impose on oil products. ``We
are unfairly blamed for all the problems of the world economy''
stemming from high oil prices, Abdulla complained, adding that
consuming countries should ``share the sacrifice through the taxes
that they impose on oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Consuming countries, though, are sure to resist any linkage
between a price drop and a reduction of taxes. To ease taxes would
not only increase gasoline consumption, and therefore OPEC's
revenue, but extend the dependence on fossil fuels that
industrialized countries are trying to lessen through the
development of alternative sources of energy.

 &HT;    Hoping to reach height of glory
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Mark Ruiz is afraid of heights.
</P>
<P>
   That's not unusual in the general population _ not everyone
wants to make the Harbour Bridge climb. But Ruiz is a diver, and on
Friday he'll be standing with his toes on the edge of the Olympic
10-meter platform, ready to plunge 33 feet to the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm not where I'm going to fall, then I'm all
right,'' Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   On the platform, he's in total control. Ruiz, 21, of Orlando,
and David Pichler, 32, of Fort Lauderdale, are the last chances for
the U.S. men to win a diving medal. They'll compete in prelims and
semifinals Friday, with the finals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ruiz went on an amusement park ride in
Orlando with his girlfriend and his stepbrother. ``I couldn't even
look down, I was so scared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz was originally afraid of the platform, too. He was 14 years
old and remembers crying when he first stood so high over the
water. So how did his coach get him to do it? ``He said, `Either
you do it or you quit,''' said Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't quit. The diver who has been called ``the next Greg
Louganis,'' was born in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico, just outside San
Juan. He and his brother used to swing off trees into a little pond
or accompany their mother, Lydia, to a hotel with a pool. While
their mom gambled in the casino, the kids would splash and dive.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz started taking lessons when he was 4. The family moved to
Miami, back to Puerto Rico, and then to a strange city, Orlando,
when he was 12. Ruiz had fallen in love with Orlando at a training
camp. He begged his mother, who was divorced from Ruiz's father and
struggling financially, to move. She was hesitant, but did it for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I owe everything to her,'' Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother now owns a hair salon in Orlando, and when Ruiz was
younger he'd help sweep up. His father, John, died of a heart
attack just before Mark competed in the 1998 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Ruiz won the Pan American Games on 3-meter
springboard, and was considered a hero when he went back to Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the U.S., and I love representing our country,'' said
Ruiz, who decided at age 12 that he would dive for the U.S., ``but
I'm also Puerto Rican.''
</P>
<P>
   On a scale of 1-10, with singer Ricky Martin a 10, Ruiz figures
he'd be a 7 or an 8, ``which is pretty good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's more used to comparisons with Louganis, the greatest diver
ever, and someone who has given him inside tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more mechanical,'' said Ruiz, who has won 17
national titles. ``I would say Greg was more graceful in the air.
There's never been another diver like Greg. . . . That's what it's
all about in diving, making things look easy and graceful in the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   The back 3 1/2 tuck on platform is Ruiz's signature dive.
</P>
<P>
   On the perfect dive, he said, ``You go in the water and it feels
really smooth, The water just kind of goes really soft on you. I
feel the water hit the palm of my hand, pow , and you just know you
did a good entry.''

 &HT;    Marion Jones wins the 200 meters, giving her two golds with
three events left.
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ What do you call a second gold medal? If you're Marion
Jones, thrown deeper in the spotlight by a drug scandal involving
her husband, it's one word: relief.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the deep-red Olympic Stadium oval is her refuge. No
rumors, no in-your-face questions. Just do what you do best, and
pocket gold.
</P>
<P>
   Running as if scripted in an NBC production truck, Jones
comfortably took the 200-meter gold Thursday to go with an earlier
gold in the 100. Next up is the dicier long-jump final Friday,
followed by two relay medal opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, there was pressure coming to Sydney and
saying I was going for five gold medals,'' Jones said, reflecting.
``Then, of course, what happened the last couple days is not
necessarily pressure, but something that could easily have swayed
my focus. But it didn't, and I'm glad about that.'' Earlier this
week, it was revealed that Jones' husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter,
had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug. The Sydney
newspapers have played the story to the hilt. Then, the Aussies'
favorite athlete, Cathy Freeman, and countrywoman Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor sprinted into the 200 final against Jones _ though
both finished deep in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Jones wore a heavy parka in the 90 minutes between the semifinal
and final, spending her time on a nearby warmup track. The trace of
a smile crossed her face when, during introductions for the final,
the PA announcer identified her as: ``from the Bahamas. I beg your
pardon, from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the distractions seemed to matter as Jones blitzed the
field in a season-best 21.84 seconds. Atlanta resident Pauline
Davis-Thompson, 34, won the silver medal for the Bahamas. Davis, a
five-time Olympian and the oldest runner in the field, finished
nearly five meters behind Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, Jones wouldn't let on if the intense
scrutiny has unnerved her. She was calm and cool on the track. At
race's end, she carried flags of the U.S. and Belize on her victory
lap, just as she had after the 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us just started training this year,'' said Jones,
explaining her singular focus. ``It's been my dream for a lot of
years. All the days of having my mother take me to track meets . .
. So I'm not going to let one event, traumatic as it is, ruin that.
No way, no way.''
</P>
<P>
   The sprints were never thought to be a serious problem, anyway.
How she'll fare in the long jump and relays is anyone's guess, but
Davis-Thompson and Debbie Ferguson, a former University of Georgia
star and fifth in the 200, stand between Jones and another gold in
the 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the team from the Bahamas reigning world champs, but
the U.S. squad is in disarray after injuries suffered by Inger
Miller and Gail Devers.
</P>
<P>
   Hyped after her silver-medal run, Davis-Thompson stood by Jones'
side offering coming relief and jabs about the relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way, we're the `96 silver medalist and `99
world champions, and we're still the underdog and we love that
spot,'' Davis-Thompson said. ``It's just going to make our victory
sweeter, Marion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody said it was going to be easy,'' Jones responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion, we're going to give you a helluva race,''
Davis-Thompson said, laughing. ``I know you have a little Caribbean
blood, too, Marion. You're mother being from Belize. So you're like
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the 200 was Davis-Thompson, silver medalist in
the 400 at the 1995 world championships. A former training partner
of sprinter Gwen Torrence, she trains in Atlanta with coach Loren
Seagrave.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, she ran a personal-best 10.97 100 earlier this year, and
recently was named athlete of the century for the Bahamas. She was
expected to be a key member of the 400 relay, but few rated her a
medal favorite in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never gave up,'' said Davis, a semifinalist at the 1984
Los Angeles Games. ``It's been a very very long road to Sydney.''

 &HT;    IOC dispels rumor of Athens' loss
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The International Olympics Committee, the premier of
New South Wales and the Athens Organizing Committee dismissed
rumors Thursday that Sydney might steal the Games from Athens in
2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athens is absolutely a certainty for 2004,'' said Franklin
Servan-Schreiber, the IOC director of communications. ``We are
impressed by the progress that has been made, and we will work with
them very closely to put on the best Games ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not get excited about this,'' New South Wales Premier
Bob Carr said. ``No one has offered it to us. No one has asked us.
And we won't be doing 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's spectacular showing, coupled with the IOC's public
scolding of Athens earlier this year for being ill-prepared, had
prompted speculation that the 2004 Games might be played in Sydney,
or even Seoul, if Athens was not ready in time.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Greek government put Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki
in charge of the Athens committee in July, the IOC seems to have
changed its position.
</P>
<P>
   Said Angelopoulos on Wednesday: ``I don't pay attention to
rumors. I pay attention to facts. The fact is in August, at the
presentation to the IOC, we received comments like, `You are on
track. You have made an excellent job up to now. Of course it is
not easy because you only have four years instead of seven. You
have a new team. We are happy that your prime minister decided his
participation is needed. We are happy that the whole government
seems to understand that. We are with you, and we want you to
organize the best Games.' That is what I get, and nothing else.''

 &HT;    Norway refuses to lose; gets winner in overtime
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The mantra of success for the U.S. women's soccer team
for the past decade has been its unremitting resolve in the clutch.
But the only nation that has shown any ability to match that will
to power over the years proved every bit as durable with the gold
medal on the line.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a tying goal with seconds to play in the second
half Thursday, Norway could have fallen victim to what the United
States likes to describe as its special mentality for winning.
</P>
<P>
   But a ``golden goal'' by substitute striker Dagny Mellgren 12
minutes into extra time gave the Norwegians a 3-2 victory in front
of 22,848 at the Sydney Football Stadium, shattering the hopes of
an American team aiming for its third consecutive major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a magic moment, that is all I can say,'' said defender
Gro Espeseth, who scored Norway's first goal a minute before
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that this was our day today. We were not going to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which gave up a fifth-minute goal to Tiffeny Milbrett,
who looked unstoppable in the first half, recovered to pull even
right before the intermission. The Scandinavians then hung together
after Milbrett's second strike gave the Americans what appeared to
be the momentum to pull off the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to win,'' said Milbrett, who scored the dramatic
equalizer at the end of regulation. ``They just have our number.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Norwegians, the victory was the fourth over the
Americans this year, and runs their all-time record against their
venerable rival to 15-13-2. The U.S., winners of Olympic gold in
1996 and the World Cup last year, has been ousted from the only
major tournaments it has lost, including the 1995 World Cup, by
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   After being humiliated 2-0 by the U.S. on Sept. 16 in their
Olympic opener in Melbourne, Norway rebounded with a vengeance,
displaying the kind of counterattacking it used in beating the
Americans twice on home soil in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we are the best team in the world now,'' said outgoing
Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hogmo. ``We have defeated the United
States four times, China three times and Germany twice this year.''
</P>
<P>
   For an American team completing a remarkable decade of
achievement, this loss surely was an emotional backbreaker. Moments
after Mellgren's clincher, U.S. players looked around the field in
a daze, showing no visible reaction. Whatever tears poured out were
left in the locker room. Nearly 30 minutes after receiving their
runner-up medals, several players emerged to put a good face on
their thwarted dreams. Only one of them, defender Brandi Chastain,
managed a convincing smile with a piece of silver dangling from her
neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people got the best game possible,'' said Chastain,
who wasn't a part of the 1995 World Cup team upset by Norway in the
semifinals. ``We played a great game out there. But you have to
give Norway credit. They scored goals when they needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm, who often has disappeared in the late stages of
tournaments, was superb in the final, teaming up with speedy
Milbrett to terrorize the slow-footed Norwegian defense early. They
created the opening score, and it was Hamm's cross with seconds
remaining in the second half that the 5-foot-2 Milbrett put home,
rising over two Norwegian defenders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans found no rejuvenation from their rally.
Instead, Norway, which switched from a 4-4-2 to a 4-5-1 formation
to bottle up the U.S. attack after drawing even 1-1 at halftime,
waited for the right time to strike back.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. defense, so sturdy during the Olympics, fell apart
when pressed. In the 78th minute, central defender Joy Fawcett
mistimed a cross in the box to Ragnhild Gulbrandsen, who headed the
ball safely in the net as U.S. goalkeeper Siri Mullinix tried to
put up a final line of defense in vain.
</P>
<P>
   In extra time, another long ball, this one to Mellgren from Hege
Riise inside the center circle, bounced off Fawcett's head and onto
the shoulder of Mellgren, who knocked home the shot past a
sprawling Mullinix. U.S. captain Julie Foudy called for a handball,
but Canadian referee Sonia Denoncourt wouldn't hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal had changed hands, and the Americans were in the
unusual position of consoling themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said to the players, 'Hold your heads up, you have
nothing to be ashamed of,' `` Hamm said.

   Americans are very sophisticated about the relationship between
politics and entertainment. Anybody can tell you that Richard Nixon
blazed the trail in 1968 when he appeared on ``Laugh-In'' and
muttered the show's catch phrase, ``Sock it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the first glimpses of the ``fun'' Nixon the nation
would later come to love.
</P>
<P>
   We know this story because it was an important moment in our
collective cultural history and also because it was the answer to
the first million-dollar question on ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon moment was one step in the road toward our current
controversy over the amount of time presidential candidates are
spending on television, talking about their families and favorite
foods. The other night you could flip back and forth between Al
Gore on MTV, looking stern at the mere mention of marijuana, and
George W. Bush on CNN, hanging out with Larry King. On NBC, I swear
I saw Dick Cheney mounting the pommel horse.
</P>
<P>
   (Has anybody noticed, by the way, that none of the candidates
have spent much time cheering on our Olympic athletes? This is
particularly disappointing in the case of Bush, who did such a
great job of psyching up the Ryder Cup golf team by reading them a
letter from the commander of the Alamo, vowing ``victory or
death.'' I think I am speaking for all Americans when I say that if
Bush had taken the trouble to read his Alamo letter to the women's
soccer team, they would not have lost to Norway.)
</P>
<P>
   We digress.
</P>
<P>
   Our topic today was whether the candidates are spending too much
time hanging around the softer side of the media, where they do not
have to answer tough questions. The whole debate is truly touching,
since it presumes that when they aren't on ``Oprah,'' Gore and Bush
are at the mercy of bloodthirsty journalists who are forcing them
to finally come clean about the contradictions in their Medicare
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the campaigns are so controlled that it's a challenge
to get much more than the message of the day, and in the case of
Gore, the press conference of every other month. If the TV hosts
think they can pry something surprising out of these guys, more
power to them. David Letterman gave it the old college try when he
demanded to know what Gore thought we should do about global
warming. (Great news! The problem can be solved by new,
job-creating technology.) Winfrey didn't exactly go for the
jugular, but it was still fun to watch the presidential candidates
groveling at the feet of a powerful woman. Gore was in such full
pander mode that when asked to name his favorite cereal, he blurted
out, ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's least threatening interviewer had to be Regis Philbin,
who spent an inordinate amount of time questioning him closely
about what the ``W.'' stands for. (``Walker ... of course, Walker.
... George Walker Bush. ... Yeah, yeah.'') Perhaps Philbin was
worried about all the trouble Bush had earlier in the campaign,
when people asked him about world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning as TV entertainment has actually been with us since
the 1950s, when people acquired their first television sets and
immediately stopped showing up at political rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower saw what was going on and hired a media
consultant, one of whose coups was to persuade CBS to air a
birthday tribute to Mamie Eisenhower in the spring of the 1956
election year, despite the fact that the first lady had actually
been born in late November. Adlai Stevenson, meanwhile, resisted
all attempts to make him more camera-friendly, and turned down an
invitation to appear as the mystery guest on the popular program
``I've Got a Secret.'' This cost Stevenson both valuable exposure
and the opportunity to become immortalized as a 21st-century quiz
show question.
</P>
<P>
   Now the airwaves are full of once and future candidates, and if
this race gets any closer, they'll be moving into the prime-time
lineup:
</P>
<P>
   Sunday _ Dueling centrists Bush and Gore attempt to elbow
Malcolm out of the Middle.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday _ The ``NYPD Blue'' gang gets to escort Gore to a
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Friday _ Bush appears on a special edition of ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire,'' limited to questions about people's middle names.

 &HT;    Jones the main attraction tonight
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Marion Jones variety hour continues tonight with
her bid for the gold in the women's long jump. This is the last
individual event for Jones and figures to be the toughest one for
her to win. There's also the men's finals in the 1,500 meters and
the pole vault with American Lawrence Johnson in the latter, but
NBC hopes the other eye-grabber will be the men's basketball
semifinal between the U.S. and Lithuania. So far, Craig Sager's
memorable feature on Alonzo Mourning's sojourn from Sydney to Miami
for the birth of his daughter has been the highlight of the men's
basketball coverage in prime time. Perhaps high-flying Vince Carter
will provide a few more tonight. The U.S. women's basketball team,
led by WNBA stars Lisa Leslie and Yolanda Griffith, will be
showcased on NBC's late-night telecast when the semifinal against
South Korea will be shown. MSNBC plans to use the men's
bronze-medal soccer match between Chile and the U.S. as the
linchpin of its coverage, while the women's gold-medal match
between Australia and Argentina will augment the boxing semifinals
on CNBC where U.S. light welterweight Ricardo Williams is the
fighter to watch.

 &HT;    For Dogs defense, gambling less results in fewer big plays
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ During the past three years, Georgia's defense has
offered more versions than Mircrosoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who ranked last in the SEC in defense last season,
have had five coordinators in eight years. But former Oklahoma
coach Gary Gibbs, hired in February to replace Kevin Ramsey, has
brought some stability.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's game at Arkansas, Georgia is ranked second
in the SEC and eighth nationally in total defense, giving up only
235.3 yards per game. The Bulldogs rank first in the SEC against
the pass, allowing 93.7 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played hard,'' Gibbs said. ``We've made some mistakes,
which you are going to have every week, but they are correctable
mistakes. We've gotten a lot of good play from a lot of different
players.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change from last season is that Georgia isn't making
as many big mistakes. Only once in its first three games has the
defense allowed a play from scrimmage of more than 25 yards. Last
season, opponents had six plays of more than 25 yards in the first
three games.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, a defensive coordinator with the Sooners for eight
seasons in the 1980s, has installed a scheme that seems to take
fewer risks. Last season, Georgia's cornerbacks often played
bump-and-run coverage and tried to jam receivers at the line. In 12
games in 1999, Georgia gave up 28 passing plays of more than 25
yards.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the cornerbacks are playing farther back from the
line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know one thing for sure. They are going to be very sound,
very disciplined,'' Arkansas coach Houston Nutt said. ``I don't see
too many home-run balls going against them. That's been the most
impressive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulldogs have yet to face a passing team as formidable
as the Razorbacks. Arkansas quarterback Robby Hampton is averaging
13.2 yards per completion and has thrown six touchdowns and two
interceptions. Razorbacks receiver Boo Williams leads the SEC with
a 28.8-yard average on 10 catches.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said Williams, 6 feet 4 and 230 pounds, reminds him of
Auburn's Ronney Daniels, who blistered the Bulldogs for nine
catches and 249 yards in the Tigers' 38-21 victory in Athens last
season. Georgia cornerback Tim Wansley, who is about seven inches
shorter than Williams, will have the daunting task of covering him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe Wansley is one of the most competitive guys
we have here,'' Donnan said. ``He's fearless. He thinks he can do
anything. (But Williams) is a scary guy. We're going to have to
give (Wansley) some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs also has installed a five-man front, a change from
Georgia's 4-3 defense last season. One of the Bulldogs' defensive
ends is more of a down lineman, and outside linebacker Will
Witherspoon creeps to the line next to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's other defensive ends aren't rushing the quarterback as
much, either. The Bulldogs have only six sacks in three games, with
just one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got to play the run first and the pass second,''
defensive end Josh Mallard said. ``Last year, our defense was kind
of like Florida State's, and they just let us run. This year, we've
got to be a little more disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   The new plan seems to be working so far. In the first three
games, Georgia's defense has carried its inconsistent offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we gave up a lot of big plays,'' linebacker Tony
Gilbert said. ``This year, we don't want to give up the big plays.
They can get the yards, just as long as they don't score on us.''

 &HT;    Stepping in for the Heels
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With his credentials from Atlanta's Marist School,
Brandon Russell could have attended Georgia Tech or Georgia on a
football scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against the state schools, but Russell wanted to broaden
his horizons.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur, Ga., native passed on official visits to either and
chose North Carolina over Stanford and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wanted to get away from Atlanta,'' he said. ``I love
Atlanta; I just wanted something else. I had always heard North
Carolina was a nice place. I had the opportunity to look around,
and I didn't see anything nicer. Chapel Hill impressed me.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision already has proved to be a good one for both
Russell and North Carolina coach Carl Torbush.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's regionally televised game against Georgia
Tech, Russell is the starting tailback and the Tar Heels' leading
rusher with 178 yards on 50 carries. He also has caught two passes
for 26 yards for the 3-1 Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most pleasant surprise is that Brandon continues to make
improvements at tailback,'' Torbush said. ``His two best games have
been the two previous games. We also had him returning punts and he
did an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell's best work came in the final minutes of Carolina's
comeback win over Marshall Saturday. Behind the blocking of
fullback Anthony Sanders, Russell gained 34 yards on six carries
during the Tar Heels' final 13-play drive, which allowed them to
milk the clock for the victory. He finished with 79 yards on 17
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coming up here, I wasn't sure if I was going to play or
redshirt or what,'' Russell said. ``As it turned out, it worked out
for me. To tell the truth, I didn't think I'd be starting. I didn't
think I'd just come up here and step in and start. It wasn't
realistic from my perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell also plans to play outfield for the North Carolina
baseball team, hitting .483 with 11 home runs and 23 stolen bases
as a Marist senior. He was selected by the Florida Marlins for the
Major League Showcase in 1999. That sport almost persuaded him to
stay in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was especially tempting at Georgia with that guy
(second-year coach Ron Polk) who (was) at Mississippi State there.
That was a real draw,'' he said. ``But all three of my final
schools would let me play baseball. I have a passion for both
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   In football, the War Eagles compiled a 51-4 record during his
four years at Marist, where he also played defensive back and
linebacker and blocked eight kicks. But he always flourished on
offense. He gained 1,697 yards, an average of 9.98 yards per carry,
and scored 29 touchdowns as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said hitting a baseball is harder than playing football.
But he has found something harder than both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played golf one time up here,'' he said. ``It was the most
frustrating thing I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his history, he will master that one eventually, too.

APPLE SAYS QUARTERLY PROFIT WON'T MEET EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer said Thursday that its
fourth-quarter earnings would fall far below analysts' estimates
because of weak September sales, an announcement that sent the
company's shares plunging in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've clearly hit a speed bump,'' said Steve Jobs, Apple's
chief executive, adding that before investment gains, Apple would
earn about $110 million rather than the expected $165 million for
the quarter, which ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though this slowdown is disappointing,'' Jobs said, ``we have
so many wonderful new products and programs in the pipeline,
including Mac OS X early next year, and remain positive about our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple says it now expects earnings of 30 to 33 cents a share in
the fourth quarter, well below the consensus estimate of 45 cents,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings. The company said it expected to report revenues of $1.85
billion to $1.90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., made its
announcement after the close of the market. Apple shares, which had
closed at $53.50, up $4.56 on Nasdaq, dropped as low as $28.25 in
after-hours trading. Apple's last profit warning came a year ago
when the company's results lagged forecasts because of parts
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Apple's loyal user base has often buffered it from the
seasonal swings of the broader personal computer industry, analysts
said the company was not immune to the global slowdown affecting
the business this quarter. Last week, Intel Corp. sent jitters
through the technology sector when it warned of a slow quarter,
which it attributed primarily to a soft market in Europe. Dell
Computer Corp. said in August that second-quarter sales rose more
slowly than expected because of weak demand.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the bigger fear for Apple was whether the
shortfall indicated that the company's much-heralded turnaround _
tied to Jobs' return to the helm and the introduction of the
popular iMac desktop computer _ had run out of gas. For Apple to
continue growing at the pace it had been, it has to claim new
computer users and former PC users for its Macintosh computers,
something it has been doing. Now it is unclear whether the company
can continue to make gains among those users, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since Steve returned the company to
profitability in the fourth quarter of '97 that they've truly hit a
wall,'' said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read.
``It's not that its so dramatic a wall, but it is, in my mind, an
ominous one. The scary part is maybe their ability to attract new
users to the Mac platform will be more difficult in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Fred D. Anderson, Apple's chief financial
officer, attributed the expected shortfall to three factors.
``First, we experienced lower-than-expected September sales due to
a business slowdown in all geographies,'' he said. ``Second, our
education sales, which normally peak during September, were lower
than expected. And third, our Power Mac G4 Cube is off to a
slower-than-expected start, resulting in revenues below
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the G4 Cube has won rave reviews for its sleek design,
it appears to be selling primarily to Mac loyalists rather than
winning over new users, analysts said. The slowdown in education
sales, traditionally an Apple stronghold that accounts for about 25
percent of revenues, is particularly troubling, they said, because
it could indicate the loss of market share.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Apple began shipping a public beta test
version of Mac OS X, the new version of its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the company would provide lower growth targets for
the next quarter and the next fiscal year when it announced final
results on Oct. 18.

 &HT;    We were robbed _ really
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As if finishing a disappointing fifth wasn't bad
enough for Atlanta kayaker Scott Shipley last week, he was a crime
victim shortly after going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley drove back from a party to the house he and teammates
rented at Penrith and went to sleep at 3 a.m. A half-hour later,
team leader Bob Campbell got back and noticed the car was missing.
He went inside and discovered other items gone, such as Shipley's
digital camera and the team VCR and camera. Police received an
anonymous tip and tracked down the stolen car at a house that day.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were arrested. Some of them were wearing clothes
stolen from the house. Unfortunately for Shipley, there was no
medal for the crooks to pilfer.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES
</P>
<P>
   Kay Poe's disastrous day ended on a happier note.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the gold-medal taekwondo favorite in the
under 49-kg (108-pound) class was ousted in the first round. That
evening, however, she and friend Esther Kim sat at the venue with
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, and two IOC members asked to
meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Kim bowed out of the U.S. Trials finals against her injured pal,
which put Poe in the Games. Kim and her father, who coaches both,
are Samaranch's guests at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY ON, MATES
</P>
<P>
   It's getting to be party time in Sydney as athletes wrap up
competition and start having fun. Aussie swimmer Susie O'Neill
threw a party for teammates and friends at a Bondi beach club.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson celebrated his 34th birthday and his 400-meter
victory with a party at Planet Hollywood. Among the guests were his
wife, Kerri, Prince Albert of Monoco and women's 400 bronze
medalist Katherine Merry. ``I love Syndey,'' Johnson said. ``It's a
great city. Oi, Oi, Oi!''
</P>
<P>
   GREENSPAN'S VIEW
</P>
<P>
   Pieter van den Hoogenband's upset of Aussie swim star Ian Thorpe
in the 200 meter freestyle will be a focal point of Bud Greenspan's
documentary on the Games. Greenspan said he would also focus on
Cathy Freeman's victory in the 400 meters and the Opening
Ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   AND FINALLY . . .
</P>
<P>
   Scene at the tennis stadium: A woman was standing in the ramp
entrance to a section, breastfreeding her infant. Nearby, a man was
smoking a cigarette. She said, ``Could you move away from the baby,
please? Thank you.'' He complied.
</P>
<P>
   NO WAVING IN THE PRESS BOX
</P>
<P>
   While the ``wave'' is long gone as a crowd favorite at sporting
events in the United States, it remains popular in other countries.
At the Olympic Stadium Tuesday morning, spectators kept a wave
going for several minutes. When it reached the media section and
slowed down, the crowd booed, but fans in the upper deck kept it
alive.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO IT
</P>
<P>
   The places journalist will go to get a story! As a ferry slowly
made its way to Manly, a North Sydney suburb, passengers noticed a
lone boat floating off to one side of the Olympic regatta. The tiny
motorboat was flying a flag that read ``Media.'' There were one
reporter and one photographer aboard, and they looked like they
were enjoying their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   WEBSTER'S THE TOP DOG
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Closing Ceremonies are expected to be a big celebration
for the athletes, with a major party and jam session taking place
on the field of Olympic Stadium. Among the Australian stars
expected to come out that night are singer-dancer Christine Anu,
rock star Jimmy Barnes, country legend Slim Dusty, opera singer
Yvonne Kenny and supermodel Elle Macpherson. But the night will
belong to 13-year-old Nikki Webster. The high-flying girl became an
overnight star at the Sept. 15 Opening Ceremonies. But by all
accounts she's just an ordinary kid who goes to school at McDonald
College in the Sydney suburb of North Stratfield. According to one
local newspaper: ``Her little dog, Star, got to wag his tail
madly'' when she got home from the Olympic spectacle the other
night. Awww.

 &HT;    Athens gets help in push for 2004
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ After a severe scolding from the International Olympic
Committee, the Athens 2004 effort is trying desperately to put its
house in order, and the person leading the effort seems to be
winning the confidence of the IOC and the public.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can salvage the Athens Games, it is believed to be
Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki _ a statuesque and striking
45-year-old with an impeccable political, business and academic
dossier.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was credited with single-handedly winning the Athens
bid in 1993, she remained behind the scenes until four months ago,
when Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis begged her to come to the
rescue of Athens, which appeared in danger of losing the Games. In
April, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said Athens faced the
worst organizational crisis he'd seen in his 20-year tenure, and
the Greek government assumed full responsibility for delivering the
Games on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I couldn't say, `I won't assist my country,' '' said
Angelopoulos, who is in Sydney with a team of 130 observers from
Athens. ``What I truly didn't know is that we need all the good
people, all the capable people. It's not the result of one
charismatic person or 10 charismatic persons. The government has to
participate. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can see in Sydney is that they have made a good
coordination. Good people, good Games. It's a very strong effort.
It's a very hard task.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Angelopoulos also gave good marks to the
Atlanta Games and said that Athens will run its torch relay on five
continents _ an unprecedented and ambitious undertaking. She
praised Atlanta's egalitarian torch relay as a model.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we feel is that the Olympic torch really makes people
think about ideals and ideas like friendship, peace, like
tradition,'' she said. ``Like forget about divisions and think
about issues that we can share. It's a unique celebration of
Olympism.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first woman to run an Olympic enterprise, Angelopoulos
says each host city has to put its on stamp on the Olympics.
``Atlanta was different from Barcelona. Sydney was different from
Atlanta. Athens will be different from Sydney,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Atlanta bid organizers) Charlie Battle and Billy
Payne. They tried to organize the Games in their American model. I
personally very much liked the Games. And I know that NBC enjoyed
them very much, that they were very good Games. This is what really
counts to me. The masses, the spectators: They enjoyed great Games.
They had a lot of good sports, good results, good records. This is
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelopoulos, a former Athens city councilwoman and member of
the Greek Parliament, is married to Greek shipping magnate Theodore
Angelopoulos. She is a lawyer and serves as vice chairwoman of
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   The Athens organizing committee has been mired in the slow
machinations of Greek politics for the past three years, and the
IOC has expressed serious concerns about venues, transportation,
hotel accommodations and security.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Athens gave a good progress report at an IOC meeting in
Sydney on Sept. 12, it was told to deliver the venues _ now only
about 70 percent complete _ by the end of 2003, four months earlier
than the original deadline. Still to be built are the five venues
for yachting, rowing and canoeing, equestrian, softball and
baseball, and badminton and fencing.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government has spent $634 million on infrastructure
improvements, including a new road system and subway. It is
spending an additional $981 million for a sports training and
education program throughout the country _ improvements that
Angelopoulos says ``has to do with motivating the country.''
Athens' organizing committee's operating budget is about $1.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Athens is clearly trying to promote itself as an idyllic tourist
destination. The Games will be played in the shadows of the
Acropolis and Mount Olympus, and Greece is a repository of
sun-splashed Aegean islands.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday night's Closing Ceremonies, Sydney will pass the
Olympic flag to Athens, and the Greeks will introduce themselves to
the world in an eight-minute segment set to music by ``Chariots of
Fire'' composer Vangelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first image of Greece that people will have,''
Angelopoulos said. ``It will be a way to show how Greece feels
about the Olympic Games. On the one hand, we promise to have a
state-of-the-arts Games. Athens, we believe, will be good for the
Games. On the other hand, we want to show where the Olympic Games
were born. They have a unique culture, a unique heritage, a unique
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelopoulos also extended an olive branch to Atlanta. She said
that Athens carried no grudges for the loss of the 1996 Centennial
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to win on merit and not by right. Athens was not ready
at the time. Atlanta was.''

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It has become an urban legend at these
Olympic Games: Security guards are supposedly confiscating bottles
of Pepsi-Cola from visitors at the gates of the Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi, cracked the Sydney Morning Herald, is on the forbidden
list _ along with guns, knives and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, says the Sydney Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given no instructions for Pepsi to be confiscated,'' Bob
Bowden, a spokesman, said. ``People are allowed to bring food and
drink into the park. We haven't specified what kind of drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the denials, Bowden said the Olympic Committee had been
unable to snuff out the rumor. That may reflect the consensus, both
here and abroad, that Sydney has gone farther than any previous
host city to protect its official sponsors from being ambushed by
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's archrival, of course, is Coca-Cola, which paid an
estimated $55 million to be a worldwide sponsor of the Olympics.
The company is blanketing Sydney's Olympic Park with red-and-white
umbrellas, lawn chairs and other reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1996 Games held in Coke's hometown of Atlanta, Sydney
has kept so-called ambush marketers far from Olympic arenas and
sites. Although nonsponsor companies are visible here, Sydney has
little of the flea-market ambience that made the Atlanta Games a
byword for crass commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really done a great job,'' said Gary Pluchino, vice
president of Carlson Marketing Group, which works for Olympic
sponsors IBM, Samsung Electronics and Eastman Kodak. ``It's
enormously helpful for these companies, which are using the Games
as a platform around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambush marketing is such a touchy subject because the costs of
an Olympic sponsorship are so high. The International Olympics
Committee's 11 worldwide sponsors plunked down $550 million for the
four years leading up to the Sydney Games, while local sponsors
paid an additional $315 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing better captures the difference between Atlanta and
Sydney than the role played by Nike. In 1996, Nike, the athletic
shoe and apparel maker, was the most aggressive ambush marketer of
the Games _ leasing a parking garage near Centennial Park to
promote its athletes and peddle its products.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nike is inside the tent, as an Australian sponsor of the
Games. That status has allowed it to plaster its trademark Swoosh
all over Sydney without worrying about protests from other
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Among its showier gestures, Nike has wrapped a skyscraper in
perforated film painted with expansive images of three Australian
athletes who endorse Nike shoes: Cathy Freeman, the sprinter;
Lleyton Hewitt, the tennis player; and Lauren Jackson, a star
player on the women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expected this to be a huge shift for us, like `You were
the black sheep of the family, and now you're the white sheep,'''
said Martha Ivester, the Olympics marketing director for Nike.
``But the reality is, we're doing the same marketing. People always
expect us to be in-your-face.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk, Nike seems to have mellowed. Four years ago,
it thumbed its nose at the whole concept of sponsorship. ``We don't
sell dreams. We sell shoes,'' declared an eight-page advertising
insert in Sports Illustrated. A television commercial said: ``You
don't win silver. You lose gold.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the tone is softer: Nike's commercials talk
about drawing on one's inner strength to win. The Australian
campaign has Olympic athletes promising to put their lives in order
after the Games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like other people at Nike, Ivester seems almost nostalgic for
the insurgent days of Atlanta, when Nike spurned a sponsorship and
still won more attention for its marketing than the officially
sanctioned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ivester is excited about Nike's new status, she said
that the company _ because of its close identification with sports
and its superstar endorsers _ did not need the sponsorship as much
as nonsports companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of being an event sponsor is to get visibility
for your brand,'' Ivester said. ``The moment Marion Jones steps on
the track wearing our shoes, we get all the visibility you could
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike only signed its deal with the Australian Olympic Committee
last December after its competitor, Reebok, pulled out after a
dispute over the scope of the agreement. By picking up the $5
million contract just nine months before the Games, Nike was able
to dictate its terms.
</P>
<P>
   Nike agreed to design and produce uniforms for the Australian
athletes, but not the 47,000 volunteers who work at the Olympic
Park. The company obtained waivers of an International Olympic
Committee rule that prohibits the use of Olympic athletes in
advertisements during the two weeks of the Games. As part of its
agreement, Nike has also been allowed to build mobile playgrounds
around Sydney that feature Nike products.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the company's promotional efforts were centered on
Nike Park, a flashy complex near Centennial Park that drew crowds
and the envy of less inventive sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marketing coups like that are all but impossible here because
most of the sporting events are concentrated in the
tightly-controlled Olympic Park at Homebush Bay. Not only is the
park free of ambush advertising, the organizers have bought up most
of the billboards on the surrounding roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly helps to have a new facility that is not
surrounded by buildings on which you can hang big fluorescent
signs,'' Bowden of the organizing committee said. ``You've
basically got to hijack the airspace above the park if you want to
get a marketing message out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Bowden points out, skywriting over Homebush is prohibited
by the Olympic Arrangements Act, a government law that covers
everything from security and parking to airspace. The act permits
the authorities to remove unauthorized advertisements in the
vicinity of the park that are deemed to be ambush marketing.
</P>
<P>
   While it says it has not yanked bottles of Pepsi, the Sydney
organizing committee has let little else slip by. A catering
service in the park was ordered to change the appearance of its
bacon-and-egg roll because it looked suspiciously like an Egg
McMuffin _ McDonald's is a worldwide sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to ban legitimate marketing,'' Bowden said.
``But we want to protect the investment of our main sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Sydney, the Olympic committee cannot eradicate every
incidence of ambush marketing. Among sportswear manufacturers, the
Italian company Fila has taken up the mantle of Nike. In 1998, it
leased a replica of Britain's legendary 18th century sailing ship
HMS Bounty, the crew of which mutinied against Capt. William Bligh
on a commission to Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   The ship _ its fluttering foresail emblazoned with the Fila name
_ is tied up at a wharf in Sydney's harbor. The company uses the
ship to wine and dine clients. But its biggest value is as a
floating advertisement: it sits just across the bay from the iconic
Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Alessandro De Pestel, Fila's vice president of communication,
said the company spent $2 million on its Sydney marketing campaign.
That compares with $10 million for a full-fledged Australian
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has learned from Nike,'' said De Pestel, as he
relaxed with a double espresso on the Bounty replica's quarter
deck.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Nike has gone easy on Fila, Adidas, and other
nonsponsors that are practicing ambush marketing here. Adidas, for
example, has widely trumpeted its association with Ian Thorpe, the
17-year-old Australian swimmer who won two gold medals. That may be
because Nike is likely to revert to its outsider status in future
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the U.S. probably wouldn't know who Ian Thorpe is if
Adidas hadn't done so much advertising with him,'' Ivester said.
``Does that make us mad? Kind of yes, kind of no.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   There are no mixed feelings between Australia's two airlines,
Qantas Airways and Ansett Australia, owned by Air New Zealand,
which are engaged in the most rancorous battle between a sponsor
and an ambusher. Ansett is the official airline of the Games;
Qantas, the longtime carrier of the Australian Olympic team, was
left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers could be forgiven for thinking it was the
other way around. By signing an estimated $8 million deal with
Australia's Seven network, the local broadcaster of the Games,
Qantas has been able to place its commercials around the hottest
events involving Australian athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse for Ansett is the Qantas theme song, ``I
Still Call Australia Home,'' which has become the unofficial anthem
of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   While Ansett has managed to keep the song out of formal Olympic
ceremonies, one of Australia's gymnasts chose it for her floor
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been disappointed with a lot of the ambush activity
undertaken by our competitor,'' said Jane Corbett-Jones, a
spokeswoman for Ansett. ``But we're satisfied that our sponsorship
has met the objectives we originally set out.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Qantas theme song?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that it evokes a lot of sentiment among
Australians,'' Corbett-Jones said. ``One way or another, the song
is going to be played, and there's not a lot we can do it about
it.''

STOPGAP BUDGET MEASURE APPROVED BY SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate passed a stopgap spending measure
Thursday that will allow the federal government to function through
Oct. 6, seven days after the end of its fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate's 96-0 vote to approve the short-term spending
measure and the House approval of the legislation on Tuesday,
Congress has now given itself more time to debate the remaining 11
spending measures that finance a variety of federal agencies,
including the State Department and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Only two spending bills _ one a $288 billion measure for the
military and another, smaller, bill that provides funds for
military construction _ have been approved by Congress and signed
by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During a lengthy debate in the Senate on the stopgap financing
bill, known as a continuing resolution, Democrats criticized
Republicans for failing to enact the 11 spending measures,
comparing the Republican-controlled legislature with what President
Harry Truman called the ``do nothing'' Congress of 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that we have now developed an operating procedure
around here that is a disaster,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
``We end up with no accountability and no control and chaos at the
end. That's where we are today. This is chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Democrats' ire has been directed toward Republican
leaders who have held off presenting for Senate passage three major
spending bills. One finances the Department of Veterans Affairs and
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, another provides
money for the Commerce, Justice and State departments; the third
authorizes the budgets for the Treasury Department and other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have also expressed anger at a tactic the
Republican leaders had used recently. They had asked the Senate to
vote on a House-Senate conference spending measure for military
construction projects that included the full spending bill for the
Treasury Department, even though the Senate had not debated or
voted on the Treasury measure. The bill was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are poisoning the institutional role of the United States
Senate, rendering it weaker and weaker in influence and
usefulness,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans said they had to use unorthodox
methods to get spending bills passed because Democrats had been
stalling, attaching amendment after amendment to spending bills to
delay passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the process has broken down,'' said Sen. Robert F.
Bennett, R-Utah. ``If I were to look for a place to place blame,''
he said, ``I would look towards'' the Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the finger-pointing, some lawmakers acknowledge that
one cause of the slow pace is the caution bred by a fear of making
a political mistake at a time when the balance in the House and the
Senate, as well as in the presidential race, rests on a razor's
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars are all aligned,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
``You are going to elect a new president and both houses are in
play. That doesn't happen often.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as Congress gave itself some breathing room to work out
agreements between Republicans and Democrats and between Capitol
Hill and the White House, the House moved toward a confrontation
Thursday with the administration about the water flows of the
Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 301-117, the House approved a compromise worked out
in a House-Senate conference on a $23.6 billion spending measure
that finances the Department of Energy, including the national
laboratories where nuclear weapons are developed, and a host of
other federal water and energy programs. The Senate is scheduled to
consider the House-Senate conference measure next week.
</P>
<P>
   The energy and water bill, however, also contains an amendment
that halts the Army Corps of Engineers from revising its plan to
manage the upper reaches of the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   For years, environmentalists have urged the corps to increase
the springtime Missouri flows, thus providing a more hospitable
habitat for threatened species like the pallid sturgeon and two
endangered birds, the piping plover and the least tern.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed change is opposed by down-river lawmakers in
Missouri like House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, a Democrat,
and Sen. Christopher Bond, a Republican. They say that changing the
water flows of the Missouri in the spring could mean reduced flows
in the river in the late summer. As a result, Bond has argued,
barge operators would have difficulty navigating the river.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and other Democrats _ including Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, an up-river lawmaker from South Dakota
_ have prevailed upon the administration to veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, wrote
a letter declaring that unless the amendment barring the Corps of
Engineers from revising its management of the Missouri was dropped
or substantially modified, ``the president will veto this bill.''

FUJIMORI LOOKS FOR U.S. SUPPORT TO MOVE PAST CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As tensions deepen for him at home, President
Alberto Fujimori of Peru flew to Washington on Thursday to seek
support from the United States and inter-American countries and
organizations for his plan to transfer power to an elected
successor, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's trip stunned Clinton administration officials, who
last week were acutely worried that he might be ousted by military
officers loyal to his fired intelligence chief, Vladimiro
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears eased somewhat after Montesinos took refuge in
Panama. But American officials said that Fujimori's hold on power
remained precarious and that Montesinos remained capable of
influencing events in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Peruvian lawmakers have withdrawn their support from
Fujimori, and an 11th has been expelled from his Peru 2000
coalition since the president announced on Sept. 16 that he would
call elections.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' departure has cost the autocratic Fujimori his
majority in the congress and confused a political climate that was
for nearly a decade anchored by him and his rarely photographed but
ubiquitous spy chief, Montesinos. The congress did, however, accede
to Fujimori's request to abolish the National Intelligence Service,
which Montesinos led.
</P>
<P>
   In several areas of Peru, a transportation strike gained ground.
The affected zones included the second-largest city, Arequipa.
Dozens of Peruvians were arrested in protests in coastal cities as
demonstrators called for a lower fuel prices, lower unemployment
and Fujimori's immediate departure.
</P>
<P>
   After a round of hurried calls to Washington late Wednesday,
Fujimori arrived and met Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of
the Organization of American States. Since denouncing Fujimori's
re-election in May as fraudulent, the 34-nation hemispheric forum
has pressed him to hold a new vote. A senior administration
official said Fujimori, after having spurned the OAS for months,
was now seeking its embrace to thwart political or military
challenges at home as he arranged a transition. Fujimori's aides
have indicated that he is considering holding elections in March,
with the inauguration of a president in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming to the OAS to lift his standing and to show he's
in control,'' the official said. ``It's very gutsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Fujimori's challengers is the democratic opposition, which
includes Alejandro Toledo, the candidate for president who withdrew
from the race in the spring as signs of electoral fraud developed.
</P>
<P>
   There also a small but powerful group of army leaders who owe
their careers to Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fujimori is trapped between the military, which wants
Montesinos back or wants a coup, and the opposition which wants an
immediate transition,'' said Eduardo Gamarra, an Andean expert at
Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the army leaders sent menacing signals to bolster
their demand that Montesinos be granted permanent haven in Panama.
Panamanian authorities are considering his request for asylum, a
status that would make it harder to prosecute him for political
extortion, murder and other abuses attributed to him by human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   American officials and Gaviria, a former president of Colombia,
had pressed President Mireya Moscoso of Panama to admit Montesinos
in the first place. The officials said it would be up to Peruvian
and Pananamian officials to determine whether he should be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Montesinos, who reportedly has
vast files on Peruvians, including Fujimori, has long had an
informal relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Friday morning. American officials privately said he
appeared determined to protect a mixed legacy. It has weakened
democratic institutions, but it has also neutralized threats posed
by guerrilla groups, fought the narcotics trade and opened up the
Peruvian economy.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the State Department, Philip T. Reeker, said,
``We will, of course, when we do meet with President Fujimori,
emphasize our support for a peaceful, democratic, constitutional
transition of power for the continuation of that OAS dialogue that
has been going on and which we very much supported.''

FIRESTONE UNEASY OVER THREATENED CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., which is struggling to
cope with the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, can chalk up
one more problem: growing uncertainty about who will be running the
company in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Yoichiro Kaizaki, the president of Firestone's parent,
Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, created the uncertainty two weeks ago
by declaring that a management reshuffle was likely at its U.S.
subsidiary, which is based in Nashville. But there has been no
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of reports in the Japanese media Thursday
that Masatoshi Ono, Firestone's chairman and a protege of Kaizaki,
would be demoted. Bridgestone, based in Tokyo, denied the reports
while repeating that management changes might be coming. Kaizaki
``may be considering a kind of management reshuffle, but nothing
has been decided,'' Ken Kitawaki, Bridgestone's manager of public
relations, said in a telephone call from Nashville, which he is
visiting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Crisis management experts say that promising a shake-up without
taking immediate action is a bad idea because it tends to undercut
the authority and morale of the people who might be losing their
jobs. ``It puts everyone on tenterhooks, because they don't know
what their role is going to be in the future,'' said C.B.
Bhattacharya, an associate professor at Boston University who
specializes in how corporations manage their reputations during
crises.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone is already struggling to preserve its brand in the
face of Congressional hearings and investigations by federal
regulators and the attorneys general of 39 states. Complaints to
regulators have linked the tires to 101 deaths and more than 400
injuries. Almost all of the deaths and injuries have occurred in
Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion at Firestone came as the tire maker and Ford Motor
Co. also quarreled publicly over the role that Firestone would play
in supplying tires to the next generation of Ford Explorers,
beginning with the 2002 Explorer, which is scheduled to go on sale
in January. Firestone said in a statement Thursday that it ``is
slated to be the sole supplier on the 2002 Ford Explorer when it
launches in 2001,'' and that other tire makers would become
involved later.
</P>
<P>
   But Della DiPietro, a Ford spokeswoman, denied this, saying that
Ford had been working with Michelin as well as Firestone since 1997
to supply tires for the next Explorer, and that Michelin tires
would be available from the beginning. Lynn Mann, a spokeswoman for
Michelin, said ``We're happy to stand behind Ford's announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone said in a statement Thursday night that Michelin would
be providing some tires. Separately, Ford has also said it is
talking to Goodyear about tires for the 2002 Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   In a potentially ominous development for Ford, Blueovalnews.com,
a Web site devoted to news about Ford, plans to announce on Friday
that it will share information with regulators about patterns of
defects in Fords. Blueovalnews is popular with technicians at Ford
dealerships, and Robert Lane, the site's founder, said that the
site would allow technicians and the public to fill out forms
online about vehicle problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said that Blueovalnews had been asked unofficially by
officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to
begin collecting the data. Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the NHTSA,
said the agency had not officially asked the Internet site to
provide information but added that one or more investigators might
have asked it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vaughn, a Ford spokesman, said that the site's efforts
were unnecessary because Ford already gathers information from its
dealers and works closely with regulators.

NASDAQ AMENDS PROPOSAL FOR NEW TRADING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to criticism that their plan for a more
centralized system for executing stock trades treated some
investors' orders unfairly, Nasdaq Stock Market officials revised
the proposal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, which is subject to approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, is an attempt to mollify the operators of
electronic communication networks, known as ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of these networks, which allow investors to meet
without a middleman, had complained that the previous Nasdaq plan
put them at a disadvantage because prices posted by an ECN on the
system would have included the trading fees they charge. Adding
such fees to prices posted by ECNs would have made them less
attractive to other investors looking for the best price on a
Nasdaq stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest plan, Nasdaq will no longer post prices on its
system based on the inclusion of ECN access fees. Nasdaq officials
say the new plan will allow its users to choose which market
participants they want to deal with. ``This is a fair resolution to
this issue,'' Richard G. Ketchum, president of Nasdaq, said. ``It
is hard to argue with letting the market decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The change led one ECN that had been critical of Nasdaq's new
system to support the plan. Kevin Foley, chief executive of
Bloomberg Tradebook, said: ``If implemented along the lines
envisioned, it will be a dramatic enhancement for investors and all
market participants.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at other networks, including Archipelago ECN,
remain opposed to the Nasdaq plan. Douglas M. Atkin, president of
Instinet, the largest ECN, said that if Nasdaq allowed market
participants to choose whom they do business with in the system,
some investors' orders that should have priority might never be
executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of fixing the problem and saying investors' orders are
not going to be discriminated against, they dismantled price/time
priority by adding something they call choice,'' Atkin said.
``Every other market in the world lets the first person there get
the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised proposal did not address the issue of how the Nasdaq
system would display prices offered by competing exchanges, like
the Pacific Stock Exchange. Under the original plan, prices from
these exchanges were set to appear well below the quotations of
other market participants and would thus presumably attract fewer
investors. In announcing its revised plan, Nasdaq acknowledged that
additional work would have to be done to make sure prices posted by
exchanges were treated equally.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutional investors who had criticized Nasdaq's earlier
plan declined to comment on the revision until they could read the
amendment, which Nasdaq officials said would be filed with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell anything from what a press release says,'' said
Harold Bradley, senior vice president at American Century
Investments. ``It's in the details where you get stuck.''

NEW DIRECTOR PUSHES FOR STRICTER STANDARDS ON EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP J. HILTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new head of the federal office that oversees research on
people said the system is flawed and will be revised to increase
protections for human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Koski, who took over as director of the Office of Human
Research Protections this month, said that because of the
increasing number of experiments involving people, stricter
standards were needed.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would ask universities to verify that scientists
dealing with human subjects have formal training in ethics. He also
said that the review boards at the universities that approve human
experiments must show they have sufficient staff and expertise to
conduct proper ethical reviews of proposed experiments. In
addition, he is asking the Institute of Medicine at the National
Academy of Sciences to devise a way to measure the performance of
the scientists and boards.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come after a series of lapses in experiments that
Koski said has shaken public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger of Tucson died in a gene
therapy experiment in Pennsylvania. And during the past two years,
the federal government has shut down human research at eight major
universities and hospitals for failure to abide by the nation's
ethical rules. In addition, 34 universities and hospitals were
cited for similar violations.
</P>
<P>
   Koski said that he hoped that most of the changes could be
carried out by research centers voluntarily. But if they were not,
public sentiment likely would force Congressional action to mandate
such standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must move beyond the culture of compliance, to move to a
culture of conscience and responsibility,'' Koski said at a news
conference at his office in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been no certification or accreditation of
scientists or review boards to make sure they have formal ethics
training. Federal officials do not even know how many review boards
there are in the United States, how many experiments are conducted
on humans, or exactly what qualifications researchers and ethics
reviewers have. Not surprisingly, federal oversight has been
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Koski said, the certification of scientists and
supervisory boards by universities and medical centers would remain
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, he said his office has the option of suspending
any program that gets federal funds to carry out research. Research
carried out with private funds is not covered by the system.
</P>
<P>
   Adil E. Shamoo, vice president of Citizens for Responsible Care
and Research, a nonprofit group that has criticized government
supervision of human experiments, said the moves were ``good first
steps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will now depend on how they are carried out, and whether
they can address the weakest link in the system _ that the review
boards themselves are employees of the institutions doing the
experiments. That conflict of interest is the central problem,'' he
said.

OLYMPICS-AD-COLUMN-1 -- The International Olympics Committee's 11

leading up to the Sydney Games, while local sponsors paid an
additional $315 million. Among sportswear manufacturers, the
Italian company Fila has taken up the mantle of Nike at the Games
in Sydney. In 1998, it leased a replica of Britain's legendary 18th
century sailing ship H.M.S. Bounty, the crew of which mutinied
against Capt. William Bligh on a commission to Tahiti. The ship,

USC NEEDS BIG ROAD PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sign No. 1 USC is a different team:
</P>
<P>
   During halftime of the Trojans' 34-24 victory over San Jose
State, center Eric Denmon lambasted his teammates in the locker
room for their sloppy efforts. And he had a captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always have players speak out, but it only means
something if players want to listen,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Denmon's message, with USC trailing by 12 points, was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, being down 12 points at halftime, they would have
given up,'' Denmon said. ``I just told the team we're not playing
like we were practicing. Just because we were ranked ninth, that
didn't mean anything. I told them that in so many words.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmon's speech apparently worked, because USC ended up
outscoring San Jose State 22-0 in the fourth quarter to pull out
the comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's a major reason the eighth-ranked Trojans (3-0) believe they
are better equipped to handle adversity this season.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Trojans really are a different team, they need to
demonstrate they can win on the road and in a hostile environment,
something they haven't done consistently in the Pacific-10
Conference during coach Paul Hackett's first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   USC will get the chance to clear this barrier when it plays
undefeated Oregon State (3-0) Saturday at Reser Stadium in
Corvallis.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are 3-5 on the road under Hackett, but all three
victories (Washington State twice, Stanford) came against teams
with losing records.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime USC has played a quality opponent, or for that matter, a
team above .500, it has found a way to lose. And usually, the
Trojans were their own biggest enemy, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, usually only one phase would do well, primarily
the defense was our strength,'' Denmon said. ``There would be a lot
of bickering on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive stats certainly show an inconsistency on the road.
In USC's Pac-10 road losses under Hackett, the Trojans averaged 18
points per game. In their victories, they averaged 36 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we lost most games was because of mental errors or
mistakes,'' quarterback Carson Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The offense's ineptness usually caused the defense to feel the
strain of trying to hold an opponent down, aware the offense
wouldn't be able to rally from a deficit. Sometimes, worrying about
it too much would backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past couple years, we had a knack for letting the big play
happen against us,'' cornerback Kris Richard said. ``There was a
lack of focus. Not necessarily a lack of emotions, but we had a
big-play syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are optimistic these problems will not resurface in
Corvallis. Even Hackett believes this year's team is better
prepared to handle playing in a small, loud, sold-out stadium that
seats little more than 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a different team. The leadership and response in the
fourth quarter is different,'' Hackett said. ``But this game is a
big hump. We've got to get over this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is only the first Pac-10 game for both teams, the
players realize the stakes are high, particularly as the Trojans
continue to build confidence from their perfect start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose this one, the whole season will build off that,''
fullback Charlie Landrigan said. ``We can't look ahead to any
games. That's what's bitten us in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Denmon: ``Both teams have a lot to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The loser immediately falls into the back of the pack in the
Rose Bowl race and needs the winner to lose two conference games to
keep its hopes of playing in Pasadena alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will gunning for us,'' Landrigan said. ``Winning there
would be big.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hackett feels good about one thing going into the game, it's
USC's 29-5 victory over Penn State last month in the Kickoff
Classic. While Giants Stadium was a neutral field, the crowd of
more than 78,000 was overwhelmingly pro-Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be a good football team, you have to play
on the road and win,'' Hackett said. ``Now, I feel good about
playing in New York. We went on the road and won. This would have
been our first road game if we hadn't played there.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be as many fans at Oregon State, but they will be
closer to the field. And many of the Trojans weren't even around
the last time USC played in Corvallis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we haven't experienced,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   But as serious as USC regards the game, that doesn't mean the
Trojans haven't sometimes been lighthearted when pondering the
prospects of playing away from the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure on the road. Traveler won't be
there,'' Denmon joked, referring to USC's horse mascot.

Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of Canada who
successfully defended his vision of federalism and a unified nation
against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism, died Thursday in
Montreal. He was 80. Trudeau had suffered from Parkinson's disease
and prostate cancer and, more recently, pneumonia. Throughout his
career, Trudeau succeeded in altering his country's traditionally
staid and fusty image with atypical flamboyance. He was a dashing
figure who made his countrymen proud that a Canadian was so highly

mifepristone or RU-486, for sale in the United States. It is the
first alternative to surgical abortion approved here. Roussel
Ucalf, a unit of Hoechst AG, declined to seek marketing approval
for the drug in the United States, saying it feared protests from
opponents of abortion rights. In 1994, the company gave the drug's
patent to a nonprofit group, the Population Council, which set out
to get market approval. A photo of Roussel Ucalf's RU-486 when it

<P>
   I am a scab, a nonunion actor who crossed the Screen Actors
Guild picket line to audition for and act in a commercial. This may
be the first issue on which Susan Sarandon and I disagree.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is how to pay actors for their work in TV commercials.
Advertisers want to pay a flat fee for all ads on network TV, as
they do for cable. SAG wants advertisers to continue paying actors
each time a commercial is shown on network TV, and to adopt that
policy for cable and the Internet, too. On May 1 SAG called a
strike, prohibiting its members from performing in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   I never wanted to be a scab; I wanted to be in the union. But
SAG has a Catch-22: you can't get into the union unless you have a
union job, and you can't get a union job unless you're in the union
(unless you know somebody with enough pull or you are exactly what
they're looking for).
</P>
<P>
   The union dictates that I can't even be considered for a
commercial until all SAG actors of my type have been seen. And
since I am a middle-aged woman, odds are low that I will even be
seen by a casting director.
</P>
<P>
   But right now I can get into SAG by putting in 80 hours manning
the picket lines and harassing non-SAG actors as they go on
auditions (there was such an overwhelming response to this offer
that the union stopped putting names on the waiting list). I can
also join if I alert the union when I book a commercial so they can
set up a picket line. By refusing to cross, I will get my card
immediately. These conditions may not come under the rubric of
illegal labor practices, but they seem pretty unfair to me.
</P>
<P>
   The strike's most vocal supporters seem to be the least
affected. Instead of wearing yellow ribbons to the Emmys, why
didn't Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston just not show up? After
all, the show is supported by advertisers. Or Richard Dreyfuss
could say he will never make another movie with a product
placement.
</P>
<P>
   Other unions aren't actively supporting this strike, because SAG
doesn't support them. Shortly after the strike began, all 35 SAG
film actors on the New York set of ``Perfume'' crossed a picket
line of stage employees protesting a nonunion crew. If SAG has no
qualms about working with a nonunion crew, why should the crew care
whether it works with non-SAG actors?
</P>
<P>
   At 6:45 on a recent drizzly morning I was greeted by four
protesters as I approached the van that was to take me to location.
They harangued me and took my photograph. When the strike was over,
they warned, I would be forever barred from joining the union. This
sounds like a Hollywood blacklist to me, but maybe I'm letting my
imagination run away with me.

ABORTION CHANGES, BUT HOW MUCH?

 By CYNTHIA GORNEY 
 c.2000 New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The RU-486 announcement yesterday arrived with a lot of emphatic
declarations attached: ``historic moment,'' ``milestone,'' ``most
significant technological advance in women's reproductive health
care since the birth control pill.'' That last characterization was
from Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood, responding to
the news that the Food and Drug Administration had finally approved
the marketing of what's come to be known as the abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare for a confusion of multisyllabic ``m'' words as Historic
Moment arguments get underway. Mifepristone, named RU-486 by the
French company that developed it, is the now-marketable pill that
begins a miscarriage in very early pregnancy. Misoprostol, already
marketed for other uses, is the medication that completes a
pill-induced abortion, when used after the mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   Two medications, in other words, not one. Two visits to the
doctor, under the most lenient of the current protocols _ maybe
three visits _ and maybe a mandatory ultrasound to confirm the
timing of the pregnancy, which could require a trip to a facility
with an ultrasound machine.
</P>
<P>
   There's drawn-out pain, severe in some cases, less so in others,
but lasting considerably longer than the brief intense pain of most
surgical abortions. And medical abortion promises to be no cheaper
than the surgical alternative, at least at first _ about $300,
according to doctors who have been running this country's clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Which is only to say that women need to remember what is in fact
historic about this moment, what must be kept in perspective, and
how much we have yet to learn about what termination by pill is
going to mean for American abortion practice.
</P>
<P>
   It will change the abortion debate, not because it is a pill but
because it works so early in pregnancy; both sides know that. Both
sides know as well that in theory the pills have the potential to
do what some abortion supporters dreamed of 30 years ago, when New
York became the first of the contiguous states to drop its abortion
restrictions: Termination of pregnancy might now lose its dreadful
stigma, they exulted, and become part of the regular practice of
any doctor who attends to women in their childbearing years.
</P>
<P>
   But of course that is not what happened, and although much has
changed over the last three decades, veterans of the legalization
battles sometimes despair over how much has not. In many
communities the decision to offer terminations still brings on
protests or bomb threats or the cold shoulder at Sunday church
services; surely nobody in New York in 1970 envisioned
circuit-riding doctors with bulletproof vests under their scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most physicians don't want to be worried about their safety,''
a St. Petersburg, Fla., obstetrician-gynecologist told a reporter
earlier this month. She thought RU-486 was a fine idea, but she
said she had no plans to begin dispensing it.
</P>
<P>
   Is hers a minority voice? Or are there many thousands like her
out there, kindly disposed toward mifepristone without quite being
ready to hand over the pills and risk the word getting out around
town? Are family practitioners and gynecology training programs
ready to amend their ``We don't teach that here'' stance?
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more we don't know yet. Is it going to be a good
thing or a bad thing when the first magazine and newspaper ads
offering discount mifepristone-abortion start appearing, like the
ads for cheap laser eye correction? And how long will it take
before somebody is offering cut-rate abortion tablets on the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   These pills have been studied as thoroughly as any in recent
history, as their many medical defenders have pointed out, and one
conclusion of the studies is the critical importance of timing the
pregnancy correctly and making sure that when the bleeding and
cramping are over, the abortion is complete. That requires a visit
to the doctor. It requires vigilance on the part of the pregnant
woman, and a decision before the eight-week cutoff period.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if she wants an RU-486 abortion without going over to the
local abortion clinic, the woman is going to have to sit down with
her doctor and ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the popularity of mifepristone in Europe,
and rightly so: more than a half million of these abortions have
taken place there by now. But it is also worth remembering that
even in France, where the pills began, two-thirds of abortion
patients are still opting for suction.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans do take to the new method, and if they are
straightforward about requesting it from their doctors, and if the
dispensing of mifepristone develops enough critical mass so that no
community physician is singled out as the abortion pill doc, then
perhaps we really are looking at a milestone here.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be up to doctors and their patients to decide
together how big a milestone, and just how much of the journey it
marks.

   Bridgestone/Firestone, which is recalling 6.5 million tires, is
also facing growing uncertainty about who will run the company.
Yoichiro Kaizaki, the president of Firestone's parent, Bridgestone

<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ When Herman Boone was passed over for a head
coaching position in Williamston, N.C., he did what any coach would
do. He searched for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Little did Boone know that he was going to find the biggest
challenge of his career. But it also proved to be the most
rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Boone, a Rocky Mount, N.C. native, became the head
football coach at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va. The
Alexandria school board was being forced to create more racially
balanced schools. Boone, who is black, was appointed the new head
coach and thereby given the task of trying to unite not only a
football team, but a school and a community. The Titans completed a
perfect season and won the Virginia AAA state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story of the 1971 Titans is hitting the big screen
nationwide today with the opening of ``Remember the Titans.'' The
Walt Disney film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced
such films as ``Armageddon,'' ``The Rock'' and ``Con Air.'' It
stars Denzel Washington as Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the films stars were on hand for a gala screening in
Washington, D.C., Tuesday night. With many of the original Titans
in attendance, along with celebrities and dignitaries like
President Clinton, the atmosphere combined a high school reunion
with a Hollywood gala.
</P>
<P>
   It also continued to shine the spotlight on Boone, 64. Who told
the Telegram a year ago when filming began, that he was afraid of
the attention the movie would bring to his family. He still feels
that way today, but he has learned to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a low maintenance family,'' Boone said at the
post-screening party at ESPN Zone restaurant. ``We try to stay out
of the spotlight as much as we can. But this is like a storm that
catches up with you and you can't avoid it. You just have to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone said he coached at a school in Williamston from 1961 to
1969 and won four state championships. But when he was passed over
for a head coaching position when the schools were integrated, he
decided to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that the town wasn't ready for a black coach,''
Boone said. ``And with me assisting the white coach at the white
school, so we couldn't help but win could we? The white coach came
out of East Carolina, a nice guy, a nice kid. He lost his first
eight, won his last two. I go 14-0 and right away I've got to
assist him? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone said he headed to a coaching clinic and was one of the few
black coaches in Eastern North Carolina that filmed his games. He
would bring his films to the clinics and meet with other black
coaches because everything was so segregated.
</P>
<P>
   Boone eventually was hired to be part of the staff of Bill
Yoast, a white coach. But the school board later appointed Boone as
head coach over Yoast, which created even more tension. Not only
did Boone have to find a way to get his players to come together,
he had to start but uniting his own coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Boone found a way to not only unify the team, but eventually the
entire community. Mostly through his determination. Qualities Boone
said he gained while growing up in Rocky Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Boone grew up in the Happy Hill section of Rocky Mount. An area
that stretches west of the railroad tracks, to the Tar River and
down to Raleigh Road. He still has a brother who lives here. Many
friends and family were in Washington for the premier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell the underprivileged children of Rocky Mount, 'If a
little racked dude who lived over a ditch in the 700 block of Gay
Street, can make it to the top of the world, through hard work, I
mean extremely hard work - the only one in my family of 12 people
that ever thought about college - then they can make it,''' Boone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though conditions were rough, Boone still speaks fondly of
his childhood. Partly because he said he never knew that things
were tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three rooms with no heat, a fireplace,'' Boone said.
``The spigot froze up in the winter time. We had to save our water,
bathe in tubs. . . . None of my friends in Rocky Mount knew that we
were poor, because as Sam Gray, on of my best friends said to me a
few minutes ago, 'there's love between people of Happy Hill.' They
won't allow you to realize that you're poor. Because we had so much
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone was involved in the making of the film. He said he spent
most weekends in Atlanta, where the film was shot, and worked with
Washington to help him mold to the role.
</P>
<P>
   Boone said there wasn't much he had to tell Washington, only
teaching him some of Boone's own football terminology. That's where
Boone says there is a little Rocky Mount flavor in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to tell him that much,'' Boone said of
Washington. ``He's a brilliant human being. You just had to tell
him your football vocabulary. So that he could make it authentic.
So of course my wife told him my curse words . . .. Hind parts _
you know what that is - when you say that I guess everybody in the
world will know I'm from Rocky Mount.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone touched and shaped the lives of a community nearly 30
years ago. Now he's hoping that the movie will shapes the lives of
everyone that sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it touches a lot of lives,'' Boone said. ``It's a feel
good movie.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the first debates of the Republican
primaries, Gov. George W. Bush did not have to do much. With six
candidates dividing an hour and a half, no one got more than 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush filled up even less than that, his diaphanous answers
sometimes ending many seconds before the allotted time. And while
his opponents talked longer and louder during those early December
meetings, few seemed as self-satisfied as the Texas governor. His
lips twisted into an expression quickly branded ``the smirk.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, however, he had grafted a layer of
earnestness over any arrogance for his ninth debate, a special
edition of CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' There were just two other
contenders left at that point. But Bush was suddenly a font of
interjections and rebuttals, as if he had to rush to fit in all
that he had to say.
</P>
<P>
   As he approaches his first debate with Vice President Al Gore in
Boston next week, it is impossible to know which incarnation of
Bush will show up.
</P>
<P>
   He and his aides are hoping for the better version, and will
devote much of the weekend to debate preparation. It is their final
push in a process that began last spring, and it is a recognition
both that the campaign is entering a new phase, to be dominated by
the three debates between Bush and Gore, and that these events
represent Bush's best chance to erase any lingering questions about
how serious and seasoned he really is.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore is a well-known quantity in this arena, a fresh,
thorough review of Bush's 10 debates during the primaries and his
two earlier debates in Texas showed him to be an unpredictable,
uneven performer. At the same time, it revealed someone who,
despite his image in some quarters as an overconfident slacker, can
be capable of significant improvements, important adjustments and
little surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still kind of out on Bush,'' said Greg Mueller,
who was a senior adviser to the publisher Steve Forbes, one of
Bush's former rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.
Mueller was referring to Bush's aptitude for debates, but he said
there was one clear lesson from the primaries: Bush brings weapons
to the battle that should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them is his talent for humorous asides, some of
them cleverly self-effacing and some of them clearly spontaneous,
and Bush drew on this with increasing frequency and effectiveness
as he progressed through the rapid-fire series of debates last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   At his fourth one, in early January, he was asked: ``Would you
take an expression like `What would Jesus do?' into the Oval
Office?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take an expression into the Oval Office of `Dear God,
help me,''' Bush answered, without missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   When Gary Bauer, another rival, muttered that the same thought
would go through his head if Bush were president, Bush again found
a fast and fitting retort.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't very Christian of you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also, in the same forum, mispronounced ``obfuscate,''
even though he was following his habit of edging up slowly to
multisyllable clusters of consonants, as if pondering dangerous
potholes on his oratorical highway.
</P>
<P>
   That error demonstrated one of his debate liabilities: A
wobbliness (and sometimes wackiness) with words that was present
even during the Larry King performance, when Bush signaled his
commitment to a growing economy by saying, ``We ought to make the
pie higher.''
</P>
<P>
   His debates to date form a fairly apt metaphor for his candidacy
and, really, for his political identity.
</P>
<P>
   At his worst, Bush came across as cocky, tongue-tied and only
glibly engaged with the nuts and bolts of the matters at hand. At
his best, he projected a genuineness of belief, buoyancy of spirit
and affability of character that trumped any of his opponents'
charms.
</P>
<P>
   At all times, he leaned _ arguably a few inches further than
other candidates do _ on transparently scripted, broad statements
about his principles and qualifications, no matter what he had been
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable example was his answer, during a December
debate in Phoenix, to a question about what he had learned from a
biography of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson that he had
previously said he was reading. Bush simply reverted to
foreign-policy lines from his stump speeches.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But his aides and advisers are not talking much these days about
that balance sheet of strengths and weaknesses; they are too busy
building Gore into the most fearsome forensic gladiator in the
empire.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, one of them called the vice president
``the most effective and lethal debater in modern presidential
politics.'' Several others said that Bush would be lucky simply to
remain upright in the face of Gore's onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The name of this game is the management of expectations, and
Bush's associates played it perfectly in 1994, when he was running
for Texas governor against a quick-witted incumbent, Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   A recent look at the sole Bush-Richards debate that year left
little doubt that she was funnier, more agile with facts, and more
authoritative. And some of Bush's canned goods verged on hokey, as
when he concluded his final remarks by abruptly quoting a song:
``Texas, our Texas, all hail the mighty state.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had never previously engaged in a formal debate, so the
fact that he stood his ground and stated his platform succinctly,
clearly and sometimes even forcefully impressed many skeptical
observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought he won,'' said Bill Miller, a political
strategist in Austin, who has worked for both Democrats and
Republicans. ``But nobody said, `Gee, Richards just wiped the floor
with this guy,' so he came out of it well.'' Several weeks later,
he defeated Richards in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers are now trying to create a similar dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   They can and will tell anyone who asks that since 1984, Gore has
debated about 45 times. They can and will recite chapter and verse
of a long article about Gore's evolution as a debater in the July
issue of Atlantic Monthly, the cover of which depicted the vice
president as a political vampire.
</P>
<P>
   But many of Bush's advisers acknowledge that behind the scenes,
Bush has been practicing and practicing, to a degree that is not
wholly characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, for example, he did not bother with a
single mock debate. For the general election, he began such
rehearsals about four months ago, several advisers said. In May, he
sat with aides in the governor's mansion in Austin and watched a
videotape, edited by the campaign's chief media adviser, Mark
McKinnon, that included scenes from Gore's debates as well as high
points from past presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In early June, he and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the
stand-in for Gore, actually stood at lecterns in a room at the Bush
family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. It was a scenario repeated
over subsequent months, with Stuart Stevens, another media adviser
with the campaign, acting as a moderator.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, at Bush's ranch near Waco, he and Gregg will
hold a timed rehearsal at the same late hour as Tuesday's event, a
dry run that will test him past his usual bedtime. They may do a
second rehearsal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers said that one goal of all this work has been to brief
Bush thoroughly on the details of Gore's record and proposals. But
another goal has been simply to make sure that Bush goes into
Tuesday's debate feeling as comfortable as possible, because that
often dictates whether he seems clipped or convivial, herky-jerky
or fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts said that the way he showcases his
personality will be a key to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``His forte is not speed or specificity,'' noted Roderick P.
Hart, a University of Texas professor of communication and
government who has observed Bush through the years. ``But contrary
to popular reports, he's an intelligent man.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hart said, ``he has some of that genial quality
that President Reagan had in debates.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The debates during the primaries bear out that assessment. Some
of Bush's best moments came when he finally relaxed enough to
unleash a playful streak that made him seem accessible and smart
and accomplished other goals as well.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, during his eighth debate, he responded to
several of Forbes' attacks on his Texas record by saying, ``So many
half stories, so little time.'' It was the kind of Reaganesque,
``there-you-go-again'' line that is certain to be trotted out on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the last debate, on March 2, he drew laughter
and applause when he answered a question about his familiarity with
the Internet by saying that he ``e-mailed my mother the other
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to stand straight, by the way, when I was at your
debate,'' he added. It was a quick, self-effacing and humorous way
to work his family connections.
</P>
<P>
   But this was also the debate in which Bush went a laugh too far,
chuckling when one of his questioners mentioned that some death row
convicts in Texas had had lawyers who slept during their trials.
</P>
<P>
   A more persistent trait of Bush's responses was his tendency to
talk about foreign policy in the most general, well-worn terms.
When King asked him about the appropriate occasions for military
force, Bush lapsed into a kind of mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's in our national strategic interest,'' Bush said.
``The Far East is in our national strategic interest. Our own
hemisphere is in our national strategic interests. The Middle East,
protecting Israel, is in our national security interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, to many observers, was much safer than it was
illuminating.

 &HT;    Candidates prepare for the debatesBy Ken Herman and Scott
Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For Al Gore, the problem is great expectations.
For George W. Bush, the hurdle, as it's been since day one, is
proving he is presidential material.
</P>
<P>
   So far, months of campaigning and millions of dollars of
political spending have produced a dead heat. The tie-breaking
process begins Tuesday night in Boston when Bush and Gore go
lectern to lectern in the first of three debates that will move
crucial undecided voters one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the debates, the American people get the
information they need to make an informed decision on Nov. 7,''
said Paul G. Kirk Jr., a co-chairman of the Commission on
Presidential Debates that sponsors the events.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, both candidates retreated to familiar ground for
final preparation sessions. The goals are the same, but the
challenges differ for the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is a natural-born killer when it comes to debates,'' said
GOP strategist Scott Reed, who is not affiliated with the Bush
campaign, but is part of the Republican effort to set a high bar
for Gore to clear.
</P>
<P>
   For GOP nominee Bush, who has spent more than a year offering
programs and policies, the hurdle is the same one he faced on June
1999 when he flew to Iowa (on a plane dubbed ``Great
Expectations'') to announce his candidacy: Is this guy presidential
material?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has got to convey something more than warmth and charm,''
said Wayne Fields, a political rhetoric expert at Washington
University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Fields' campus will host the third presidential debate on Oct.
17. Round two is set for Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C. Vice
presidential nominees Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney square off
Thursday night in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went home for the weekend and Gore headed to Florida to
prepare for the Tuesday meeting at the University of Massachusetts
at Boston. At his ranch in Crawford, west of Waco, Bush is working
with a team of aides and New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, who is
playing Gore in the mock debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore brought a small entourage to Longboat Key, near Sarasota,
where he will practice at the Mote Marine Laboratory, a private,
nonprofit research and education facility. In addition to debate
prep, the trip to Florida gave Gore several days of high-profile
publicity in a key state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used the facility as the headquarters for preparation
for his 1996 vice presidential debate against GOP nominee Jack
Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore entourage in Florida this weekend includes wife Tipper,
daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, brother-in-law Frank Hunger and a
handful of top aides. Among those is Clinton adviser Bruce Reed,
who has taken a leave of absence from his White House chores to
help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also invited 12 ``ordinary citizens'' from around the
nation to join him in Florida to offer their input.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not complicated,'' Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley said
of the pre-debate process. ``You try to guess at the subject areas,
the three or four that will come up in each'' debate.
</P>
<P>
   A key member of Team Gore is Paul Begala, a Texan and longtime
Clinton-Gore aide who is spending the weekend playing Bush. Begala
got the gig after former U.S. Rep. Tom Downey of New York, who had
been playing Bush, received a package including a videotape of Bush
debate preparation sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Downey turned the tape over to the FBI, which is still
investigating how it got to him, and dropped off the debate prep
team.
</P>
<P>
   Begala relishes his role as Bush, who, like Begala, is known to
occasionally crack wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that very appealing. He is a bit of a wiseacre and I am
too, I like that about him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Begala is the author of a recent book analyzing Bush's
effectiveness in Texas. It's called ``Is Our Children Learning?''a
campaign-trail malapropism coined by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very different world view than I do. He was born rich
and he is going to be rich and he is going to die rich,'' said
Begala, who has managed to turn politics into a buck or two.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to spin a spinner, so Begala isn't buying the Bush
campaign's attempt to set low expectations (a curious effort on
behalf of a candidate who makes his points about raising education
standards by discussing ``the soft bigotry of low expectations.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has done a masterful job of spinning
expectations,'' said Begala. ``That's one of the reasons he beat
Ann Richards and he beat John McCain. It would be very, very
foolish to underestimate him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, political rhetoric expert Rita Whillock said Bush's
burden of proof is to show he is up to the top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got to come across as a CEO,'' said Whillock, a
professor of public affairs at Southern Methodist University.
``That's his credentials for office. He just doesn't have the
policy wonk information.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Bush aide said a successful night for his boss would be
showing that he can ``stand toe to toe'' with Gore, a debater whose
actual talents can't possibly match the reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, aware of the great expectations, told reporters last week,
``I don't have an overconfident bone in my body.'' He recalled
Bush's performance, rated by many at the time as adequate, in his
1994 gubernatorial race debate against then-Gov. Ann Richards, then
the reigning queen of political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to be slaughtered in that,'' Gore said,
aw-shucksing his own vaunted talents. ``She's certainly a better
debater than I am. She's got a very quick wit and silver tongue and
is just smart as a whip, and he beat her in that debate, so put
that in your formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, calmly confident in the face of the pre-debate chatter
about Gore, is taking the low-key approach to what he knows will be
a high-key deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as a great opportunity to explain my vision for the
country,'' he said last week on ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, which included a Wednesday night return
to Austin for debate preparation, Bush summed it up this way,
``Either you're ready or you're not read.'' And he believes he is.
</P>
<P>
   It's a more even-up assessment than offered during the summer by
Karl Rove, Bush's top strategist, who, facetiously but to make a
point, called Gore ``the world's most pre-eminent debater, a man
who is more proficient at hand-to-hand debate combat than anybody
the world has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pre-debate setting of odds and expectations,
University of Kansas communications professor Diana Carlin says
voters tend to ignore the hype and watch with a discerning eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers are measuring a combination of things,'' said Carlin,
a member of the Commission on Presidential Debates. ``This is the
only time you have them in the same place, the only time you can
really get them to compare, if the questions are asked the right
way. I equate it to a job interview. It's part job interview, but
it's also part test of how they handle the pressure, how they
relate to the public.''

TWO EXECUTIVES INDICTED IN $9 BILLION FRAUD SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two former top executives of a Georgia medical software company
were indicted on Thursday, accused of costing investors more than
$9 billion in one of the largest financial frauds in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   As co-presidents of HBO &AMP; Co. for most of 1998, Albert J.
Bergonzi and Jay P. Gilbertson used sham deals and bad accounting
to inflate the company's revenue and earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars, according to federal prosecutors in San
Francisco, who announced the indictments. If convicted, the two men
each face up to 10 years in jail and a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. was acquired by McKesson, a distributor of
prescription drugs based in San Francisco, in January 1999 for $14
billion. When the merged McKesson HBO announced that its auditors
had discovered fraud in April 1999, its shares fell almost 50
percent in one day, leaving investors $9 billion poorer. McKesson
HBO stock has yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission
steps up efforts to work more closely with federal prosecutors in
cases of serious financial wrongdoing. Over the last two years,
Richard Walker, the SEC's director of enforcement, has visited U.S.
attorneys in several cities to offer the commission's help to
prosecutors interested in filing financial fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping cases like this will send a message to corporate
boardrooms and suites that they actually could go to jail for
this,'' said Leslie Caldwell, chief of securities fraud for the
U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco. ``This isn't just managing
your numbers or tweaking accounts here and there. This is putting
your whole company at risk, and if you do that, there are going to
be serious consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Bergonzi and Gilbertson denied the criminal charges,
as well as a related civil complaint filed by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Dominick A. DeRosa, a former HBO vice president, agreed to pay
more than $411,000 to settle an SEC complaint against him in the
case. DeRosa was not charged in the criminal case, and Caldwell
said DeRosa was cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's fast growth in sales and profits made it a favorite of
investors throughout the 1990s. Its stock rose more than a
hundredfold between October 1990 and October 1998, when HBO agreed
to be acquired by McKesson, the largest distributor of prescription
drugs in the United States. At the time, the two companies had a
combined market value of more than $23 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when the merged McKesson HBO announced in April 1999 that
its auditors had discovered fraud at HBO during a routine annual
review, McKesson HBO shares fell to $34 from $65 in a single day.
HBO McKesson stock rose 38 cents, to close at $30.50 on Thursday,
giving the company a market value of less than $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Bergonzi and Gilbertson, desperate to ensure
that HBO would meet or beat analysts' expectations for sales and
profits, used several schemes to inflate the company's results.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1998, they allowed more than a dozen hospitals to buy
HBO software or services with conditional ``side letters'' that
allowed the hospitals to back out of the deals, according to the
indictment. Then they hid the side letters from auditors and
reported those sales as complete, violating accounting rules. In at
least one case, a hospital canceled a purchase HBO had booked,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   To further bolster its results, HBO also agreed to huge sham
sales with two other large computer companies, according to the
indictment. On Sept. 28, 1998, two days before the end of HBO's
quarter and just weeks before HBO and McKesson agreed to merge, the
two men agreed to buy $73.8 million in software from Computer
Associates, supposedly for resale, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Computer Associates of Long Island, a maker of
software used by big companies, bought $30 million in HBO software,
also supposedly for resale.
</P>
<P>
   To make the deals seem separate, the men ``split the transaction
into separate contracts, neither of which made any reference to the
other,'' the indictment asserts. In the two years since it bought
HBO's software, Computer Associates ``has neither made use of nor
distributed any of the $30 million in HBOC software products,''
according to the indictment. Similarly, HBO had sold only a
fraction of the $74 million in Computer Associates software it
bought.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, McKesson HBO and Data General, a computer
hardware maker based in Massachusetts, agreed to a similar deal,
prosecutors said. It was that deal that eventually led to the fraud
discovery, when Data General disclosed to auditors that what
appeared to be a simple $20 million purchase of HBO's software had
a side agreement that essentially ensured that Data General would
never have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The frauds increased HBO's revenue by $230 million, or more than
20 percent, in the final three quarters of 1999, according to the
indictment. Profits were overstated by $170 million, or nearly 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson left HBO in November 1998 to become the president of
WebMD, an Internet health care company. He resigned from WebMD in
June 1999 after McKesson HBO said it had discovered the fraud.
McKesson HBO fired Bergonzi and other former top HBO executives in
June 1999. A McKesson spokesman said on Thursday that only one
former HBO executive is now among the top 20 executives of the
merged company, and that that person joined HBO only in December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell and SEC officials said that the investigation was
continuing and that more complaints or charges might be filed.
Charles McCall, the former chairman of HBO, has not been charged
with wrongdoing in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said McKesson HBO was unlikely to be charged with fraud
because the company immediately began an investigation when it
discovered the problems and told the public and the authorities
promptly. ``The company basically did the right thing when they
discovered there was a fraud,'' Caldwell said.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday that it had
approved the marketing of an abortion-inducing pill, the first
alternative to surgical abortion approved in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, a prescription drug, will be available to doctors in
about four weeks, its distributor said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, mifepristone, or RU-486, will allow doctors like
family practitioners and obstetricians to offer abortions outside
of specialty clinics, and it will allow women to have abortions in
the privacy of their homes up to seven weeks after their last
menstrual period.
</P>
<P>
   Although most women who seek abortions do not do so until later
in their pregnancies, the drug has taken on immense symbolic
importance for both supporters and opponents of abortion rights.
Many supporters of abortion rights have said its approval would
transform the struggle over legal abortion, making the procedure
more accessible, more private and harder for opponents of abortion
to identify women who are having the procedure and doctors who are
providing it. Approval of the drug immediately brought out the
contrasts in the views on abortion of Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Gore said he was pleased with the
decision and Bush said it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Jane E. Henney, the FDA commissioner, said in an
interview, ``Politics had no role in this decision.'' It was based,
Henney said, on persuasive data showing the drug is safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The drug will be distributed under the name Mifeprex by Danco
Laboratories of New York City, a company formed specifically to
find someone to make the drug and then to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of abortion rights said they were elated by the health
agency's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I seen anything like this,'' said Gloria Feldt, the
president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which
participated in clinical trials of the drug. ``Never has there been
a drug approval that has been through such an arduous political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldt called the drug ``the most significant technological
advance in women's reproductive health care since the birth control
pill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a setback for those who oppose abortions, and some of
them saw it as a contradiction in Clinton administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should give people pause,'' said Dr. Richard Land,
the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and
religious liberty commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how they square this with making abortions safe,
legal and rare,'' Land said, citing an oft-repeated Clinton
administration goal. ``It will make them more plentiful and less
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, the health agency set relatively few
restrictions on doctors' freedom to prescribe the drug, beyond
requiring that the doctors be able to determine the length of time
that a woman has been pregnant and that they make sure that women
who receive mifepristone have ready access to surgical abortions,
should they need them.
</P>
<P>
   Women will be given written instructions on the pill's use and
its side effects and their doctor must sign a statement saying that
they have read the instructions and will comply with them exactly.
The women must also agree to have a surgical abortion if the pills
do not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   A woman first takes mifepristone, which blocks the action of
progesterone, a hormone required to maintain a pregnancy, and 36 to
48 hours later takes a second drug, misoprostol, which makes the
uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue. In clinical trials,
the drug combination failed to result in complete abortion in about
5 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also required that the Population Council, a nonprofit
group that sponsored Danco's application to market mifepristone,
keep track of how many women suffer serious side effects and the
number of cases in which it fails to induce abortion. The council
will also audit doctors to see whether they and the women taking
the drug are signing the patient agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although advocates of abortion rights have been pushing for
approval of mifepristone for years, it is not clear how many U.S.
women will choose it. The drug can be used only until seven weeks
after a woman's last menstrual period, and just one-third of
abortions performed in the United States occur at that stage
according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that
conducts research on reproductive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, side effects like excessive bleeding are extremely
rare in first-trimester surgical abortions, and abortions are legal
even into the third trimester of pregnancy in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors said they anticipated many women seeking abortion
would prefer the surgical approach, since the procedure usually is
over in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that mifepristone is highly effective and
there are good results most of the time,'' said Dr. Warren Hern,
director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado. But. she said,
citing side effects like excessive bleeding and incomplete
abortions, ``people have a way of denying these problems with the
drug and saying it's a magic bullet. It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldt of Planned Parenthood said women in clinical trials said
they liked mifepristone abortions because they felt more natural
than surgical ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel more in charge, more in control of their personal
health,'' Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   But Olivia Gans, who is the director of American Victims of
Abortion at the National Right to Life Committee, said she worried
that women might not understand what they were getting into when
they took the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just seeking another way to deliberately end a life,''
she said. ``How honest are we going to be with the American public
about what's at stake with this drug?''
</P>
<P>
   Heather O'Neill, a Danco spokeswoman, said that the company had
not yet set a price for the drug but that she expected that
insurance companies and government programs that now pay for
surgical abortions would also pay for mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who want to use mifepristone may find that insurance
questions and FDA restrictions are just part of their requirements.
In some states, abortion laws might restrict the drug's use. For
example, many states require that abortion providers register and
report every abortion. Some have detailed requirements for the
design of offices and clinics. Some states require that fetal
remains be examined by a doctor and in North Dakota, the remains
must be cremated, incinerated, or buried, the law says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some doctors who could administer the drug may
choose not to do so. ``Any doctor who regularly does abortions in
most states has been subjected to extra scrutiny from law
enforcement _ they don't fool around with this,'' said Janet
Benshoof, the president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, a legal advocacy organization that has represented abortion
clinics in legal disputes. Benshoof said that in many states, the
laws written for surgical abortions also apply to pill-induced
abortions and that some states specifically include pill-induced
abortions in their regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite mifepristone's great potential to improve medical
services for women, anti-abortion state legislatures have already
erected a labyrinth of laws restricting all abortion,'' Benshoof
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mifepristone was first synthesized 20 years ago, in France, and
came on the market in Europe more than a decade ago. But from the
beginning its introduction into the United States was entangled in
abortion politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Land said, he went to Europe with a delegation of
opponents of abortion, like the National Right to Life Committee
and the Knights of Columbus, to tell executives at Roussel-Uclaf
SA, the drug's maker, and its parent company, Hoechst AG, that they
would face boycotts and protests if they attempted to sell the drug
in the United States. (Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc last
December and the merged company is called Aventis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Hoechst that it would be unfortunate if they were to
market the drug in the U.S. since they had an unfortunate history
when it came to death-dealing materials,'' Land said. The company
was part of a conglomerate that had a major interest in the
chemical used in German gas chambers in World War II. ``We knew and
we wanted them to know that we knew,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Roussel-Uclaf said that it would not seek
approval to market mifepristone here; without a new drug
application, the FDA could not fully assess the drug.
</P>
<P>
   When he first came into office, in 1993, President Clinton asked
federal regulators to assess whether the drug was safe and should
be sold in this country. Dr. David A. Kessler, who was commissioner
of the FDA from October of 1990 until March of 1997, prevailed upon
Roussel-Uclaf to donate its patent to the Population Council, which
wanted to sponsor clinical trials in the United States and find a
company to produce and market the drug. In May of 1994,
Roussel-Uclaf donated its patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did think that we should have a chance to evaluate
the drug,'' Kessler said. ``We didn't think that politics should
get in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Population Council presented its data on the
drug's safety and efficacy to an advisory committee of the health
agency, which recommended the drug be approved for marketing in
this country. But the Population Council still had no one willing
to manufacture the drug. As a result, the agency could not issue
final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't approve a drug unless the drug exists, unless you
can inspect the plant,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some doctors have been using a cancer
chemotherapy, methotrexate, to induce abortions. This use is legal,
but because methotrexate was not extensively tested and is not
approved as an abortion drug its use is not widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to announce the approval of mifepristone, Henney,
the F.D.A. commissioner, said, reflects the FDA's own six-month
interval to rule on applications to market a drug. Danco submitted
crucial information six months ago, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go back again to saying that politics did not play a
role in this,'' Henney said. ``The people who know me and the
people who know this agency know that we make our decisions based
on the scientific evidence that we have before us. These are
scientific decisions.''

MORGAN STANLEY CREATES FUND TIED TO INTERNET INDEX 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning Friday, investors will be able to tie their money to
picks made in part by one of the most influential Wall Street
analysts following the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is introducing an investment fund
that will track the Morgan Stanley Internet index, whose 29 stocks
are chosen by Mary Meeker and other analysts at Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker has been dubbed ``Queen of the Net'' by Barron's and was
the subject of a long profile in The New Yorker last year. Her firm
was the lead underwriter for such pioneering initial public
offerings as Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Now Morgan Stanley is using Meeker to promote its new Internet
fund _ she is scheduled to appear at a news conference Friday
promoting the product, which will be the first investment fund for
retail investors that has a tie to her research.
</P>
<P>
   This year, of course, being ``Queen of the Net'' is not the most
exalted perch. Internet stocks took a drubbing in April and have
yet to recover. Since its introduction on March 24, the Morgan
Internet index has fallen 48.4 percent. Meeker declined to comment,
and Morgan officials refused to speak on the record. But they
contend the index is a better gauge of the Internet industry
compared with the dozens of other Internet indexes that have
preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the market for Internet stocks has slumped this
year, Internet stock indexes continue to proliferate, as do
investment funds created to buy only Internet stocks. Because of
regulatory bureaucracy and the investment industry's sometimes
sluggish pace, new funds created to invest in hot market trends
often arrive just in time to find that the hot investment trend has
grown ice cold.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, three mutual funds invested exclusively in
Internet stocks. Today, there are more than 40 of various types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there room for more? My inclination is probably not,'' said
Donald Cassidy, senior research analyst at the fund tracking firm
Lipper. ``The Morgan Stanley name will help. The fact that she'd
talk it up will help. But, gee, this isn't the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   The StreetTracks Morgan Stanley Internet Index Fund, as the new
fund is called, is an exchange-traded fund, a mutual fund-like
product that trades like a stock. The index is run in conjunction
with the American Stock Exchange, which uses Morgan Stanley's
research and its lists of recommended stocks to compile and alter
the index, in which each stock is rebalanced with an equal
weighting every quarter. The fund will be run by State Street
Global Advisers, an investment firm in Boston that is introducing
six other exchange-traded funds Friday, and come with a 0.50
percent expense ratio _ the annual fee deducted in daily increments
from mutual and exchange-traded funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be interest because it's Mary Meeker, but there's
no shortage of Internet investing options,'' said James Atkinson,
president of an Internet investment company called Maxfunds.com.
``This is a very late entrant into this field.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson helped create the first Internet index fund last July,
when he was the top domestic mutual fund executive at Investec
Asset Management, based in London. Investec's fund tracks an index
maintained by Internet.com, a Web publishing company. Since then,
funds have been introduced that track Internet indexes created by
Dow Jones, Goldman, Sachs and several firms with less familiar
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting how new funds are created,'' Cassidy said.
``Somebody makes a marketing decision that's usually made in a
favorable time. Then you take two, three, four months, whatever the
process is in the particular house, before it finally trades. By
then the market might be quite different.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with last year, the market is quite different. The
average Internet mutual fund has fallen 22.9 percent this year,
according to the fund tracking firm Morningstar. Some have lost 40
percent to 50 percent. The optimist would call it a buying
opportunity. The pessimist would call it a dark hole to jump into.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Garnick, a Merrill Lynch analyst who follows
exchange-traded funds, said the Morgan fund would be a breed apart
from existing Internet funds, a hybrid falling in between
traditional index funds that try to represent the market or
different sectors, and actively managed mutual funds, where stock
pickers try to beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say it is a giant leap forward toward actively
managed ETFs,'' Garnick said. Because of the regulatory
restrictions of a fund that trades throughout the day like a stock,
all exchange-traded funds are index funds. Most prominent stock
indexes, like those run by Standard &AMP; Poor's or Dow Jones, are
compiled by a committee of economists trying to represent a market
sector. Garnick thinks Meeker and the other Morgan analysts would
add a different kind of selectivity to the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts know better the prospects of the companies,'' she
said, and would go beyond merely trying to represent the Net
industry and try to pick ``the best companies.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of
Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a
unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism,
died Thursday in Montreal. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau had suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate
cancer and, more recently, pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Trudeau succeeded in altering his
country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical
flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen proud
that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two
spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month
hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the
Conservatives. When, finally, in 1984 he chose to step down after a
meditative walk in the snow, he was the longest serving Western
leader of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic
electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political
equivalent to the paroxysms evoked by the rise of the Beatles.
During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of
the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation.
Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being
pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau supervised the process by which the country replaced its
ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered
economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his
country at odds with the leadership of Canada's only neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   While firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive
to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Trudeau saw to
it that the role of the French language was reinforced when the
entire country was made officially bilingual in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau recognized Communist China long before the United States
did. He led sometimes quixotic campaigns for world peace and
nuclear disarmament while allying himself closely with such
Socialist leaders as Olav Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of Germany
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Canadians, his greatest achievement was his
successful struggle against the Quebec separatist movement. After
bombings, bank robberies and kidnappings by terrorists, and after
he was scorned as an apostate to Quebec's cause, he ultimately won
the support of most Quebec voters, who sided with him in a
referendum in 1980 that took the wind out of the sails of the
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reason before passion,'' was his personal motto, and he used
it in arguing, on economic and moral grounds, that Quebec should
stay within the Canadian federation. The separatist challenge was a
major crisis in Canadian history, and his admirers say he saved
Canada by defeating the movement.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Pierre Trudeau ran his country with a panache
that was aggressively and un-Canadianly immodest. He wore rakish
hats, drove sports cars, flaunted his learning and his wit, dated
celebrities like Barbra Streisand, toured the discos, married a
former flower child much younger than himself and once, in an act
of apparent insouciance, was photographed as he pirouetted alone in
Buckingham Palace while other guests walked off to meet Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Valpy, a political columnist for The Globe and Mail,
noted in 1998 on the occasion of Trudeau's 79th birthday, the prime
minister had become impressed early in his political career by an
idea advanced by Marshall McLuhan, the philosopher of media.
McLuhan believed that the public sees prominent figures as if they
are wearing masks, and that it is the character of the mask that
the public identifies with, not the person behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Valpy, who is married to Deborah Coyne, a constitutional lawyer
who is also the mother of Trudeau's youngest child, a daughter,
maintained that the mask Trudeau selected was that of the warrior
chief. He added, ``It would require a Joseph Campbell to explain to
Canadians _ the beaver people of peace, order and good government _
why they found magic in a warrior chief's mask. But magic they
found, served up by a practiced and consummate magician.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Canadian commentator, Richard Gwyn, maintained that
Canadians were fascinated with Trudeau precisely because his image
was not the way they saw themselves but the way they wanted to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He teases, taunts, inspires and bugs the hell out of Canadians
because they know he is utterly un-Canadian _ but exactly what they
want other people to think Canadians are like,'' Gwynn wrote in a
collection of essays called ``Trudeau's Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country so devoted to understatement, Trudeau's ascendancy
marked a radical departure. His success was compared to the
transformation of presidential style and leadership that took place
eight years earlier in Washington when John F. Kennedy was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, such a change drew complaints at home and abroad.
In the United States, Trudeau's assertion of Canadian prerogatives
frequently raised eyebrows and indignation. There was the time, for
example, when he referred to a Washington bureaucrat as ``a
pipsqueak.'' There were protests in America when he tried to limit
U.S. investments in Canada, particularly in the Canadian oil
industry. And when he urged NATO to make a dovish retreat from its
first- strike nuclear strategy, the Reagan administration thought
him to be naive, dangerous and presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like all Canadian leaders, he remained preoccupied by his
country's relationship with the United States and even charmed his
critics with comments like those he offered in 1969 after meeting
President Richard Nixon in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an
elephant,'' Trudeau declared. ``No matter how friendly and even
tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by
every twitch and grunt.``
</P>
<P>
   And when Trudeau retired 15 years later, James Reston wrote in
his column in The New York Times: ``Some of us down here think he
was a good neighbor and a good friend. We liked his crusty
arrogance and the rose in his lapel. He gave us his truth as he saw
it, even if we didn't always like it.``
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Philippe Pierre Ives Elliott Trudeau was born on Oct. 18,
1919, in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Charles-Emile Trudeau, the son of French-speaking
Quebec farmers, was a lawyer then on his way to wealth as the owner
of a chain of gas stations. He would also acquire profitable mines,
the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the Royals, the city's
minor league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Grace, was of mixed Scottish and French descent.
</P>
<P>
   The family spoke mostly French at home, but Trudeau could not
remember a time when he did not also speak English.
</P>
<P>
   At a Jesuit high school where he studied Latin and Greek, he
systematically tested teachers in contrarian debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that I must never interrupt a teacher to make an
impertinent remark, because that would be certain to infuriate
him,'' Trudeau wrote in 1993 in a book he called simply ``
Memoirs.`` ``But if I waited until he paused and then I slipped in
a wisecrack, the class would burst out laughing before he had a
chance to get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the pleasure of such moments led him to a lifelong
habit of ``opposing conventional wisdoms and challenging prevailing
opinions.``
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 he entered the University of Montreal, only vaguely
aware that the war in Europe ``might constitute the most dramatic
adventure the men of my generation would ever confront.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he also observed, ``If you were a French Canadian in
Montreal in the early 1940s, you did not automatically believe that
this was a just war. We still knew nothing of the Holocaust, and we
tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the
superpowers.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he did not enlist and even rallied against
conscription of French Canadians. In 1943 he graduated with a
degree in law and after clerking in a law office, went to Harvard
for graduate study in political economy. At Harvard, he recalled,
he was made to understand the parochialism of the Quebec, meeting
professors who were refugees from Europe who did make him aware of
``missing one of the major events of the century.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Until he was 30, he spent his time in study and travel. He left
Harvard for Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris, where he roared
across the city on a motorcycle and tasted from a rich and
fashionable intellectual menu: The Christian left, the worker
priest movement, orthodox Marxism, classical liberalism,
existentialism and particularly personalism, an attempt associated
with the writer Jacques Maritain to reconcile the needs of
individuals and society.
</P>
<P>
   A year later he was studying at the London School of Economics,
principally with Harold Laski, the eminent professor of political
science who was also the chairman of the British Labor Party.
Trudeau has written that his basic philosophy of government was
established at the LSE at a time when Britain was on the verge of
instituting the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1948, Trudeau set off on a slow voyage of
discovery, ostensibly to do research for a never completed doctoral
dissertation on the interplay of Christianity and Marxism in Asia.
Actually, as he later explained, he was embarking on a different
odyssey, eager to mix with local people and to see and sense the
world.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in Arab Jerusalem on suspicion of being an
Israeli spy, and later he was detained when he crossed the new and
tense border between Pakistan and India. He hitch-hiked across an
Indochina already rent by warring factions and he was in China
during the 1949 revolution there.
</P>
<P>
   His attendance at a lawyers' meeting in Moscow led to
instructions to American immigration officials in the
anti-Communist period in the 1950s to deny him admission if he
tried to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, Trudeau returned home dismayed that the
authoritarian government of Maurice Duplessis and the local
ecclesiatical establishment that had ruled Quebec since his
childhood were still in firm control. He committed himself to work
for a ``democratic revolution'' in the province, seeking separation
of church and state, electoral reform and educational changes. He
founded an intellectual quarterly, Cite Libre, and used its pages
to call for a coalition of democratic forces against the Duplessis
regime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 he became a law professor at the University of Montreal,
which earlier had steadfastly shunned him for being too radical and
anticlerical. By this time a quiet revolution was well underway in
Quebec, with urban, cosmopolitan and secular values rising to
challenge the old culture and the old politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 Trudeau joined the Liberal Party and won election to the
House of Commons. In Parliament, he sympathized with many
grievances of the French Canadians, advocating support for their
language and culture. But at the same time he steadfastly opposed
any legislative action that would give them special status. He was
a federalist, and he despaired of any separatist solutions that
suggested ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``French Canadians must refuse to be enclosed within Quebec,''
he wrote in one of his essays. ``The die is cast in Canada: There
are two main ethnic and linguistic groups; each is too strong and
too deeply rooted in the past, too firmly bound to a mother culture
to engulf the other. But if the two will collaborate at the hub of
a truly pluralistic state, Canada could become the envied seat of a
form of federalism that belongs to tomorrow's world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, he was quickly singled out by Prime Minister Lester
Pearson, who named him to his cabinet in 1967 as minister of
justice and concurrently attorney general. He produced legislation
expanding social welfare, tightening gun control and liberalizing
laws relating to divorce, abortion and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   When Pearson announced his intention to resign, Trudeau competed
with 19 others for the post of party leader, which carried with it
the prize of prime minister. Trudeau was victorious and on April
20, 1968, he was sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister and its
third of French descent.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later he dissolved Parliament, calling for general
elections. Trudeau campaigned on the promise of ``a Just Society,''
urging that the country's richer provinces pay for programs in the
poorer ones . He conceded that the expanded government programs he
wanted would mean higher taxes, but declared ``if you want pie in
the sky, you'll have to vote for another party.''
</P>
<P>
   It all went over with the voters, and on June 25, propelled by
``Trudeaumania,'' the electorate gave the Liberals a clear and
comfortable majority.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria was shattered in 1970 when a terrorist group, the
Front de la Liberation de Quebec kidnapped James Cross, a British
diplomat, and a week later, seized Pierre Laporte, a minister in
the Quebec provincial cabinet. As a condition of their freedom, the
Front demanded the release of members who had been imprisoned on
charges or convictions of murder, bank robbery and bombings carried
out in the pursuit of separatism.
</P>
<P>
   While demonstrators rallied in support of the Front and
nonviolent supporters of separatism called stridently for full
appeasement of the kidnappers, Trudeau painfully and reluctantly
invoked Canada's War Measures Act to protect Canada from what the
``cancer of an armed, revolutionary movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Using provisions of the act, he sent thousands of troops to
Montreal and canceled some civil liberties, including the use of
legal writs. Some 400 people were arrested and detained without
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Oct. 17, a message from the Front told
authorities where they could find the body of LaPorte. Four men
were eventually charged with his murder and imprisoned. Cross was
then released and his captors were allowed to leave for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After the crackdown, terrorism effectively ceased in Quebec.
Trudeau's tough responses proved highly popular.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of separatism for Quebec did not disappear. Indeed
it kept growing, advanced no longer simply by terrorists but by
popular politicians of the Parti Quebecois, notably Renee Levesque,
an old friend of Trudeau's who was to become his chief opponent on
the issue. By 1976 the party had taken control of the Quebec
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was the success of Trudeau's policies toward
Quebec that led to his brief ouster from office in the elections of
May 1979. With the risk of Quebec's secession seemingly ended by
his efforts, the western provinces were encouraged to lash out
against Trudeau's party, which they viewed as favoring federal
power at the expense of the authority of their provinces. The
Liberals won no seats west of Winnipeg, and Joe Clark, the leader
of the Progressive Conservative Party, became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But then Levesque inadvertantly came to Trudeau's rescue.
Realizing that the elections had removed the strongest proponent of
federalism from power, Levesque felt it opportune to prepare a
referendum that would ask the people of Quebec whether they wanted
to empower provincial officials to begin negotiations on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But by that act he strengthened Trudeau's support throughout the
country. Some of those who had voted against him thinking the
separatist danger had ended, now openly missed his voice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And Clark quickly stumbled. He lost a vote of no confidence and
new elections were ordered. Trudeau rallied impressively, and by
March 1980, he was once more prime minister, and immediately set
off to challenge the Parti Quebecois in Levesque's referendum,
scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
   The debate became personal and nasty, with Levesque, who was
seeking a yes vote, at one point dismissing the prime minister's
arguments against the proposition. ``His name is Pierre Elliott
Trudeau and this is the Elliott side taking over, and that's the
English side, so we French Canadians in Quebec can't expect any
sympathy from him,`` said Levesque.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister counterattacked. He listed the Ryans, the
Johnsons and the O'Neills _ who despite their Anglo-Saxon names
were famous French Canadian political families. Then he declared,
``Of course my name is Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Elliott was my
mother's name. It was the name borne by the Elliotts who came to
Canada more than 200 years ago. My name is a Quebec name. But my
name is a Canadian name also.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. On May 20, 1980, 59.6 per cent of the electorate
voted ``non.'' In the showdown over the destiny of Quebec,
Trudeau's vision had overwhelmed Levesque's hopes of pulling an
independent Quebec out of the Canadian federal system. Though only
the foolhardy could claim that Trudeau's victory over the forces of
separatism was permanent, none could dispute that it was profound.
</P>
<P>
   There were other successes. In 1982 he succeeded in repatriating
the Constitution by having the British Parliament pass an act that
ceded full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter to
Ottawa. He saw bilingualism and multiculturalism become national
programs. And his vision of Canada as a compassionate and
benevolent government open to the rest of the world yet different
from the United States has survived his term of office.
</P>
<P>
   There were setbacks over nuclear disarmament and on his attempts
to limit foreign involvement in the economy. But it was in his
private life where he proved most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, at the Club Med in Tahiti, the 51-year-old Trudeau met
Margaret Sinclair, 21, the daughter of a Liberal party politician
from British Columbia. They were married the next year and by 1975
they had three sons, Justin, Alexander and Michel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after campaigning with her husband in the 1974 elections,
Margaret Trudeau suffered exhaustion and was hospitalized. When she
emerged from the hospital, she became a photographer, following
rock musicians and frequenting nightclubs, where she was herself
often photographed in ways that were humiliating to her husband.
Her friendship with Mick Jagger and other pop icons provided more
grist for tabloid gossip columnists on several continents.
</P>
<P>
   The couple separated in 1974 and were divorced in 1984 with
Pierre Trudeau getting custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down as prime minister, Trudeau moved to Montreal
where he kept largely to himself, avoiding interviews or public
appearances. He suffered from Parkinson's disease but even before
the symptoms of his illness intensified, he kept close to home. He
was always considered an aloof, insular man, and his former wife
had once said that he was ``destined for eternal solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   His public mask, the one he had crafted, seemed to have slipped
away and friends who had known him for years described him as an
increasingly unhappy man. In 1998, his youngest son, Michel, a
23-year-old microbiologist who had worked as a ski instructor, was
swept to his death in an avalanche in British Columbia. Trudeau
grieved privately. He was close to his surviving sons and until his
last illness frequently visited with his daughter by Coyne.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, despite the aloofness of his last years, memories
of the warrior chief persisted in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years after he left office, when a sampling of
Canadians were polled about which public figure they would most
want to have dinner with, Pierre Trudeau came in a close second.
The only Canadian who was more popular than he was Wayne Gretzky.

A LITTLE PRAISE FOR CLINTON GOES A LONG WAY FOR BUSH

 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ After more than a year of trying to hang
President Clinton around Vice President Al Gore's neck, Gov. George
W. Bush took the opposite tack on Thursday, saying that the main
problem with Gore was that he was not enough like his boss.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to workers at a manufacturing plant here, Bush
tacitly praised Clinton's past calls for an end to ``big
government'' and said that Gore was not heeding them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the vice president had ``cast his lot with the old
Democratic party'' in proposing a new level of federal spending and
regulation that, Bush said, would endanger the country's current
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president was seated right behind Bill Clinton at the
State of the Union when the president declared, `The era of big
government is over,''' Bush said, referring to Clinton's address in
January 1996. ``Apparently, the message never took.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent seemed interested in `reinventing government,'''
Bush said, alluding to one of Gore's signature phrases. ``Now he
seems interested only in expanding it. For him, big government has
never really been dead. It's simply been biding its time, waiting
for its next chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments made up some of the sharpened language that Bush
unveiled on Thursday to make the case that electing Gore might mean
a return to ``the old ways of tax and spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the point, Bush called on Gore to make an unequivocal
promise that he would never raise the payroll taxes for Social
Security to keep the entitlement program financially solvent. Bush
has made that pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The references to Clinton revealed a fresh tactic in Bush's
intrinsically difficult quest to persuade Americans that they
should unseat an incumbent administration during a period of
unparalleled prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was essentially saying that electing Gore would not be like
re-electing Clinton, because Gore was less protege than dissident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is proposing the largest increase in federal spending in 35
years, since the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson,'' Bush said.
``The vice president's spending plan proposes three times more in
new spending than Bill Clinton proposed in 1992. If the vice
president gets elected, the era of big government being over is
over. And so, too, I fear, could be our prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   In casting Gore as financially profligate and trying to plant
fears that he might raise taxes, Bush sounded much like his father
did in 1988, when then-Vice President George Bush waged a
successful campaign for the presidency against Michael Dukakis,
then the governor of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not use the word ``liberal,'' which was the tag his
father placed on Dukakis at the time. But that was clearly what the
Texas governor meant. And what he intended was to persuade voters
that prosperity was a potentially fragile thing and that Gore was
not its surest protector but its direst threat, someone who would
not use the projected federal surpluses in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began an attempt to take the issue of prosperity at least
partly away from Gore this week when he warned that the vice
president was not taking the necessary steps to end an ``education
recession'' that imperiled the American economy down the line.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he warned that too much new government spending
could have the same effect. He said that his own proposal for a
sweeping tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years was, in fact, ``an
insurance policy against an economic slowdown or a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, called
Bush's assessments ``absolutely laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Gore's 10-year budget plan called for
higher expenditures in ``education, health care, Medicare and the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hattaway said that Gore's proposal for an estimated $500
billion in tax cuts over 10 years _ less than half the size of
Bush's _ made that spending affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's pledge not to raise payroll taxes for Social
Security, Hattaway said, ``Did he say, `Read my lips'? The last
time a Bush made a silly pledge like that, he broke it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Gore would not be making a similar vow, because
the vice president had already outlined a plan for safeguarding
Social Security that did not involve a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mentioned Clinton twice _ and twice flattered him in
comparison with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Bush had loudly rued the possibility of ``four more
years of Clinton-Gore'' and implied that the vice president was a
participant in an administration that, in Bush's view, was guilty
of serious ethical lapses, divisive partisanship and failed
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Bush described Gore as an entirely different
kind of politician from Clinton, one who had ``left the vital
center of American politics.''  &QL;

MOSLEY TO TAKE ON DIAZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His rematch with Oscar De La Hoya on hold
indefinitely, Shane Mosley is moving on but not avoiding a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The WBC welterweight champion will make the first defense of his
title Nov. 4 in New York against Antonio Diaz _ a junior
welterweight contender from Coachella who has won his past 25
fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a credible fighter,'' Mosley said, ``a great fighter. He
has great counter-punching skills, he's consistent. He has a Julio
Cesar Chavez look., strong, great chin, durable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I'm too fast for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz (33-2, with 24 knockouts) IS a credible fighter.
</P>
<P>
   He has proved he's all the things Mosley (35-0, 32 KOs) said he
is. In two recent fights, he was tougher than two tough opponents,
stopping Ivan Robinson in April and outpointing Mickey Ward in
August.
</P>
<P>
   A significant question is weight: Diaz will be fighting at 147
pounds for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio is a big boy,'' said Lee Espinoza, his manager. ``He's
been having a lot of problems trying to make weight. He weighs 164
pounds right now.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, from whom Mosley took the title in June, is in the
picture. The former champion said he wants to fight early next year
in spite of an ugly contractual dispute with promoter Bob Arum and
would like to fight Mosley in May.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Mosley, who stands to make $10 million-plus
against De La Hoya (compared to $3 million against Diaz).
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Oscar's ready, I'll be ready,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of
Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a
unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism,
died Thursday in Montreal. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau had suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate
cancer and, more recently, pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Trudeau succeeded in altering his
country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical
flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen proud
that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two
spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month
hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the
Conservatives. When, finally, in 1984 he chose to step down after a
meditative walk in the snow, he was the longest serving Western
leader of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic
electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political
equivalent to the paroxysms evoked by the rise of the Beatles.
During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of
the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation.
Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being
pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau supervised the process by which the country replaced its
ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered
economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his
country at odds with the leadership of Canada's only neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   While firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive
to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Trudeau saw to
it that the role of the French language was reinforced when the
entire country was made officially bilingual in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau recognized Communist China long before the United States
did. He led sometimes quixotic campaigns for world peace and
nuclear disarmament while allying himself closely with such
Socialist leaders as Olav Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of Germany
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Canadians, his greatest achievement was his
successful struggle against the Quebec separatist movement. After
bombings, bank robberies and kidnappings by terrorists, and after
he was scorned as an apostate to Quebec's cause, he ultimately won
the support of most Quebec voters, who sided with him in a
referendum in 1980 that took the wind out of the sails of the
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reason before passion,'' was his personal motto, and he used
it in arguing, on economic and moral grounds, that Quebec should
stay within the Canadian federation. The separatist challenge was a
major crisis in Canadian history, and his admirers say he saved
Canada by defeating the movement.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Pierre Trudeau ran his country with a panache
that was aggressively and un-Canadianly immodest. He wore rakish
hats, drove sports cars, flaunted his learning and his wit, dated
celebrities like Barbra Streisand, toured the discos, married a
former flower child much younger than himself and once, in an act
of apparent insouciance, was photographed as he pirouetted alone in
Buckingham Palace while other guests walked off to meet Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   In a country so devoted to understatement, Trudeau's ascendancy
marked a radical departure. His success was compared to the
transformation of presidential style and leadership that took place
eight years earlier in Washington when John F. Kennedy was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, at the Club Med in Tahiti, the then 51-year-old Trudeau
met Margaret Sinclair, 21, the daughter of a Liberal party
politician from British Columbia. They were married the next year
and by 1975 they had three sons, Justin, Alexander and Michel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after campaigning with her husband in the 1974 elections,
Margaret Trudeau suffered exhaustion and was hospitalized. When she
emerged from the hospital, she became a photographer, following
rock musicians and frequenting nightclubs, where she was herself
often photographed in ways that were humiliating to her husband.
Her friendship with Mick Jagger and other pop icons provided more
grist for tabloid gossip columnists on several continents.
</P>
<P>
   The couple separated in 1974 and were divorced in 1984 with
Pierre Trudeau getting custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down as prime minister, Trudeau moved to Montreal
where he kept largely to himself, avoiding interviews or public
appearances. He suffered from Parkinson's disease but even before
the symptoms of his illness intensified, he kept close to home. He
was always considered an aloof, insular man and his former wife had
once said that he was ``destined for eternal solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   His public mask, the one he had crafted, seemed to have slipped
away and friends who had known him for years described him as an
increasingly unhappy man. In 1998, his youngest son, Michel, a
23-year-old microbiologist who had worked as a ski instructor, was
swept to his death in an avalanche in British Columbia. Trudeau
grieved privately. Nonetheless, despite the aloofness of his last
years, memories of the warrior chief persisted in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years after he left office, when a sampling of
Canadians were polled about which public figure they would most
want to have dinner with, Pierre Trudeau came in a close second.
The only Canadian who was more popular than he was Wayne Gretzky.

GORE SAYS BUSH TAX PLAN THREATENS PROSPERITY
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo NYT3 is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Thursday that
``prosperity itself will be on the ballot'' on Nov. 7 and then
repeatedly portrayed Gov. George W. Bush's proposed income tax cut
as a serious threat to the country's economic health.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not tax relief,'' Gore said of his Republican rival's
$1.3 trillion tax reduction plan. ``That's a massive tax on
America's potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his comments in a notably brief speech to a group of
scholars and staff members at the Brookings Institution, one of
Washington's most prominent research organizations. It is a
nonpartisan group that conducts research on a broad range of
domestic and foreign policy topics.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made no new proposals during his address,
which he read somewhat impassively from a teleprompter while
standing at a lectern. But he did introduce new language, and aides
said the speech, like other Gore addresses this week, was designed
as something of a test drive for Gore's first debate with Bush,
which is set for Tuesday night in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, viewers can expect to hear a vigorous
assault on Bush's tax cut plan. Gore attacked the Bush plan five
times in his 13-minute address. The candidates' disparate
approaches to tax cuts provide perhaps the clearest distinction in
this year's campaign, and Gore has long maintained that the
Republican plan risks a return to heavy deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush proposal would reduce all income tax rates, double the
child credit, provide a break for married couples, repeal the
federal estate tax and expand the deductibility of charitable
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   It would reduce federal revenue by $1.3 trillion in the nine
years starting 2002 and would use $1.6 trillion of the federal
surplus because of increased interest costs that the government
would incur if the surplus is used for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to
be $4.3 trillion during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, opposes any across-the-board reduction in tax
rates. He has proposed a $500 billion array of targeted tax cuts
and credits aimed at providing relief for the middle class. They
would include financial breaks intended to encourage retirement
savings and to make college tuition, health insurance and child
care more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would spend more than Bush on education and health care,
and he would devote significant sums to paying down the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider this fact,'' Gore said of Bush's proposal. ``The
other side's plan gives more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 1
percent _ $667 billion of the surplus _ than all the new money they
would invest in education, health care, prescription drugs and the
national defense combined.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I believe in smart investments for the future, not
massive tax cuts for the few that could bring us back into
deficit.''

   NEW WRINKLES IN CHINA-WTO APPLICATION
</P>
<P>
   China's effort to gain admission to the World Trade Organization
has encountered new problems, undercutting the chances that the
country can join by the end of the year. China's top negotiator,
Long Yongtu, denied speculation of a deadlock, but the WTO
negotiating group chairman issued a statement calling for a
``fundamental re-examination of negotiating positions in capitals''
before any new session takes place. Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S.
trade representative, has asked for a meeting with China's premier,
Zhu Rongji, but no date has been set, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   FREESERVE POSTS LOSS
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Freeserve, the leading provider of Internet access in
Britain, fell 3 percent to 235 pence, or about $3.31, after it said
first-quarter losses had nearly doubled to 15.5 million pounds, or
about $19 million, as spending on advertising and new services
increased. Revenue grew more than three-fold to 14.6 million
pounds, and the number of registered users grew to 2 million,
compared with 1.4 million a year ago. Freeserve, which is 80
percent owned by Dixons, the British consumer electronics retailer,
has been unsuccessful in its attempts to find a buyer even as other
Internet service providers have rushed to consolidate. Tiscali SpA
and Germany's T-Online International AG, which have made
acquisitions to expand and cut costs, now have more than 6 million
users each. Freeserve also is facing stiff competition from United
States Internet companies Yahoo and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   PARTNERSHIP ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   In a deal to help speed the development of in-car electronic
services, Ford Motor Co. and Peugeot Citroen of France announced
that they would form an alliance to cooperate in automotive design
and the development of wireless services like cell phone and
Internet access and entertainment channels. The companies expect to
formally seal the deal by the end of the year. In August, Ford
formed a joint venture with Qualcomm Inc., called Wingcast, to
equip its cars for wireless services. The deal is the latest
example of a spreading web of cooperation agreements in the car
industry. Ford and Citroen recently announced an agreement to
cooperate in the development of diesel engines.

<P>
   STRONG RESULTS AT FRENCH CONGLOMERATE
</P>
<P>
   The French media company Lagardere, best known for its
publishing division and magazines, reported a 36.4 percent increase
in first-half operating income, to 263 million euros, or $232
million, as revenue increased to 5.9 billion euros from 5.8 billion
a year earlier. Net profit soared almost sixfold, to 788 million
euros largely on a one-time exceptional gain of 1.1 billion euros
related to the sale this year of an Internet service provider, Club
Internet, to Deutsche Telekom, and of the publisher Grolier Inc. to
Scholastic Corp. To focus on the media, Lagardere this year also
entered an alliance with Canal Plus, a European pay-for-view
television company.
</P>
<P>
   UNILEVER-BESTFOODS DEAL APPROVED
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission said it had approved the $24.3 billion
acquisition of the U.S. foods company Bestfoods by Unilever PLC,
the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer goods conglomerate. Under the
European Commission's condition for approval, Unilever must shed
brands and businesses worth $440 million in annual sales. Unilever
said it had agreed to shed overlapping businesses such as its Oxo
bouillon cubes and Bestfood's Lesieur mayonnaise products in
France. The Federal Trade Commission in the United States has
approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA BANK EXPANDS SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Canada's largest Royal Bank of Canada, has agreed to buy Dain
Rauscher Corp. of Minneapolis, a retail brokerage and investment
banker, for $1.456 billion. At $95 a share, the offer is 19 percent
above Dain Rauscher's trading price Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange. Royal Bank chairman John Cleghorn said the acquisition
will provide ``an established U.S. presence and a platform for
growth.'' In June, the bank bought the insurance businesses of
Liberty Corp. of Greenville, S.C., and indicated it wants to
develop cross-marketing of banking, insurance and brokerage
services that are not yet permitted in Canada. The latest
transaction requires approval from regulatory agencies and
shareholders.

   NORTEL WINS CHINA, TAIWAN DEALS
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Nortel Networks Corp. has won two contracts worth $525
million to build wireless telephone systems in China and Taiwan.
One contract, worth $250 million, is for 1,900 new base stations
for cellular phone and Internet transmission for Chunghwa Telecom
in Taiwan. Chunghwa has given Nortel, which is based in Brampton,
Ontario, $900 million worth of orders since 1994. The second, $275
million contract is with Zhejiang Unicom in China to install
infrastructure and software for wireless Internet services.

FIDELITY SELLS NEWSPAPERS TO BOSTON HERALD OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The owner of The Boston Herald is purchasing Community Newspaper
Co., a group of four daily and 88 weekly newspapers in the Boston
suburbs, from Fidelity Capital, the new business and venture
capital arm of Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Patrick J. Purcell, the owner of Herald Media
Inc., a regional platform from which to compete with The Boston
Globe, particularly in the wealthy suburbs west of the city. The
Globe is owned by The New York Times Co., which earlier this year
completed its purchase of The Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette, which
is Massachusetts' third-largest newspaper, for $295 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegram &AMP; Gazette circulates in many of the same western
suburbs where Community Newspapers owns weeklies. The biggest of
the four daily newspapers, The MetroWest Daily News, is published
in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Thursday, Purcell declared, ``Let the
battle begin.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six and a half years since he bought The Herald _ which
has a daily circulation of 266,000 _ from his former employer,
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Purcell has impressed industry
analysts and New England newspaper executives with his ability to
keep The Herald profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The same observers say that Fidelity struggled to get consistent
returns on its investment in the newspapers and niche publications
that serve 140 communities in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, Fidelity has not operated these newspapers well,''
said Steven Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Ketter, the former editor of The Patriot Ledger in
Quincy, Mass., who is now chairman of Boston University's
journalism department, said: ``I think Fidelity has found that the
newspaper business is a very difficult business. They tried the
concept of 100 little mice trying to be an elephant, and they
realized that it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Purcell, operating from a strong base in Boston, may be able
to find economies and combinations that enhance The Herald's reach
and profitability, while increasing the margins of the community
newspapers, which have a combined circulation of about 900,000. ``I
think the purchase of the Fidelity papers by The Herald moves them
up a significant notch in competition with The Globe,'' Ketter
added.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell said Thursday that ``this is an extraordinary
revenue-generating opportunity.'' He added that ``the ability to
generate ad revenue in this combination is enormous.'' He also
noted that his was by far the biggest community newspaper operation
in a single region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two other companies have pursued a similar strategy. Pulitzer
Inc., the owner of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, this summer paid
$165 million for Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, including
38 newspapers and some niche publications. Hollinger Inc., the
parent of Hollinger International, owns Chicago's No. 2 newspaper,
The Chicago Sun-Times, as well as the suburban Pioneer Press
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the Community Newspaper sale came on the
same day The Globe started its new Thursday GlobeWest section,
serving 35 communities in Boston's western suburbs. The Globe has
also just finished a redesign, and has recently added new editorial
initiatives, including focused weekly business coverage of the
biotechnology industry _ a growing part of the economy of the same
western suburbs.

MILOSEVIC'S OPPONENTS, CLAIMING VICTORY AT POLLS, WILL PRESS HIM TO
LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct name of Radical Party leader in graf 16)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Serbia's democratic opposition thinks
that it has a president in Vojislav Kostunica. But it also has a
problem: how to get the incumbent, President Slobodan Milosevic,
out of power.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is more than technical. Milosevic shows no signs of
wanting to go.
</P>
<P>
   So Kostunica and the leaders of 18 parties that support him
decided Thursday night to call a rally for 2 p.m. Friday in
Belgrade's Square of the Republic, where they will ask the people
of Serbia to perform ``any act of civil disobedience they have at
their disposal'' until Milosevic leaves office, Zarko Korac, a
party leader, said after Kostunica and the opposition met Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Talking of rolling strikes, the closing of roads, cinemas,
theaters, shops and schools, Korac said: ``We know it's a high-risk
game, but we know we have no alternative. Through the rigging of
votes, Milosevic is clearly challenging us, and since we are being
pushed into the street, we must accept it. It is Milosevic who has
declared war. We'll start tomorrow and see how we end up and how
far we have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to some 3,000 people who had gathered spontaneously in
the square Thursday night, Zoran Djindjic and other opposition
party leaders said they would start at 2 p.m. and remain in the
square until Milosevic leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years, we have to show that we are ready to defend
our will and overthrow one regime,'' Djindjic said. Another party
official, Slobodan Orlic, said: ``See you tomorrow at 1400. He can
do nothing to us. He is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is hoping that his special police, which he has built
up and paid well at the expense of the army, will stand by him in
the face of what could be widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's Federal Election Commission, in an announcement
early Thursday morning, confirmed its preliminary results and
declared that Kostunica, while running 10 percentage points ahead
of Milosevic, had failed to win more than 50 percent of the votes
in Sunday's elections, meaning he and Milosevic would have to face
each other in a runoff on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica and the democratic opposition, backed by the United
States and the European Union, have cried fraud, and say that their
count shows clearly that he won more than 52 percent of the vote
and that there is no need for a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has ruled out a second round, saying that to
participate would be to accept electoral fraud and betray the votes
of the people. ``If we bargained, then we would acknowledge a lie
instead of the truth,'' he told a huge rally of more than 200,000
people in downtown Belgrade on Wednesday night. ``If we bargained,
we would admit that one man's will is greater than the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to boycott has given Milosevic an opportunity.
On Thursday, he met the main officials of his Socialist Party and
those of his allies, and announced that he would run in a second
round _ displaying himself on television for the first time since
Sunday's vote. And if Kostunica does not run, Milosevic may win by
default _ unless the opposition can force him to recognize his
defeat in the meantime, through legal efforts in dubious courts or
through popular pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is clearly buying time. He is hoping to hold his
party, his coalition and his security forces together, while
dividing the opposition _ and the outside world _ with the idea
that a second round is hardly undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   But Kostunica and other opposition leaders believe that a second
round would be a trap, and that Milosevic would have more time to
prepare an enormous vote fraud or to find a pretext to cancel or
annul a second round, and thus remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not going to recognize the true results from the first
round and leave office, why should he recognize the results from
round two?'' an opposition leader asked.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked in an interview on Wednesday whether he saw risks in his
boycott strategy and might allow Milosevic to remain in power,
Kostunica shrugged. ``I won't exclude that risk,'' he said. ``But
risk is all round us. Living in a country with Slobodan Milosevic
is risky. But he is buying time, and this is something that cannot
last long. People know I won these elections, and why should I
betray them?''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica found moral support Thursday from the Serbian Orthodox
Church, which recognized his election victory and addressed him as
``president elect.'' And the leader of the Radical Party, Vojislav
Seselj, until recently a Milosevic ally, also congratulated
Kostunica on his election, called for a reshuffle of the Serbian
government and the firing of Milosevic's powerful interior
minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, the anti-Milosevic prime minister, Filip
Vujanovic, also recognized Kostunica as president.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leaders of the 18 parties met twice Thursday to
discuss strategy, with some leaders more radical than others. They
decided on following two tracks: first, a legal track, which
Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, insists upon, challenging the
findings of the Federal Election Commission in the courts. The
second track is people power _ popular pressure through a mixture
of rallies, strikes and other demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing except random gatherings Thursday, with a few
thousand people gathering in Belgrade and more substantial
spontaneous rallies in Novi Sad and Cacak. In Gornji Milanovac,
high school students went on strike, saying they would not return
to school until Milosevic left office. In Krusevac, which was a
Socialist town, the local television and radio started showing news
from independent Radio B2-92 and Radio Free Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are angry, but our dilemma is how to organize their
protests without burning people out,'' Korac said. He said leaders
were discussing a mix of protests, rallies, strikes and
encouragements to those allied to Milosevic to abandon a sinking
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has been reluctant to provide an early provocation to
the police, but he says he believes that in the end the police and
the army will not act against the will of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A general strike in Serbia, suggested early this morning by
Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party, is problematic, given
the poverty of people and the high level of unemployment anyway.
But the opposition is discussing general strikes in one city at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its case before the courts and world opinion, the
opposition says it has clear evidence of fraud, including the
sudden disappearance from the rolls of 600,000 voters, the
inclusion of invalid ballots to lower Kostunica's percentages and
the counting of ballots from polling stations in Kosovo that
apparently never opened.
</P>
<P>
   To the opposition's outrage Thursday night, the election
commission declared that its work for the first round was done,
refused to hear opposition complaints and, in a final statement,
took away four seats from the opposition's totals in the lower
house of the federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition efforts to get large numbers of the permanent
government-appointed commissioners to resign apparently failed,
although there were reports that Bojan Pudar, the commission's vice
president, had quit.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said they thought that Milosevic would not
succeed in holding on to power and that his government was already
crumbling. But experts here noted that Milosevic appeared to
encounter no dissent at the meeting of his party's main board or a
second meeting of the leaders of his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, Milosevic can keep power only by killing Serbs,''
a diplomat said. ``But the police and the army know that people
voted for Kostunica, and many of them voted for him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Thursday urged Milosevic to honor the
results of the election. ``The people of Yugoslavia have spoken
loud and clear in support of democratic change,'' Clinton said in
Washington. ``It is time for Milosevic to heed the call of the Serb
people, step down, and allow a peaceful democratic transition to
take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the European Union, with France in its
revolving presidency, are pressing Russian President Vladimir Putin
to help make Milosevic yield. French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine was in Moscow on Thursday, and there were reports that the
Milosevic government sent copies of its electoral material to
Moscow _ where Milosevic's brother, Borislav, is the Yugoslav
ambassador _ to try to convince Putin that a second round is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians will evaluate the evidence, and the opposition
has the better evidence,'' a Western official said. ``No one has a
veto over the fact that change will come. There is an opportunity
for the Russians to help this along more quickly and easily and
leave fewer scars in Serbia, to be a player and help other Slavic
peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Moscow
``stands firmly for the peoples of Yugoslavia to have full freedom
to express their will without internal or external pressure'' and
urged other nations ``not to allow destabilization of the
situation.''

   LIEBERMAN CONTINUES CRITICISM
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman on Thursday accused Republicans of
deceiving voters about the Democratic plan to pay for prescription
drugs, the second time this week he has called them dishonest.
``What Bush and Cheney are saying about our Medicare plan is
downright deceptive,'' Lieberman said, joined by other Democratic
lawmakers on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he said Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had
repeatedly made promises that were contradicted by ``their records
and the details of their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has proposed adding a prescription drug
benefit to Medicare. Bush has derided the plan as forcing older
people into a government-run health maintenance organization and
has proposed a more limited program.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control Inc. will begin broadcasting television
commercials this weekend that feature the actor Martin Sheen
criticizing Gov. George W. Bush's record on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-second commercial, Sheen, who portrays the president
on the television series ``The West Wing,'' sits in front of an
American flag and says: ``Should the next president be the
candidate of the gun lobby? Should he have signed a bill that
allows hidden handguns in churches, hospitals and amusement parks?
Should he be someone of whom the NRA has said, that if he is
elected, they'll be working right out of the Oval Office? That's
Governor Bush's record.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Handgun Control sought Sheen is that his brother
Joseph Estevez did the voice-over for a commercial opposing gun
control produced by a gun industry group, said Joseph Sudbay, the
group's political director. Sudbay said Handgun Control has bought
more than $300,000 in time on stations in Cleveland, Milwaukee and
St. Louis. The commercials have been timed to coincide with the
season premier of ``The West Wing.'' Last season's finale featured
an assassination attempt on Sheen's character.  &QL;

<P>
   THE TRAVEL LOG

and hacking away at their opponents' credibility.

WOMEN BALANCE EASY MONEY VS. RISK IN JAPAN'S CULTURE OF PAID
COMPANIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Although she's only 22, Veronica Solano thinks that she
has got the world pretty much figured out.
</P>
<P>
   With easy self-assurance each night she deploys a dazzling smile
and a form to entice men to spend hundreds of dollars to enjoy her
company at the Flamingo Bar, a dark and smoky nightclub where she
works. And by all accounts, since arriving in Japan from her native
Costa Rica four years ago, she has been a smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   By now, this four-year veteran of Japan's hostess club scene
says she is scarcely troubled by the stereotype that the Japanese
businessmen flock to this bar and dozens of others like it in
Roppongi, one of Tokyo's largest entertainment districts, because
of their abiding fantasy about sex with a Western woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask for sex all the time, but that happens wherever I go
outside, too,'' said Solano, who said that regular visitors to the
Flamingo Bar have plied her with countless gifts, from luxury
handbags to expensive jewelry in pursuit of their quest. ``It's
just a game, and as long as you know how to play it right, there's
no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking has long held sway among the would-be models,
aspiring dancers and other footloose adventurers who have flocked
here in wave after wave since Japan's sharp economic rise in the
1970s in response to promises by recruiters or simple word-of-mouth
about the easy money to be made in the hostess business.
</P>
<P>
   But the hostess clubs have been under a harsh spotlight since
the sudden disappearance in early July of Lucie Blackman, a blonde,
22-year-old former British Airways flight attendant who came here
to live the hostess life _ a burgeoning class who often end up
flirting with prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, Blackman's case has absorbed the attention of
the British press, whose reporters have flocked here en masse to
write luridly about a business that employs hundreds of thousands
of women in Japan. The majority are Japanese. But there are also
tens of thousands of Asians who have been smuggled into the country
as virtual slaves, according to international human rights groups,
and perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Blackman's case garnered so much attention in England
that the British prime minister, Tony Blair, inquired about the
investigation into her disappearance with his Japanese counterpart,
Yoshiro Mori, during a recent visit here.
</P>
<P>
   And in early September, Britain's lord chancellor, Lord Irvine,
met with Japanese police officials here to encourage them to
continue investigating a case in which there have been plenty of
rumors _ of abduction by a cult, rape and murder taped for a
``snuff'' film, or more prosaically, death in a dispute over sex _
but few true leads.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, who waited several days from the time of
Blackman's reported disappearance before they made inquiries at
Casanova, the club where she worked, have provided little
information about the case in recent weeks, insisting defensively,
as one spokesman said, ``this could happen in any country.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Blackman's case highlights what some experts _ and many
of the hostesses themselves _ say is a feature that sets Japanese
society apart from much of the West: for Japan's freewheeling
males, paying women for sex and other entertainment is as common as
dropping coins in a pachinko parlor, and carries just about as much
stigma _ which is to say virtually none.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese say this is a result of a complex cultural
history, and is reinforced by the crowding and sprawl of Tokyo. For
centuries, while Japan was under feudal rule, regional warlords
were required by the shogun to have their families reside in the
capital, while the lords themselves traveled back and forth to
their domains on lengthy pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   With lords separated from their spouses for long stretches, a
culture of geisha and concubines flourished, and along with it, so
did the idea that paying for sex and the company of women was
normal. In modern Tokyo, with tiny houses and long commutes being
the norm, receiving guests at home is impractical, and men instead
stay out on the town, typically with their co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hostess bars, and sex-oriented massage parlors, known as
``soaplands,'' have proliferated to entertain them. Indeed, where
hostess bars at least are concerned, many Japanese companies pay
the bill for their male employees' nights on the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where there is no couple culture, where male
and female enjoy themselves together,'' said Yumiko Ehara, a
professor of sociology at Tokyo Municipal University.
</P>
<P>
   ``While mother and children wait at home patiently, the men are
allowed to enjoy themselves alone,'' she said. ``Many housewives
are frustrated about this. But the husbands would not tell their
wives about going to soaplands, and in the case of hostess bars,
this is a company matter, and women don't feel that they can
interfere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehara said that according to one recent academic survey, more
than 50 percent of the male respondents acknowledged having paid
for sex.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With his slicked-back hair and open collar, Shinichi Watanabe,
the president of the Flamingo Bar, and a clutch of related
entertainment businesses, offered a simpler explanation with just a
touch of hyperbole. As a dancer did a striptease in the background
on a stage ringed with men dressed with neckties, he said: ``Every
Japanese man would go if he had the money. You get to sit next to a
beautiful woman and get entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, as Watanabe's club began filling up
with customers, Linda, a tall 24-year-old blonde from Norway,
laughingly described her job as one of the world's easiest. Then,
when the name of Lucie Blackman came up _ she said they had worked
together _ Linda paused to consider the constant propositions and
her ritualized evasions, and the wearying, ever-present, if minute,
feeling of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is like theater, it's a game, and to convince the
customer to keep coming back you've just got to maintain an act,''
she said. ``But some clubs get very pushy. They tell you to sit
closer and closer to the men. They tell you to let them touch you a
bit. Then there's a lot of pressure to date the customers.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``That's the kind of place I worked at with
Lucie. And if you think too much about money, you begin going out
with customers you've only met once. You begin taking big risks.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MAD DOG IS STILL TOP DOG
</HEADLINE>
   (Sports of the Times) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is called Mad Dog the way bald guys are called
Curly, or penny-pinchers are called Big Spenders. It is the flip
side of what is. If he were, in fact, a canine, he might be the
ultimate thinking man's pooch, a bloodhound, say, or one of those
Labrador retrievers who remarkably leads the cops to the packet
where the coke is stashed.
</P>
<P>
   If there has ever been a cooler, craftier, better-controlled
pitcher mentally, physically and even facially than Greg ``Mad
Dog'' Maddux, it had to be Sidd Finch, or at least Christy
Mathewson. It's true that the surname Maddux lends an alliterative
lilt to the nickname, but it fits perfectly for its opposite
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Maddux went to the mound for Atlanta against the
Mets looking for his 20th victory against eight losses this season,
seeking to extend his scoreless inning streak that stood at 36 1/3
innings _ the equivalent of four games and a few tokens _ and in
conspicuous contention for the Cy Young Award, which would be his
fifth, a major league record.
</P>
<P>
   But after three perfect innings, Maddux ran into trouble in the
fourth when the Mets scored three times, primarily on two infield
hits and a single to right by Todd Pratt. It ended Maddux's
scoreless streak at 391/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   This was less than Maddux's most fortunate outing. He allowed
one solid hit in the game, the single by Pratt, while walking two
and striking out seven. But the Mets had a 4-1 lead by the time he
left after five innings, and wound up winning by 8-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I pitched good,'' said Maddux. ``I wanted to pitch
good enough to win, but I pitched good enough to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just personal gain Maddux was after, but a victory for
his team, too. While the Braves have won the National League East
title, they still haven't secured home-field advantage in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was facing a Mets team that was still in seventh heaven,
and perhaps with champagne lingering in its hair, after having
beaten the Braves the night before to clinch the wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   The bill of Mad Dog's cap always looks a little too long, and so
the inexpressive eyes in his small, college-sophomore-like face
appear to be viewing things from within a cave. He appears no more
imposing on the mound than some groundskeeper, no lanky rancor of
Randy Johnson, no lean nefariousness of Pedro Martinez, none of the
portly desperado of David Wells. Mad Dog stands 6 feet tall, weighs
185 pounds and doesn't throw as hard as any of the other top
pitchers in the game. His breaking balls aren't eye-popping. His
weapons, however, are the equivalent of an artist's palette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the pitching coach with the Braves for eight
years,'' said Leo Mazzone, ``and I'm still in awe of Mad Dog. When
he's going well, as he has recently, he can hit the target about 97
percent of the time. He does it with various speeds on his
fastballs, and his breaking balls go in on both right-handed and
left-handed hitters, and away from them. Most pitchers can do one
or the other. And his changeup is virtually pin-point perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone also remembers a time when Maddux threw close to Eddie
Murray, who made noises that Maddux was trying to hit him. The
Braves' catcher, Charlie O'Brien, said to Murray: ``Eddie, relax.
Mad Dog's control is so good that if he wanted to hit you, he'd hit
you right between the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, at age 34 and in his 15th big league season, had a rocky
start, for him, this season. Yet in his eight losses, he has given
up a paltry 13 runs. He had a 2.91 earned run average, just shy of
his 2.82 mark coming into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is on the corners, or two inches off,'' said Jay
Payton, the Mets' center fielder. ``He never gives you a cookie,
one right down the middle. And every time you think you've
outguessed him, you gotta guess again.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, went to the
mound and suggested to Maddux that he walk the next hitter. Maddux
told him, no, he'd get the batter to pop to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby came back to the bench,'' Mazzone recalled, ``and the
batter popped to third. Bobby said, `Well, I'll be.' I asked him
what it was. And he said, `Mad Dog told me exactly what he was
going to make the guy do _ and he did it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was asked about this Wednesday. ``I don't remember it,''
he said with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't remember it?'' came the response. ``You who makes a
study of every pitch to every batter in every inning?'' ``Well,
it's pitching,'' Maddux replied. ``Hitters read that stuff _ or
someone tells 'em about it. I don't want them knowing what I'm
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, even against the mighty Maddux, the Mets had
an inkling, and that turned out to be more than enough.

AS CARRIERS TIGHTEN BELTS, IT'S EQUIPMENT-MAKERS WHO'LL HURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Telecom-equipment stocks busted out of their
slump yesterday and rallied the overall market after a Sanford
Bernstein analyst issued a gloom-and-doom report on the sector.
</P>
<P>
   After falling for six straight sessions, the S&AMP;P communication
equipment index _ which includes Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies
and Nortel Networks _ jumped 4 percent yesterday, more than any
other S&AMP;P sector index.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst called it a classic case of ``sell on the rumor, buy
on the news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone heard about this Sanford Bernstein report (Wednesday)
morning'' and started selling telecom-equipment stocks, says Jeff
Wrona, manager of the PBHG Technology &AMP; Communications fund. When
Bernstein analyst Paul Sagawa finally discussed his report in a
conference call yesterday morning, ``they bought them right back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein is known for doing detailed research and is considered
less biased than other Wall Street firms because it doesn't manage
stock and bond deals for the companies it covers. But its analysts
generally don't have the same stature as those from the big
investment banks. And some critics scoffed at Sagawa's gloomy
predictions, saying telecom-service providers always underestimate
how much they'll spend on equipment in the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernstein report predicted a ``sharp decline'' in spending
on equipment for carrying voice and data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysis of 59 North American and European
telecommunications carriers leads us to conclude that actual
spending on telecom equipment is likely to show a sharp
deceleration from more than 28 percent growth in 2000 to less than
20 percent growth in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that total capital expenditures _ including
non-equipment outlays such as labor _ will fall 3 percent next year
after rising 31 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even spending on optical and data networking equipment, which
grew an astounding 65 percent this year, will grow only 39 percent
next year, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Given that he expects industry sales to grow less than 20
percent next year, Sagawa can't see how earnings could possibly
meet a consensus growth rate of 29 percent next year. ``In
particular, we are concerned that companies trading at more than 50
times forward earnings will face considerable pressure,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Sagawa, as expected, downgraded Cisco and Nortel to ``market
perform.'' But Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney reiterated
their buy ratings on both stocks. Cisco rose $2.13 to $59.88, while
Nortel jumped $2.13 to $61.75.
</P>
<P>
   Sagawa is hardly the first analyst to forecast a slowdown, but
he is more bearish than most.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in telecom equipment providers _ like Cisco, Nortel and
Lucent _ have been slumping for at least a month, ever since it
became clear that many of their customers were in a heap of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom service providers _ ranging from biggies like AT&AMP;T,
Sprint and WorldCom to smaller local-service providers dubbed CLECs
(competitive local exchange carriers) _ have been suffering from
overcapacity, falling prices, financing difficulties and, in some
cases, management problems.
</P>
<P>
   Two CLECs _ GST Telecommunications an ICG Communications _ have
become insolvent and more are headed that way. Some of these
companies are financed by telecom-equipment providers, who stand to
lose an investment as well as a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Sagawa admits that telecom carriers spent way more than they
thought they would on equipment this year, which is one reason for
their current predicament.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't see how they can keep spending at current rates,
given that stock prices for every category of carrier are down
after three years of superior returns, free cash flows have turned
sharply negative and bond yields are up (which makes debt financing
more costly).
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting spending to continue at current rates, but
some are more bullish than Sagawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens every year at this time. People get concerned
about capital spending on telecom equipment by the carriers,'' says
Robb Parlanti, co-manager of the Turner Technology fund. ``Service
providers don't want to say, `We're going to spend this much
money,' because that generally hits their stock.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, U.S. carriers projected a 7 percent to 10 percent
increase in spending and ended up spending 36 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   Sagawa says he took that into account when preparing his
projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our survey projects (total spending) to decline 9 percent in
the U.S. and 3 percent worldwide. If we assume the degree of
underestimation is the same (as last year), it equates to 18 to 21
percent growth in the U.S. and 17 to 20 percent worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Parlanti says the market has already discounted a moderate
slowdown in capital spending. ``I'll also say that I think that
Wall Street has a habit of taking things to extreme, on the upside
and the downside.''
</P>
<P>
   He is generally bullish on telecom-equipment stocks but says
they could post further losses in the next 30 days. Many mutual
funds have fiscal years ending in October and they will try to
minimize taxable distributions by selling losers to offset realized
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next month we'll see the bottom for some of these
stocks. We'll be keeping an eye on Nortel, Corning, Cisco,''
Parlanti says.
</P>
<P>
   He says companies such as Lucent that are focused on older
technologies will fare the worst, because carriers will spend the
most money on newer technologies, primarily fiber optics.
</P>
<P>
   But he also says some of the smaller optics companies that have
one or two products could also get whipsawed. ``There's no doubt in
my mind that this group is still going to be volatile over the next
month or so,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Wrona, of PBHG, says he doesn't think anyone knows how much
telecom carriers will spend next year. And in a way, it doesn't
really matter, he adds. What does matter is the company's specific
products and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being much more selective in which telecom equipment
companies I own,'' Wrona says. ``The wind is not at the back of a
lot of subsectors of the tech world. You really have to pick and
choose more than you did two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrona says he was buying Ciena and Redback Networks yesterday
and is looking at a couple of upcoming IPOs, including San Jose's
Oplink Communications. ``All of my exposure is in the optics/next
generation area,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sth  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; IPO UPDATE: Oplink is getting a lot of buzz in the IPO world, but
it'll face plenty of competition if it goes public next week as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Ten companies went public this week and as many as 13 more could
premiere today. ``Underwriters were pushing to get out as many IPOs
as they could before the end of the quarter,'' says Dan McCarthy,
an analyst with IPO.com. The reason: to pump up their third-quarter
underwriting volumes.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine deals were priced last night, which means they'll
begin trading today, and four more were expected to price but could
be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest deal to price last night was Head, the Dutch maker
of tennis racquets and skis. The company priced its IPO at $10 per
share, the bottom of its $10-to-$12 range, but it still managed to
raise $208.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   This week's biggest winner, ironically, was CoSine
Communications, a Redwood City telecom-equipment-maker. It was
priced at $23 per share on Monday and closed Tuesday at $63.06. It
dipped slightly to $58.13 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters will be looking to see how well the market absorbs
today's new issues. ``Underwriters saw this as a big test week,''
says McCarthy. Depending on what happens today, he says, ``I think
they'll adjust their calendars accordingly.''

`FAITHLESS': IN AN OLD MAN'S REVERIES, THE PAST LIVES ON AS PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an unsettling thought: The hardest lessons we learn in
life (and maybe the only lessons we truly absorb) are those learned
too late. It is precisely this sense of nagging regret and the
compulsion to comb obsessively through decisions that can't be
undone that haunts the characters in Liv Ullmann's morose and
profound film, ``Faithless.''
</P>
<P>
   For in looking back, there is usually a point at which past
events lose their fluidity. That lingering question of what-if?
evaporates, and the past becomes frozen, at once accessible and out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed by the actress and director (it's her fourth full-length
feature) from a late screenplay by Ingmar Bergman, this attenuated
two-and-a-half-hour reflection on marriage, adultery, parenthood
and the casualties of sexual warfare unfolds like a brooding
autobiographical epilogue to Bergman's much stormier 1974
masterpiece, ``Scenes From a Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   In its tone, style and message, ``Faithless'' is an old man's
movie, paced at a measured hobble, its metaphysical gaze turned as
much toward the sea and the sky as toward the houses on the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Ullmann, a colleague and collaborator of Bergman's for decades,
has absorbed his sensibility and style so thoroughly that
``Faithless'' is more than just a reverent homage to the master. It
feels almost like the product of artificial respiration, as if
Ullmann (who starred in Bergman's ``Persona'' and ``Scenes From a
Marriage'') and Bergman were breathing life into each other in
long, sad exhalations.
</P>
<P>
   As in earlier Bergman films, the great Swedish actor Erland
Josephson is a stand-in for the director. This time around, his
character is a frail, aging film and theater director actually
named Bergman who, while rattling around his office, conjures up
the ghost of Marianne (Lena Endre), an actress he once loved who
has since died and become his muse.
</P>
<P>
   When she appears, he coaxes her into delivering a blow-by-blow
account of her love affair with her husband's best friend, David
(Krister Henriksson), a director who turns out to be the old man's
younger mid-40s self. As she tells the story, most of the events
she recalls are remembered in extended flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing orderly or predictable about the drama in which
Marianne is the prime mover and David, although the initiator of
the affair, the follower. Her husband, Markus (Thomas Hanzon), a
world-famous conductor, and their young daughter Isabelle (Michelle
Gylemo) flit in and out as supporting players who are horribly
damaged by the affair.
</P>
<P>
   As the story unfolds, you expect it to fade out, but it takes
several surprising turns as hidden facts come to light.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most tales of adultery, ``Faithless'' is an emotional
mystery story that never solves (or even tries to solve) an
essential puzzle. Why would a happily married woman jeopardize a
successful marriage by having an affair with her husband's poorer,
less attractive and admittedly unhappy best friend? For David, to
put it bluntly, is no catch. As he warns at the outset of their
affair, he is self-loathing, joyless and pathologically jealous. In
one of the film's ugliest scenes, he coaxes Marianne into revealing
the details of her past sexual adventures, then explodes with
violent jealousy when she's finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faithless'' offers few if any psychological or sexual clues to
explain Marianne's faithlessness. She professes to have a great sex
life with Markus, yet she still gives in to David's casual
suggestion that they sleep together. Is it just curiosity?
Altruism? When Marianne has an opportunity to end this rocky affair
before the roof falls in, she chooses not to. The movie suggests
that major life decisions that can have the most earthshaking,
tragic consequences may ultimately come down to whims.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is deepened by the film's extraordinary central
performances. With his alarmed watery eyes gazing beseechingly into
the void, Josephson's Bergman is an unforgettable portrait of the
artist as an old man at once tormented by his past and unable to
resist raking over its coals. If he has acquired a certain wisdom
and humility late in life, they have arrived too late to do him any
good, which only adds salt to his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The only word to describe David, Bergman's self-portrait of his
younger self, is unsparing. In every shot, Henriksson palpably
registers David's inner suffering, as if beneath a surface
joviality he were wincing through his life. Most complicated of all
is Endre's Marianne, a woman who usually knows exactly what she's
feeling but who has no understanding of the forces determining her
behavior. She has the paradoxical quality of having a conscience
but hardly any capacity for self-examination. In the end, you begin
to wonder if this is Bergman's view of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ullmann has filled the movie with references to earlier Bergman
films, especially those in which she appeared. The mirror images of
characters confronting one another echo ``Persona,'' while the
couple's erupting domestic battles recall ``Scenes From a
Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The very solemnity of ``Faithless'' reminds us that the
institution of marriage isn't the awesome edifice it used to be,
that our expectations of coupling ``till death do us part'' aren't
as absolute and fearsome as they were in the 1950s and '60s when
Bergman was at his creative peak. As excruciatingly painful as it
is, sexual betrayal in marriage nowadays is less likely to be the
life-or-death, kill-or-be-killed emotional battle that it is for
these characters. The dam of all-powerful monogamy and the
commitments it entails has been seriously breached.

A LONG DAY'S NIGHT INTO NBC NOWHERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no wonder Olympic athletes these days are older and older.
The younger ones aren't awake to become inspired any more. Unless
they have insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila just won the first women's Olympic pole vault
competition, smiled into NBC's camera and called it ``a dream come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' she continued, ``all you girls who want to pole vault,
go for it!''
</P>
<P>
   This was shown at 10:30 p.m. Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, just before Marion Jones ran the 100-meter
sprint to what would be her first gold medal, NBC ran (another) on
Jones, in which she talked in glowing terms about how as a little
girl she watched the 1984 Games from Los Angeles. She saw how
emotional Florence Griffith Joyner and Carl Lewis were after
winning their gold medals. It inspired her.
</P>
<P>
   Then NBC showed Jones' race. At 11:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:45 p.m., it showed Maurice Greene's 100-meter victory.
</P>
<P>
   Every night of the gymnastics events during the first week
didn't air until well past 9:30 p.m. even though, in Sydney time
when they were originally held, they didn't come close to 11 p.m.
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson's 400-meter gold-medal run _ try 11:15 p.m.
Monday on NBC. He ran it at about 8:20 p.m. Sydney time.
</P>
<P>
   And the gold-medal ceremony for the U.S. baseball team after it
defeated Cuba? NBC aired it Wednesday night at about midnight,
after showing a brief highlight package of it at about 10:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to show something delayed. And, as we grind our
teeth each night, we try to understand NBC's restraints with this
unusual time difference. But it has tried our patience once too
many times.
</P>
<P>
   We're cranky. And we're not watching any more.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern for NBC to delay coverage of the bigger events
more, hoping to keep the audience awake just another hour of
ratings time, was simply rude. What happened to the family hour?
That's what NBC bigwig Dick Ebersol said was the reason the
Olympics worked like magic in prime time. They brought families
together.
</P>
<P>
   My two kids, aged 13 and 9, were fast asleep by the time all
those things took place above. Something about having to go to
school the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks again, NBC, for shattering the dreams of the Olympic
experience while the kids are dreaming of something else.
</P>
<P>
   __ Watson's journey: He flew 13 hours and 9,000 miles from
Sydney to Los Angeles on Wednesday to get home in time to do a high
school football game Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Because that's Jim Watson's gig and he genuinely wanted to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   After working all of NBC's beach volleyball coverage with Mike
Dodd, including the gold-medal match that aired on the network
Tuesday night in prime time, Watson's next assignment was to beat
it back home for Thursday night's Long Beach Poly-Fontana game,
which aired on Fox Sports Net 2.
</P>
<P>
   And how's that? It aired live.
</P>
<P>
   ``How ironic is that?'' said Watson on Thursday morning as he
tried to regain his bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Watson had done play-by-play for every FSN2 high school telecast
since its inception four seasons ago before he missed the last
three weeks because of the Olympics assignment, which he described
as ``an awesome experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Bill Macdonald was NBC's first pick for the beach
coverage, but he declined because of family matters. Macdonald
recommended Watson, who was eventually hired just three months
prior to the Games. Macdonald then covered for Watson on the high
school telecasts, including last week's Hart-Westlake game.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Olympic beach was closed, Watson had no second thoughts
about getting back as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox really went out of it way to let me go to Sydney,'' said
Watson, ``and high school football is the real reason I was hired
by them. I consider it my beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally after a trip I get a day or two to mellow out, but
I'm stepping over suitcases trying to get more information on
Fontana's offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson got off one of the better closing lines for an event.
</P>
<P>
   After the clinching point in the gold-medal match, he said on
Tuesday night's broadcast: ``Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana had
no business being on center court in the Olympic beach volleyball
tournament, and now they own it.'' &QL;

PAUL ALLEN LEAVING MICROSOFT BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After increasingly distancing himself from the company
he helped create 25 years ago, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen will
step down from the company's board of directors next month.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a Mercer Island resident worth an estimated $36 billion,
will become a senior strategy adviser to Microsoft, the company
said in a proxy statement filed after the close of business
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 47, declined to comment on why he is resigning his post.
In a prepared statement, he wrote, ``Being an active board member
for a dynamic and successful company such as Microsoft is a
time-consuming role and one I have enjoyed for many years. This new
role will enable me to spend my time on technology and products
where I can really make a significant contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's spokeswoman, Susan Pearson Brown, said Allen is not
leaving for health reasons. After founding Microsoft with Chairman
Bill Gates in 1975, Allen left in 1983 in the midst of a battle
with Hodgkin's disease.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the biggest individual seller of Microsoft shares
this year, unloading shares worth more than $6 billion, according
to the Washington Service, which tracks insider stock sales.
</P>
<P>
   Most onlookers speculated he is departing to focus more closely
on his own extensive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been pretty involved in his own investments over the past
few years, so I don't know how involved he's been in Microsoft's
board anyhow,'' said Jonathan Geurkink, an analyst with Ragen
MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's Vulcan Ventures investment arm has a hand in some 140
technology, telecommunications and entertainment companies,
including Egghead Inc., Asymetrix Corp., Starwave Corp. and Virtual
Vision Inc. Allen owns the Seattle Seahawks football team and
Portland Trail Blazers basketball team, and in June opened a $240
million shrine to American music, the Experience Music Project, in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The world's third richest man, Allen currently serves on the
boards of Charter Communications, USA Networks, pop.com, and
DreamWorks SKG.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Allen's reasons, his departure creates the impression
of a company in transition, if not in trouble, one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft was the 8,000 pound gorilla with the super growth
trajectory, and now the near-term perception will be that
everything isn't quite tight at Microsoft,'' said Gene Munster, an
analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows a huge drop in Microsoft's stock price, the
departure of key old-guard executives, and multiple antitrust
lawsuits. The stock closed up 69 cents at $61.31 Thursday, and
declined 81 cents in afterhours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has dropped 47 percent this year, making it the
second-worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Chief
financial officer Greg Maffei, chief technology officer Nathan
Myhrvold, Windows chief Brad Silverberg, and MSN maven Pete Higgins
all left the company within the past year. Just two weeks ago,
14-year veteran Paul Maritz retired.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year-old federal antitrust suit, along with scores of
private antitrust class actions, continues to dog the company. But
Microsoft did win a victory earlier this week when the Supreme
Court declined to hear its antitrust appeal before lower court
review, sending the appeal to a court where Microsoft has prevailed
twice before on related matters.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said in a prepared release, ``Paul and I have an amazing
friendship that extends back 30 years. I will continue to value his
friendship and counsel in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Gates and Allen together bluffed a tiny Albuquerque
computer company, Model Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, into
thinking they had created a version of the BASIC language for that
company's 8080-based Altair computer. They then worked day and
night for 8 weeks in a Harvard University computer lab to actually
write it, according to ``Hard Drive,'' a history of Microsoft by
James Wallace and Jim Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed, the company's president offered to make Allen
software director, a position he accepted. He left to work full
time with Gates in November 1977, with a 36 percent share in the
company then called Micro-Soft.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hackborn, a former executive vice president of
Hewlett-Packard, also will leave the board.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said Hackborn will leave his seat to spend more time
on personal and philanthropic pursuits. He stepped down as chairman
of the board of Hewlett-Packard last week but will remain on that
board. He retired from Hewlett-Packard in 1993 as the executive
vice president of the Computer Products Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The departures reduce Microsoft's board to six people. Allen and
Hackborn will not be replaced, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining board members are David Marquardt, a founding
general partner of August Capital in Menlo Park, Calif.; Ann
McLaughlin, a director of and adviser to numerous educational and
not-for-profit organizations; and William Reed, a Medina resident
who is also a director of PACCAR, Inc., SAFECO Corp., the Seattle
Times Co. and Washington Mutual Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the board are Jon Shirley, another Medina resident who
served as Microsoft's president and chief operating officer from
1983 to 1990; chief executive Steve Ballmer; and Gates.

   When Vice President Al Gore chose Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his
running mate, even many Jews wondered how an Orthodox Jew would
reconcile his religious obligations with the demands of the job he
was seeking. As vice president, would Lieberman take an official
phone call on the Sabbath? Would he fly to Washington for a
tie-breaking vote in the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman explained in response that Talmudic scholars had
advised him that certain work by public servants on the Sabbath was
permissible. But such rulings tell a fascinating story, suggesting
that Lieberman's candidacy, already hailed as a historic event in
the history of American Jewry, could also serve as an important
moment in Jewish religious law. That history is worth thinking
about in this season of the Jewish New Year, beginning Friday
night, and in an era of internal divisions for Jews in the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbath observance is broadly respected among Jews, not simply
the Orthodox. The blanket biblical prohibition against working on
the Sabbath has always allowed certain exceptions _ for example,
when a life is at stake. Still another exception applied
historically to a personage known as the shtadlan, the name for the
Jewish representative in old European courts _ the court Jew.
Because the shtadlan pleaded for the safety of Jews, his working on
the Sabbath was deemed necessary, just as the Talmudic doctrine
known as pikuah nefesh commands a doctor to work to save a life.
</P>
<P>
   But of course Lieberman is not a ``court Jew'' representing the
interests of Jews _ a concept that became abused and discredited
anyway. He is an observant Jew serving a largely secular and
non-Jewish constituency, something that official Jewish law has
dealt with only informally. Rabbi Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva
University, the leading Orthodox seminary in the United States,
said that the ``court Jew'' precedent was irrelevant but that a
Jewish requirement to respect what is known as tsorkhei rabbim _
the needs of the larger community _ could apply to Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does not take a call from ((Russia's president,
Vladimir)) Putin on Shabbas ((the Sabbath)), he may be jeopardizing
an American interest,'' said Lamm. But he added that if elected,
Lieberman ``will have to decide these things ad hoc, but under
general guidelines of Jewish law.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fine distinctions are central to Jewish law, life and
identity. It will be interesting to see if rabbis and scholars
agree that a larger ``American interest'' should become a factor in
their interpretations of acceptable Sabbath work in the future, or
whether some rabbis will insist on a more strict interpretation.
Eventually, Lieberman's conduct could lead to a significant
evolution in Jewish law and history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use this as a barometer of how far the Jewish
community has come,'' said Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the
Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, which serves the
Conservative branch of Judaism. ``When Jews lived on the margin,
they needed an advocate or defender. Now I would argue that the
alleviation from Sabbath laws given to the shtadlan should be
transferred to Jews who have moved into the public arena to serve
the common good.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman leads the way on these questions, he may not want
to talk about it. Recently he stirred up a furor by saying on the
Don Imus radio program that there was ``no ban whatsoever'' on
intermarriage. Many leading Jews criticized him _ don't try to be a
rabbi, they said _ and Lieberman now acknowledges that he made a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's personal attitude was clear when Imus asked him
about the traditional prayer of many Orthodox Jews thanking God
that they are not women. ``There is a prayer like that,'' he
replied. ``For a long time, I've skipped that one. There's a
certain amount of latitude here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Jewish community as divided as it is between observant
and non-observant Jews _ and between ``modern Orthodox'' Jews like
Lieberman and more insular Orthodox Jews known as the Haredim _
such comments will probably continue to create a commotion.
Strictly speaking, Orthodox Jews are uncomfortable with the idea of
change in Jewish law, though Lieberman may be given dispensations
by some rabbis for some acts in his official capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish law itself cannot be changed until a universally
recognized authority actually rules, citing reams of precedent and
logical conclusions. Since late antiquity no such person or body
has existed, and as a result, even among the Orthodox, what is
permitted will inevitably be a matter of conflicting opinions among
learned specialists. But it is not unreasonable to think that the
reality reflected by Lieberman's situation may eventually find its
way into the pages of Jewish legal writings.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Irving Greenberg, president of the Jewish Life Network, an
educational foundation, and a friend and spiritual counselor of
Lieberman, said Jewish law needed to take account of the full
integration of Jews in American life. ``When the arbiters of Jewish
law take responsibility for the revolutionary transformation of the
Jewish condition,'' he said, ``then Jewish law will be able to
guide those Jews who must take responsibility for the larger
society.''

EDITORIAL: MILOSEVIC'S TRICKERY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic's resounding defeat in Yugoslavia's
presidential elections is being celebrated by large and joyous
crowds around the country. Thursday, Serbia's Orthodox Church
joined most of Yugoslavia's political parties, President Clinton
and leaders across Europe in recognizing the election of the
opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, Milosevic himself does not yet seem to have gotten
the message. His allies in the government-controlled election
commission have brazenly shaved just enough votes off Kostunica's
winning margin to call for a runoff vote next month. That insults
democracy and invites political turmoil. The international
community, including Russia, must firmly insist that Milosevic step
aside now.
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable vote count comes from opposition poll watchers
who observed the official ballot tabulation at almost every voting
place in Yugoslavia. Adding up the local tally sheets, each signed
by observers from all major parties, shows Kostunica with a clear
majority of 52.54 percent, enough to avoid a runoff, with only
35.01 percent going to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition count has been endorsed by Washington and leading
European governments. Similar results have been announced by
Yugoslavia's leading independent vote monitoring group and even by
some parties previously allied with Milosevic. But early Thursday
morning the election commission announced a total of 48.96 percent
for Kostunica and 38.62 for Milosevic. Producing those figures
required disqualifying several hundred thousand voters and
dispensing with the legal requirement of reconciling the
commission's numbers with the tally sheet totals compiled by the
opposition. If these cooked numbers are allowed to stand, neither
candidate would have the 50 percent needed for a first-round
victory, forcing an Oct. 8 runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has rightly refused to accept this latest
attempted manipulation by the Milosevic camp. New balloting would
give the beleaguered dictator time to regroup and once more try to
steal victory through systematic vote-rigging and violent
repression. Instead Kostunica has summoned his supporters to the
streets to defend his victory, and plans to call for civil
disobedience. Hundreds of thousands of Yugoslavs have already
rallied in Belgrade and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is understandably desperate to cling to power. Out of
office, he might find it harder to avoid eventual trial before an
international war crimes tribunal for his treatment of Kosovo's
Albanians. But he should not be allowed to take Yugoslavia down
with him. An attempt to prolong his rule by further electoral fraud
could produce unrest, even violence, making it difficult for
Yugoslavia to end its economic and political isolation from the
rest of Europe. Russia, which has traditionally seen itself as the
protector of Yugoslavia's people, has thus far stood apart from
European demands for Milosevic's immediate departure. Moscow should
now make clear to him that the Yugoslav people have voted him out
of power and he must yield.

JUDGE DISMISSES PART OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S SUIT AGAINST TOBACCO
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge threw out part of the government's
suit against the tobacco industry on Thursday, narrowing the
avenues by which the Justice Department can seek billions of
dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Gladys Kessler of U.S. District Court, dismissed two
counts in the Justice Department suit, rejecting theories that the
government could use two statutes enacted 40 years ago to recover
money spent on smoking-related health care. Those statutes empower
the government to seek damages from outside parties it deems
responsible for medical expenses borne by the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kessler declined to throw out two other counts accusing the
industry of operating a ``racketeering enterprise'' and seeking
recovery of ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   Each side issued a statement saying it was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to proceeding to trial and holding the tobacco
companies accountable for the fraudulent conduct alleged in this
lawsuit,'' said David Ogden, the assistant attorney general who
heads the Justice Department's Civil Division.
</P>
<P>
   William Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel
for Philip Morris, one of the defendants in the suit, called
Thursday's ruling ``an important first step in the ultimate
dismissal of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   A government official who spoke on condition he not be named had
this perspective: ``Would we rather have had a one-line ruling
saying that the motion to dismiss is denied? Sure. But this is
still a big lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said as much in her ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the government's theories of liability have been
limited,'' she wrote, ``the extent of defendants' potential
liability remains, in the estimation of both parties, in the
billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The government suit was filed last September and sought to use
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Medical
Care Recovery Act and provisions of the Medicare Secondary Payer
statute to pry money from the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the government's efforts to use the last two, Kessler
concluded that Congress had not intended those laws to be used the
way the Justice Department sought to employ them.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Medical Care Recovery Act of 1962, she noted
``its total nonenforcement by the Department of Justice for 37 of
those 38 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In ruling that the RICO portion of the suit could proceed, the
judge held that the government had established a sufficient basis
for its claims, ``which is all it must do at this early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the first the government has filed against an entire
industry using the RICO statute. The statute was enacted 30 years
ago to fight organized crime, although federal prosecutors have
more recently used it against businesses and others it contends
have engaged in a pattern of illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues such a pattern going back to at least 1953
among the tobacco companies. It accuses them of promoting biased
research, wrongly asserting that nicotine was not addictive and
aiming their products at children.
</P>
<P>
   When the suit was filed last year, Attorney General Janet Reno
accused the companies of engaging in ``a campaign designed to
preserve their enormous profits whatever the cost in human lives,
human suffering and medical resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has accused the government of ``politically
correct extortion,'' as Greg Little, a Philip Morris lawyer
characterized it a year ago, and of bullying an entire industry in
a way it has treated no other legal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is separate from the cases that resulted in settlements
totaling about $246 billion that the tobacco industry reached with
various states in 1998 over smoking-related Medicaid costs for the
poor and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Philip Morris, the defendants are R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co.; the former American Tobacco Co.; the Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., a division of British American Tobacco
PLC; the Lorillard Tobacco Co.; the Liggett Group; the Council for
Tobacco Research USA Inc.; and the Tobacco Institute Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler rejected a request by the Liggett Group to exempt it
from the racketeering suit on grounds it broke with other tobacco
companies four years ago and settled with several states.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco groups expressed pleasure at Thursday's ruling. The
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said it hoped that Congress would
not succumb to pressure to cut off money to pay for the Justice
Department suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayers deserve their day in court to hold the tobacco
companies responsible for their illegal behavior,'' the
organization said.

METS BACKUPS BATTER MADDUX, JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets are not used to relaxing. Sometimes
they press, sometimes they focus, but not since the end of the 1997
season had the Mets been able to kick back and play ball for the
heck of it. Thursday night, the Mets played a game with absolutely
nothing on the line, and they had no trouble beating the best
pitcher of this generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets clinched the National League wild-card berth on
Wednesday, so four everyday players took Thursday night off. Two
other starters are out with minor injuries. A sell-out crowd of
52,134 at Shea Stadium paid to see the Mets' bench try to hit the
Atlanta Braves' Greg Maddux. They left the park happy for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   With Maddux trying to win his 20th game and build on a lengthy
scoreless innings streak, the Mets' reserves knocked him out after
five innings, en route to an 8-2 victory. Todd Pratt drove in three
runs, Darryl Hamilton had two hits, Timo Perez scored twice and
Kurt Abbott hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than enough support for the right-hander Bobby J.
Jones, who worked eight innings, allowing two runs (one earned) to
improve to 11-6. The strong effort could complicate the Mets'
decision about who will be their fourth starter in the division
series against St. Louis or San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets almost certainly will use four starters; if they do
not, two starters would have to pitch on short rest in a five-game
series. General Manager Steve Phillips, manager Bobby Valentine and
the coaching staff will meet Friday to discuss plans for the
playoff roster and rotation, and they were coy Thursday when asked
for their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton, Al Leiter and Rick Reed will each get a start, of
course. But Glendon Rusch and Jones can make strong cases for a
turn. Rusch (11-11) has pitched better lately, and Phillips said
recent performance will be a factor in which pitcher starts and
which shifts to the bullpen. But Valentine said Thursday night's
game would not affect his opinion of Jones, a veteran he trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's a very good pitcher who I think is capable of winning
a game any time of the season,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, whose team was eliminated from playoff contention on
the final day in 1998 and clinched a playoff spot in a one-game
playoff last year, rested shortstop Mike Bordick, catcher Mike
Piazza, third baseman Robin Ventura and first baseman Todd Zeile.
Two outfielders _ Derek Bell (bruised left knee) and Benny Agbayani
(strained right hamstring) _ also sat out.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux came in with 361/3 consecutive scoreless innings, a total
topped only twice in the majors since Orel Hershiser's record
59-inning run in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux worked the first three innings perfectly, needing only 26
pitches to retire the first nine Mets. That brought the streak to
391/3 innings, and with two more scoreless innings, Maddux would
own the longest streak since Hershiser's.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Timo Perez, who sparked two rallies on
Wednesday, tried to bunt for a hit, but the ball went foul. Maddux
then threw three balls, and Perez took first on Maddux's second
walk in more than 40 innings.
</P>
<P>
   This was a case of a leadoff hitter making things happen.
Agbayani probably will regain the leadoff spot if his strained
right hamstring heals for the playoffs, but Perez is faster, and
his legs paid off here. With Perez running and second baseman Keith
Lockhart covering the bag, Hamilton tapped a slow bouncer to second
for a single.
</P>
<P>
   There were runners at first and third, and after getting a
flyout, Maddux hit Jay Payton with a pitch to load the bases. He
ran the count to 3-0 on Lenny Harris, a .179 career hitter off him,
then got Harris to chop the ball in front of the plate. Maddux was
poised to leap for it _ a Gold Glover, he has perfected the move _
but the ball was well over his head, and shortstop Rafael Furcal
could not barehand it.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreless streak was over, the Mets had tied the game, 1-1,
and on the next pitch they took a 3-1 lead when Todd Pratt lashed a
single to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added a run in the fifth, in another rally generated by
Perez, who walked again, this time with with one out. Hamilton
singled, his seventh hit in 13 at-bats against Maddux, and Edgardo
Alfonzo grounded to short. Furcal's throw was wild, an error, and
Perez scored to put the Mets in front, 4-1.

IN NEED OF MOMENTUM, THE YANKEES GET PUMMELED
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The New York Yankees have been so
dominant for so long that even their losing streaks made sense.
They were either unhealthy or unchallenged but always unconcerned
because the Yankees have come to believe in their own ability to
refocus and win any game they absolutely had to win.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of year when they usually increase their level of
intensity and assume the look of a juggernaut, the Yankees are
being obliterated daily, and they are confused, angry, frustrated.
It is as if baseball's supermen have been robbed of their powers
and they do not know why.
</P>
<P>
   They look helpless, with the playoffs four days away. The Tampa
Bay Devil Rays concluded a three-game sweep of the Yankees here
Thursday night, wiping out Roger Clemens, 11-3, and handing the
Yankees their fourth straight loss, 12th in 15 games and their
sixth defeat by eight or more runs in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the Yankees managed to inch closer toward the
American League East title because the Toronto Blue Jays were
eliminated in Baltimore, 23-1. One more Yankees victory or Boston
Red Sox defeat would put the Yankees into the postseason next week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no chance George Steinbrenner would participate in
even a muted clinching celebration, however. He has owned the
spotlight in such times during the Yankees' rebirth over the last
five years. But as Tampa Bay whipped his team Thursday night,
Steinbrenner sat near the back of his private box, a silhouette on
television screens, and stalked out before the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   His anger has occasionally boiled over through this strange
season, but he has been relatively sedate the last couple of days.
There is nothing he can do now; the Yankees will either rebound or
their reign will end.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees abandoned their clubhouse quickly Wednesday after
Tampa Bay crushed them, 11-1, a loss variously described by the
players and manager Joe Torre as humiliating, embarrassing,
disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he was disappointed and hung the wreath of defeat on
the pitching. He leans toward the notion that the slump is mostly
the result of poor pitching, given that the Yankees have allowed
114 runs in 15 games, an average of 7.6 runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   Others offered different interpretations. Reliever Mike Stanton
feels that since the Yankees swept the series in Boston three weeks
ago, ``the intensity we had up until that point hasn't been
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton continued: ``I think there was a big exhale once the
Boston series was over. It's like the old parable: You push to row
upstream in a river, and you don't stop rowing once you get to
where you want. You have to keep pushing, and for a short time,
we've stopped rowing.''

BRISTOL-MYERS PLANS TO SELL CLAIROL AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year filled with setbacks, Bristol-Myers Squibb
announced Thursday that it would sell its Clairol beauty care
business and another unit that sells medical equipment so that it
can focus more on the highly profitable business of prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with analysts and investors, Charles A. Heimbold
Jr., chairman of Bristol-Myers, said that after the selling two
businesses, prescription drugs would make up 85 percent of the
company's sales and 90 percent of its profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best days are still ahead of us,'' Heimbold told the
investors, many of whom have been pressuring the company to find
ways to improve its bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Heimbold said that the company was not sure how it would divest
itself of the two businesses. He said the company might trade the
units for another company's pharmaceutical business to avoid taxes
on a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers has long resisted pressure from investors to sell
Clairol, which had $2.4 billion in sales last year, because the
business was founded by the family of Bristol-Myers' former
chairman, Richard L. Gelb. The medical equipment business, which is
known as Zimmer Inc., sells hip replacements and other supplies.
The business is based in Warsaw, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Heimbold said the company also planned to pursue more
co-promotion agreements in which Bristol-Myers sales
representatives help sell other companies' drugs. The company will
also try to increase its sales in Japan, he said, which is the
world's second-largest market for prescription drugs. The United
States is the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers' stock price has fallen this year after the
company was forced to delay its plans for Vanlev, a promising new
drug that it was counting on to replace sales of two blockbuster
drugs that are losing their patent protection. Once a drug loses
that protection, generic drugs can quickly eat into its sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company postponed its regulatory application for Vanlev, a
blood-pressure drug, in April after some patients developed severe
facial swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers shares rose $2.52 Thursday, to $59.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers has aggressively filed lawsuits against generic
companies to try to keep them from selling a low-priced version of
Taxol, a cancer drug that is the company's second-biggest seller.
Those tactics recently prompted the Federal Trade Commission to
investigate whether the company had violated any antitrust laws.
Th investigation is continuing. Ivax, a generic company, has said
that it plans to soon begin selling generic Taxol, a drug that
contributed $1.5 billion to Bristol-Myers revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, the company will also lose its patent protection
on Glucophage, a diabetes drug that had $1.3 billion in sales last
year. And, Bristol-Myers' top seller, Pravachol, a cholesterol
drug, has been losing market share this year to a Pfizer drug,
Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   Heimbold said that the company was planning to increase its
earnings this year by 11 percent _ a rate that Wall Street is
expecting. That rate will increase in the next two years, he said.
By 2003, the company expects to be growing by 15 percent or more. &QL;

SONY FACES BIG DELAYS FOR PLAYSTATION 2 SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The North American debut of Sony's new Playstation 2 video
system appears to have become a marketing nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   After days of rumors, Sony confirmed Wednesday that it would
fall far short of meeting its promise to have a million devices
ready for sale on Oct. 26. At least 500,000 consumers Sony had
expected to satisfy immediately _ many of whom had made deposits
with retailers _ will be turned away. Sony blamed shortages of
electronic components, though it offered no details.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that despite Sony's plans to ship 100,000
units a week from the end of October until Christmas, sales of the
$299 device will fall at least 700,000 units below previous
projections for the Christmas season, costing more than $200
million in revenues. And that is not counting lost sales from game
software and compact discs that can be played on Playstation 2, the
first device that lets users play video games, browse the Internet
and play DVD-format discs on one machine.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals asserted that Sony was squandering a huge opportunity in
the $8 billion games industry, where 60 percent of sales come in
the last quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have something under the Christmas tree, `` said
Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer of Sega of
America, which is shifting its $149 Dreamcast video units from
container ships to air freighters to fill what it describes as
soaring demand from retailers frantic to stock up on alternatives
to Playstation. ``Rain checks won't work with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts were not so sure. While some sales would be
lost, they said, Playstation 2 is such an advance on competing
systems that many serious game players, however annoyed, are likely
to wait until Sony works out its production bottlenecks. While Sega
will certainly experience a measurable boost, they say, Playstation
2 will not face true competition until the fall of 2001, when both
Microsoft and Nintendo are expected to introduce products with
comparable features.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said Wednesday that it would catch up with it previous
production promises by the end of its fiscal year next March 31,
its target date for having sold 10 million Playstation 2 consoles
worldwide. The device was introduced in Japan last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just shifting revenue from the end of this year to
the first three months of 2001,'' said James Lin, an analyst at
Sutro &AMP; Co. ``The impact is minimal once you do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's stock and shares of game designers like Electronic Arts
and Activision rebounded in heavy trading Thursday from sharp
declines on Wednesday, when rumors about Sony's problems had
swirled through the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's American depository receipts rose $5.06 Thursday, to
$104.44, after falling $9.38 on Wednesday. Electronic Arts rose
$4.94, to $50.13; Activision climbed $1.38, to $14; and THQ rose
$3.44, to $24.50.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's problems represent the latest variation on a familiar
theme this year for electronics consumers and investors. The entire
industry has been hit by shortages of memory chips, displays,
several types of processors and even humdrum components like
capacitors _ tiny devices that cost a few cents but are crucial to
managing power on chips.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, including IBM, Palm and the cellular phone giant
Ericsson, have lost so much production to shortages that it has had
a material impact on earnings. Analysts expect fewer such
announcements in the coming months as many of the shortages are
eased, but several component markets are expected to remain tight
for at least another six months.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's inability to pull together the components needed to
create a huge inventory of Playstation 2 units for rollout
contrasts with the situation at Sega, which ironed out the mass
production kinks that Dreamcast encountered last year and has been
able to build a slight buffer of inventory this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's shortfall, though, is vast even by gaming industry
standards, and many retailers are fuming that they were not warned
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for short supplies is certain to be tense for months,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is how it is distributed among the big versus
the small shops,'' said John-Paul McNealy, a consumer electronics
analyst for Gartner Group in San Jose, Calif. ``We think the Mom
and Pop stores are going to get pinched.'' &QL;

COMPANY MANAGING DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT RETAINS
CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government on Thursday renewed its
contract with the private organization that runs the nation's organ
transplant system, a move that appears to end two years of bitter
dispute over the limited number of organs are distributed.
</P>
<P>
   After competitive bidding, the contract was again awarded to the
United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit organization based in
Richmond, Va., that had resisted new federal rules requiring organs
to be distributed across broad geographic areas to the sickest
patients first.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year contract explicitly calls for the network to
accept those rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely pleased to have retained this important
contract and thus continue to serve the needs of the more than
71,000 patients awaiting transplants,'' said Walter Graham, the
network's executive director. The contract, he said, affirms the
government's ``continued confidence in our ability.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the contract does not give complete authority to the
organ sharing network.
</P>
<P>
   The network, which has run the transplant system since the
mid-1980s, will continue to maintain the list of patients who are
waiting for new organs and will run the computer system that
matches waiting patients with donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   But federal health officials selected another organization, the
University Renal Research and Education Association of Ann Arbor,
Mich., to run the scientific registry that examines how transplant
patients fare and how changes in organ distribution policy affect
them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Earl Fox, the administrator of the Health Resources
and Services Administration, the federal Health and Human Services
unit that oversees the transplant system, said he hoped that the
awarding of the contracts would help the government, ``settle the
dust and move forward with the transplant community'' to improve
the quality of care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   He added:``There was absolutely no politics involved. These
contracts were awarded based on merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract with the Richmond group is worth $52 million for
three years. About $1.5 million per year will come from taxpayers,
while the rest comes from fees paid by transplant patients or their
insurers. The Michigan group will receive $2.5 million per year
from taxpayers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday's decision came one day after Donna Shalala, the
secretary of Health and Human Services, announced she was creating
an advisory committee on organ transplantation to help guide her
though the thicket of medical and ethical issues that come with
regulating the transplants.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the committee, Shalala said it would provide her
with ``top-notch, science-based counsel on transplantation
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the organ sharing network had worked over the summer to
develop new policies for distributing livers, which are in
especially short supply, and that the advisory committee would help
assess those proposals.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 62,000 Americans now waiting for donated
organs, and each year, about 4,000 people die while they wait. As a
result, the dispute over who should receive donated organs is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Shalala first proposed revamping the organ sharing
system to force organ sharing across broad geographic regions,
reaction to the proposal was swift and intense.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system that had been in effect since the mid-1980s,
when the organ sharing network got its start, the country was
divided into 11 regions further divided into a total of 62 areas.
Donated organs were first offered to patients within areas. Only if
there was no need locally, were they offered in the larger regions.
</P>
<P>
   Citing great disparities in waiting times for transplants from
region to region, Shalala argued that the old system was unfair and
sought to replace it with one that would break down the old
geographic barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The organ sharing network resisted, however, and soon the debate
moved to Congress, which put the administration's rules on hold
until March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was not only political, but economic. Small
transplant centers feared that the new rules would put them out of
business by steering organs to larger, big-city hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, transplant surgeons argued bitterly among
themselves. Some states also stepped into the debate, passing
legislation that would prevent organs from being shipped to
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thursday's decision, Congress could still step in. The
National Organ Transplant Act, the 1984 law that created the organ
allocation system, expired several years ago and is up for
reauthorization. Congress could use the reauthorization as an
occasion to reshape the system yet again.

EDITORIAL: IMPORTING CHEAPER DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Republican leadership has joined forces with
President Clinton, Congress is almost certain to pass a bill that
would permit imports of U.S.-made pharmaceutical drugs that are
sold at low prices abroad. The Republican leaders may have come
around to the idea to insulate themselves from charges that they
have failed to protect Medicare and other patients from soaring
drug prices. To be sure, a proposal designed to lower price is by
no means a sufficient answer to the problem that millions of the
elderly have no coverage for prescription drugs. Yet it is worth
trying in an effort to curb prices and instill more evenness in
global pricing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. manufacturers often sell patented drugs abroad for less
than they charge in the United States. One analysis showed that a
month's supply of an osteoporosis drug sold for $170 in the United
States but only $45 in Canada and $51 in Mexico. The typical
discount for patented drugs is smaller. Taking into account price
reductions offered to Americans enrolled in managed care or
otherwise insured, foreign drugs probably sell for 15 to 30 percent
less. Under current law, wholesalers are not permitted to buy
U.S.-manufactured drugs abroad and resell them in the United
States. The proposed bill would remove that prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the savings to consumers will almost certainly be smaller
than sponsors expect because there are many ways the manufacturers
can minimize the impact. The drug companies might raise their
prices abroad, cutting the price differential. Or they might
restrict exports to levels that foreign countries will absorb for
their own use, leaving little for wholesalers to import back to the
United States. Or they might change the dimensions of the pills
sold abroad so they are no longer the same as the drugs that are
approved for sale in this country. The rules that federal
regulators will issue to insure that reimported drugs are safe will
add to costs, wiping out some of the potential saving.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the proposal is worth trying for the simple reason that
American patients now bear the brunt of development costs for drugs
that are used worldwide. Protected by patent laws and the
prohibition against imports, American manufacturers charge high
prices in the domestic market. The profits cover the cost of
finding the next blockbuster drug. Having recovered development
costs in the domestic market, manufacturers can sell abroad at low,
government-set prices and still add to their profits. The proposed
legislation would attempt to tilt the market in favor of American
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal works as promised, and thus lowers the profit
margins of drug companies, there is some risk that manufacturers
might cut their research budgets for new drugs. That risk seems
small because the incentive to discover new drugs would remain
substantial. The drug import bill is no substitute for providing
prescription drug coverage for the elderly. But it is worth
enacting because it might do some good and poses no great harm.

DISCIPLINE PENDING FOR SCIENTISTS AND ADMINISTRATORS AT LOS
ALAMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some scientists and administrators at the Los Alamos weapons
laboratory have been notified that disciplinary actions, possibly
including dismissal, are imminent in the case of computer hard
drives improperly removed from a safe and later found behind a copy
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials said that three of the employees to be
disciplined are Bradley Clark, a Los Alamos scientist, Stephen
Younger, the head of nuclear weapons programs, and John Browne, the
director of the laboratory. Laboratory officials said Thursday that
other scientists might be reprimanded or suspended, and that Clark
may even be fired.
</P>
<P>
   The actions, while meant to close a chapter of the unsolved
displacement of the missing hard drives, are likely to darken the
already somber mood at the birthplace of the atomic bomb. Los
Alamos is the main institution that designs and maintains the
security of the country's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The computer hard drives, no bigger than a wallet, hold data on
nuclear arms and are meant for use in emergencies by the
government's Nuclear Emergency Search Team, which is responsible
for responding to nuclear accidents and terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The lapse in security began in early May as the flames of a
raging forest fire closed in on the sprawling Los Alamos National
Laboratory, on a plateau in the forested mountains of New Mexico.
As members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team gathered materials,
they discovered that two hard drives with nuclear secrets had been
improperly removed from their secure storage. The loss was reported
on May 31, and the drives were found on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the laboratory was already under scrutiny because
of the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist who pleaded guilty
Sept. 13 to a charge of mishandling classified data. Reports that
the computer drives were missing touched off a hunt for them and
for evidence about who had handled them last.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary of some laboratory personnel is being
considered because it took three weeks for the head of the weapons
laboratory to find out about the missing storage drives, federal
said in interviews Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, already critical of laboratory security because of
suspected espionage, made much of that embarrassing delay.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed disciplinary actions are being recommended by the
University of California, which runs the laboratory for the
Department of Energy. Separately, officials said, the FBI was still
conducting a criminal investigation of the missing computer drives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Los Alamos NEST team was told of impending
punishments on Tuesday, but they would provide no details. And they
cautioned that final penalties had not been decided and could
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lab has made no decision to terminate any lab employee,''
said John Gustafson, a laboratory spokesman. ``The review has
looked at a wide range of disciplinary actions. The process is not
done. And the actions that have been proposed are not final.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. John Gordon, the director of the National Nuclear Security
Administration, the new, semi-independent agency that oversees the
government's nuclear weapons sites, said, ``These are internal
management decisions being taken by Los Alamos and the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said details of the disciplinary actions might be made
public as soon as Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NEST is a largely volunteer force of top laboratory scientists
who are ready to fly anywhere at a moment's notice to respond to a
nuclear emergency.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the situation said Thursday that punishing
the NEST volunteers was already being viewed as unjust. One federal
weapons expert called the proposed actions ``an overreaction that
will devastate the emergency response community.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation is widely viewed by laboratory
personnel as a frivolous diversion from maintaining the nation's
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got 60 FBI agents on misplaced hard drives,'' Robert
Vrooman, a former head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos, said.
``I'd like to know how many of them are working on Chinese
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives were stored inside a vault in locked containers
in the division of the national laboratory where nuclear weapons
are designed. Younger, one of the main government witnesses against
Lee, heads the that division, and Clark heads the NEST team.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Clark's office and home were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, the University of California issued a
statement saying that ``several managers and supervisors throughout
the Los Alamos chain of command'' would be affected by the proposed
punishments. It said no further comments were possible because Los
Alamos policy gave employees five days to respond, and that the
people involved had ``extensive rights to appeal the final notice
of discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   When Congress criticized Los Alamos about the lapse in security,
Browne vowed to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for me to fully convey my frustration at the
damage a single act, apparently human error or intentional
wrongdoing, can do to the accomplishments of so many,'' Browne told
the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am committed to taking the strongest possible actions I can
to secure the nation's nuclear secrets. These actions will include
disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment
against individuals who willfully or carelessly violate the
rules.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday that it had
approved the marketing of an abortion-inducing pill, the first
alternative to surgical abortion approved in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, a prescription drug, will be available to doctors in
about four weeks, its distributor said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, mifepristone, or RU-486, will allow doctors like
family practitioners and obstetricians to offer abortions outside
of specialty clinics, and it will allow women to have abortions in
the privacy of their homes up to seven weeks after their last
menstrual period.
</P>
<P>
   Although most women who seek abortions do not do so until later
in their pregnancies, the drug has taken on immense symbolic
importance for both supporters and opponents of abortion rights.
Many supporters of abortion rights have said its approval would
transform the struggle over legal abortion, making the procedure
more accessible, more private and harder for opponents of abortion
to identify women who are having the procedure and doctors who are
providing it. Approval of the drug immediately brought out the
contrasts in the views on abortion of Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Gore said he was pleased with the
decision and Bush said it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Jane E. Henney, the FDA commissioner, said in an
interview, ``Politics had no role in this decision.'' It was based,
Henney said, on persuasive data showing the drug is safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The drug will be distributed under the name Mifeprex by Danco
Laboratories of New York City, a company formed specifically to
find someone to make the drug and then to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of abortion rights said they were elated by the health
agency's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I seen anything like this,'' said Gloria Feldt, the
president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which
participated in clinical trials of the drug. ``Never has there been
a drug approval that has been through such an arduous political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldt called the drug ``the most significant technological
advance in women's reproductive health care since the birth control
pill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a setback for those who oppose abortions, and some of
them saw it as a contradiction in Clinton administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should give people pause,'' said Dr. Richard Land,
the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and
religious liberty commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how they square this with making abortions safe,
legal and rare,'' Land said, citing an oft-repeated Clinton
administration goal. ``It will make them more plentiful and less
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, the health agency set relatively few
restrictions on doctors' freedom to prescribe the drug, beyond
requiring that the doctors be able to determine the length of time
that a woman has been pregnant and that they make sure that women
who receive mifepristone have ready access to surgical abortions,
should they need them.
</P>
<P>
   Women will be given written instructions on the pill's use and
its side effects which can include bleeding and cramping,
headaches, vomiting or diarrhea, and their doctor must sign a
statement saying that they have read the instructions and will
comply with them exactly. The women must also agree to have a
surgical abortion if the pills do not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   A woman first takes mifepristone, which blocks the action of
progesterone, a hormone required to maintain a pregnancy, and 36 to
48 hours later takes a second drug, misoprostol, which makes the
uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue. In clinical trials,
the drug combination failed to result in complete abortion in about
5 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also required that the Population Council, a nonprofit
group that sponsored Danco's application to market mifepristone,
keep track of how many women suffer serious side effects and the
number of cases in which it fails to induce abortion. The council
will also audit doctors to see whether they and the women taking
the drug are signing the patient agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although advocates of abortion rights have been pushing for
approval of mifepristone for years, it is not clear how many U.S.
women will choose it. The drug can be used only until seven weeks
after a woman's last menstrual period, and just one-third of
abortions performed in the United States occur at that stage
according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that
conducts research on reproductive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, side effects like excessive bleeding are extremely
rare in first-trimester surgical abortions, and abortions are legal
even into the third trimester of pregnancy in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors said they anticipated many women seeking abortion
would prefer the surgical approach, since the procedure usually is
over in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that mifepristone is highly effective and
there are good results most of the time,'' said Dr. Warren Hern,
director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado. But. she said,
citing side effects like excessive bleeding and incomplete
abortions, ``people have a way of denying these problems with the
drug and saying it's a magic bullet. It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldt of Planned Parenthood said women in clinical trials said
they liked mifepristone abortions because they felt more natural
than surgical ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel more in charge, more in control of their personal
health,'' Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   But Olivia Gans, who is the director of American Victims of
Abortion at the National Right to Life Committee, said she worried
that women might not understand what they were getting into when
they took the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just seeking another way to deliberately end a life,''
she said. ``How honest are we going to be with the American public
about what's at stake with this drug?''
</P>
<P>
   Heather O'Neill, a Danco spokeswoman, said that the company had
not yet set a price for the drug but that she expected that
insurance companies and government programs that now pay for
surgical abortions would also pay for mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who want to use mifepristone may find that insurance
questions and FDA restrictions are just part of their requirements.
In some states, abortion laws might restrict the drug's use. For
example, many states require that abortion providers register and
report every abortion. Some have detailed requirements for the
design of offices and clinics. Some states require that fetal
remains be examined by a doctor and in North Dakota, the remains
must be cremated, incinerated, or buried, the law says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some doctors who could administer the drug may
choose not to do so. ``Any doctor who regularly does abortions in
most states has been subjected to extra scrutiny from law
enforcement _ they don't fool around with this,'' said Janet
Benshoof, the president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, a legal advocacy organization that has represented abortion
clinics in legal disputes. Benshoof said that in many states, the
laws written for surgical abortions also apply to pill-induced
abortions and that some states specifically include pill-induced
abortions in their regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite mifepristone's great potential to improve medical
services for women, anti-abortion state legislatures have already
erected a labyrinth of laws restricting all abortion,'' Benshoof
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mifepristone was first synthesized 20 years ago, in France, and
came on the market in Europe more than a decade ago. But from the
beginning its introduction into the United States was entangled in
abortion politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Land said, he went to Europe with a delegation of
opponents of abortion, like the National Right to Life Committee
and the Knights of Columbus, to tell executives at Roussel-Uclaf
SA, the drug's maker, and its parent company, Hoechst AG, that they
would face boycotts and protests if they attempted to sell the drug
in the United States. (Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc last
December and the merged company is called Aventis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Hoechst that it would be unfortunate if they were to
market the drug in the U.S. since they had an unfortunate history
when it came to death-dealing materials,'' Land said. The company
was part of a conglomerate that had a major interest in the
chemical used in German gas chambers in World War II. ``We knew and
we wanted them to know that we knew,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Roussel-Uclaf said that it would not seek
approval to market mifepristone here; without a new drug
application, the FDA could not fully assess the drug.
</P>
<P>
   When he first came into office, in 1993, President Clinton asked
federal regulators to assess whether the drug was safe and should
be sold in this country. Dr. David A. Kessler, who was commissioner
of the FDA from October of 1990 until March of 1997, prevailed upon
Roussel-Uclaf to donate its patent to the Population Council, which
wanted to sponsor clinical trials in the United States and find a
company to produce and market the drug. In May of 1994,
Roussel-Uclaf donated its patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did think that we should have a chance to evaluate
the drug,'' Kessler said. ``We didn't think that politics should
get in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Population Council presented its data on the
drug's safety and efficacy to an advisory committee of the health
agency, which recommended the drug be approved for marketing in
this country. But the Population Council still had no one willing
to manufacture the drug. As a result, the agency could not issue
final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't approve a drug unless the drug exists, unless you
can inspect the plant,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some doctors have been using a cancer
chemotherapy, methotrexate, to induce abortions. This use is legal,
but because methotrexate was not extensively tested and is not
approved as an abortion drug its use is not widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to announce the approval of mifepristone, Henney,
the F.D.A. commissioner, said, reflects the FDA's own six-month
interval to rule on applications to market a drug. Danco submitted
crucial information six months ago, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go back again to saying that politics did not play a
role in this,'' Henney said. ``The people who know me and the
people who know this agency know that we make our decisions based
on the scientific evidence that we have before us. These are
scientific decisions.''

IN HIS OWN WORDS: GEORGE W. BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remarks by Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday, in Green Bay, Wis.,
on Vice President Al Gore's spending proposals:
</P>
<P>
   `` I'll treat people with respect. I trust them to know their
own interests and chart their own course.
</P>
<P>
   My opponent once had some sympathy for these ideas. He has
claimed to invent many things, but he did help invent the
Democratic Leadership Council. Senator Lieberman is also a member
of that council.
</P>
<P>
   This is an organization of more moderate Democrats who want to
modernize Medicare and Social Security. They want to shrink the
federal work force and control spending. They want to use
market-oriented ideas to help people in education and in health
care.
</P>
<P>
   I don't always agree with this group, and they certainly don't
always agree with me. But they are leaders, and the kind of leaders
I will work with should I become the president.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has cast his lot with the old Democratic
Party. His promises throw the budget out of balance. He offers a
big federal spending program to every _ to nearly every _ single
voting bloc in America. He expands entitlements without reforms to
sustain them. And when others, Republican or Democrat, propose
needed reforms in Social Security or Medicare or education, he
opposes them vigorously, and he attacks them.
</P>
<P>
   Just when progress on important issues seemed within reach, my
opponent has left the vital center of American politics. ''  &QL;

ANTICIPATED RESIGNATION OCCURS AT 3COM
</HEADLINE>
  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 3Com Corp. said Thursday that Eric Benhamou
had resigned as chief executive, but would remain chairman.
</P>
<P>
   He is being succeeded as chief executive by Bruce Claflin,
3Com's president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou's departure has been anticipated ever since 3Com
successfully spun off its Palm Inc. unit in an initial public
offering in July.
</P>
<P>
   His restructuring of the company showed signs of being on track
on Tuesday, when 3Com reported a first-quarter loss that was
substantially smaller than analysts' estimates. But the company's
future prospects remain cloudy, analysts say, and investors are
wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is my 10th anniversary as chief executive,'' Benhamou
said in a telephone interview, noting that his original commitment
to the board was to run 3Com for 10 years. ``In an industry as
volatile as ours, it's a good discipline to self-regenerate
leadership. I believe Bruce is up to it, and the most qualified
person to lead 3Com through its next phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of 3Com rose $1, to $18, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou presided over a rocky 10 years at 3Com, which once had
a clear opportunity to be the dominant company in computer
networking. Its founder, Robert Metcalfe, invented Ethernet, a
popular technology used for creating office networks of personal
computers, while a researcher at the fabled Xerox PARC. But the
company lost ground early on to Novell Inc., which emphasized
software over hardware, and more recently to Cisco Systems Inc.,
which has been a much more aggressive competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 3Com acquired U.S. Robotics Inc., the leading modem
manufacturer, only to watch as the modem market imploded. At the
same time, 3Com's own core product, network adaptor cards for
connecting PCs to Ethernet, became a commodity item with little
profitability. In routers, specialized computers used to direct
traffic over networks, the company was consistently outgunned by
Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Palm, which had been a nearly overlooked part of the
U.S. Robotics deal, came to be worth more by itself than all of
3Com. So 3Com spun off Palm, and at the same time announced its
withdrawal from the corporate networking equipment business. 3Com
now is focused primarily on broadband and wireless connectivity
devices for consumers and small businesses, and infrastructure
equipment for companies that provide telecommunications and
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou, 45, appointed Claflin, 48, president and chief
operating officer in 1998. Claflin had previously worked for the
Digital Equipment Corp. and the International Business Machines
Corp.

MARION BY A MILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SYDNEY, Australia _ Once upon a time, the women's Olympic
200-meter dash looked as if it would be taut with drama. That was
before the fairytale unraveled like the plot of a dime-store novel.
</P>
<P>
   When defending Olympic champion Marie-Jose Perec's demons chased
her out of these Summer Games and defending world champion Inger
Miller bowed out with a hamstring pull, the ending of the 200 final
here became as predictable as the guy getting the girl.
</P>
<P>
   As long as she finished, Marion Jones was going to finish first.
The ending was foreshadowed none too subtly in the semifinal
Thursday when the former Thousand Oaks High standout clocked a
22.40 and looked as winded afterward as someone who had just
gathered the newspaper off her front porch.
</P>
<P>
   In the final, a scant two hours later, Jones pulled away from
the field so promptly, her final 80 meters was for all intents and
purposes the start of her victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was timed in 21.84, a season best. Pauline Davis-Thompson
of the Bahamas edged Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka for the
silver, 22.27 to 22.28. Not since Australian Marjorie Jackson's
.5-second victory in the 1952 Olympics in the era of hand-timing
had anyone scored such a clear-cut victory in the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' said Jones, who is 2 for 2 in her historic
quest for five gold medals, having won the 100 meters Saturday.
``I'm here for greater things than two gold medals. In a certain
way I guess I am checking (the events) off the list. But I'm
definitely enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing Jones enjoys more than competing. When she saw
Davis-Thompson's times dropping with every round of the 200, Jones
said she thought to herself, ``OK, it's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been thrilling to see Jones battle a healthy
Miller, whose personal best in the event is within .01-second of
Jones' 21.76. And Perec has run a sub-22, so her presence would
have added to the intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Perec weren't the only athletes whose nonappearance
created a theatrical void. Erki Nool of Estonia won the decathlon
in the absence of Dan O'Brien, the defending Olympic decathlon
champion who missed the U.S. Trials with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantinos Kenteris of Greece won the gold medal in the 200-
meter dash in the absence of world-record holder Michael Johnson
and Maurice Greene, both of whom pulled up lame in the final at the
U.S. Trials. Ato Boldon, who ran at UCLA and competes for his
native Trinidad &AMP; Tabogo, finished third in the slowest 200-meter
final since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans Suzy Favor Hamilton and Camarillo High graduate
Marla Runyan advanced to Saturday's final in the 1500 meters in the
absence of U.S. Trials winner Regina Jacobs, who dropped out of the
Games with a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   Anymore at the Olympics, it's not finishing first that's the
hardest thing; it's making it to the starting blocks at all.
</P>
<P>
   Jones knows bad things can happen to really good athletes. She
collapsed on the track with back spasms in the semifinals of the
200 meters at last summer's World Championships. So she can be
forgiven for not looking any farther than tonight's long jump final
(she also is scheduled to run in the 400 and 1,600 relays).
</P>
<P>
   That Jones has been able to maintain her keen focus the past few
days in spite of the fallout from her husband C.J. Hunter's
positive test for the banned steroid nandrolone is something of
which she is proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that could have easily swayed my focus, but
it hasn't,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   She simply has worked too hard and dreamed too big to get
distracted now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To let some event in your life, no matter how dramatic it
might be, ruin a dream you've had for a lot of years wouldn't be
worth it at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who long ago declared her intentions to become the
first track athlete to win five gold medals in a single Olympics,
Jones, 24, is awfully modest. She was quick to dismiss any notion
that she was running against the clock Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a class by myself,'' she said. Nodding to Davis-
Thompson and Jayasinghe, who flanked her in the interview room,
Jones added, ``These women pushed me. They made me dig deep down.''
</P>
<P>
   From high in the Olympic Stadium stands, it appeared as though
Jones, a red-white-and-blue blur, was the one pushing the others
along to faster times. All seven runners behind her posted
season-best times and Davis-Thompson and Jayasinghe recorded
lifetime bests.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's awesome,'' said another finalist, Melinda Gainsford-
Taylor, who had nipped Jones in a quarterfinal heat Wednesday and
then awakened Thursday to find photos of her first-place finish
stripped across the front pages of the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clear case of a picture misrepresenting the facts,
Gainsford-Taylor admitted with a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just good fun, I think,'' she said after finishing
sixth in the final. ``I knew Marion was shutting down, so I said,
what the hell, it's my hometown, and I passed her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainsford-Taylor went on to admit she's keeping all of
Thursday's newspapers and probably will have the photo of her
beating Jones framed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that terrible?'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The female sprint corps isn't exactly known for being an esprit
de corps. Big egos and a small margin of error make for uneasy
alliances; just ask Miller and Jones, who will exchange relay
batons before they do words.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest living female on the planet, Gainsford-Taylor says,
is also the friendliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been running internationally for the last 10 years and
I've never seen someone so friendly,'' Gainsford-Taylor said.
``It's just really refreshing, let's put it that way. I've seen
good winners and bad winners. She's a good winner.''

NORWAY EDGES U.S. IN OVERTIME

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Same excitement. Different result.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's soccer team has a knack for playing dramatic
matches in the grandest of arenas and the Yanks were at it again
Thursday night at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffeny Milbrett scored her second goal 30 seconds from end time
to forge a stunning tie, but Norway got the decisive goal 12
minutes into overtime to upset the Americans 3-2 in the gold-medal
match at Sydney Football Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will sleep well tonight knowing they did everything they
could to win this game,'' U.S. coach April Heinrichs said of her
players.
</P>
<P>
   After a streak of winning big matches going back to the 1996
Olympics and extending through the 1999 World Cup, the U.S. this
time succumbed to a cool, heady Norwegian team that took advantage
of its limited opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive chance came when U.S. defender Joy Fawcett's
attempted clearance header caromed off Norway forward Dagny
Mellgren and fell to her feet just inside the box. Mellgren bounced
a shot that U.S. keeper Siri Mullinix got a hand on but couldn't
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinix did not have a strong match. She never saw Norway's
first goal, off a corner kick; came off her line in an attempt to
catch a ball that turned into a header and Norway's second goal;
and couldn't get a big-enough piece of a ball within her reach on
the third goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got down on it and I got a piece of it, but I guess it
wasn't enough,'' Mullinix said of the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Julie Foudy refused to consider the idea that Mullinix
cost the U.S. the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Siri has done a tremendous job for us,'' Foudy said.
``She's been absolutely phenomenal. Without her, we don't even get
to this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans dominated the first half but managed only one
goal. ``Coulda, woulda, shoulda,'' U.S. forward Mia Hamm said of
the missed opportunities. ``It's a little late for that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett banged home a perfect pass by Hamm in the fifth minute
to launch what for a time looked like a replay of the 2-0 U.S.
victory in the opening match of this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have started better,'' Heinrichs said. ``It's a
coach's dream to push the ball around as much as we did, and all
that possession.''
</P>
<P>
   But it yielded only a 1-1 tie at the half when Gro Espeseth
headed in a corner kick in the 41st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Espeseth said Norway had to withstand the early U.S. momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored so early and I said, 'Oh, no, not again,' '' she
said. ``Why should they win again and again and again?''
</P>
<P>
   The game took on a different cast in the second half as Norway
coach Per-Mathias Hagmo packed his midfield with a 4-5-1 formation
to break up the U.S. attack and Norway launched counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   Ragnhild Gulbrandsen put Norway up 2-1 in the 78th minute when
she headed in a long pass while colliding with Fawcett and Siri
Mullinix near the penalty spot. ``That's my style, going out for
long balls,'' Mullinix said. ``Unfortunately, this time it didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans weren't finished, even as they went into the
second of two minutes of extra time tacked on after the 90th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team never gives up until they're told to leave the
field,'' Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm carried a ball down the right flank and launched a long
cross into the box. It sailed over the head of midfielder Kristine
Lilly but right into the path of Milbrett, who headed it home, a
lightning bolt of a goal that brought the crowd to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best goals I've ever scored,'' Milbrett said. ``I
mean, I'm 5-foot-2 so I haven't put in too many with my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps exhausted by its comeback, the U.S. failed to carry
momentum into overtime, and Norway ended things quickly in the
sudden-death format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norway are champions,'' Heinrichs said. ``We have a
deep-deep-seated respect for Norway. Their history, their talent,
their will to find a way to win. We respect that and have for 10
years.''

IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, RICK LAZIO STUMPS TO SHOW HIS CONCERN FOR
REGION'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio Thursday sought to rebut the
perception that he has turned a happy cheek to the economic
suffering upstate, asserting that new jobs are being created while
acknowledging that ``the recovery here has not reached every single
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Buffalo Rotary Club a week after his opponent in
the Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, told the same group that
Lazio was out of touch, he stuck close to a stance that has
generated some debate upstate and has led even some fellow
Republicans to question his approach.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, noting statistics indicating 11,000 new jobs created in
the region during the last 18 months, said, ``It is symptomatic of
a dynamic economy _ of an economy that's changing, that's flexible,
that's adapting, that in the end that is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I know the recovery here has not reached every
single family. I know there is still a lot of work to do, and I
know that the next senator of New York will need to be a leader of
that effort. But the question is: Do we want to build on our recent
accomplishments or do we want to return to the policies that caused
the recessions in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio did not lay out a specific plan aimed at the region,
saying his overall plan to cut taxes and encourage partnerships
between the public and private sectors would stimulate the economy.
He said that he would encourage more high-technology businesses to
settle here, and suggested that the region would benefit from a
high-speed rail link to downstate.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the audience expressed impatience, asking for specifics
on what he would do as senator.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Mills, who would not give his party affiliation but said
he had not decided whom to vote for in November, told Lazio that he
had spent too much time telling the group what ``disqualifies your
opponent rather than what qualifies you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has spent the past few days emphasizing his tax-cut plan
in speeches, but he no longer assigns a figure to it. When he
unveiled it in a speech last month, he said it would amount to $776
billion over the next decade, but Democrats and news reports
suggested the figure was closer to $1 trillion, putting it in line
with the one proposed byGov. George W. Bush. Lazio's aides have
since conceded that some of the figures he used were outdated,
though he has stood by the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's latest swing through the state, which began Wednesday
and concludes Saturday, is a prelude to a high-energy drive to
secure the upstate vote, his strategists said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the region is traditionally Republican, polls _ both
independent and Lazio's _ suggest that Clinton poses a strong
challenge after heavily campaigning here with the message that the
upstate economy is hurting and that she will focus on fixing it.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's assistants said he would spend time upstate next month,
focusing on potential supporters of Vice President Al Gore who tell
pollsters they are undecided on a choice for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who says they support Gore but are undecided in this
race does not want to vote for Hillary Clinton,'' a Lazio aide
said. ``They are looking for a reason not to vote for Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides said he had been hurt by commercials from Clinton
and her supporters that have hampered his efforts to tell voters
who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has complained that the advertisements have distorted his
record in Congress, and on this trip he has made an effort to
correct what he considers misconceptions, especially regarding
Medicare. Clinton's supporters have run commercials saying that
Lazio voted to cut Medicare by $270 billion: Lazio instead voted to
cut the rate of growth in the program, a position Clinton has also
supported. In his speeches, Lazio has told people not to pay
attention to the advertisements.

FIBERGLASS HERD IS SENT TO MARKET

   NEW YORK _ They were rustled in the dead of night and sprayed
with graffiti, saddled by children and derided by critics. And
Thursday night the cows of the city's CowParade New York 2000 did
yeoman's service one more time, raising hundreds of thousands of
dollars for charity.
</P>
<P>
   As featured cows rose up and down on hydraulic lifts in the
ornate hall of Cipriani 42nd Street, a sold-out crowd that had paid
up to $350 per ticket bid enthusiastically, with most of the cows
going for several times their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30 p.m., 49 cows had been sold for a total of nearly a
million dollars, with the highest bid of $60,000 going to Adele
Moros' ``Tiffany Cow.'' A cow by the pop artist Peter Max went for
$24,000, as did a cow that unfolds into a real piano. The president
of a chain of Japanese steakhouses, Tony Fujita, bought two cows,
paying $48,000 for ``Lady Cowdiva,'' a ladylike cow seated atop a
Holstein, by Tim Gaydos, and $24,000 for ``La Vie Bovine'' by Matt
Maraffi.
</P>
<P>
   For the auction, a committee selected 75 of the 500 life-size
cows, each sponsored by a corporation, civic group, cultural
institution or other organization, which had been deployed in
public spaces during the summer, with most of them, 480, in
Manhattan. Since Labor Day, the colorful herd has been corralled in
the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remaining 425 cows, including one that was signed by
the cast of the television show ``Survivor,'' are being sold on
Amazon.com in an auction that began at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Bidding
closes on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds will benefit charities chosen by the city, including
the City Parks Foundation, God's Love We Deliver, Hale House,
Citymeals-on-Wheels, New Yorkers for Children and the Center for
Arts Education, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Though each artist began with one of only three fiberglass cow
models (standing, grazing or seated), the designs ranged widely,
from cheesy to conceptual. Among the crowd pleasers was a ``Cowch
Potato'' plopped on a sofa in Grand Central Terminal. On the
head-scratching side, there was ``Ceci n'est pas une vache''
(``this is not a cow,'' a reference to a painting by Rene Magritte,
``Ceci n'est pas une pipe'').
</P>
<P>
   There were cows transformed into slinky-toys, cows covered in
ersatz moola and a cow catching a Frisbee in its mouth. But there
were no sliced cows a la Damien Hirst, the British artist whose
work in ``Sensation,'' at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, caused a stir
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The cows were popular with tourists but derided by many locals,
who pointed out that New York is not the cow town that Chicago, the
first city in the United States to play host to a cow parade, can
claim to be.
</P>
<P>
   Art critics, too, bemoaned what they called the hokey designs
and the hackneyed puns in the titles. (``Moo York'' was used a
dozen times.) Roberta Smith, writing in The New York Times, located
the hoofed creations ``somewhere between a Happening and an art
class at summer camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Such slings and arrows, it seems, placed Pat Smith, a spokesman
for CowParade Holdings, Inc., on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In answer to the question, `Is this really art?''' he wrote to
a reporter, ``we offer representatives from Phillips Auctioneers,
the third-largest auction house in the world, which is lending its
prestige to this event and providing its services at no charge.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any guide, CowParade Holdings, the company
responsible for the cow parade, need not have feared negative
appraisals. In Chicago, an auction of 147 cows generated $3.5
million for charity, according to Jerry Elbaum, CowParade's
president. Cows expected to go for $2,000 to $5,000 went for $8,500
to $110,000 (for a cow decorated with the handprints of patients at
a children's hospital).
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey spent $110,000 on three cows. But she had a place
to put them: her Indiana farm. Where, on the other hand, would the
average New York auctiongoer put one of the statues?
</P>
<P>
   Barbi Benton, the actress and singer, hopes to acquire 20 cows
for her 40-acre sculpture garden in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Mendell, a senior officer at Chase Manhattan Bank, said
that if he bid successfully on the ``Twin Cowers,'' two cows
modeled after the World Trade Center, he would put them in his
summer house. ``Pound Ridge, New York,'' he said. ``Everybody has a
summer house, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   A couple from Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said that their $26,000 cow,
``Hugs and Smooches,'' which the artist, Susan Rooney, had covered
with X's and O's, was destined to stand by their pool.

RICHARD MULLIGAN, ACTOR ON `SOAP' AND `EMPTY NEST,' DIES AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to correct date of death)   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Mulligan, who won Emmy Awards for his portrayal of
fathers on the situation comedies ``Soap'' and ``Empty Nest,'' died
Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his friend and assistant, David
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Although he achieved his greatest success in television in the
course of a career of some 40 years, Mulligan appeared frequently
in films and on the Broadway stage. He portrayed a Hollywood
producer in the 1981 Blake Edwards farce, ``S.O.B.,'' which also
starred Julie Andrews and William Holden.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan was also featured in ``The Undefeated'' (1969) with
John Wayne, and portrayed Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer in
``Little Big Man'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   Among his other films were ``Love With the Proper Stranger''
(1964), ``The Group'' (1966), ``The Big Bus'' (1976) and ``Trail of
the Pink Panther'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway in 1982, Mulligan starred with Suzanne Pleshette in
``Special Occasions,'' Bernard Slade's two-character play about a
divorced couple who keep meeting over a period of time. He also
starred on Broadway with Marlo Thomas in a 1974 Herb Gardner
comedy, ``Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   He was best known for his roles on ``Soap'' from 1977 to 1981
and on ``Empty Nest'' from 1988 to 1995. On the former, he played
Burt Campbell, a lovable screwball who was stepfather to the
character played by Billy Crystal. And on ``Empty Nest,'' a spinoff
of ``The Golden Girls,'' Mulligan played Dr. Harry Weston, a
widower with three grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly different from my role on `Soap,''' Mulligan
told The Associated Press in 1988. ``This guy's a good doctor who
cares deeply about his patients. He's a good fellow trying to take
care of his daughters. His wife died 18 months ago, and he still
can't take the ring off.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 1980 Emmy for ``Soap'' and the 1989 Emmy for ``Empty
Nest,'' each in the category of outstanding lead actor in a comedy,
Mulligan won a 1989 Golden Globe for ``Empty Nest'' for best
performance by an actor in a television series.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared in episodes of ``The Twilight Zone,''
``Charlie's Angels,'' ``The Partridge Family,'' ``Bonanza'' and
``Rat Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan, who was born in the Bronx on Nov. 13, 1932, planned on
becoming a priest before he decided to study playwriting at
Columbia University. According to Julian Myers, his longtime
publicist and a friend, it was playwriting that led Mulligan into
acting. Myers said that not long after Mulligan finished his
studies, he drove to Florida to show one of his plays to the
director of a playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived to find the director in the midst of rehearsals. And,
Myers said, ``The director said, `You'd better try out for this
role.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan was married and divorced four times.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, James, of West Lebanon, N.H., and two
brothers, James, of North Dakota, and Robert, of Connecticut, the
director of films like ``Fear Strikes Out'' and ``To Kill a
Mockingbird.''

U.S. BEARS UP IN SEMIFINAL LOSS TO RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It started off as a mismatch, as the
Russians, with eight players on their women's volleyball roster
taller than the United States' tallest player, were connecting on
one spike after another and blocking every shot that came their
way.
</P>
<P>
   And at the conclusion of the semifinal proceedings Thursday
night, two of the youngest American performers, Logan Tom and Kerri
Walsh, wept. The rest of their teammates were similarly distraught.
</P>
<P>
   Not, mind you, because they were embarrassed by the Russians,
ranked second in the world behind Cuba and undefeated in these
Games. They were downcast because they felt they should have beaten
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   And, for a tantalizing few moments in the decisive fifth game of
what turned into a thrilling match, it seemed that the ol'
David-Goliath saga would repeat itself as the Americans actually
held a 7-6 lead and had the momentum and the crowd at the Sydney
Entertainment Center solidly on their side.
</P>
<P>
   But then harsh reality set in _ i.e., the Russians' overwhelming
height advantage _ and the gallant Americans finally unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just let it get away,'' said Danielle Scott after the
Russians pulled away in that final game and emerged with a 25-15,
23-25, 25-15, 26-28, 15-8 victory that almost caused their volatile
coach, Nikolai Karpol, a nervous breakdown. ``We're very
disappointed. We wanted to win the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't come up with the defensive stops in that last
game, and they did,'' said Walsh. ``We had to play a great game to
beat them and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans might not have played extraordinarily well, but
they played with a fierce determination and did something only Cuba
has been able to do in this tournament _ extend the Russians to
five games.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. faced match point twice in the fourth game _ it trailed
at one point 15-9 _ but somehow avoided certain defeat with clutch
shots by Scott and Tom and terrific defensive plays by Scott, Walsh
and Heather Brown.
</P>
<P>
   At this juncture, the crowd, composed of a lot of Brazilian fans
who had watched their team beaten earlier by Cuba, was cheering
loudly for the heavily underdog Americans. And Karpol, sort of a
Russian version of Bobby Knight, was stomping around the sidelines,
screaming at his women for not being able to put away the U.S.
team.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Karpol's eruption, which inspired boos, was
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had an overwhelming frontline advantage with
6-foot-4 Elena Godina, their best player, 6-3 Evguenia Artamonova
and 6-3 Anastassia Belikova _ they combined for 61 kills _ and four
of their players had powerful jump serves.
</P>
<P>
   They easily should have disposed of an American team that not
only lacked size _ Danielle Scott (a team-high 16 kills) was its
tallest player at 6-2 _ but also offensive cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. women didn't lack resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the Russians credit,'' U.S. coach Mick Haley
said. ``They're good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are good, but the Americans weren't bad, either,
despite their obvious shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I would have played a better game,'' said Tara
Cross-Battle, who contributed a couple of big blocks in that tense
fourth game that was decided on a Logan Tom kill. ``. . .Now we
just have to concentrate on winning the bronze medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will play Brazil Saturday for that honor, but,
clearly, the American players thought for a time Thursday night
that they were destined to meet Cuba for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it our best,'' said Cross-Battle. ``We left our hearts
on the court.''
