<HEADLINE> J&AMP;J Halts Allergy Drug Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sepracor's stock plunged 15 percent today after  
the pharmaceutical firm disclosed that Johnson &AMP; Johnson is pulling 
out of a project to co-develop an experimental hay fever drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Sepracor, which specializes in making safer versions of existing  
drugs, said it was continuing advanced human trials of 
norastemizole, a nasal allergy medicine closely related to J&AMP;J's 
drug Hismanal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Hismanal have lagged in the last few years, partly  
because of concerns about cardiac side effects. As a result, 
Hismanal's market share has fallen from 40 percent in 1993 to less 
than 3 percent today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the contributions it has made to the project already,  
J&AMP;J will still get royalties from the new drug that Marlborough, 
Mass.-based Sepracor is developing. But J&AMP;J could have gained 50 
percent of the profits if it decided to stay on board and 
eventually co-promote the experimental antihistamine. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sepracor executive acknowledged that not having J&AMP;J's  
marketing muscle behind the new drug could be a setback. But the 
company said human trials are nearly done, and it will apply for 
FDA approval next year. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J said its decision was based on an economic analysis, said  
spokesman John McKeegan. ``We had the choice to co-develop and 
co-market the drug, or step back and just take the royalties,'' he 
said. ``We just chose to take the royalties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J does not sell any other prescription allergy drugs besides  
Hismanal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sepracor has the option to use another drug maker to help it  
with marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a temporary setback for Sepracor,'' said Sergio  
Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Sepracor's stock slipped $13.18 or 15 percent to $78.75 on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. J&AMP;J fell $2.06 1/4 to $92.87 1/2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Mission Limits Air Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- The Pentagon's annual air  
extravaganza is missing a few planes, including giant C-17 
transports and F-117 stealth jets, that are too busy over the skies 
of Yugoslavia to join the show. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional stress on their units, heavily engaged in action  
over the Balkans and the Middle East, prompted Air Force commanders 
to recommend that the annual joint services display be canceled 
this year. They were overruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment, our men and women are engaged in the  
largest military operation in Europe since World War II,'' Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the opening ceremony, Cohen thanked the military for  
``standing up to brutality in the Balkans'' and said troop morale 
remains high despite the strain of ongoing operations over 
Yugoslavia and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Johnny Whitaker, a spokesman for the Air Force, said  
the service had been concerned about increasing the stress on its 
people and planes by having to allocate them to the event. Also, 
the service's showcase aerobatics team, the Thunderbirds, has been 
grounded since a mishap last month in which two of the planes 
touched wingtips in flight and could not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, the Department of Defense weighed all that and  
decided to go on with the show, although it has been scaled down 
somewhat,'' Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The open house, the biggest of its kind in the nation, will  
feature unprecedented security because of fears of anti-war 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The war is the main reason,'' said Lt. Col. Ray Neal, one of  
the organizers. ``The U.S. military is in a little higher threat 
condition than we would normally be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of military policemen has been significantly beefed  
up and some aircraft, such as the B-52 and B-1 bombers, are 
off-limits to visitors. Signs posted around them warn that guards 
are authorized to use ``deadly force'' against transgressors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, hammer-wielding peace activists attacked a parked  
B-52 and poured vials of human blood on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 700,000 to 800,000 visitors are expected to tour the show  
this weekend, Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike previous years, when crowds picnicked in the shade of  
the planes on display, visitors will not be allowed to bring food 
and drink coolers, and their backpacks will be subject to random 
searches by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too easy to conceal things there,'' said Capt. Dave Teal,  
another organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included in the lineup are the C-17 and C-9 jet transports,  
along with the giant KC-10 refueling tankers. Also absent is the 
F-117 stealth fighter, which has borne the burden of the early 
attacks on Yugoslavia, and the U-2 spy planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at 80 percent of status,'' Teal said. ``We're missing a  
lot of cargo and mobility aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many of the types being used over Yugoslavia and Iraq are  
abundantly represented. 
</P>
<P>
	An A-10 Warthog ground attack jet performed aerobatics above the  
crowds Friday, and FA-18 Hornets and F-15 Eagles were prominently 
featured. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more Hornets here than you can shake a stick at,''  
said Capt. Gary Schwindt, the pilot of a Canadian CF-18, an export 
version of the Hornet and the only foreign warplane on display. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very interesting show with an unusual number and  
variety of planes,'' said his co-pilot, Capt. Steve Chadwick, as he 
surveyed the flight line. The two men flew down from their base at 
Bagotville, Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	The Armed Services Day open house offers a wide-ranging display  
of planes, tanks, artillery, light naval craft, and other military 
equipment and is intended to showcase the latest technology 
available to the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's show was kicked off by the Army's Golden Knights  
parachute team. They were followed by a mass jump by some 320 
troops from the 82nd Airborne Division.

	Duma Voting on Impeachment Motion  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Communist lawmakers accused Boris Yeltsin of  
destroying Russia amid signs today that an impeachment vote could 
be close despite opposition claims of certain success. The lower 
chamber of parliament, the State Duma, began to vote today on 
whether to indict Yeltsin on any of five impeachment charges they 
had debated for the past two days. A positive vote on any of the 
five charges would start a complicated and lengthy process to 
remove Yeltsin from office. Grigory Yavlinsky, head of a liberal 
bloc that is expected to vote for impeachment on one count, lashed 
out at the Communists, saying they were responsible for the 
destruction of Russia.

	NATO Admits Civilian Attack

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO confirmed today that it  
attacked a Kosovo village where Serbian media reported scores of 
ethnic Albanian refugees were killed and alliance planes pounded 
Kosovo in what the Yugoslav state news agency termed ``ceaseless'' 
raids. Yugoslav media reported that 84 people were killed after 
NATO jets attacked Korisa, where 500 ethnic Albanians were spending 
the night. NATO called the village ``a legitimate military 
target,'' saying it was a military camp and command post. NATO 
spokesman Jamie Shea suggested that the refugees may have been used 
as human shields to protect military equipment deployed in the 
village.

	Chinese Banker Picked To Lead Macau

<P>
	MACAU (AP) -- A banker educated in Canada won a landslide victory  
today to become the first Chinese to lead the tiny enclave of Macau 
in more than four centuries, the final step before the territory 
returns to China's control. Edmund Ho defeated Stanley Au, also a 
local banker, in the historic election to lead the peninsula which 
covers 8 1/2 square miles at the tip of south China. The landmark vote 
is the last major political event before Macau, the oldest European 
settlement in Asia, returns Chinese rule for the first time in 442 
years.

	Deadlock Over IRA Arms Persists  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British and Irish governments pledged today to  
pressure all the main Northern Ireland parties after a marathon 
negotiating session failed to break the deadlock over IRA arms. 
Both governments, however, said they left feeling more optimistic 
about resolving the peace process. The 10 hours of talks in British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair's office ended yesterday without an 
agreement to form the compromise Protestant-Catholic government. 
``There will be extensive contact continuing between Downing 
Street, Dublin and all the parties through the weekend,'' a 
spokesman for Blair's office said today.

	Norplant Said To Work on Settlement

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The makers of Norplant are negotiating a national  
settlement with about 40,000 women who say the birth control device 
injured them, The Dallas Morning News reported today. The paper 
quoted lawyers who said the deal could be worth $100 million. 
Norplant is made of six silicone rods filled with a synthetic 
hormone and is intended to protect users from pregnancy for about 
five years. Users have blamed it for irregular menstrual cycles, 
weight gain, headaches and depression. The lawsuits against 
Norplant maker American Home Products, involve about 30,000 users.

	Report Probes Minority Health Gap  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minorities lag behind whites in the United  
States on nearly every health measure, from life expectancy and 
disease rates to health insurance and access to care, according to 
a report documenting the widespread disparities released yesterday. 
The disparities are well-known among health professionals, who 
point to economics, health systems, racism and culture in trying to 
explain them. The report offers a collection of statistics. For 
example, a white boy born in 1996 has a life expectancy of 74 
years; a black boy's life expectancy is 66. For a white girl, it's 
nearly 80; for a black girl, just over 74.

	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- John Stockton hit a 23-foot jumper  
with seven-tenths of a second remaining as the Jazz stayed alive in 
the NBA playoffs with a 90-89 victory over the Sacramento Kings in 
a scrappy game Friday night. The victory evened the first-round 
series at two games apiece and sent it back to Salt Lake City for a 
decisive Game 5 on Sunday. Karl Malone had 23 points and 16 
rebounds, and Shandon Anderson had eight points in the final 90 
seconds as the Jazz rallied.

<HEADLINE> Federal Appeals Court Judge Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Judge John Minor Wisdom, the last survivor of  
the federal appeals court that forced the Deep South to give up 
segregation, died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom would have turned 94 on Monday. He had open-heart surgery  
in 1989, but 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals spokeswoman Denise 
Estopinal said she was not sure of the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, while Martin Luther King was marshaling marchers  
and forcing the nation to reckon with the rights of its black 
citizens, Wisdom and his fellow federal judges issued a series of 
rulings forcing the Deep South to abolish its segregated society. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican appointed to the court by President Dwight  
Eisenhower, he wrote decisions that helped open the doors of the 
University of Mississippi to James Meredith and sow the seeds of 
affirmative action. He fleshed out the 1954 Supreme Court decision 
that called for desegregating schools ``with all deliberate 
speed,'' and expanded it beyond education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it was a period of great social unrest and  
upheaval,'' U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman, a clerk for Wisdom 
in the 1950s, recalled Saturday. ``The Supreme Court had left it to 
the district courts and courts of appeal to define `with all 
deliberate speed.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Former 5th Circuit clerk Gilbert Ganucheau remembered storing  
large cardboard boxes full of hate mail that arrived at the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented a new breed of white judicial leadership, and  
he must be looked upon as a brave and courageous member of the 
bench who helped tear down the walls of segregation and the walls 
of racial discrimination,'' U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a veteran 
of the civil rights movement, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom and three fellow members of the 5th Circuit Court of  
Appeals were called ``The Four'' by an outraged fellow judge who 
said they had destroyed the South. The others were Elbert Tuttle of 
Atlanta, John Brown of Houston and Richard Rives of Montgomery, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	They issued landmark decisions that struck down the barriers of  
discrimination in voting, jury selection and employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the 5th Circuit prevented a second civil war,'' Wisdom  
once said. ``If we hadn't made people obey the laws of this 
country, I think there would have been a lot more people killed, a 
lot more people hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four decisions written by Wisdom in 1965-67, changed the  
plodding pace of Southern school boards into a single system that 
as he wrote consisted of ``not white or Negro schools -- just 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th Circuit helped persuade extremists on both sides to  
avoid violence, said Nicholas Katzenbach, who was a deputy U.S. 
attorney general in the Kennedy administration and attorney general 
in the Johnson administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very, very serious situation, hard perhaps to imagine  
today on that particular issue,'' Katzenbach said in a 1994 
Associated Press interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom considered a 1966 ruling in the case U.S. vs. Jefferson  
County (Ala.) Board of Education to be his most important. It 
provided the legal grounds for what is now known as affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Wisdom received a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the  
nation's highest civilian award. The following year, the 5th 
Circuit Court of Appeals building was renamed in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom, born in 1905, grew up as part of the power structure he  
later helped reform. His father was a New Orleans aristocrat, a 
prominent cotton broker and insurance executive, and a member of 
the White League that fought to overthrow the integrated city 
government established during Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Republican Party while he was still at Tulane Law  
School, as a revolt from Huey P. Long's dictatorship, which he saw 
as a threat to democratic principles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Wisdom was chairman of a Southern group campaigning for  
Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower named Wisdom to the 5th Circuit in 
1957, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
``separate but equal'' public schools were not equal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom took senior status -- meaning semi-retirement -- in 1977, a  
few months short of 20 years on the court, but he continued to hear 
cases as a senior judge into his 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, Wisdom married Bonnie Stewart Mathews,  
great-granddaughter of a Louisiana Supreme Court judge who ruled in 
1837 that a minor slave who had been taken to France, where slavery 
was illegal, could not be returned to slavery after leaving France. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife, his is survived by two daughters, Kathleen and  
Penelope.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Leaders To Fight Fla. Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- NAACP leaders from around the country pledged  
Saturday to fight Florida's school voucher program and launch a 
campaign to defeat an anti-affirmative crusade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vouchers siphon off money from public education,'' said New  
York NAACP Chapter President Hazel Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors of the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People promised legal and legislative aid to 
the Florida chapter to help try and overturn the state's plan to 
give parents money to send children to schools of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature earlier this year  
passed the nation's first statewide school-choice law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is the backbone for us, so we really have to monitor  
this new language -- vouchers, charters, magnets,'' Ms. Dukes said. 
``All schools should be magnets. Public education is a civil rights 
issue. If a person wants to send their children to private school, 
they must pay for it. You can't use public money for private 
education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP leaders also agreed to fight hate crimes, police brutality  
and racial profiling -- police targeting blacks because of their 
race -- during the three-day meeting that ended Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization pledged $50,000 to fight the anti-affirmative  
action campaign of black California businessman Ward Connerly. 
Connerly wants voters there to cast their ballots to end 
affirmative action in public contracting, education and employment.

<HEADLINE> Poll Explores Faith in U.S. Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black Americans have far less confidence in  
state and local courts than their fellow citizens do, a new 
nationwide survey suggests. Surprisingly, Hispanics expressed 
greater overall satisfaction than non-Hispanic whites in the 
performance of courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opinion is divided sharply across racial lines,'' said Frank  
Bennack Jr., president of The Hearst Corporation, which funded the 
survey for the National Center for State Courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consensus is that the courts protect our constitutional  
rights, and that they are honest and fair. But there is also an 
overwhelming belief that equal justice under the law is more equal 
to some than to others,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey results, made public Friday at a conference studying  
public perceptions of courts, indicate that 68 percent of blacks 
believe ``people like them'' are treated worse than others in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, only 33 percent of Hispanics said people in their  
own ethnic group received worse treatment than others from the 
courts. More non-Hispanic whites (47 percent) and blacks (60 
percent) said they think Hispanics receive less than equitable 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	About 42 percent of Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites believe  
blacks receive worse treatment, the survey indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hispanics, 33 percent said they strongly agreed with the  
statement that courts make reasonable efforts to ensure all 
litigants get adequate legal help. Only 29 percent of non-Hispanic 
whites and 27 percent of blacks said the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was based on 1,826 interviews conducted between Jan.  
13 and Feb. 15. About 1,200 people were randomly chosen. An 
additional 300 Hispanics and 300 blacks were selected ``to ensure 
that the findings reflect the voices of the major groups in 
American society,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sample was weighted so the three groups were represented in  
the same proportion as in American society -- 12 percent black and 
13 percent Hispanic and 72 percent whites and others. The survey 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 85 percent of Americans believe courts protect criminal  
defendants' constitutional rights, and only 18 percent prefer that 
a judge ignore the law to ensure a defendant's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But 81 percent also say they believe judges' decisions are  
influenced by political considerations, and 78 percent agreed with 
a statement saying elected judges ``are influenced by having to 
raise campaign funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans -- 80 percent -- also believe that legal disputes  
``are not resolved in a timely manner.'' Sixty-eight percent 
disagreed with the statement ``it is affordable to bring a case to 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And 53 percent disagreed with this statement: ``The media's  
portrayal of courts is mostly accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey's results regarding minorities track the findings of  
a poll commissioned by the American Bar Association last August. It 
found that many Americans think the nation's courts do not provide 
equal justice for racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	ABA President Philip Anderson, a lawyer from Little Rock, Ark.,  
said then that his organization ``will intensify our efforts to 
eradicate gender and racial bias in our courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference at which the new survey was released is  
jointly sponsored by the ABA, the League of Women Voters, the

<HEADLINE> Poll: Women's Sports Making Strides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women athletes and coaches are making  
significant progress in college athletics, but disparities in 
participation and financing for their teams persist, according to a 
survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey covered the 1997-98 academic year. The analysis was  
based on reports, prepared under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure 
Act, from 306 of the 310 NCAA Division I member schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Its found that 40 percent of athletes were women, a five percent  
increase from 1996-97, and women received 40 percent of 
athletic-scholarship budgets, a 14 percent rise from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But participation by women in sports trailed enrollment rates of  
women at many colleges. Nationally, women constituted 53 percent of 
the undergraduates at Division I schools, but only 40 percent of 
their athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools with the greatest disparity of women's athletic  
participation in 1997-98 were Murray State, Southern University, 
Drake, Southwestern Louisiana, Marshall, Chicago State, 
Tennessee-Martin, Southern Mississippi, Western Kentucky and Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	At Murray State, women made up 55 percent of the students but  
only 18 percent of the athletes. At Southern, 59 percent of all 
students were women, but only 23 percent of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools awarding the least-proportional share of scholarships to  
women athletes were Vanderbilt, Miami of Ohio, Richmond, Eastern 
Washington and Colorado. Miami, which announced this year it was 
dropping three men's sports to comply with Title IX, awarded only 
32 percent of its athletic-scholarship budget to women, who 
represented 45 percent of the university's athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches of women's teams received only 28 percent of total  
salary expenditures on coaches, the survey found. Every Division I 
school in the survey paid the coaches of men's teams more than the 
coaches of women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 61 schools spent more than one-third of their salary  
budgets on women coaches. Forty-one schools spent less than 20 
percent on women's coaches, including Rice, East Carolina and 
Clemson. At Rice, only eight percent of coaching salaries went to 
the coaches of women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that women's sports received only 32  
percent of recruiting budgets. At 25 schools, women's teams 
received less than 20 percent of total recruiting budgets. Among 
them were Prairie View A&AMP;M, Norfolk State, Iona, Sam Houston State 
and Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's sports also received only 36 percent of total team  
operating budgets. Excluding the military academies, the colleges 
with the smallest women's team budgets, proportionally, were 
Louisville, Cincinnati, Alcorn State, Southwestern Louisiana and 
Memphis.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Are Desperate For a Win / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Bruins, trailing Buffalo 3-1 in their  
best-of-seven Stanley Cup playoff, need a win Sunday to stay alive. 
But many Boston players were obviously discouraged after Friday 
night's 3-0 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an embarrassing game,'' said Bruins forward Jason  
Allison, his head sunk low after practice Saturday. ``We outplayed 
them in Game 1 and Game 3, but I couldn't tell you what happened 
last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Things will hopefully work out,'' Allison added.  
</P>
<P>
	But if history has anything to do with it, the Bruins chances  
for success are slim. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of the 18 previous series the Bruins trailed 3-1, they  
never came back to win. Only three times in those situations has 
Boston managed to win a second game and the Bruins have never come 
back to tie any of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem in this series stems from the Bruins lack of  
offense, which was most evident in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres launched 39 shots to the Bruins' 24 -- including  
Buffalo's 16 to Boston's four in the first period. By all accounts, 
Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe played an outstanding game. But Buffalo 
goalie Dominik Hasek was better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to know that the goaltender can't do it all  
himself,'' Bruins defenseman Kyle McLaren said. ``We have to have a 
balance of offense and defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how do the Bruins correct the problem?  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to put the puck in the net,'' Bruins coach Pat Burns  
said simply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we have to play better than we did last night,''  
Dafoe said. ``Hopefully, we can get the first goal. Scoring the 
first goal in a hockey game changes everything -- not to mention 
this Hasek Mystery we've had the past five periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has not allowed a goal in the past five periods and  
recorded a team-record fifth playoff shutout of his career on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	And while many Bruins players said they need to put Friday  
night's game behind them, Hasek said the win was likely Buffalo's 
best game in the playoffs, his easiest and definitely one 
performance he wants the Sabres to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We outplayed them, outskated them, outshot them,'' Hasek said.  
``I don't know if we can get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo forward Dixon Ward agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to try to put together the same kind of effort for  
Sunday,'' Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	But no playoff victory on the road is easy, and the Sabres  
expect to meet a strong Bruins team with home-ice advantage on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always say the fourth win is the toughest to get,''  
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``(But) you would expect them to give 
it everything they've got in their own building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruins forward Joe Thornton -- who will play Sunday despite  
missing much of Friday's game after being hit in the head -- said 
Boston will pull out all the stops on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just desperate right now,'' Thornton said. ``We got to  
do anything we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren agreed, adding that he was not ready for summer vacation  
to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be home on Monday saying we could've,  
should've,'' McLaren said. ``I want to be on a plane to Buffalo.''

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jaime Moreno, A.J. Wood and Carlos  
Llamosa scored goals during the shootout period Saturday night, 
giving D.C. United a 4-3 victory over Kansas City in Major League 
Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter and Carey Talley each scored second-half goals as  
D.C. United overcame Kansas City's 3-1 halftime lead. D.C. United 
scored on all three of its extra-period shots while blanking the 
Wizards.

	Midfielder Chris Henderson scored the first goal in the 13th  
minute off a pass from Takawira to give Kansas City a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	DC United answered when Moreno passed to Wood, who drilled the  
ball into the right side of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Klein in the 32nd minute and Preki in the 34th gave Kansas  
City a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 62nd minute, Ben Olsen dribbled down the right flank and  
passed to Lassiter, who scored against Wizards goalie Chris Snitko. 
Talley then drilled a 30-yard shot over Snitko's hand in the 82nd 
minute, tying the game at 3 and forcing the shootout.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Might Get New Fenway Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fenway Park, the oldest and smallest ballpark in  
the country, may soon be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox unveiled a plan Saturday to replace the  
historic park in 2003 with a similar but roomier ballpark across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed stadium would have about 35 percent more space and  
11,000 more seats, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the estimated $550 million project, most of the  
87-year-old Fenway Park -- including the Green Monster wall in left 
field -- would be preserved and turned into a public park adjoining 
the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	John Harrington, the team's chief executive officer, said at a  
news conference at Fenway that the proposed stadium would improve 
facilities for players and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what the Red Sox mean to the people of New England, and  
I know Fenway Park is part of that,'' Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he insisted the move was necessary because the current park  
is crumbling and the team needs the facilities -- and revenue -- 
expected to accompany the upgrade. The new stadium would 
accommodate one million more spectators a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other improvements at the proposed stadium, which officials said  
would also be called Fenway Park, would include about 100 luxury 
boxes, at least 5,000 premium club seats, upgraded concession 
areas, wider seats and bigger aisles. 
</P>
<P>
	The field dimensions would remain virtually the same.  
</P>
<P>
	Current estimates place the cost of the ballpark around $350  
million, with more than $200 million in additional costs that 
include building new parking garages, preserving the old Fenway and 
acquiring the plot of land now covered with warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the team has not completed a plan to finance the  
park. Funding will involve negotiations between the team, the city 
and the state, said Boston Redevelopment Authority Director Thomas 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a very, very early stage,'' O'Brien cautioned. ``But  
I think all the parties -- residents, the team, state officials and 
others -- see this as an opportunity for us to sit at one table and 
see if we can work out a plan that offers an improvement over what 
exists today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they could preserve the tradition of Fenway that would be  
fantastic,'' Red Sox slugger Nomar Garciaparra said Saturday in 
Toronto. ``I just hope they do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the Red Sox players agree to preserve the tradition-rich  
park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time they did it,'' said pitcher Pedro Martinez.  
``It's like an old man who passes away; you have to let go. 
Everything has to go at some point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 33,871 seats, Fenway Park is the smallest stadium in the  
major leagues. It is also the oldest, having opened on April 20, 
1912.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Adds Preakness to Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Charismatic and Chris Antley, the ex-claimer  
and the comeback kid, are on the threshold of winning the Triple 
Crown after winning the Preakness on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Guiding the unlikely pair on their journey is trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas, an old hand at winning Triple Crown races, although he's 
never trained a Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can win it,'' Lukas said after the Kentucky Derby  
winner took control at the head of the stretch at Pimlico and then 
held off Menifee for a 1 1/2-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Bob and Beverly Lewis before the Kentucky Derby, `I  
don't know how well we'll do in the first two, but I like our 
chances in the Belmont.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby and Preakness certainly have been a fairy tale ride  
for the 33-year-old Antley, who tested positive for marijuana and 
cocaine in 1988, and left racing in September 1997 because of 
weight problems and depression. He began the attempt to revive his 
career in February, the same month that Charismatic ran for a 
$62,500 claiming tag at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are telling me, `Smile and be joyous,''' Antley said.  
``I'm trying to take it all in. This is special. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very charismatic!''  
</P>
<P>
	The strapping chestnut who was racing for the fourth time in 42  
days looked like a winner in the post parade as he pranced on his 
toes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the race, he was back in the pack down the backstretch and  
then made a tremendous move on the final turn that carried him into 
the lead past stablemate Cat Thief and Kimberlite Pipe turning for 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne and I spoke this morning,'' Antley said. ``The race set  
up pretty much like we expected. Everything went well -- he ran a 
superb race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Derby, Charismatic went off at 31-1 and, despite his  
victory in that grueling race, was sent off at 8-1 on this cool, 
sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic's reputation has suffered because he was put in  
claiming races twice -- the last on Feb. 11. On that day, anyone 
could have purchased him for $62,500. 
</P>
<P>
	While the victory had to surprise most of the crowd, Lukas had  
said all week that he wouldn't be surprised if Charismatic did it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Chris, `This is as good as human hands can make him.  
Let's take advantage of every step,''' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic gives Lukas his first shot at training a Triple  
Crown champion. The trainer, however, has won all three races the 
same year. That was with Thunder Gulch, who won the Kentucky Derby 
and Belmont, and Timber Country, winner of the Preakness, in 1995. 
Lukas has won 12 Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bob and Beverly Lewis, who bought Charismatic for $200,000  
as a weanling, it will be a second chance at owning a Triple Crown 
champion. They owned Silver Charm, who failed when he finished 
second in the Belmont in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had just great hopes and anticipation, and they were  
fulfilled in every way here,'' Bob Lewis said. ``We're going down 
this road for a second time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beer distributor from Southern California turned 75 on  
Wednesday and said that while he doesn't acknowledge birthdays 
anymore, the Preakness victory was the present he'd hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for the Triple Crown twice in a lifetime,'' he  
said. ``How can a couple of country bumpkins from Newport Beach be 
so lucky?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic's second trip toward racing immortality unfolded in  
1:55 1-5 for the 1 3-16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	He paid $18.80, $7.60 and $5.80. Menifee, ridden by Pat Day,  
trying for a sixth Preakness victory, returned $3.60 and $3.20. 
Badge, a non-Derby starter ridden by Mike Luzzi, was $18.80 to show 
after finishing a head behind Menifee and 3 1/2 lengths ahead of 
Stephen Got Even. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish were Patience Game, Adonis, Cat  
Thief, Kimberlite Pipe, Valhol, Vicar, Torrid Sand and Worldly 
Manner. The filly Excellent Meeting, trying to give Baffert a third 
straight Preakness win, was pulled up on the final turn. Jockey 
Kent Desormeaux said she suffered an asthma attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lewis said he had put Charismatic in the claiming race on  
Feb. 11 because, ``quite frankly, I'd given up on the horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to salvage as much of that original $200,00  
investment as I could,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Charismatic's venture into the high-class claiming ranks,  
he earned a shot at the Kentucky Derby by finishing fourth in the 
Santa Anita Derby on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the colt holds his weight and recovers well after racing,  
Lukas decided to give him another start before the May 1 Derby, and 
he responded by winning the Lexington at Keeneland on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the win in the Derby, and now the victory that has put  
him on the verge of becoming the 12th Triple Crown winner and first 
since Affirmed in 19678. He will be the seventh to try for the 
Triple Crown since Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	While many handicappers and racing fans refused to give  
Charismatic his due, the colt seemed to have developed a sense of 
his own worth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a little bit of a strut to his step when he came off  
the track during the week,'' Lukas said. ``He was much more focused 
all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Antley was barely back to riding, Lukas picked him for  
Charismatic after the Lexington. He believed Antley, who had been a 
world-class rider, fit the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We picked him out, put him in the ball game, and he came  
through,'' Lukas, a former basketball coach, said. ``He hit the 
3-pointers every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Charismatic-Antley pairing ``is a nice little marriage, a  
nice combination,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic's stirring victory was the high point on a day that  
almost had a tragic low. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh race, a man got out of the infield, crossed the  
turf course and got onto the main track as eight horses thundered 
toward him. Somehow, they missed trampling him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was quickly apprehended by security personnel.  
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic broke from the No. 6 post -- he left from No. 16 in  
the Derby -- and was 10th after the first half mile as Cat Thief, 
Kimberlite Pipe and Vicar led the field around the clubhouse turn. 
</P>
<P>
	After three-quarters of a mile, Charismatic was still eighth.  
But on the turn, Antley sent him four horses wide, and he charged 
into the lead in the upper stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was one position ahead of Charismatic after  
three-quarters and then began his own charge that carried him into 
third with an eighth of a mile to go, a little more than three 
lengths behind Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too much to make up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I might have pulled the trigger a little soon, and  
then in the far turn, I got in a little tight and lost my position 
briefly,'' Day said. ``We got near the winner but couldn't make up 
any ground in the last 16th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was the favorite, as was the Elliott Walden-trained  
Victory Gallop, second in the Preakness last year. Walden now has 
four seconds in the last five Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
	``My horse had a good trip throughout,'' Walden said. ``He ran  
extremely well. Charismatic just handed it to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other three horses favored over Charismatic were Cat Thief,  
Worldly Manner and Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Excellent Meeting's breathing problems, Dr. Larry Bramledge,  
a veterinarian, said the filly just had ``a bad day today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She couldn't get her air. It's like asthma in people. The  
jockey didn't abuse her, and pulled her up. She walked back the 
barn on her own. She'll be all right,'' Bramledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic earned $650,000 from the $1 million purse and  
boosted his earnings to $1,928,064. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who became only the third trainer to win as many as five  
Preaknesses, said he plans to celebrate with milkshakes and 
cheeseburgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lukas has never trained a Triple Crown winner, he's got  
a Triple Crown watch, which he said he bought 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the colors of every Triple Crown winner on numbers 1  
through 11, but 12 o'clock high is blank. I want Bob and Beverly's 
green and gold to be on 12 o'clock high.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks, Heat Down to Wire ... Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- All four games have been lopsided, and yet the New  
York Knicks and Miami Heat are going down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	For the third year in a row, the bitter rivals will clash in a  
winner-take-all playoff game Sunday at Miami Arena. And for the 
third year in a row, a team will be shorthanded for the deciding 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks point guard Chris Childs missed practice Saturday because  
of a bruised right thigh, and he's unlikely to play in Game 5, 
coach Jeff Van Gundy said. That will mean more minutes for starter 
Charlie Ward, with seldom-used Rick Brunson his backup. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Patrick Ewing's minutes could be limited, although  
he's likely to play. The 36-year-old center has been hampered by a 
sore left Achilles' tendon that forced him to miss 12 games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The past two years, fights led to suspensions that affected the  
final game. Miami eliminated New York in Game 7 in 1997, when the 
Knicks were without Larry Johnson and John Starks. The Knicks beat 
the Heat in the deciding Game 5 last year, when Miami was without 
Alonzo Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no fights this year. There have been no close  
finishes, either. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, seeded eighth in the Eastern Conference, beat Miami by  
20 and 24 points. The top-seeded Heat won Game 2 by 10 points, and 
their 87-72 comeback victory Friday evened the uneven series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Sunday's game is going to be a blowout,''  
Miami's Voshon Lenard said. ``Both teams want to win real badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Game 4 left the Knicks in a precarious state emotionally as  
well as physically. They led 51-40 in the third quarter, then were 
outscored 47-21 the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost our poise,'' Knicks guard Allan Houston said. ``We  
kind of fell apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not guarding against it,'' Van Gundy said, ``you  
have the possibility of having a hangover that carries over from 
Game 4 to the start of Game 5. We can't get down or frustrated or 
unhappy that we're back in Miami. We have to look at it as an 
opportunity to play in a deciding game. Our guys have to turn their 
frustration and disappointment and anger into commitment that 
they'll do anything it takes to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More tangible are the Knicks' physical woes. Childs is their  
best perimeter defender, and his absence makes New York susceptible 
to a breakout game by Tim Hardaway, who showed signs of shaking his 
series-long shooting slump Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning becomes a bigger threat if the Knicks can't use Ewing,  
who has become increasingly hobbled during the series. He had just 
three points and one rebound in the second half of Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``His leg is getting sorer and sorer,'' Van Gundy said. ``I  
don't want him getting frustrated. It's a credit to him that he's 
going out there. There are a lot of great players who wouldn't even 
go out there and risk not looking as good as when they're at full 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't be who he is at the physical level he's at, but he  
can help us win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing is likely to play with the stakes so high. Van Gundy may  
be fired if the Knicks lose, and Pat Riley may dismantle the Heat 
if they lose, because they've advanced beyond the opening round 
just once in his four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat have been outshot, outscored and outrebounded in the  
series, and they were routed in Games 1 and 3. Nonetheless, Miami 
is one win from advancing to the second round against the winner of 
Sunday night's game between Atlanta and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some new life,'' Riley said. ``So we were humiliated  
twice. Sometimes when you get humbled, really humbled, it does 
wonders as far as what it takes for you to rise up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Knicks have been humbled, too, and the Heat's home-court  
advantage counts for little. New York has won four playoff games in 
Miami since 1997, including Game 1 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what they're capable of,'' Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a rivalry this heated, ything's possible Sunday -- even a  
close game.

<HEADLINE> Red Wing's Osgood Returns To Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Unless he encounters some sort of calamity before  
Sunday's game, Chris Osgood will be in goal when the Detroit Red 
Wings try to regain control of their NHL playoff series with the 
Colorado Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit coach Scotty Bowman, who dislikes disclosing any  
information that the opposition might use to its advantage, 
conceded that Osgood is his choice for Sunday's Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood, Detroit's regular goalie, suffered a sprained right knee  
in the final game of the Red Wings' first-round series with 
Anaheim. Bill Ranford played the first four games of the Colorado 
series, performing brilliantly in the first two games -- both wins 
in Denver -- and poorly in the last two -- a pair of losses in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, the 1990 NHL playoff MVP with Edmonton who was acquired  
as backup insurance last month from Tampa Bay, was replaced by 
rookie Norm Maracle in the second period of the last two games, 5-3 
and 6-2 losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Osgood showed up (Sunday) and couldn't play, then you'd  
have to make a game-time decision, either Ranford or Maracle,'' 
Bowman said on Saturday. ``But we're not thinking about that right 
now. We're thinking that Osgood is going to play. That's what we're 
planning for. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been able to practice the last four days, to move around  
and make saves. I think he looked pretty good (Saturday). 
Naturally, we wouldn't put him in unless he was close to 100 
percent. It's been three weeks since the injury, and that's a good 
time frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood, who allowed a total of only six goals in Detroit's  
four-game sweep of Anaheim in the first round, said, ``When you 
lose two games in the fashion we did at home when we didn't play 
very well at all, you hope to be one of the guys who gives the team 
a boost and energizes them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings center Igor Larionov also has returned to the ice  
since suffering a dislocated finger in Game 2. Wearing a specially 
fitted brace on his left hand, Larionov is expected to return for 
Game 6 Tuesday in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really painful, but it's important to get back,'' he  
said. ``When the series is on the line, you want to help the team. 
We'll see if the next two days can help me. Right now, shooting 
hard shots and taking hard passes are difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Red Wings won't be without their captain, Steve  
Yzerman, who leads the NHL with nine playoff goals. Yzerman was 
prepared to leave the team at a moment's notice to attend the birth 
of his third child, but his wife, Lisa, gave birth to a 7-pound, 
14-ounce daughter early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado has benefited from the return of Valeri Kamensky, who  
missed two months with a broken arm before bouncing back to play 
the last two games, scoring one goal and an assist and bolstering 
the Avalanche's depth. 
</P>
<P>
	With the two one-sided wins in Detroit, the Avalanche seized the  
momentum of the series after appearing ready to be swept following 
the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I can put into words what a crazy series this  
has been,'' said Avalanche rookie center Chris Drury, who scored 
goals in Games 3 and 4. ``They play great in our building. We play 
great in theirs. Now we have to try to win a game in our own, 
finally. We know it won't be easy, just based on the way we've 
played there in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avs are 1-4 at home in the postseason and 5-0 on the road.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep the momentum on our side,'' Avs goalie Patrick  
Roy said. ``We have to keep playing that way in our building now.''

<HEADLINE> Springer Fights' Validity in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Fist fights, chair throwing and hair pulling are  
staples of Jerry Springer's talk show. But is it real? That's the 
question Springer will have to answer June 4 at a Chicago city 
council committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman Edward Burke, a former policeman and chairman of the  
council's finance committee, says if the violence is genuine, 
Chicago police should enforce the law, cuff the guests and haul 
them off to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	If it's staged, Burke has suggested ``The Jerry Springer Show''  
should be required to obtain a city entertainment license. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke called for Springer's appearance before the council's  
Police and Fire Committee to determine whether authorities should 
be taking action to stop the brawls, a trademark of the popular 
syndicated TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	Security on the show is provided by off-duty Chicago police  
officers. Burke says those officers are required by state statute 
to make arrests if they see violations of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke threatened to subpoena Springer if he refused to testify.  
Springer, a former mayor of Cincinnati, agreed to appear June 4, 
his spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry was a member of a city council himself back in  
Cincinnati prior to becoming mayor,'' Linda Shafran, the 
spokeswoman, said. ``He respects the function of the city council, 
and he's accepted their invitation to speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman William Beavers, chairman of the council's police  
committee, said he is not surprised that it didn't come to a 
subpoena. ``He loves publicity, and this will just give him more of 
it,'' Beavers said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also believes the fighting on the show is bogus. ``You never  
see any blood,'' Beavers said. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, critics of the show say an admission by  
Springer that the violence is scripted could be valuable in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would show him as a liar and a fraud,'' said the Rev.  
Michael Phleger, a Chicago minister who has led a yearlong campaign 
against Springer. ``I think it would take the attraction off his 
show. I think he would lose audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer agreed to eliminate the fighting after numerous  
protests last year, but they returned when the show's ratings 
suffered.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Raises Funds in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton's weekend visit to  
Hollywood comes as the entertainment industry grapples with how to 
respond -- and who to blame -- for last month's high school massacre 
in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was scheduled to attend a dinner tonight that will  
generate some $2 million for fellow Democrats less than a week 
after complaining about too much violence coming out of Tinseltown. 
The hosts include Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David 
Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Spahn, political adviser to the three DreamWorks partners,  
said he sees nothing unusual about the president issuing the 
challenge to Hollywood one day, and accepting the industry's 
campaign money the next. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has taken a very balanced and constructive  
approach in the aftermath of Littleton,'' Spahn said. ``What we're 
not happy with is the scapegoating that comes from some of the 
Republican leaders in the House and Senate and frankly from members 
of the media. Attempting to blame or connect Hollywood to the 
violence of Littleton is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, he said, the ``fundamental bottom line issue is access  
to guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the aftermath of the shootings in Littleton, Colo.,  
that left 15 people dead, Clinton's attendance points to the 
influence the entertainment industry enjoys in politics and its 
deep pockets come election time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most politicians might feel a little bit peculiar about  
sucking up fund-raising dollars from the same people who blew them 
off a few days earlier, but Bill Clinton is not most politicians,'' 
said Republican commentator Dan Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the president met with entertainment industry  
lobbyists, clergy, children, parents and gun manufacturers, though 
executives from the film and music business declined to attend. 
Clinton challenged the makers of violent movies, video games and 
CDs to consider the potential consequences of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	At a fund-raising luncheon Friday in Seattle, Clinton did not  
single out the entertainment industry for responsibility. Still, he 
said, there was inconclusive proof that violence in entertainment 
affected children who were already vulnerable and anti-social. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 300 studies now which show that hours and hours and  
hours a week after years and years and years of watching sustained 
indiscriminate violence makes young people less sensitive to 
violence and to its consequences,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Senate Republicans did pass new restrictions on gun  
show sales, but Clinton said the provision was ``riddled with 
high-caliber loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was much agreement in the Senate on proposals directed at  
the entertainment industry. The Senate overwhelmingly approved a $2 
million federal study on the effects of entertainment products on 
young people, and authorized a federal investigation into movie 
studio marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analyst Sherri Bebitch Jeffe of Claremont Graduate  
University noted that Hollywood has a long history supporting the 
president, and that it continues now to back Democrats in part 
because ``there is not yet on the scene a viable alternative in the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is the mother's milk of politics,'' she said. ``It's as  
simple as that. It's the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 election, Clinton received $442,000 from TV and  
movie executives and their families, compared with $166,000 for 
Republican challenger Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment figures also generously donated to Clinton's legal  
defense fund during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Among those giving 
$10,000 were rock singer Don Henley, TV producer Paul Simms and 
former studio mogul Lew Wasserman. Actor Robert De Niro gave 
$5,000.

<HEADLINE> Play Looks Into Post-Soviet Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Kennedy Center Opera House seats 2,200  
people, but each night this week just 65 people got into any 
performance there. 
</P>
<P>
	Audience members entered through a narrow door to a stage rigged  
behind the scenes and walled off from the auditorium. They sat on 
backless benches, some even inside the action of an ultra-modern 
production of ``A Hotel Room in the Town of NN,'' a broad 
adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's comic novel of 150 years ago -- ``Dead 
Souls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the play, a Russian con man buys identification documents of  
dead serfs to sell to anyone who might think the serfs were still 
alive and able to work. (The czar freed Russia's serfs shortly 
before Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the 
United States in 1862.) 
</P>
<P>
	The play has two long monologues, both in Russian, with music  
and spectacular business more important than the other scraps of 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Shown for the first time in this country, the play gave  
Washington a rare glimpse into a theater now being revived after 70 
years of Communist control. Earlier this century, the ever popular 
plays of Anton Chekhov and the realistic method of director 
Konstantin Stanislavski helped transform American stage and screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking place in the con man's hotel room, the play shows him  
carefully shaving, plucking hair from his nose and -- in a dream -- 
wedding and bedding the governor's daughter. At that point 
Alexander Bakshi's musical score calls for ``an accompaniment of 
erotic female moans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No author is named in the program, which indicated only that it  
is ``adapted and directed by Valery Fokin.'' In an interview, Fokin 
was at a loss to name any recent Russian playwright likely to be 
produced in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russian theaters are packed,'' he said, ``but the interest (in  
the United States) is mostly in the production and interpretation 
of old material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence J. Wilker, president of the Kennedy Center, said this  
was the first of a series of Russian programs in its 1999-2000 
Millennium Season. There will also be performances by the Bolshoi 
Ballet and the Russian National Symphony Orchestra.

<HEADLINE> Columbus 2, New England 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Cunningham had a goal and an assist  
as the Columbus Crew beat the New England Revolution 2-0 Saturday 
night in the inaugural game in the first stadium built specifically 
for major professional soccer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham scored his third goal of the season 10 minutes into  
the game. Stern John scored the second goal in the 59th minute on a 
header from five yards off a cross into the box by Cunningham. Matt 
Kmosko also assisted on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	John set up the first goal in the $28.5 million stadium by  
stealing the ball at midfield and sending a pass to Cunningham who 
chested the ball down and made a quick turning shot from 12 yards 
out past the onrushing Walter Zenga. 
</P>
<P>
	An overflow crowd of 24,741 packed the most ambitious soccer  
facility built in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	One of New England's best chances came in the 26th minute when  
Paulo Dos Santos collected a ball that Crew goalkeeper Mark 
Dougherty punched away on a corner kick. But Dougherty was able to 
pull in Santos' shot from 30 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	One minute later, Johnny Torrez sent a hard shot from 18 yards  
out that Dougherty was able to save. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Max-Moore almost got New England on the scoreboard in the  
68th minute on a spinning volley from five yards that was stopped 
by Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty made five saves for his second shutout of the season  
and 41st victory of his career, one shy of Mark Dodd's MLS record.

<HEADLINE> Mutombo Guarantees Hawks Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Atlanta Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo  
predicts his team will win Sunday's decisive Game 5 against the 
Detroit Pistons. In fact, he's guaranteeing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo made his surprising forecast after the Hawks practiced  
Saturday, the morning after Atlanta's disastrous 103-82 blowout by 
the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Detroit's second straight rout after the Hawks had easily  
won the first two games at home in the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to win tomorrow night,'' a thoughtful  
Mutombo said, sitting on a chair after the workout at Life 
University in suburban Atlanta. Then his conviction got even 
firmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee a win,'' continued Mutombo, who dominated the  
Pistons in the opening two games. ``I can see it in my teammates' 
faces. There's a determination there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo averaged 22.5 points and 16 rebounds in 90-70 and 89-69  
victories before getting a total of only 16 points and 18 rebounds 
in the two losses at Auburn Hills. Detroit smothered the 7-foot-2 
Mutombo with double coverage in its 79-63 and 103-83 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played bad the last two games, but watching the tapes it  
was small errors that can be corrected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, who have played virtually the entire four games  
without starting forwards Alan Henderson and Chris Crawford, will 
be without both on Sunday. Henderson has an eye injury and Crawford 
a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, who had an MRI on Friday that indicated surgery might  
be needed correct his blurred vision, will have another MRI. In any 
event, he's lost for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford could be ready at some point during the second round of  
the postseason if the Hawks advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't control injuries. It's unfortunate,'' Coach Lenny  
Wilkens said. ``It's changed our rotation and guys (Grant Long and 
Ty Corbin) have had to come off the bench and start and it cuts our 
depth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, point guard Mookie Blaylock did not attend practice  
Saturday, remaining at home with a cold. He is expected to play 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sick in bed,'' Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said.  
``He's had a bad cold the last two days, but we expect him to be 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sunday's game will be played in Atlanta, it won't be at  
the Georgia Dome, where the Hawks won the first two games. It will 
be at Georgia Tech, because the Dome was booked for a Tommy James 
and the Shondells concert expected to run late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was 7-4 at Tech this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``For two years, we've been the only team in the NBA that has  
had to play in two arenas, and I don't like either one of them,'' 
Wilkens groused. ``But it is in Atlanta, and it will be our fans. 
It will be our court, so I feel like we'll be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Detroit has going for it is momentum and a couple of hot  
players -- Joe Dumars and Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, retiring when the playoffs end, scored 20 points Friday  
night, hitting 4-of-6 3-point baskets. Hill had 23 points, six 
rebounds and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still ready to retire,'' Dumars said. ``I'm just not ready  
to lose this series. I think we kind of took the momentum from 
them. But you never know. When you get to a Game 5, anything can 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the Pistons win, they would be only the sixth team in NBA  
history to come back from a 2-0 deficit to win a five-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks have never lost a series after going up 2-0, winning  
on six previous occasions. Atlanta's last 2-0 lead was the first 
round of the 1988 playoffs against Milwaukee. The Hawks won that 
series 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played well down there, we played well up here,'' Hill  
said, alluding to Auburn Hills, Mich. ``I think that both teams are 
going to play better than what they showed in the first few games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, now we can do what we aren't supposed to do and win  
on the road.''

<HEADLINE> Investigation Continues at Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators in the Columbine High  
School shooting are scanning e-mails and computer files of students 
who knew gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to determine if any 
of them aided or knew of their plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the students have voluntarily turned over their home  
computers to Jefferson County sheriff's officials, Lt. John 
Kiekbusch said. Search warrants have also been issued to America 
Online and other Internet service providers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some school district computers are also being searched.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has focused on up to 12 students who claim to  
be members of the ``Trench Coat Mafia,'' the school clique to which 
Klebold and Harris belonged. At least two have taken lie-detector 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives want to know who visited Harris' page on the World  
Wide Web, where he wrote about bomb-building and committing mass 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are looking for e-mails that may have been sent to or  
from the teenage gunmen in the days before the April 20 attack that 
killed 13 and injured 21. Klebold and Harris committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investigators said Friday they may finish their work  
in the school by June 1 when school officials say they need to get 
started preparing the building for fall classes.

<HEADLINE> Ali Child Graduates From UNLV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Maryum Ali was a bit worried her famous father  
would miss her big moment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The eldest child of former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali  
said she planned to instruct her father to stay focused during her 
graduation ceremony at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't say something, he'll be signing autographs while  
I'm walking across (the) stage,'' she said. ``I know him, and he 
just can't say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 friends and family members, including her father, were  
to attend the graduation ceremony. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stamp Compares Character to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom  
Menace'' director George Lucas wanted to give Terence Stamp tips on 
how to play the president of the universe, he didn't go far for a 
real-life model. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `He's a good man, but he's beleaguered -- a bit like  
Clinton,''' Stamp says in Saturday's New York Post. ``And that was 
before the scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stamp, 59, became a star in the early 1960s with ``Billy Budd,''  
``The Collector'' and ``Far From the Madding Crowd.'' The 
British-born actor went on to play a villain in two ``Superman'' 
movies. More recent credits include ``Bliss'' and ``The Adventures 
of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the ``Star Wars'' role wasn't a hard decision, once  
travel from Australia was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I said, `If they want to give me a first-class ticket on  
Singapore Air, I'll come over and play the president of the 
universe.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Stamp has completed two other upcoming films. In ``The Limey,''  
he plays a hot-headed ex-convict. In ``Bowfinger,'' he plays the 
leader of a cult that Eddie Murphy joins.

<HEADLINE> FBI Probing Border Patrol Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The FBI has investigated a report that a Border  
Patrol agent may have caused the drowning death of an illegal 
immigrant by firing a pellet gun at a raft used by three migrants 
to cross an irrigation canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Martinez, an assistant chief patrol agent in the Border  
Patrol's El Centro sector, confirmed the investigation. No victim 
has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations are extremely serious,'' said Bill  
Strassberger, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, which oversees the Border Patrol. ``This is something we 
have zero tolerance for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who was caught Friday trying to cross the border into  
Imperial County told authorities she saw an agent fire a pellet gun 
at a raft, causing it to flip when three passengers shifted their 
weight to one side. She said only two of the migrants made it to 
the concrete bank of the canal, near Calexico, more than 100 miles 
east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people have drowned so far this year trying to cross the  
canal, a heavily used route for illegal immigrants. U.S. officials 
have installed bright, stadium-style lights and motion detectors at 
several sections of the waterway to discourage crossings.

	Yeltsin Impeachment Fails  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin triumphed over his  
Communist foes today after lawmakers in the Russian parliament 
turned down five charges of impeachment, any one of which could 
ultimately have led to his removal from office. Communists in the 
hushed chamber looked stunned by the voting results. Some bowed 
their heads, slumping in their chairs. Yeltsin supporters -- 
generally considered moderates or liberals -- reacted quietly but 
with obvious relief. ``This whole show of impeaching the president 
has finished,'' said a Yeltsin spokesman. Communist leader Gennady 
Zyuganov angrily assailed those who had ``betrayed their country'' 
by voting against impeachment.

	Clinton Urges Cut in Movie Violence  
</P>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Saying ``there's still too much  
violence on our nation's screens, large and small,'' President 
Clinton today challenged the entertainment industry to ban guns 
from ads and movie previews, and do a better job of keeping kids 
away from R-rated movies. In his weekly radio address, the 
president applauded Hollywood for its voluntary ratings system for 
TV shows and the V-chip to enforce parents' decisions on what 
children may watch. But still, he said, ``By the age of 18, the 
typical American will see 40,000 dramatized murders.''

Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, Slovenia and host Ukraine signed a statement urged 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the peace plan 
drafted in Bonn, Germany, earlier this month. The plan calls for 
the deployment of armed international peacekeepers, the withdrawal 
of Serb forces from Kosovo, and substantial autonomy for Kosovo

minister dropped out of the race today, a move that could help 
boost the candidacy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's chief 
challenger. Azmi Bishara said he made the decision because he saw 
that his continued candidacy could hurt chances of toppling 
Netanyahu. Bishara, however, did not call on his constituency of 
Israeli Arab voters to support moderate opposition leader Ehud 
Barak. Bishara, an Arab Christian lawmaker, is an advocate of equal 
rights for Israel's 1 million Arab citizens.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Less than 5 percent of U.S. cancer patients take  
part in experiments to test new treatments, a figure at least four 
times lower than ideal to answer quickly the most pressing cancer 
questions, according to a survey released today. ``We need clinical 
trials to know what works and what doesn't,'' said Dr. Allen 
Lichter, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. 
The survey estimates that about 20 percent of all cancer patients 
are eligible to join tests. Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel of the National 
Institutes of Health, the study's primary author, said doctors 
should try to enroll the entire 20 percent.

the central industrial town of Cacak. Meanwhile, NATO says it was 
attacking a Serb military command post when it struck a Kosovo 
village where Yugoslavia reported 87 ethnic Albanians were killed. 
As the death toll rose, it remained unclear why the refugees -- 
apparent victims of NATO's most deadly bombing of civilians in the 
air campaign against Yugoslavia -- had stopped in the village of 
Korisa. NATO officials said they simply didn't know if the ethnic 
Albanians had been ordered or encouraged by Serbs to stop there.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Player Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico basketball player Damion  
Walker was charged with auto burglary and criminal damage for 
trying to break into a university vehicle, campus police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 22, was arrested Friday night after a witness alerted  
UNM police that two males were trying to enter a university van, 
said campus police spokesman Lt. Jay Daniels. Another man, Carnell 
White, 22, was also been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker and White were bonded out of jail Saturday, Daniels said.  
</P>
<P>
	The two were charged with breaking and entering, tampering with  
a vehicle and criminal damage, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels said officers who investigated the incident reported  
Walker and White were apparently trying to move the 
university-owned van because it was blocking Walker's car. The men 
had broken the window and were trying to enter the van when they 
were arrested, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobos coach Fran Fraschilla was out of town and could not be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Walker, a former McDonald's All American from  
Dallas, has had several traffic violations since transferring to 
New Mexico from Texas Christian after his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stopped Jan. 7 by an Albuquerque police officer on  
Interstate 40 for speeding and driving on a suspended license, 
according to court records. He was found guilty and ordered to pay 
$158 in fines and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also stopped Walker last December for allegedly making an  
illegal U-turn, driving on a suspended license and having no 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was suspended for two games last season by former Lobos  
coach Dave Bliss for violating team rules. Bliss would not say what 
rules Walker had violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker averaged 9.7 points and 4.5 rebounds a game last season.  
He was the Lobos' leading scorer with 21 points in a 78-56 loss to 
Connecticut in the second round of the NCAA tournament.

<HEADLINE> Dumars Going Out on High Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- His high, arcing jump shot was  
virtually unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars scored 33 points in the third game of the 1990 NBA  
Finals, leading the Detroit Pistons to a 2-1 lead over the Portland 
Trail Blazers. The celebration didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Dumars learned that his father had died earlier  
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars II had driven an 18-wheeler for the same company for  
34 years in Louisiana. He never missed a day of work in all that 
time, his son says -- and so, like father, like son. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars played in the next two games as the Pistons wrapped up  
their second straight championship. Then he went home and buried 
the father he cherished. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to do the right thing all the time,'' said Chuck  
Daly, the Pistons' coach at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	And he did it with a quiet brilliance.  
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, who turns 36 on May 24, has been with the Pistons longer  
than any other player. He is retiring as Detroit's leader with 
1,018 regular-season games played in 14 seasons. He topped 16,000 
career points this season, the 61st NBA player to reach the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got drafted, my dad said, `That's a pretty good  
job you've got there. Treat it with respect,''' Dumars said. ``I 
think it was good advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the good years and the lean years, Dumars always  
followed his father's words. 
</P>
<P>
	He played with the Bad Boys and was a key in the Pistons' two  
championships, earning the Most Valuable Player award in the 1989 
finals. Yet he never fought, never was fined. 
</P>
<P>
	He was perfectly happy to let his more flamboyant teammates like  
Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Vinnie Johnson and Dennis Rodman get 
all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe kept his nose clean,'' said Johnson, now a Pistons'  
broadcaster. ``But Joe had as much skill as anybody on that team. 
He just didn't like talking about himself. Joe was a model 
citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No longer as quick or strong, Dumars still was a factor in his  
final season. While the headlines most often went to Grant Hill, 
Dumars continued to contribute and helped the Pistons earn the No. 
5 seed in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	During his final regular-season home game, May 2 against  
Philadelphia, Dumars scored 15 points, including a 3-pointer and 
three free throws toward the end of the game in a 100-96 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a snot-nosed coach like me to be able to have coached Joe  
Dumars, I feel just very, very lucky,'' coach Alvin Gentry said. 
``I think he epitomizes what a pro athlete should be. He's got 
great character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Sixers' 23-year-old Allen Iverson, leader of the NBA's  
Generation X, praised Dumars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've a lot of respect for him as a player and as a man,'' said  
Iverson, who chatted with Dumars at midcourt during warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, whose 6-foot-3 listing might be a stretch, claims to  
have dunked the ball five times. Other than that, he has been a 
model of humility. He doesn't preen, prance or point. He doesn't 
talk trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought it was cool to do something and not turn  
somersaults,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was one of the fiercest defenders in NBA history,  
always drawing the opponents' best player. Michael Jordan once 
called Dumars the best defender he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	Others must have thought so, too. Dumars has been on the NBA's  
All-Defensive Team four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe showed up in big games as much as any player I've ever  
seen,'' said Daly, now coach of the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Pistons were on top and the Chicago Bulls were trying  
to knock them off, Dumars was the key to a defensive plan known as 
Jordan Rules. It wasn't complicated: force Jordan to his left, try 
to make him pass off instead of shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't perfect, either. In 22 playoff games against the  
Pistons from 1988-91, Jordan averaged 30 points, 6.7 rebounds and 
6.6 assists. And in 1991, of course, the Bulls finally eliminated 
Detroit in the playoffs and began their own historic run. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars named his first son Jordan, but claims it had nothing to  
do with his friendship with the ex-Bull. It was a family name that 
his wife, Debbie, liked. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars has played in six All-Star games. He has been All-NBA  
Second Team once and All-NBA Third Team twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've accomplished everything I wanted to accomplish, both on  
and off the court, individually and team-wise,'' Dumars said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars III, the youngest of seven children, was born and  
raised in Natchitoches, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Pistons scout Will Robinson saw Dumars playing for McNeese State  
while in Louisiana to watch some other players. He persuaded the 
Pistons to pick him in the 1985 draft with the 18th pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dumars arrived in Detroit, the Pistons already were loaded  
with guards. Isiah Thomas and John Long were starting and Johnson -- 
nicknamed the ``microwave'' because he heated up so fast -- was the 
first man off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, on Jan. 15, 1986, with the Pistons in a 4-15 slump,  
Dumars started in place of Long. He would remain there the rest of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell every rookie to savor the good moments and put the bad  
ones behind you as quickly as possible,'' Dumars said. 
</P>
<P>
	He leaves the sport in what has become the year of retirements.  
Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and John Elway all retired in the 
past five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard Gretzky talk about the daily grind in the summer,  
working out and trying to get ready for the grind of an 82-game 
season,'' Dumars said. ``I knew exactly what he was talking about. 
It doesn't appeal to me, anymore, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the right time. It's the right thing for me to do.''

<HEADLINE> Jefferson, Hemings Relatives Gather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) --Descendants of Thomas Jefferson and  
offspring of his slave Sally Hemings gathered at his plantation 
Saturday for the first time in 170 years and promised to stay 
close, whether or not they become official blood cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this is the beginning of a long relationship,'' said  
James Truscott, a white descendant of Jefferson's daughter Maria 
and vice president of the Jefferson family's Monticello 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The association, comprised of white Jefferson descendants, will  
debate at a private family meeting Sunday whether to accept 
Hemings' progeny as their blood cousins, allowing them to be buried 
at the family cemetery at Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, who became president in 1801, was accused publicly in  
1802 of being the father of several of Sally Hemings' children. 
Scholars have differed about whether to believe it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	A DNA study published in November said Jefferson may have  
fathered at least one of Hemings' children. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Saturday evening at Monticello, Jefferson's  
Blue Ridge mountaintop home, association president Bob Gillespie 
said the group's executive committee voted earlier in the day to 
study the Hemings membership issue for as long as a year. Some in 
the reunion crowd of about 250 people groaned in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Truscott's nephew, Lucian Truscott, was  
applauded loudly when he declared that the Hemings family should be 
acknowledged as true kin right away. He said he will press the 
issue at the family meeting in a Charlottesville hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	After the news conference, descendants from both sides stood  
together for a group photo on Monticello's steps. Later, they dined 
together at a historic tavern about a mile down the mountain from 
Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sunny afternoon on a majestic Blue Ridge mountaintop,  
the atmosphere was cordial as relatives shook hands, exchanged 
family stories and, in some cases, addresses for Christmas card 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going to be family, regardless of that the  
Monticello Association does,'' said Hemings descendant Shannon 
Lanier, 17, of Cincinnati. ``We've always known it, since we were 
kids, that we were family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this weekend is about an opportunity for individuals  
who share a common heritage -- and common ground at Monticello -- to 
come together and to get to know one another better,'' Jefferson 
Foundation President Dan Jordan told the families. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first time that the white and black descendants of  
Jefferson and Hemings gathered together at the founding father's 
plantation since Jan. 15, 1827, said Jordan, whose foundation runs 
Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
	On that day, sixth months after Jefferson died deeply in debt,  
130 plantation slaves and other possessions were sold at auction. 
Shortly thereafter Sally Hemings and five members of the Hemings 
family were freed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My kids will be reading about this in the history books,''  
said Hemings descendant Troy Harding, 17, of Chillicothe, Ohio, as 
he walked along Mulberry Row where Jefferson's slaves once lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanier said the resemblances between the family members were  
remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see facial features in them, and say, hey, you look just  
like my aunt,'' Lanier said. ``You can tell we're cousins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They walked together beside Jefferson's European-style alcove  
bed, covered with a crimson rose bedspread. The went through the 
underground stone passageway to Sally Hemings' tiny bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said the Jefferson-Hemings relationship ``is an American  
story,'' and Hemings descendant Shay Banks-Young, 54, of Columbus, 
Ohio, said it represents a chance to help heal race relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to begin mending bridges that broke down after  
generations and generations of slavery and segregation,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Saints Sign Their Only Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Ricky Williams got an $8.8 million signing  
bonus -- the biggest the New Orleans Saints have ever paid. He also 
signed a contract that could tie him to the team for eight years, 
the longest deal an NFL rookie has ever signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a super contract,'' Saints owner Tom Benson said.  
``Ricky's going to make lots of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will if he can do in the NFL what he did in college.  
</P>
<P>
	The contract, loaded with incentives, is worth between $11.1  
million and $68.4 million, contingent on performance. 
</P>
<P>
	If Williams plays as well as the Saints expect, his contract  
would be the most lucrative ever given a rookie. If he fails to 
reach goals set in incentive clauses, he will earn the league 
minimum for the next seven years: $175,000 in year one, increasing 
annually to reach $400,000 in year seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here a long time and do a lot of great  
things,'' Williams said after signing the deal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints swapped their six 1999 picks and selections in the  
first and third rounds next year to move up to No. 5 in the NFL 
draft last month so they could pick Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka labeled Williams the final piece of the puzzle,  
saying a first-class ball carrier was all he needed to make the 
Saints a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans has not had a winning season in six years, going  
6-10 each of Ditka's first two years. The Saints' offense was 28th 
in the league last season; the running game was last. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a decade since New Orleans has had a 1,000-yard  
rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to make Ricky an important component of our  
offense,'' Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams finished his career at Texas as the NCAA's career  
rushing leader with 6,279 yards. He set 20 NCAA rushing records, 
including most rushing yards, all-purpose yards, highest average 
per carry, rushing touchdowns, total touchdowns and points scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is heavily loaded with incentives.  
</P>
<P>
	There are 26 targets that could earn him $50,000 for each one  
reached, up to a cap of $500,000. Those incentives include rushing 
for an average of 4.5 yards per carry or better, 12 or more rushing 
touchdowns, 12 or more receiving touchdowns, scoring 76 points, 
gaining 1,601 yards in total offense and playing in 35 percent of 
the offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there are two escalator clauses that could kick in.  
</P>
<P>
	The first escalator would boost Williams' salary each year in  
years 2-4 -- $1 million if he rushes for 1,600 yards, $1.5 million 
for 1,800 yards, $2 million for 2,000 yards, $2.1 million for 2,100 
yards. If he breaks the league single-season rushing record of 
2,105 yards by Eric Dickerson, he would get a $3 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The second escalator is based on Terrell Davis' contract, the  
richest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first four years, Davis rushed for 6,413 yards, had 7,594  
yards in rushing and receiving, averaged 4.8 yards per carry and 
scored 61 touchdowns for the Denver Broncos. If Williams hits three 
of those four marks, his contract will automatically duplicate 
Davis'. 
</P>
<P>
	If that escalator kicks in, Williams' contract would be worth a  
total of $68.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also has a $100,000 bonus for taking part in the  
Saints' offseason program and $100,000 for not weighing over 240 
pounds at each of four weigh-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is the second No. 1 pick to sign a contract. Tim Couch  
signed with Cleveland on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there had been speculation that Williams' agent, Leland  
Hardy of No Limit Sports, would be hard to deal with or slow to 
reach an agreement, Saints salary cap consultant Terry O'Neil said 
negotiations, many of which were done on the golf course, were 
exceptionally smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there were a lot of misunderstandings about No Limit  
and what we'd do,'' Hardy said. ``I hope this will quiet that.''

<HEADLINE> Few Cancer Victims Test New Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Less than 5 percent of U.S. cancer patients take  
part in experiments to test new treatments, a figure at least four 
times lower than ideal to answer quickly the most pressing cancer 
questions, according to a survey released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need clinical trials to know what works and what doesn't,''  
said Dr. Allen Lichter, president of the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer experts almost universally endorse the need for patients  
to participate in formal studies, but data on how many do so have 
been scarce. So the oncology society, the nation's largest group of 
cancer practitioners, commissioned a survey of about 7,000 of its 
members and released the results at its annual meeting in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that about 40,000 Americans -- between 3 percent  
and 5 percent of those diagnosed with cancer each year -- are 
enrolled in these studies. However, it also found that far more 
could take part in the experiments, what doctors call clinical 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey estimates that about 20 percent of all cancer  
patients are eligible to participate, since available studies are 
aimed at their particular kinds of cancer and conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do better,'' said Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel of the National  
Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmanuel, the study's primary author, said doctors should try to  
enroll the entire 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiments typically test new medicines or combinations of  
drugs, and they attempt to see whether they work better than 
standard approaches. Those who participate receive at least the 
state-of-the-art treatment and often get a chance at otherwise 
unavailable approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Some patients do not participate simply because they don't  
relish the idea of being experimented on. But only about half of 
eligible patients are even told about the availability of the 
studies. The survey said the primary barriers to enrolling patients 
are time and money. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 20 percent of cancer specialists have time set aside to do  
this kind of cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them do it by squeezing it in,'' filling out study  
paperwork early in the morning or after hours, said Dr. Lowell 
Schnipper of Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, a 
survey co-author. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that a doctor's cost of enrolling and keeping a  
single patient in a clinical trial averages $2,000, and it ranges 
from less than $600 to almost $7,000. This is the cost of the time 
involved in explaining the study to the patient, doing follow-up 
and filling out forms, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute, which is the single largest  
sponsor of these studies, pays doctors $750 per patient for this 
work, while pharmaceutical companies' average payment is about 
$2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Despite concerns to the contrary, insurance companies often  
cover the care of patients in clinical trials. Less than 10 percent 
of claims are denied for studies that do not involve bone marrow 
transplants. When these expensive transplants are included, less 
than 20 percent of claims are rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of the 40,000 Americans in clinical trials, 20,000 are in  
studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, 13,000 
sponsored by drug companies and the rest paid for by hospitals and 
other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nine percent of pharmaceutical firm studies are devoted to  
cancer. The leading subject is heart disease, which involves 25 
percent of clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Eighty percent of cancer specialists enroll at least some  
patients in clinical trials.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Gets Chance for Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas will finally get his chance to  
win the Triple Crown -- with the same horse. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic crossed the finish line  
1 1/2 lengths ahead of Menifee in Saturday's $1 million Preakness, it 
put the Hall of Fame trainer a Belmont Stakes win away from 
saddling the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about it, the Triple Crown has so many  
connotations,'' Lukas said. ``I had a Triple Crown before, but not 
with the same horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Lukas' Thunder Gulch won the Derby and Belmont, but the  
colt's stablemate, Timber Country, won the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who has won 12 Triple Crown races, spent the past two  
years watching trainer Bob Baffert shoot for the Triple Crown with 
Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet last year. Each time, Baffert's 
colts were narrowly defeated in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Charismatic, Lukas hopes his 3-year-old former claimer can go  
down in history as the 12th Triple Crown winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can win it,'' Lukas said.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Lukas has reserved a spot on his Triple Crown watch for  
the green and gold colors of Bob and Beverly Lewis, the owners of 
Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourteen years ago, I bought this Triple Crown watch, and it  
has the colors of every Triple Crown winner on numbers 1 through 
11. But 12 o'clock high is blank. I want Bob and Beverly's green 
and gold to be on 12 o'clock high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic may have gone off as the fifth choice in the betting  
at 8-1, but it wasn't because Lukas wasn't touting the big chestnut 
son of 1990 Preakness winner Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still raving, but nobody's listening,'' Lukas said  
before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone's raving now, and Lukas is back on top of the training  
world again. A few days before the Derby, Lukas was elected to the 
Hall of Fame, and then Charismatic and Chris Antley, the jockey he 
hired on ``a hunch,'' went out and won the Run for the Roses. 
</P>
<P>
	That win brought Lukas his fourth Derby win, and Saturday's win  
brought him his fifth Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont Stakes is June 5, and Lukas has won that one three  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in New York, if the moon is in the right place, the fans  
will turn out for this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, who ran in a claiming race in February, where  
anyone could have purchased him for $62,500, entered the track 
prancing away like he knew he was going to be the star of the show. 
And Lukas was well aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a little strut to his step,'' Lukas said, ``like `I  
don't know what I did two weeks ago, but it must have been 
important.' He saddled so beautifully and I told Chris, `This is as 
good as human hands can make him. Let's take advantage of every 
step.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley did, and now Lukas will get his shot at a Triple Crown  
with a most unlikely colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted,'' Lukas said.

<HEADLINE> Norplant Said To Work on Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The makers of Norplant are negotiating a national  
settlement with about 40,000 women who say the birth control device 
injured them, The Dallas Morning News reported today, quoting 
lawyers who said the deal could be worth $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin lawyer Mike Slack, who represents 1,500 Norplant users,  
said settlement discussions with American Home Products Corp. of 
Madison, N.J., were under way but wouldn't discuss details. The 
company declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Norplant is made of six silicone rods filled with a synthetic  
hormone and is intended to protect users from pregnancy for about 
five years. Users have blamed it for irregular menstrual cycles, 
weight gain, headaches and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products, the world's seventh-largest drug maker,  
has been served with 3,732 lawsuits on behalf of 39,580 Norplant 
users. U.S. District Judge Richard Schell of Beaumont is presiding 
over all federal lawsuits, which involve about 30,000 users. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January that  
American Home Products need not warn patients about the potential 
dangers of its drugs, as long as doctors are informed. Plaintiffs' 
lawyers say doctors also were misled about Norplant's side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products and subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories  
have denied wrongdoing, and say doctors and patients are familiar 
with the side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wyeth-Ayerst continues to emphasize the importance of  
maintaining the Norplant system as a valuable contraceptive option 
for women,'' Wyeth spokesman Doug Petkus said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, the company has and will continue to offer  
health-care professionals an array of patient education materials 
to help the counsel patients about the benefits and risks 
associated with the Norplant system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers this week also said they've begun settlement talks with  
American Home Products on behalf of thousands of people who said 
they developed heart problems after using the diet drug combination 
fen-phen. Lawyers and analysts have said the fen-phen settlement 
could total between $3 billion and $5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Sears Settles Child Labor Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she hopes a  
case against Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. will make other retailers follow 
the letter of the law when it comes to child labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears has agreed to pay $325,000 to settle allegations it  
violated child labor laws by letting teen-agers operate heavy 
machinery or work too many hours. A Labor Department investigation 
found 227 children were illegally working at Sears, department 
spokeswoman Susan King said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to paying the fine, the department store company  
agreed to audit its more than 800 major stores for problems each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very, very important that our young people have  
constructive early work experience, but it is equally important 
that their jobs are safe,'' Herman said. ``I quite frankly hope 
that this case will send the signal to other employers so that we 
don't have more cases like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, 16- and 17-year-olds were found loading and  
operating power-driven paper balers, a machine that flattens 
cardboard boxes, or operating freight elevators or forklifts, King 
said. Under federal law, children are not permitted to operate this 
sort of hazardous equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few cases, some 15-year-old workers were working more hours  
than permitted under law, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, the nation's largest department store and second-largest  
retailer, did not admit to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Child labor laws have become a pet issue for Herman and are  
particularly topical given that the tightest labor market in three 
decades has the retail, food service and farm segments scrambling 
to find workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, Sears has 11,000 workers under age 18. The 1998  
Labor Department investigation in 23 states involved 71 of Sears' 
stores, King said. Violations were found in 44 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond had no comment on the charges  
leveled but said the company hopes to use the agreement to improve 
working conditions for teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to be a model in the retail industry in  
making an attractive and safe workplace for teen-agers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department initiated the investigation because Sears  
is such a large company and because 60 percent of teen-age workers 
work in retail, King said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Drug Trials Hiding Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of patients are being  
recruited by their personal physicians into a booming venture for 
doctors -- the business of testing experimental drugs on people, The 
New York Times reports in its Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said a 10-month investigation revealed a system  
that is fraught with conflicts of interest; that relies on 
government and private monitoring that can be easily fooled and 
that some researchers said is inadequate; and that secretly offers 
a share of the cash to other health professionals who might 
influence patients to join a study. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of private doctors in research since 1990 has almost  
tripled, and top recruiters can earn as much as $500,000 to $1 
million a year, according to the story, which was based on 
confidential documents and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	This new system is a boon for drug companies because it reaches  
out to a vast pool of test subjects who have never before been 
available for experimentation. But it also injects the interests of 
a giant industry into the delicate doctor-patient relationship, 
usually without the patient realizing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the specific findings of the Times' investigation:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Drug companies and their contractors offer large payments to  
doctors, nurses and other medical staff to encourage them to 
recruit patients quickly. And doctors do not even have to conduct 
trials to get paid: There are finder's fees for those who refer 
their patients to other doctors conducting research. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Doctors who recruit the most patients receive additional  
perquisites, such as the right to claim a coveted authorship of 
published papers about the studies -- even though the true author 
is a ghostwriter using analysis from the drug company. Those who 
fail to meet the recruitment goals are usually dropped from future 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Testing companies often use doctors as clinical investigators  
regardless of their specialty, at times leaving patients in the 
care of doctors who know little about their condition. For example, 
psychiatrists have conducted Pap smears and asthma specialists have 
dispensed experimental psychiatric drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A growing number of doctors conducting drug research have  
limited experience as clinical investigators, raising questions 
among some experts about the quality of their data.

<HEADLINE> New Soccer Stadium Makes Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Lamar Hunt spent $28.5 million to build  
Columbus Crew Stadium, America's first facility built specifically 
for major professional soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	It opened Saturday night with the Crew beating the New England  
Revolution 2-0 before a cheering, stomping crowd of 24,741 -- 2,256 
more than capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, the millionaire oilman who is the investor-operator of the  
Crew, said he couldn't have asked more from an opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather was perfect, the crowd was tremendous,'' he said.  
``It was a very big and important night for the Crew and for Major 
League Soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loud bands and rowdy fans created a party atmosphere at the  
concrete and aluminum structure, built a corner kick from a 
six-lane interstate and across a parking lot from the state's 
historical society. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three hours before the game's start, and an hour before  
the gates opened, several hundred people were waiting outside the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hunt said one memorable night didn't mean the MLS or soccer  
in the U.S. had hit the big time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy, probably, to sell out one game because there are so  
many people who want to come out and be a part of the first game in 
a new facility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, who also owns the Kansas City Wizards of the MLS and the  
NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, said there were still many hurdles ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be easy. I'm heard we had some traffic problems and  
some long lines at the concession stands and some people will be 
turned off by that,'' he said. ``The main thing is we've got to 
solve the problems and go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An hour before the start, it was a surreal scene on the  
entertainment plaza just behind the south stands. There were places 
to buy official Crew merchandise, beer, pizza and tacos. Next to 
them were two huge cannons, a couple of Humvees and some machine 
guns. Among the Crew's sponsors is the Ohio Army National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	It took nine months and one day to build the stadium. Hunt  
signed a lease agreement one year and one day before the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice Columbus voters had voted down ballot issues that would  
have built a downtown soccer stadium with public money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt ultimately dug into his own pockets to build the facility.  
U.S. and international soccer officials, representatives of other 
Major League Soccer franchises and even those interested in 
expansion teams were on hand for the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was only the fourth largest attendance at a Crew  
home game -- the team spent the last three years at a downsized 
version of Ohio State's massive football stadium -- fans said being 
a part of the inaugural game made it special. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were there for the first game back in 1996 when the Crew  
beat D.C. United 4-0,'' Leo Vardar of Columbus said. ``Driving home 
that night, I turned to my wife and said, `Soccer's here to stay.' 
Now we're back for another milestone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vardar and his wife, Lisa, were sitting in lawn chairs in the  
parking lot, sipping beers in the 80-degree heat. They said they 
had to check a fan guide given to season-ticket buyers to make sure 
alcoholic beverages were permitted in the new stadium -- unlike at 
the on-campus Ohio Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Crew coach Tom Fitzgerald looked out over the  
neatly groomed grass and said his team now had to build a homefield 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	As he spoke, thousands of fans started streaming into the  
stadium, many with their faces painted the team's colors. Almost 
all had on at least one article of clothing with the Crew's logo -- 
three construction workers with their arms folded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all of the other intimidating factors -- all the black  
and gold in this stadium, the fact that it's our new house,'' he 
said. ``Now we have to protect it.''

	Goals by forwards Jeff Cunningham and Stern John provided the  
Crew's scoring as they solidified their grasp on first place in the 
Eastern Division of the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the stadium was completed earlier this week,  
although some of the surrounding parking lots aren't paved. Around 
850 construction workers attended the game as guests of the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The site shares parking with the nearby state fairgrounds. When  
the state fair -- famous for its livestock shows -- begins in August, 
it could make for some interesting smells at the new stadium.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Antley Continues Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- After the winning trophy was presented to the  
connections of Preakness winner Charismatic, jockey Chris Antley 
excused himself from the winner's stand because he had a mount in 
the next race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, in light of what had just happened, if he really  
wanted to ride,'' said winning trainer D. Wayne Lukas, referring to 
the tradition of winning riders in the Preakness to skip the final 
race of the day at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at me, and said, 'Two months ago, I would have  
ridden in it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Antley would have been happy to ride in any  
race, and the fact he was standing on the verge of becoming the 
jockey of a Triple Crown winner wasn't going to stop him from doing 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to take it all in,'' said the 33-year-old Antley.  
``This whole thing is special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How special, only Antley can appreciate -- because he knows how  
close it came to slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
	The talented but mercurial rider had forged a career that  
included leading the nation in victories with 485 in 1985 and 
piloting his first Kentucky Derby winner in Strike the Gold in 
1991, but was also buffeted by substance-abuse problems and bouts 
of depression. He tested positive for marijuana in 1988, and later 
that same year tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Although seen by many as the most gifted rider of his  
generation, Antley had trouble focusing on his responsibilities, 
and he moved his tack from the East Coast to the West Coast in 
1992-93. He did all right for a while, but started having 
difficulties with his weight, which he struggled to keep at an 
optimum of 114 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But last fall, he let his weight balloon to 147 pounds, and he  
returned to his father's home in South Carolina. After watching a 
horse race on television, he vowed to return to the sport he 
excelled at, and began a rigorous training program that included 
running up to 25 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The pounds came off, slowly, and earlier this year he returned  
to riding in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was magical when I came back to ride after 15 months and  
went into the jocks' room and saw my radio, my pants, my picture, 
my cigar box with all my stuff in it all set up in the corner, the 
same way when I last rode,'' Antley said. ``I felt this lucky or 
magical thing when Wayne asked me to ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in April that Lukas bumped into Antley in the tunnel at  
Santa Anita and, on a hunch, told him: ``I'm running a horse in the 
Lexington Stakes (April 18 at Keeneland), but you're my choice to 
ride him in the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley, who had rarely ridden for Lukas when his career was at  
its peak during the late 1980s and early 1990s, went home and 
called his father, Les. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't it be neat if I could ride in it?'' Antley recalled  
telling him. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley did more than just ride in the Derby. In a race  
characterized by a rough-and-tumble first turn that eliminated a 
half-dozen contenders, Antley kept Charismatic free and clear of 
trouble, then went four-wide to take the lead entering the stretch 
and hold off the late-charging Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Preakness, Antley turned in another superb performance,  
letting the big chestnut settle in well off the early pace, then 
gunning for the lead on the far turn and holding all challengers at 
bay to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris made a bold move -- my heart jumped a little bit because  
I thought it might be early, but it was perfect,'' Lukas said. 
``It's a nice little marriage between Chris and Charismatic. It's a 
nice combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who is usually associated with higher profile riders such  
as Gary Stevens, Laffit Pincay Jr. and Mike Smith, said he felt 
Antley was more focused now that he had ever been. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is focused,'' Lukas said. ``He's appreciative, he sees the  
window of opportunity. ... We didn't give him anything. We put him 
in the game, and he came through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Antley stands just 1 1/2 miles -- the distance of the June 5  
Belmont Stakes -- from joining such racing greats as Eddie Arcaro 
Jr. and Steve Cauthen as riders of Triple Crown winners. Six times 
since Affirmed won the Derby, Preakness and Belmont in 1978, horses 
have come to the brink of racing history. And six times, including 
Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998, they have faltered. 
</P>
<P>
	For Antley, just getting to this point was enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``The road back was long and hard, and maybe that's what I  
needed -- to have it taken away and not be able to get it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Get it back, he did.

<HEADLINE> Mullin Playing for Chance at Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Chris Mullin is playing less and his scoring  
is down. Never fast to begin with, he's also lost a step or two -- 
or three. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are those nagging injuries to his hands and feet,  
sure to catch up with a player who's fought through the sharp 
elbows and knees of picks for 14 seasons as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	But here he is, a 35-year-old throwback with his crewcut and  
trademark deadeye shot, helping to lead the Indiana Pacers as they 
vie for their first NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look back over your career and how you want it to  
wind down, what type of people you want to be surrounded by, the 
atmosphere you want to play in, right now everything is right in 
place,'' Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
	After 836 games with Golden State, the former St. John's star  
uprooted his family in 1997 hoping for a shot at the title with 
Pacers coach Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	A gym rat even before he became a high school and college star  
in New York City, Mullin has started every game for Indiana the 
past two seasons and won teammates' admiration for his talent and 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a scientist to the game of basketball,'' said Mark  
Jackson, also a teammate at St. John's. ``He hasn't changed a bit 
since the first time I met him in New York. He's usually the first 
one in the gym and the last one out. He's a worker and a great 
friend, an example of what type of role model an NBA player should 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life hasn't always gone smoothly for Mullin, the seventh overall  
draft pick in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed 22 games during the 1987-88 season while in alcohol  
rehab. Injuries, including a bum heel, a torn thumb ligament and a 
torn finger ligament, have sidelined him for 157 games. He often 
submerges both feet in buckets of ice after games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You exist in the NBA day-by-day,'' he said. ``It's not  
something where you say, `I want to do this for 15-20 years.' You 
just do it. You have to have a game plan, be dedicated and 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back, if you said I was going to play 14-15 years in  
the NBA, I'd might have looked at you like you were crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time All-Star also probably never thought he'd amass  
these regular-season totals: 17,554 points, 3,494 assists, 3,917 
rebounds and 1,486 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin, who missed the playoffs in seven of his 12 years with  
Golden State, helped Indiana reach the seventh game of the Eastern 
Conference finals last year before losing to Michael Jordan and the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the Pacers look like the team to beat in the East.  
They swept the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday night in the first round 
of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making the playoffs is great, but we want to win them this  
year, not just a series or two,'' Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the Warriors, Mullin settled down in the  
Indianapolis suburb of Carmel and had to adjust to a slower pace of 
life. He admits apprehension over moving his wife, Liz, and three 
young sons, but he is enjoying the change. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he had a special incentive to help the Pacers sweep the  
Bucks: It allowed him to return home to attend a son's Little 
League game on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping busy when I'm not on the court is no problem. Hockey,  
Little League, soccer, we've got tons of things going on,'' he 
said. ``We've achieved that balance that we all strive for. I don't 
know if we ever attain it, but when you get somewhere close to it, 
you have a good feeling and that's how we are as a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee coach George Karl didn't need the playoffs to  
appreciate what Mullin does for a team. He saw plenty of it as 
Seattle's coach, dealing with Mullin as a Western Conference 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love him. He's the ultimate professional. He's a hard worker  
on the court, has great knowledge of the game and the way it should 
be played and goes out and uses that knowledge to help his team and 
create problems for the opponent,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big difference I see in him over the years is that he's  
working harder on defense, trying to stop the man he's on. In the 
past he had to play so many minutes that he sometimes saved his 
energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin, who scored a career-low 10.1 points a game this season,  
hit eight of 19 3-point shots while scoring a total of 34 points 
against Milwaukee. Bird played him an average of about 18 minutes 
in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't move like I used to, and neither does Chris,'' said  
Bird, the ex-Boston Celtics great who played with Mullin on Dream 
Team I at the 1992 Olympics. ``That doesn't mean he isn't of less 
value to his team. He's of great value to us. His shooting ability 
opens up the court, his passing ability keeps the offense moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin smiles when asked about slowing down. At least he hasn't  
stopped playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to make up for it by staying in condition, practicing my  
skills and working to improve where I can,'' he said. ``I don't 
know how much longer I'll be able to keep going, but as long as I 
feel I am contributing rather than hurting my team I'll want to 
keep going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with a player as good as Mullin, that could be awhile.

<HEADLINE> Tuinei Had Overcome Adversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Adversity was nothing new to Mark Tuinei. Each  
time the former Cowboys offensive lineman hit a rough spot, he 
turned his life in a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those turning points came last spring, when knee injuries  
led the Dallas Cowboys to release the 6-foot-5, 320-pound player 
after a 15-year career. At age 38, Tuinei had wanted to come back 
one more year to set the team record for longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than a year later, his life ended with a drug  
overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he missed playing the game,'' said former San Francisco  
49ers center Jesse Sapolu, who attended the University of Hawaii 
with Tuinei. ``People don't realize how tough it is to adjust to 
life after football. It's your entire life, and all of a sudden you 
have to turn it off. '' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sapolu and others say they don't believe Tuinei turned to  
serious drug use to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei was heading home to Hawaii to finish his college degree  
and to a job as an assistant coach at his alma mater, Punahou High 
School. His wife, Pono, was already there. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he got that job, at our old school, that was his dream --  
to coach kids where he went. He'd been telling me that for years,'' 
said J.K. Spielman, a lifelong friend and classmate of Tuinei at 
Punahou. ``Unfortunately, one bad choice, and that's how it 
ended,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day he was to move, Tuinei died outside his suburban Dallas  
home from an overdose of heroin and a stimulant similar to the 
designer drug Ecstasy. Police said close friends told investigators 
Tuinei had been taking the stimulant for two weeks, but it was his 
first time to try heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys reserve fullback Nicky Sualua has told police he was in  
a North Dallas apartment May 5 when Tuinei injected heroin and 
passed out. Sualua performed CPR to revive Tuinei, and dragged the 
former player to his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Sualua then drove to Tuinei's house in Plano and fell asleep  
beside him in the car. No medical care was sought until the next 
morning, when Sualua woke up and found Tuinei wasn't breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first heard about it, I got very bitter,'' said Bill  
Olds, a close friend and mentor. ``Then I realized this may be a 
lesson for the rest of us still here. Maybe the good Lord said, 
'I'm taking him for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Olds' voice broke when he talked about the football player he  
loved like a son. He had spoken to Tuinei two days before his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very happy,'' Olds said. ``The movers were coming later  
in the week. He was anxious to see Pono and see spring practice 
start at the high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olds was an ROTC instructor at the University of Hawaii when he  
met Tuinei, who transferred there after he was asked to leave UCLA 
in 1980 for drunken brawling. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting was nothing new to Tuinei as he was growing up in the  
town of Nannakuli. His father, a Samoan and ex-Marine sergeant, was 
described as a tough man who taught his sons to use their fists. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in school at Hawaii, Tuinei got in trouble again.  
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei and a friend beat up a tourist near Waikiki, narrowly  
avoiding a jail term. Three months later, he hit a security guard 
with a chair during a school fight. 
</P>
<P>
	That time, a judge sentenced Tuinei to 23 consecutive weekends  
and summer vacation in the Oahu Community Correctional Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii coach Dick Tomey suspended him from the team and sought  
help from Olds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches said, 'We've got this guy. He needs to be  
straightened out. He needs a mentor and a coach,' '' Olds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olds said Tuinei's status as a campus athlete led to many of his  
run-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you become an athlete, you become a celebrity,'' he said.  
``If you are a strong-willed person, you are able to make the 
decision between right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are easily influenced, there are elements that come  
along and you get in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olds said the ROTC program's strict military regimen was just  
what Tuinei needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was no longer the big man on campus,'' he said. ``He wanted  
to turn his life around and he wanted his family to be proud of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei also wanted desperately to play professional football.  
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't drafted by the NFL, but managed an invitation to the  
Dallas Cowboys training camp in 1983, along with 84 other free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei, who played defensive line in those days, defied the odds  
and made the team. Coaches later decided his future was on offense. 
By 1987, he became a starter, going on to a career that included 
three Super Bowls and two Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Olds, who talked to Tuinei at least twice a month, said he  
seemed happy since his retirement. He believes Tuinei's use of 
heroin was a one-time mistake that cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he didn't have an addiction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Family members are bewildered about why Tuinei took the drugs,  
said Marian Benham, Pono's aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have no idea what happened,'' she said. ``It was a  
totally devastating shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's older brother, Tom, says he sometimes cannot believe  
his sibling is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not ashamed of my brother,'' he said at the funeral last  
week. ``I'm sad. I'm hurt. ... I have many questions but very few 
answers.''

<HEADLINE> Pollsters Question Internet Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Internet surveys are a great  
way to stir up interest in Web sites, but pollsters want to make a 
clear distinction between those surveys and polls that measure 
public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	They are considering the possibility of a rating system that  
would require pollsters to inform the public and the media which 
polls are conducted using scientific standards. Pollsters searched 
for a solution to the difficult problem Friday during the annual 
meeting of the American Association for Public Opinion Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't overstate the concern that people who practice  
polling have about this,'' said Nancy Belden, a Washington pollster 
who organized the standards discussion. ``It is more urgent because 
of the proliferation of Internet polling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Mitofsky, the veteran New York City pollster who heads  
the group's standards committee, emphasized it's too early to know 
what solution the group will finally pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	But studies of the online surveys have shown their results are  
very different from scientific polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Research Center ran a comparison of its own probability  
polls and the results of self-selected survey responses to the same 
questions on America Online. More than half in the open online 
survey disapproved of the job President Clinton was doing, while 
two-thirds in the scientific telephone poll approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific surveys use a technique called random digit dialing,  
in which a computer picks phone numbers at random and the poll 
results are weighted geographically and demographically to 
represent the population as a whole. Most Web polls are 
self-selected, meaning Internet users decide themselves whether to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet surveys are increasingly being targeted by interest  
groups that want a new forum to promote their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK Internet Brigade, let's get out there and stand strong for  
Pat!'' was the rallying cry posted recently on Pat Buchanan's 
official web site. The site encourages supporters to ``hit the 
online polls and register your vote for PJB.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides with several other presidential campaigns, Republican and  
Democratic, said they encourage participation in such polls, but 
have made no organized effort to influence the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters are trying to cut confusion caused by the Internet  
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	At CNN, poll director Keating Holland helped convince those who  
run the online surveys to call them ``quick votes'' to make a clear 
distinction that they are not scientific polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology of the Internet has simply made more visible a  
problem pollsters have faced for years. Mail-in polls, which have 
been around for years, can cause the same confusion as Internet 
polls, because the poll taker usually has little control over who 
decides to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	One firm has advocated using Internet surveys for election  
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Bayer, chief scientist at Harris Black International of  
Rochester, N.Y., says his techniques include finding a large sample 
of willing respondents on the Internet who can be canvassed by 
e-mail. ``Part of the pollsters' art and science is knowing how to 
weight and interpret survey results so that they are projectable to 
the population,'' Bayer said.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Talks Remain Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British and Irish governments pledged today to  
pressure all the main Northern Ireland parties after a marathon 
negotiating session failed to break the deadlock over IRA arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Both governments, however, were left feeling more optimistic  
about resolving the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-hour negotiating session in British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair's 10 Downing St. office ended Friday without an agreement to 
form the compromise Protestant-Catholic government, the central 
plank of last year's peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, said  
afterward that they felt hopeful about future progress, 
particularly as all sides participated in an intensive two-hour 
round table discussion. All parties also agreed to continue talks, 
though no additional face-to-face sessions were immediately 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be extensive contact continuing between Downing  
Street, Dublin and all the parties through the weekend,'' a 
spokesman for Blair's office said today, speaking on condition of 
customary anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	After Friday's session, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble,  
who would lead the new power-sharing government of the province, 
spoke of ``hope'' rather than concrete progress. But Gerry Adams, 
head of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said there remained serious 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we say the parties agreed to stay in touch with each  
other, that indicates some work still has to be done,'' Adams said 
after the talks ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble has insisted that his Protestant supporters will not  
allow Sinn Fein to take part in any government unless the Irish 
Republican Army first starts to disarm. Although the accord 
expected that the IRA would completely disarm by May 2000, the IRA 
has pledged never to hand over a single bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a very serious and intensive day of dialogue. I  
think we have made a lot of progress,'' Ahern said after Friday's 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's Downing Street office said, ``There has been an  
intensive discussion, real engagement on the issues, and progress 
has been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble also said he believed they would be able to find a way  
of implementing the agreement in full. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that will be possible sooner rather than later but I am  
not in a position to confirm that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Adams was far less optimistic, saying that Friday's session  
was '' a difficult day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We really need to make progress around establishing all  
aspects of the agreement,'' he said.

	NATO Pummels Serb Targets  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Air raid sirens wailed late Saturday  
in Belgrade, and according to local reports, Kosovo has suffered a 
day of record bombing. NATO, meanwhile, said it was attacking a 
Serb military command post when its warplanes struck a Kosovo 
village where Yugoslavia reported 87 ethnic Albanians were killed 
and more than 100 injured. It remained unclear why the refugees -- 
apparent victims of NATO's most deadly bombing of civilians in the 
air campaign against Yugoslavia -- had stopped in the village, 
Korisa.

<HEADLINE> Drugs May Be Prescribed by Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the young woman arrived in the emergency  
room complaining of lethargy and heart palpitations, Dr. David 
Flockhart suspected a dangerous side effect of her antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
	So he proposed a test: Patient and doctor both would take a dose  
to compare how quickly the woman metabolized the antidepressant. 
Sure enough, it took four times too long for the woman's body to 
clear the drug, meaning it had time to build up and threaten her 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	But Flockhart had a weird reaction, too. ``I take it and am  
completely knocked out,'' the Georgetown University doctor 
recalled. Once the sedation wore off, he remained disoriented. ``I 
go to the parking lot ... and drive off with all the car doors 
open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The experience illustrates a concept scientists only now are  
investigating: Men and women may have dramatically different 
reactions to medications, yet very few drugs have been studied to 
determine the proper dose -- and safety warnings -- according to sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until this point, it has been assumed that one drug, one dose  
was right for all individuals,'' said Dr. Marietta Anthony of the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	But new research is uncovering startling -- even life-threatening  
-- differences that show ``physicians better start prescribing drugs 
based on gender,'' said Georgetown medication expert Dr. Raymond 
Woosley. 
</P>
<P>
	Among early findings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Woosley examined 40 drugs that sometimes cause irregular  
heartbeats. For almost a dozen of the drugs, women have twice the 
risk of developing this potentially life-threatening side effect. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Morphine controls pain much better in women than in men. But  
another study suggested the over-the-counter painkiller ibuprofen 
is more effective for men than for women. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Aspirin seems to thin men's blood much better than women's, an  
important finding for heart patients. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women reject heart transplants more often than men, and the  
reason may be that anti-rejection drugs like cyclosporine clear out 
of their bodies faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists only recently began studying medication sex  
differences, spurred by the discovery that side effects from the 
antihistamine Seldane -- pulled off the market last year -- killed 
more women than men. 
</P>
<P>
	Then researchers began discovering dozens of enzymes responsible  
for metabolizing medicines, and found that some predominate 
according to gender. In fact, women can metabolize numerous drugs, 
from the antibiotic erythromycin to the blood pressure drug 
verapamil, 20 percent to 50 percent faster than men. 
</P>
<P>
	So are these drugs staying in their bodies long enough to work,  
or do they need higher doses? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody yet knows, said scientists at a meeting called by NIH's  
Office of Research on Women's Health last week to boost this 
research -- and to get the message about sex differences to everyday 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to look at each medication,'' stressed Mary Berg, a  
University of Iowa pharmacy professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, drug effects vary widely from person to person.  
Flockhart's sedation, for example, merely showed his body was not 
used to antidepressants. But his female patient lacked an enzyme 
vital to properly process certain antidepressants. 
</P>
<P>
	When such reactions prove more common in one sex, doctors could  
prescribe alternate drugs or at least watch more carefully for 
early side effects, Woosley explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Furiously taking notes during the two-day meeting were  
scientists at the Food and Drug Administration who are responsible 
for approving new medicines. Only last August did the FDA begin 
requiring drug manufacturers to analyze how the different sexes 
respond to experimental therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are watching to see how strictly the FDA will regard  
the issue of gender and medication. An experimental stroke 
treatment called tirilazad may be a key test. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial studies suggested the drug offered a small benefit to  
men but not women, so manufacturer Pharmacia &AMP; UpJohn then studied 
higher doses for women, but got uncertain results, said William 
Jusko of the State University of New York, Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will (the FDA) approve a drug with successful efficacy in men  
and questionable efficacy in women? We don't know,'' Jusko said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormones, of course, play a big role.  
</P>
<P>
	Male hormones called androgens seem to protect men from that  
irregular heartbeat side effect that Woosley uncovered in about a 
dozen drugs, including Seldane. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's hormones fluctuate according to their menstrual cycle.  
Women with asthma seem to metabolize theophylline much more slowly 
during ovulation, and consequently have improved lung function 
during that time each month. 
</P>
<P>
	Other research found that starting a few days before the  
menstrual period, women with epilepsy often report more seizures, 
because their bodies temporarily eliminate the epilepsy drug 
phenytoin faster than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	To complicate matters, proteins that help certain drugs get  
inside the body's cells play a role, too, and scientists are just 
now discovering which ones seem more important according to sex. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason scientists have so few answers about sex differences  
is that it was not until the early 1990s that the FDA forced drug 
manufacturers even to allow women of childbearing age into drug 
studies. Companies were reluctant for fear an experimental drug 
would cause fetal harm if the women became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, no one knows how most drugs behave during pregnancy,  
when hormones greatly fluctuate, because studying pregnant women is 
so seldom done. Companies fear liability if a drug proves risky, 
but women's experts note that some women, such as epileptics, must 
take medicine during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sex is even an obstacle when scientists turn to animals to study  
drug safety. Drugs usually are tested exclusively in male rats -- to 
avoid hormone fluctuation -- or exclusively in female mice -- because 
male mice attack each other too much, explained University of 
Georgia pharmacologist Catherine White.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Teens Charged in Shooting Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Four boys have been charged with  
plotting a shooting at their middle school similar to the April 
rampage at Colorado's Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo, both 14, were charged as  
adults Thursday with conspiracy to commit murder for allegedly 
planning to kill classmates at their 560-student Holland Woods 
Middle School. The two remained in custody Saturday on $100,000 
bail each. 
</P>
<P>
	The two others, ages 12 and 13, have been charged as juveniles  
with the same crime. They also remained in custody on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They planned to commit ... a slaughter and massacre of Holland  
Woods students,'' said Mary Kelly, a St. Clair County assistant 
prosecutor. She said the plot ``had been in the planning and in the 
making for over a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday at their homes.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege the teens planned to top the death toll of  
the April 20 massacre at Columbine, where Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's 12,000 students were told to stay home from its  
21 campuses after a bomb was discovered near the Holland Woods 
campus on Thursday night. A janitor found the device shortly after 
parents and school officials met there to discuss the boys' alleged 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb, which police say is not connected to the alleged plan,  
was disarmed by state police before being shipped to a Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms lab for analysis, said Vera Fedorak, 
an agency spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' alleged plans were discovered after a 14-year-old girl  
told police she overheard them talking about an elaborate killing 
spree. She told police she overheard some of the boys saying they 
wanted to kill all the school's ``preps,'' the popular clique of 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl told police the Michigan boys said their plan was to go  
on a shooting spree in a gym assembly and detonate a bomb 
afterward. Authorities have declined to specify other evidence that 
led to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials canceled weekend sports events and were  
conducting school-by-school inspections before planning to announce 
Sunday whether classes will be held this week.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Women's Sports Making Strides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women athletes and coaches are making  
significant progress in college athletics, but disparities in 
participation and financing for their teams persist, according to a 
survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey covered the 1997-98 academic year. The analysis was  
based on reports, prepared under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure 
Act, from 306 of the 310 NCAA Division I member schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Its found that 40 percent of athletes were women, a five percent  
increase from 1996-97, and women received 40 percent of 
athletic-scholarship budgets, a 14 percent rise from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But participation by women in sports trailed enrollment rates of  
women at many colleges. Nationally, women constituted 53 percent of 
the undergraduates at Division I schools, but only 40 percent of 
their athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools with the greatest disparity of women's athletic  
participation in 1997-98 were Murray State, Southern University, 
Drake, Southwestern Louisiana, Marshall, Chicago State, 
Tennessee-Martin, Southern Mississippi, Western Kentucky and Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	At Murray State, women made up 55 percent of the students but  
only 18 percent of the athletes. At Southern, 59 percent of all 
students were women, but only 23 percent of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools awarding the least-proportional share of scholarships to  
women athletes were Vanderbilt, Miami of Ohio, Richmond, Eastern 
Washington and Colorado. Miami, which announced this year it was 
dropping three men's sports to comply with Title IX, awarded only 
32 percent of its athletic-scholarship budget to women, who 
represented 45 percent of the university's athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches of women's teams received only 28 percent of total  
salary expenditures on coaches, the survey found. Every Division I 
school in the survey paid the coaches of men's teams more than the 
coaches of women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 61 schools spent more than one-third of their salary  
budgets on women coaches. Forty-one schools spent less than 20 
percent on women's coaches, including Rice, East Carolina and 
Clemson. At Rice, only eight percent of coaching salaries went to 
the coaches of women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that women's sports received only 32  
percent of recruiting budgets. At 25 schools, women's teams 
received less than 20 percent of total recruiting budgets. Among 
them were Prairie View A&AMP;M, Norfolk State, Iona, Sam Houston State 
and Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's sports also received only 36 percent of total team  
operating budgets. Excluding the military academies, the colleges 
with the smallest women's team budgets, proportionally, were 
Louisville, Cincinnati, Alcorn State, Southwestern Louisiana and 
Memphis.

<HEADLINE> Sears Settles Child Labor Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she hopes a  
case against Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. will make other retailers follow 
the letter of the law when it comes to child labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears has agreed to pay $325,000 to settle allegations it  
violated child labor laws by letting teen-agers operate heavy 
machinery or work too many hours. A Labor Department investigation 
found 227 children were illegally working at Sears, department 
spokeswoman Susan King said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to paying the fine, the department store company  
agreed to audit its more than 800 major stores for problems each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very, very important that our young people have  
constructive early work experience, but it is equally important 
that their jobs are safe,'' Herman said. ``I quite frankly hope 
that this case will send the signal to other employers so that we 
don't have more cases like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, 16- and 17-year-olds were found loading and  
operating power-driven paper balers, a machine that flattens 
cardboard boxes, or operating freight elevators or forklifts, King 
said. Under federal law, children are not permitted to operate this 
sort of hazardous equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few cases, some 15-year-old workers were working more hours  
than permitted under law, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, the nation's largest department store and second-largest  
retailer, did not admit to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Child labor laws have become a pet issue for Herman and are  
particularly topical given that the tightest labor market in three 
decades has the retail, food service and farm segments scrambling 
to find workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, Sears has 11,000 workers under age 18. The 1998  
Labor Department investigation in 23 states involved 71 of Sears' 
stores, King said. Violations were found in 44 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond had no comment on the charges  
leveled but said the company hopes to use the agreement to improve 
working conditions for teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to be a model in the retail industry in  
making an attractive and safe workplace for teen-agers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department initiated the investigation because Sears  
is such a large company and because 60 percent of teen-age workers 
work in retail, King said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Cut in Movie Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hours before sitting down to a $2  
million political dinner with Hollywood's elite, President Clinton 
challenged the entertainment industry today to ban guns from ads 
and movie previews, and do a better job of keeping kids away from 
R-rated movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Television ratings and V-chips aside, ``There's still too much  
violence on our nation's screens, large and small,'' Clinton said 
in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcast, taped after a Democratic fund-raiser in Seattle  
on Friday, came during a pause in Clinton's $3-million-plus 
campaign cash sweep down the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was spending a private day today with his  
daughter, Chelsea, at the Woodside home of computer magnate Steven 
Jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodside is near the campus of Stanford University, where  
Chelsea is wrapping up her sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
	From here, the president was heading on to Beverly Hills'  
Greystone Mansion and a Democratic Party fund-raiser organized by 
DreamWorks partners Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David 
Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
	With such high-wattage stars as Meg Ryan, Dennis Quaid, Goldie  
Hawn, Kurt Russell, Whoopi Goldberg and Ed Burns paying between 
$25,000 to $100,000 per couple, the dinner was expected to collect 
more than $2 million for Democratic House and Senate candidates in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made his anti-violence appeal nearly four weeks after  
the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colo., and just as 
he has begun to try to mobilize a national, grass-roots campaign 
against youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton plan to  
visit Littleton on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	From events in Seattle, here in the San Francisco Bay area and  
tonight in Los Angeles, Clinton continues on Sunday to fund-raisers 
in San Diego and Las Vegas -- for a four-day take of more than $3 
million for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton applauded Hollywood today for its voluntary ratings  
system for TV shows and the V-chip to enforce parents' decisions on 
what children may watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But still, he said, ``By the age of 18, the typical American  
will see 40,000 dramatized murders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still too many vulnerable children who are steeped  
in this culture of violence, becoming increasingly desensitized to 
it and to its consequences and, therefore, as studies show, 
hundreds of them more liable to commit violence themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued three challenges to the entertainment industry:  
</P>
<P>
	--Stop showing guns in ads or previews that children might see.  
The film industry already bans the depiction of drug use in movie 
trailers viewed by youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strictly enforce ratings systems at video stores and theaters.  
``You should check IDs, not turn the other way as a child walks 
unchaperoned into an R-rated movie,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Re-evaluate the ratings system, especially the PG rating, ``to  
determine whether it is allowing too much gratuitous violence in 
movies approved for viewing by children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our administration is fighting to do all we can to protect  
children. The entertainment industry should do everything it can, 
too,'' Clinton asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	He lashed out again today at the Republican-led Senate for  
passing new gun-show restrictions that he said were ``riddled with 
new loopholes'' and ignored his own proposed new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate wants to fix the problem, it should fix the  
problem, not make it worse,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Some WNBA Players Return To Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Teresa Weatherspoon and Sophia Witherspoon of  
the WNBA's New York Liberty will report to practice Saturday after 
a one-day lockout and contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon, the two-time WNBA defensive player of the year,  
and Witherspoon, the Liberty's top scorer, did not attend the 
opening day of training camp Friday in West Hempstead, N.Y. They 
joined Cleveland's Merlakia Jones and Orlando's Yolanda Moore as 
holdouts on the first day of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Sting pushed back its practice until 6 p.m. EDT  
Friday to make sure contract negotiations for Andrea Stinson, Vicky 
Bullett and Sharon Manning were finalized. Players can't attend 
camp until they sign contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon and Witherspoon were the last of 16 Liberty players  
to agree in principle to renegotiated contracts after their 
two-year contracts expired. The terms of the contracts were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league was flexible and we gave in a little,'' said Bruce  
Levy, agent for 10 of 16 Liberty players. ``They're satisfied with 
their contracts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the league's first collective bargaining agreement was  
signed on April 30, a dispute over salaries and player appearances 
postponed the WNBA draft a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute shortened the contract negotiation period to three  
business days. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's original marquee players -- Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa  
Leslie and Rebecca Lobo -- renegotiated their contracts on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Swoopes of the two-time champion Houston Comets agreed to a  
three-year contract while Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks agreed 
to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Cooper, a two-time league MVP of the Comets, agreed to a  
multiyear contract while the contract terms for the Liberty's Lobo 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coquese Washington, a Liberty player and member of the players'  
union executive committee, said the league agreed to increase the 
personal service contracts of top players from the initial 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wanted a no holdout clause this year, but the union  
did not agree. Next year, players and agents will have a three-week 
window to negotiate contracts, said Pam Wheeler, director of 
operations for the Women's National Basketball Players' 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Players on foreign national teams or currently playing  
professionally overseas have until early June to renegotiate their 
contracts with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team league begins its third season on June 10.

<HEADLINE> Spike Lee To Make Ads for Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spike Lee is setting sail with a series of  
recruiting ads for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmaker signed on to make six commercials for the  
oceangoing branch of the military. Using hand-held cameras for a 
fresh look, Lee did documentary-style spots on Navy SEALS, sailors 
in a rock band, exotic travel opportunities and other 
service-related topics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spike may attract a younger audience than our previous  
commercials did,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Karen Jeffries, adding that the 
Navy fell 7,000 recruits short of its goal in 1998. ``Spike can 
give us a different edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first commercial will debut June 4 in movie theaters showing  
the new ``Star Wars'' film before the spot airs on television. Lee, 
who has done commercials for Nike and Levis, has film credits 
including ``Malcolm X'' and ``Do The Right Thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised they picked him, but I think the Navy did the  
right thing,'' said former Lt. Cmdr. Allan Camaissa, who appeared 
in one of the new spots.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Turn Triple Play vs. Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies turned their first  
triple play at Veterans Stadium since 1991 in the sixth inning of 
Saturday night's game against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Mets leading 7-6 and men on first and second, Mike  
Piazza lined to shortstop Alex Arias as the runners were moving. 
Arias flipped to second baseman Kevin Jordan for the second out and 
Jordan then tagged John Olerud to complete the play. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 29th triple play in Phillies' history and their first  
since Aug. 30, 1998 at San Francisco, which also involved Arias. It 
was the team's first triple play at Veterans Stadium since April 
28, 1991 against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets hit into their eighth triple play and first since May  
11, 1993 at St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Menifee Getting Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Menifee came on strong in the Kentucky Derby,  
and trainer Elliott Walden expected him to be even stronger in 
today's $1 million Preakness Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very game down the stretch,'' Walden said of his colt's  
furious finish in the Derby that left him a neck short of 
Charismatic. ``If he runs that race back, he'll be tough to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Menifee tough to beat.  
</P>
<P>
	Walden says his 3-year-old colt should be a lot closer to the  
lead in the 1 3-16th-mile Preakness than he was in the 1 1/4-mile 
Derby, where he had to pass 10 rivals in the stretch to finish 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will not be as far back this time,'' Walden said. ``He got  
shuffled back early in the Derby, but we got a good draw for this 
race, and Pat Day should be able to place him where he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Derby, Menifee left from the No. 18 post in a 19-horse  
field and was forced five wide in one of the roughest Run for the 
Roses on record. In the Preakness, Menifee was to leave from the 
No. 5 post in an expected field of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he does have a big chance,'' Walden said.  
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, owned by Arthur Hancock and James Stone, was the early  
5-2 favorite, while the filly Excellent Meeting was next at 5-1, 
and Derby winner Charismatic was third choice at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Derby winner to be favored in the Preakness was Go for  
Gin in 1994. He finished second to Tabasco Cat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Walden, son of respected horseman Ben Walden  
Sr., has been overshadowed by the Triple Crown trials and 
tribulations of trainers D. Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert. But Walden 
has made quite an impact in the classics, too, beginning with 
Victory Gallop last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop finished second to the Baffert-trained Real Quiet  
in the '98 Derby and Preakness before spoiling the colt's Triple 
Crown bid with a nose victory in the Belmont Stakes. With Menifee's 
runner-up finish in Derby two weeks ago, Walden sounds like he's 
expecting another classic win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks great, he's doin' good and he's just really on top of  
his game right now,'' Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a horse who worries Walden, it's Cat Thief, who  
finished third in the Derby and second to Menifee in the Blue Grass 
Stakes on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a model of consistency,'' Walden said of the  
Lukas-trained Cat Thief, who has two wins, five seconds and three 
third-place finishes in 12 career starts. ``People kind of forget 
about him because he's never gotten the top prize. But this is the 
type of race these horses win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas finds himself in a familiar situation for the Preakness,  
where Derby winner Charismatic could end up losing his Triple Crown 
chance to stablemate Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Lukas-trained Thunder Gulch won the Derby, but  
Timber Country won the Preakness. When Thunder Gulch won the 
Belmont, Lukas had his Triple Crown -- but with two horses. 
</P>
<P>
	If it happens again, it's OK.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't mind a similar result,'' Lukas said.  
</P>
<P>
	While Baffert's filly Excellent Meeting was set for the  
Preakness, his other filly, Silverbulletday, went out Friday and 
easily won the Black-Eyed Susan in stakes-record time. Owner Mike 
Pegram wanted to run Silverbulletday in the Preakness, but pulled 
her out after she drew the outside No. 14 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, trainer Carl Nafzger was expected to scratch Vicar, who  
drew the No. 13 post, this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, becomes the 52nd  
filly to run in the Preakness, the first since Winning Colors 
finished third in 1988 and just the third since 1939. The other was 
Genuine Risk, second in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Four fillies have won the Preakness, the last being Nellie Morse  
in 1924.

<HEADLINE> Discrimination Suit Filed Vs. Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Southern University law professors  
have filed a pair of federal lawsuits against the state, saying it 
discriminates against historically black colleges with a segregated 
higher education system and with its funding decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	One suit protests the nearly $1 billion set aside for medical  
schools under the settlement of the state's lawsuit against tobacco 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the money was allocated to majority-white  
institutions,'' said Grover Hankins, a lawyer and Texas Southern 
law professor. ``None of it was allocated to Texas Southern, 
Prairie View or the other nine historically black colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we want a share of the funds, and we want a  
substantial share,'' he said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Only health, medical and science-related institutions with  
graduate and research programs received endowments. The suit seeks 
to block allocation of $956 million to those universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit names as plaintiffs Texas Southern  
students, former students and residents who live near the college. 
It says the state violated part of the Civil Rights Act that 
prohibits entities receiving federal dollars from discriminating 
against racial or ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The second lawsuit alleges Texas maintains a largely segregated  
higher education system for whites and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit is similar to the 1992 case in which the U.S. Supreme  
Court ruled Mississippi had maintained separate higher education 
systems, a violation of civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for state Attorney General John Cornyn declined to  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe Pa. Murder, Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST VIEW, Pa. (AP) -- A gas company worker killed his  
girlfriend, set fire to his house and tried to ambush his ex-wife 
before killing himself with a deer rifle after a 20-hour manhunt 
that virtually shut down this community, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police shot tear gas into a vacant house just north of  
Pittsburgh where 49-year-old Francis Weber was holed up. Police 
found his corpse on the second floor late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber shot girlfriend Amy Beardsley, 34, at about 1:30 a.m.  
Friday in Coraopolis, a Pittsburgh suburb, where she was staying 
with a friend, police said. A relative of the man's girlfriend said 
Weber may have been distraught over an impending breakup with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber then went to his home in Bell Acres less than 10 miles  
away and set several fires and flammable booby traps, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Acres authorities alerted police in West View, where  
Weber's ex-wife, Rebekah Weber, lives with their two teen-age 
children. Police moved her and the children to a safe location and 
were waiting for Weber when he arrived about 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Clad in camouflage, Weber fired eight shots from an  
assault-style rifle at a police officer and fled. The officer was 
not wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Charles Holtgraver said authorities viewed Weber as  
a skilled outdoorsman who apparently intended to hold out for a 
while. Authorities said Weber had a history of domestic violence 
and was an avid hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 150 officers were involved in the manhunt. West View  
police told residents to stay in their homes and schools canceled 
classes. For several hours, residents were not allowed to drive 
into West View while police searched for Weber.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Leaning Toward Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Fresh on the heels of Houston's ouster from the  
NBA playoffs, Charles Barkley is considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to think very hard before I make my decision,''  
Barkley, 36, said Saturday night after he led the Rockets with 20 
points in a 98-88 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers that ended 
Houston's season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win a championship and I also want to walk away  
playing at a high level. I'm going to sit back and think it through 
before I make any decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley scored 30 points in Thursday's victory over the Lakers,  
the only game Houston won in the best-of-5 series. His 23 rebounds 
Thursday were one short of a career playoff high and his 15 
boards-per-game average was tops in the league in the opening 
postseason round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, we are going to be a year older next year and I  
don't know what we can do,'' he said. ``I like everyone on this 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year has been fun because we have some great guys but the  
big question is how good can we be. I'm leaning toward 
retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 24 points-per-game average in the playoffs was the best  
among the Rockets and well over his 16-point average for the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, after 14 years in the NBA and the last three in  
Houston, played this season for the league minimum $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play just for money,'' he said. ``I want to  
win. It's going to be a hard decision. It all comes down to how 
good this team can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley is a former league MVP and is one of only three players  
in NBA history to top 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 
assists in a career. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed nearly two weeks of the regular season after  
undergoing arthroscopic surgery to his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, it is going to take a lot for me to come back  
and play basketball,'' he said. ``I'm disappointed it (the season) 
ended but we did the best we could. I'm at peace with myself.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Now Have Fernando-Mania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Fernando Tatis saunters over to the clubhouse  
CD player, slips in his music and cranks up the volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody in the St. Louis Cardinals' clubhouse complains about the  
frenetic sounds of Spanish rapper Boca C. And why would they? 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark McGwire says I'm `The Man,' so I can play whatever I  
want,'' Tatis says with a high-pitched laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard to argue with a man who set a major league record last  
month by hitting two grand slams in the same inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old native of the Dominican Republic used to be  
known more for his wacky hairstyle -- a shock of bright blond hair 
stands out on the right side of his head. Now it's his homers, 11 
of them going into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he's on a team that features another slugger. But is  
there room alongside Big Mac Land for a Fernando Land in the 
left-field bleachers? What about that empty slot on the scoreboard 
used last year to track the McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run race? 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' Tatis says. ``I haven't done anything to deserve  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not yet. But star status appears to be approaching fast  
for Tatis, who at 5-foot-10, 170 pounds is dwarfed by the 6-5, 
250-pound McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask Tatis how he generates so much power in such a compact body,  
and the 70-homer man comes up again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that Mark McGwire stuff,'' he says with another laugh,  
joking about the testosterone booster androstenedione that Big Mac 
made famous last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seriously, he said the secret is a combination of daily  
weight-training, adjusting to pitching tactics and just trying to 
make good, solid contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to be big to hit 30 or 40 home runs,'' Tatis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Mike Easler underestimated Tatis in spring  
training when he predicted the third baseman would hit 20 home 
runs. Now, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``The man's got a stroke,'' Easler said. ``He's learning what  
pitchers are doing to him. He's starting to figure these things 
out. He's one of the best. His wrists, his hands, his upper body, 
his balance. He's got good snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa has seldom been around such a quick study.  
Tatis equaled his 11-homer output from last season on May 6, and 
entered the weekend third in the NL in homers and second with 34 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a wild swinger,'' La Russa said. ``The more  
discipline he has, I tell you, the sky's the limit for him as far 
as average and production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who had eight homers going into the weekend, has been  
reluctant to talk about Tatis at times, apparently not wanting to 
steal any attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fernando and Joe have been carrying us,'' McGwire said, also  
referring to rookie outfielder Joseph McEwing. ``That's how you win 
championships. It's not one guy. It's not two guys. I encourage you 
guys (reporters) to talk about them all you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The talk about Tatis began right away this year.  
</P>
<P>
	He started his second full major league season by homering in  
the first three games, threatening the record of four straight to 
open the season set by Willie Mays in 1971 and equaled by McGwire 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With McGwire batting ahead of him, Tatis broke a different  
record on April 23, hitting the first two grand slams of his career 
off Chan Ho Park in the third inning in Los Angeles. McGwire 
singled to load the bases once, then flied out to shallow right to 
leave them loaded the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis smiles at the memory of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always think about it, because it was a good day,'' Tatis  
said. ``It comes back to my mind probably every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers most likely don't have pleasant memories of letting  
Tatis go on the trading deadline last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the deal looks like one of the great stretch-drive  
steals, ranking with the Jeff Bagwell for Larry Andersen deal the 
Astros pulled off with the Red Sox, or the John Smoltz for Doyle 
Alexander heist the Braves worked with the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade brought right-hander Todd Stottlemyre and shortstop  
Royce Clayton to the Rangers, and helped them make the playoffs. 
But Stottlemyre, who had priced himself out of the Cardinals' 
market anyway, then signed a free-agent deal with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton, once considered the heir apparent to Ozzie Smith in St.  
Louis, so far has been a flop with the Rangers. He was in a 
5-for-59 drought and batting .150 when he was sidelined earlier 
this month with a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals also got left-hander Darren Oliver in the bargain,  
and he's been one of their most consistent starters. Only the 
McGwire trade-deadline deal with Oakland in 1997 was better for 
general manager Walt Jocketty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they made a mistake,'' Tatis said of the Rangers.  
</P>
<P>
	His initial reaction to the trade was bitterness. He had spent  
his entire career in the Texas organization since signing as an 
undrafted free agent in 1992, and thought it might end that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know in baseball; you never know where you're  
going,'' he said. ``Today, I'm here. Tomorrow, I don't know where 
I'm going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jocketty said Tatis won't be going anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a young guy who's going to play for us for a long time,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> DWI Charged Dropped Against Pippen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A drunken driving charge against Houston Rockets  
forward Scottie Pippen has been dropped after prosecutors 
determined there was not enough proof he was intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion to dismiss the driving while intoxicated charge was  
accepted Friday in the Harris County Criminal Court-at-Law of Judge 
Sherman Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie knew all along that he wasn't intoxicated,'' said  
Rusty Hardin, Pippen's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, was arrested in early April 22 after running a red  
light downtown, the arresting officer said. Pippen denied being 
drunk afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested after faring poorly in a field sobriety test and  
was booked after refusing a breath blood-alcohol test. He spent 
less than six hours in jail before his release in lieu of $500 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrons of downtown's Jones Bar said Pippen was there after an  
April 21 game with teammates Charles Barkley and Matt Maloney. The 
Rockets had lost 109-95 to the Dallas Mavericks in Compaq Center, 
with Pippen scoring only four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen appeared in court briefly on April 30, and his next court  
date had been set for May 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harris County district attorney's office and Pippen could  
not immediately be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE>  Injury Forces Connors To Leave Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jimmy Connors, just four points from victory  
against Jose-Luis Clerc, retired with a torn abdominal muscle 
Friday in the quarterfinals of the Sprint PCS Champions seniors 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors was leading 6-3, 5-4 and would have been serving for the  
match when he requested trainer Bob Donatelli for the third time. 
Donatelli advised Connors to stop or face a six-month layoff if the 
injury got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Connors, lying on the training table with his right  
hand on his forehead and his left hand holding an ice pack on his 
ribs, said he first felt the injury while serving in the first set. 
In the second set, his serves were slow and short. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I played a couple of long points, I had problems taking  
deep breaths,'' Connors said. ``I was OK when I was down hitting my 
groundstrokes, but on my serve I wasn't getting any pace and it 
wasn't getting any better. If we just had a returning match out 
there, I'd have been OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connors, who had won the tour's two previous tournaments and had  
a six-match winning streak, said he didn't try to finish the game 
to get the victory because he would have been forced to default in 
the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people deserve some tennis on the weekend,'' Connors said.  
``If I'm not going out there 100 percent, it's not right for me to 
play. I'm not like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clerc could only shrug his shoulders as he accepted the winner's  
applause leaving the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel so happy because I beat Connors in this way,''  
Clerc said. ``I think it's really bad for the tournament because 
everybody wants to see Jimmy Connors. It's really difficult to play 
when you see somebody in pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donatelli said Connors might be able to play in the tour's next  
event, June 8-13 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	John McEnroe, the tournament's top seed, opens play Saturday  
against Mikael Pernfors, who beat Eddie Dibbs 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Tim Wilkison defeated John Lloyd 6-0, 6-3 and Mats  
Wilander beat Mel Purcell 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).

<HEADLINE> Youth Nabbed for Planting Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy angry with a classmate  
stalked her family and planted seven pipe bombs in her parents' 
cars -- one of which exploded while the mother was driving, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonya Corn was not injured in Friday's blast on a state highway  
about 60 miles west of Indianapolis. The device was one of three 
pipe bombs tied to her exhaust pipe. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the other two devices n the road, which was closed  
for about seven hours so the bombs could be detonated. Later, at 
the family's home in Brazil, four other bombs were found attached 
to the vehicle of Mike Corn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all happened today, and we ain't in the mood to discuss  
nothing,'' Corn said when contacted by The Associated Press. 
``We've told our story to the police 30 or 40 times today 
already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators arrested the boy, who was not identified, at his  
middle school on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The juvenile is being detained for an act that would be  
considered a felony, if committed by an adult,'' state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy began stalking the Corn family after their daughter told  
school officials the boy had brought a gun to school, authorities 
said. School officials say the girl's report was not confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents notified police and named the boy in a  
``stalking-type'' report several weeks ago, said Trooper David 
Kuhn. He is due to appear in juvenile court Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Probes Strike on Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO confirmed today that it  
attacked a Kosovo village where Serbian media reported scores of 
ethnic Albanian refugees were killed. Alliance planes pounded 
Kosovo in what the Yugoslav state news agency termed ``ceaseless'' 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb Media Center said earlier that 79 people were confirmed  
dead in the village of Korisa, but Belgrade's private BK television 
reported today that the death toll had risen to 84 because five 
injured refugees died overnight in a hospital in Prizren in 
southwestern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO called the village ``a legitimate military target,'' saying  
it was a military camp and command post. In its statement, the 
19-member alliance noted it could not confirm the casualty figures 
given by the Serb authorities but said it ``deeply regrets 
accidental civilian casualties that were caused by this attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea suggested that the refugees may have  
been used as human shields to protect military equipment deployed 
in the village. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the problems we have is that we are up against an  
adversary who is without any scruples when it comes to mixing his 
armed forces in with internally displaced persons ... and even ... 
using these as human shields on bridges,'' Shea told the British 
Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have to attack those forces because otherwise we cannot  
stop the ethnic cleansing,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Milisav Paic, a spokesman for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry,  
dismissed claims that Serbs were using refugees as human shields as 
``crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt it was NATO who carried out the raids  
against civilians and they cannot just simply try to get rid of any 
responsibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters taken to the village, on the road between Prizren and  
Suva Reka in southern Kosovo, saw dozens of bodies strewn on the 
ground. About 20 to 30 tractors were charred and wrecked, some 
still burning hours after the bombing. Two craters, apparently 
caused by bombs, were visible on the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid wrecked buildings and smoldering tractors, a group of 50  
crying women and children huddled in the cellar of a village home, 
trying to decide what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the exact number (killed). Many. Everyone was  
sleeping,'' said one dazed survivor, Feriz Emini. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanians in Korisa had emerged from weeks of hiding  
in the woods and stopped overnight in the village near Prizren when 
the bombs struck, survivors told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 14, 75 refugees were killed when NATO mistakenly  
attacked a convoy near Djakovica. NATO has admited other accidental 
strikes against a residential neighborhood in the southern city of 
Nis; a civilian bus on a bridge in Kosovo; a passenger train; a 
village in southern Serbia; and most notably the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	At the U.N. headquarters in New York, the Security Council on  
Friday adopted a statement expressing the council's ``profound 
regrets'' over the embassy bombing. Agreement on the statement's 
wording was reached only after hours of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, Vojislav Seselj, an ally of President Slobodan  
Milosevic and the leader of the far-right Serb Radical Party, 
dismissed any possibility the government would give in to NATO 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also announced it had started compiling  
information about damage inflicted by NATO bombing. The measure may 
be a prelude to a in a prelude to a possible later attempt to claim 
a compensation from the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency reported ``ceaseless'' NATO air  
activity over Kosovo on Friday night. Tanjug said NATO missiles 
blasted targets near Prizren, Djakovica and Lipljan. Tanjug said 
NATO jets were also active in the skies over the provincial capital 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Later the agency said that NATO fired six missiles on Urosevac  
county and the town of Stimlje in the south and another five on the 
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica early today. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also bombed two bridges across Toplica river near the  
Serbian town of Kursumlija, just north of the Kosovo province this 
morning, Tanjug said. The bridges had been repeatedly targeted 
during NATO's air campaign and were also hit Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, NATO struck several central Serbian towns, Tanjug  
reported. Nine ``powerful blasts'' shook an area just outside the 
town of Cacak, 70 miles south of Belgrade. A series of strong 
explosions also were heard near the town of Kraljevo, 75 miles 
southeast of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports on casualties or damage, but a  
huge fire raged near Cacak, where two factories and a residential 
suburb are located, Tanjug reported. Several missiles also hit near 
the town of Uzice, about 75 miles southwest of Belgrade, possibly 
targeting an airfield already hit in previous air raids, the agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance also bombed again the Belgrade-Nis highway in the  
vicinity of Jagodina, 75 miles south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanians in Korisa had emerged from weeks of hiding  
in the woods and stopped overnight in the village near Prizren when 
the bombs struck, survivors told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO wants the total withdrawal of Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic's forces from Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb 
republic, and the return of the refugees, as well as the deployment 
of an international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	About 780,000 ethnic Albanians have left Kosovo, which had a  
pre-war population of 2 million, since NATO bombings aimed at 
forcing Milosevic to accept a Western-dictated peace plan began 
March 24.

<HEADLINE> Winter Olympics Mascots Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A snowshoe hare, a coyote and a bear -- all  
characters in western Indian myth -- will be the mascots for the 
next Winter Olympics, 1,000 days from now. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuddly mascots were introduced Saturday night to more than  
15,000 onlookers, many wearing parkas to fend off the unseasonably 
chilly, 47-degree weather. The crowd cheered wildly as man-sized 
models of the critters were unveiled on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-foot arrowhead-shaped clock to count down the days also  
was unveiled in a long-awaited celebration in this city rocked by 
Olympic scandal. The mascots were scheduled to debut in February, 
but revelations over the excessive wooing of International Olympic 
Committee members by Salt Lake bidders earlier this decade stalled 
the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	But memories of the scandal didn't keep away the crowds.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Butler, a retired schoolteacher, admitted her enthusiasm  
for the games has been dampened by the bribery revelations, but 
said she didn't want to miss a chance to be part of the first good 
news for Utah's Olympics for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization that has been blighted,'' Butler  
said. ``We can get it on the right track again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the unveiling, Indian storyteller Billy Daydodge,  
encircled by dancing children and lighting that brought to mind a 
desert campfire, explained the three mascots' place in American 
Indian myth. Each mascot wears a charm around its neck fashioned 
after the ancient rock drawings of two Utah tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	When the lights came on, revealing a snowy mountain backdrop,  
some of the children on stage threw themselves into the arms of the 
giant creatures for hugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tammy Gergen, who came from Boise, Idaho for the ceremony with  
her children Rhandi, 17, and Autumn, 14, said it seemed the smaller 
children liked the bear best. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like he's ready to hug them, with his arms wide  
open,'' Gergen said. But her teens said they preferred the coyote 
and the hare because, ``they're cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adults liked the mascots too, which look more like cartoon  
animals than the far-out design for Izzy, the mascot of the Atlanta 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have something real instead of looking like  
strange creatures,'' said Gerri Camden, who came with her husband 
Rob and 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Camden was disappointed  
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for the Jello man,'' he said, poking fun at Utah  
residents' reputation as the country's greatest consumers of Jello. 
In fact, an Olympic pin modeled on green Jello sold out within days 
of its introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of Jello, spectators lined up by the hundreds  
at booths to buy hats, pins and T-shirts bearing the mascots' 
images. 
</P>
<P>
	That was good news for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which  
will depend on the critters to bring in a good share of $40 million 
to $50 million in merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney thanked the crowd for showing up --  
and for pitching in their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're buying things, that helps too,'' Romney said. ``We've  
had a bit of a drought. People were a little nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing three mascots instead of one trebles the marketing  
opportunities, an approach favored by recent Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the hare, coyote and bear represent the land and  
culture of Utah and the American West and the Olympics' Latin motto 
of Citius, Altius, Fortius -- or swifter, higher, stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their stories are a wonderful translation of a Native American  
legend into the symbolism of the Olympic movement,'' he said. ``The 
theme of swifter, higher, stronger crosses the boundaries of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee made its choice of mascots 1 1/2 years ago  
after consulting five American Indians, including experts in 
ancient rock art, as well as focus groups in Phoenix, Milwaukee and 
Salt Lake. The IOC approved the mascots last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah schoolchildren will begin voting on names for the mascots  
on Monday, and a national mascot-naming contest is planned this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The first known Olympic mascot was Smoky, a dog who likely  
wandered into the Olympic Village at the Los Angeles Games in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not until 1968 that organizers began using characters  
to market the Olympics. The 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble, France, 
used Schuss, a bubble-headed creature on skis, and the 1972 Games 
in Munich used Waldi the dachshund. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gift of Sight Confounding for Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENOSBURG FALLS, Vt. (AP) -- If Eva Suggs could, she would paint  
the world purple. She would live in a purple house and sleep on a 
purple pillow and drive a purple car. Sometimes, she would permit 
other colors into her world, but they would have to be bright, 
really bright, like the cherry-red barns that dot the Vermont 
countryside, so pretty beneath the great blue sky and the green 
hills that seem to roll forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva chuckles. She knows the most she will ever have is a purple  
dress. But an old lady can dream. 
</P>
<P>
	And now she can see.  
</P>
<P>
	Eva was born blind, victim of a rare genetic corneal defect that  
was passed on from her paternal grandfather, and that she, in turn, 
passed on to her children and their children and their children. A 
year ago she received what she calls her great gift -- an operation 
that gave her sight. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly 80 years of fumbling about in a colorless world,  
Eva can march down the pale yellow corridors of her rest home 
without touching the walls. She can revel in the twirl of a blue 
and gold dress. She can thrill at the way Felix the cat turns 
drowsily toward her when she calls his name. She can sneak 
delicious glances in the mirror to fix her hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sight,'' Eva says joyfully, ``is a gift from God.''  
</P>
<P>
	God's gift has already fulfilled her most treasured dream -- to  
see photographs of her parents before she dies. And it has let her 
gaze into the beautiful brown eyes of 2-year-old Renee, who, at 4 
months, had the same eye surgery as her great grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eva's gift came with its own set of obligations and  
questions and worries. The world seems to expect so much now that 
she no longer leans on her red and white cane. Eva expects so much 
of herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Her vision is far from perfect. By most standards she is legally  
blind -- a notion that seems ridiculous to Eva as she proudly reads 
aloud the biggest letters on the doctor's chart, or points out the 
color of a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva knows that blindness has sheltered her from more than the  
light. It shut her off from decisions, like what clothes to wear or 
where to hang pictures on the wall. It shut her off from an 
education, from a cluttered mind. 
</P>
<P>
	She worries about falling. She worries about losing her gift and  
being suddenly thrust back into darkness. Most of all she worries 
about her place in this dazzling world of daylight, where reds and 
yellows and golds glisten in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	Eva is nervous. She fusses about her room, straightening her  
dress, touching up her hair, lingering in the comfort of the drawn 
shades. Finally, she takes a deep breath and steps into the light. 
</P>
<P>
	This sunny afternoon is a big one. Eva is taking her first  
stroll down Main Street. Her steps are labored, her gait hesitant. 
At times she looks frightened and lost. ``It's exciting,'' Eva says 
gamely, her pale greenish-blue eyes watering in the glare. 
</P>
<P>
	She refuses to wear the thick black glasses the doctor gave her.  
Not here, not on Main Street, not where she might meet someone she 
knows. No, Eva wants to walk down the street and nod at neighbors 
and smile her good mornings to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But every step brings confusion.  
</P>
<P>
	Eva has no idea why there are so many cheerfully decorated  
banners flapping outside the stores. Sure, they look pretty, but 
aren't they supposed to signify something, like a parade or a 
holiday? Surely store owners don't just hang them out for 
decoration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be something on,'' she concludes.  
</P>
<P>
	The clothes store is enticing, but there are three wooden steps  
outside. Steps are a crisis. They swirl before her, a blur of 
crisscrossing lines. She has no idea how high they are, how low, 
how far apart. She misses her cane. 
</P>
<P>
	In the window of a children's store, her eyes settle on a poster  
of Winnie-the-Pooh. Eva grew up on an isolated farm near the 
Canadian border. The only bears she knows of are wild ones. She has 
no idea what to make of this tubby little creature with his honey 
pot. Disconcerted, she moves on. 
</P>
<P>
	A yellow sports car screeches to a halt at the stop sign, its  
radio pounding loud enough to make the pavement pulse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like a band,'' Eva says, beaming at the two youths  
inside. They throw bored, disdainful glances her way. Eva is 
thrilled. She can't get over the ever-changing expressions on the 
faces of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The youths roar off and return a few minutes later. Eva smiles  
at them again. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Eva grew up on Isle La Motte, a tiny island on Lake Champlain,  
dotted with cornfields and apple orchards, drenched in a beauty 
that as a child she could only feel. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva doesn't need her eyes to find her way to the small brown  
farmhouse where her parents raised 14 children. The smell of the 
shore, the rustle of the trees, the feel of the road tell her she 
is home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't it pretty,'' she says, her eyes confirming the image she  
always carried in her head. 
</P>
<P>
	It's her first trip back in years and, for now, memories are  
stronger than sight: the sound of her sisters teasing her for being 
afraid of cows, the gentle touch of her mother guiding her hands as 
she teaches her to bake a cake, the worried tone of her father as 
he tells her she cannot go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Her family was poor. Her father worked another man's farm,  
milked another man's cows. Eva would help, herding cows, picking 
raspberries, scrubbing floors while her brothers and sisters went 
to school. Eva, the sixth child, was the only one born blind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pa protected me,'' she says. ``He didn't let me leave the  
house. No boyfriends for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When her father died, her mother moved the family to Alburg, a  
tiny town on the Canadian border about seven miles away. Eva met 
Ward Washburn when he came to deliver wood one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva talks of their marriage as one of convenience: She needed  
someone to take care of her, and Ward had just built a house. They 
lived together for about 30 years, raising two children, Lawrence 
and Shirley. The children went to a boarding school for the blind 
in Boston when they were seven, and Eva rarely had contact with 
them after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Today Lawrence's daughter Michelle Willard lives in Eva's old  
house, along with her husband, Shawn, and their daughters, Danielle 
4, and Renee, 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle inherited her grandmother's spunk along with her bad  
eyes. It was she who persuaded Eva to undergo corneal transplant 
operations at the age of 78. The surgery, a relatively simple 
procedure, had been available for years. But no one had ever told 
Eva about it, and at first she was afraid. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Renee convinced her. If the baby's eyes could be opened  
up to the world, why not those of her great-grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva is mesmerized by Renee. She follows the toddler everywhere,  
soaking up every expression, every glance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at her, she's so cute,'' Eva cries, as she hugs the  
wriggling child and wonders, for the first time, what her own 
children looked like at that age. 
</P>
<P>
	Renee's eyes, perfect brown buttons, fascinate Eva most of all.  
Months after the child was born, her corneas, the transparent 
tissue that covers the iris and pupil, began rapidly turning a dull 
gray. The family curse. The medical term for their blindness is 
congenital corneal dystrophy. Doctors say they have rarely seen 
anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the kitchen Eva and Michelle talk about the child, about the  
chances she will have, about their own eyes and the rogue gene that 
swims through their family gene-pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle produces photographs of her father and Eva's son --  
Lawrence -- a strong, handsome man with crooked eyes and a shy 
smile. Eva pores over them sadly. It's hard to look at pictures of 
her children and not feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grandma, there were good times too,'' Michelle says.  
</P>
<P>
	Eva shakes her head. She worries that she wasn't a good enough  
mother, worries that is why Shirley died in her late 30s, and 
Lawrence killed himself at 43. 
</P>
<P>
	The suicide came seven years after the operation that gave him  
sight, and the family has always wondered. Did he choose to die 
because he couldn't cope? Others, overwhelmed by the sudden gift of 
vision, have made that choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva is vague about these and other details of her life she  
doesn't want to talk about. She left Ward in the early 1970s and 
spent the next two decades in a home for the blind in North 
Carolina. There, she learned skills for the first time: Braille, 
typing, crochet. And she was married again, to a blind resident 
named Frederick Suggs, who died of cancer shortly after their 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 her sisters paid for her ticket back to Vermont. Two  
years later Michelle took her to Dr. William Eichner for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The nurses teased Eva about how it was ``love at first sight''  
when they removed the bandages and she gazed into Dr. Eichner's 
eyes. In fact, Eva remembers a dizzying confusion of light, more 
brilliant than she could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daylight,'' she thought. ``So this is what it looks like.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, the light gave way to shapes, to a world that was far  
more cluttered than she had believed. The operations -- one on each 
eye -- took place six months apart, in July 1997 and January 1998. 
During the surgeries, which each lasted about an hour, Dr. Eichner 
removed the bad corneas and stitched in new ones from an eye bank. 
He describes it as replacing windows that were blacked out with 
ones that are clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva spent a night in the hospital after each operation. Then she  
was driven back to the rest home. 
</P>
<P>
	Alone in her room, Eva tried to sort through the emotions and  
colors swimming around in her head. I'm not handicapped anymore, 
she kept thinking. I can see like a normal person. 
</P>
<P>
	But what was normal? Was this the way others viewed the world,  
this chaotic jumble of doors and windows and colors and cars? Eva 
was given no brochures to guide her, no advice on how to cope. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eva knew exactly what to do. She knelt before the crucifix  
above her bed and said a prayer of thanks. Then she took out 
photographs of her parents and stared at them for a long, long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father looked skinnier than she had imagined, her mother  
heavier. 
</P>
<P>
	And her own reflection: That was the most intriguing image of  
all. In a handheld mirror she examined her face, touching her soft 
brown curls, tracing her fingers over her lips when she smiled, 
stroking her cheeks. She liked what she saw. Except for the 
wrinkles. ``My skin was much more smooth before the operation,'' 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Dr. Eichner is surprised by the relative ease with which  
Eva has adjusted to sight. Tests had shown her to be totally blind, 
not able to distinguish any difference between light and dark. 
Today she can read if the print is large enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva says it is not hard to master letters after learning the  
alphabet by touch. Distance is much more difficult. She doesn't 
understand foreground and background. She is startled by the 
constant shifting of her shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	From the window in her room, Eva can see a river and a farm at  
the other side. But she has no sense of how far away they are. She 
sees cows in the field, but she has no idea if there are 100 or 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva knows these are things that her eyes might never learn. She  
professes not to care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to see all that I can,'' she says, ``and not  
worry about what I have missed. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Eva spends her days sitting in her room, gazing at the river and  
her photographs. Her talking watch announces when it is time for 
lunch and bingo and Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	She longs for a Bible with letters large enough to read. She  
fantasizes about going to Hollywood and seeing the faces of the 
stars, especially Dolly Parton, the prettiest one. She would love 
to see a moose. She says she would be content, now that she has 
seen a bit of the world, to close her eyes and die. She is ready to 
see her parents in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you know there is a heaven?'' asks an old man as they  
sit on the rest home porch and discuss God's gift. ``You can't see 
it. You can't see God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I can see all his creations,'' Eva says.  
</P>
<P>
	She clicks her fingers and leans toward the home's pet dog, a  
golden Belgian shepherd. ``Here Beauty,'' she calls. ``Come here 
Beauty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Old and lame and a little blind himself, Beauty shuffles over  
and nuzzles her hand.

<HEADLINE> Spike Lee To Make Ads for Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spike Lee is setting sail with a series of  
recruiting ads for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmaker signed on to make six commercials for the  
oceangoing branch of the military. Using hand-held cameras for a 
fresh look, Lee did documentary-style spots on Navy SEALS, sailors 
in a rock band, exotic travel opportunities and other 
service-related topics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spike may attract a younger audience than our previous  
commercials did,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Karen Jeffries, adding that the 
Navy fell 7,000 recruits short of its goal in 1998. ``Spike can 
give us a different edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first commercial will debut June 4 in movie theaters showing  
the new ``Star Wars'' film before the spot airs on television. Lee, 
who has done commercials for Nike and Levis, has film credits 
including ``Malcolm X'' and ``Do The Right Thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised they picked him, but I think the Navy did the  
right thing,'' said former Lt. Cmdr. Allan Camaissa, who appeared 
in one of the new spots.

<HEADLINE> Hate Crimes Bill Fails in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas lawmakers have abandoned a hate  
crimes bill designed to protect homosexuals, with Democrats blaming 
Gov. George W. Bush for its failure and accusing the Republican 
presidential prospect of showing no leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill named for James Byrd Jr., the black man dragged to  
death behind a pickup truck in East Texas, had the backing of 
President Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have toughened the state's hate crimes law by  
increasing the criminal penalties. It would also would have 
specifically included homosexuals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked repeatedly about the bill, Bush has said only: ``I will  
look at the bill when it makes it to my desk, if it makes it to my 
desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, suggested that  
presidential politics is playing a role, with the sexual 
orientation provision a sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since our governor is a leading presidential hopeful, the eyes  
of the world are on Texas,'' Ellis said. ``Everything we do now 
takes on national implications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill sailed through the Democratic-controlled House but  
languished for weeks in a committee of the Republican-controlled 
Senate. It was abandoned late Friday, a day after two failed 
attempts by Democrats to force a full Senate vote. The Legislature 
adjourns May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``James Byrd Jr. is probably turning in his grave tonight,''  
said Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat. ``He cannot rest, and we 
should not rest, until Byrd and his family can bring closure to 
this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor's office offered  
ideas in an effort to break the stalemate, but critics weren't 
convinced of his support. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants the world to believe that he is a `compassionate  
conservative.' We want the world to know that his compassion does 
not extend to all the citizens of Texas,'' said the Rev. Michael 
Piazza of Dallas' Cathedral of Hope, which claims the world's 
largest homosexual congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dianne Hardy-Garcia, executive director of the Lesbian and Gay  
Rights Lobby of Texas, attacked Bush's neutrality. ``His 
unconscionable, immoral lack of leadership on this issue is both 
tragic and exasperating,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Ricardo Gangeme, a prominent  
Argentine journalist, died Thursday after being shot in the head in 
the Southern city of Trelew. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangeme was editor of El Informador Chubutense and former editor  
of the Buenos Aires daily Cronica. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangeme's wallet was left untouched and robbery did not appear  
to be a motive, police said. Colleagues reported that Gangeme, a 
crusading crime-fighting journalist, recently had received threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge E. Fascetto, president of the Inter American Press  
Association, told a local radio station that hundreds of 
journalists have been killed worldwide through the years, with few 
cases getting solved. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangeme was the first journalist killed in Argentina since the  
January 1997 slaying of Jose Luis Cabezas, a photojournalist for 
the newsweekly Noticias, whose killing remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia and Brazil have recently led the list of journalists  
slain in Latin America.

</P>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Neb. (AP) -- Jack Lowe, a former publisher of the Sidney  
Telegraph, died Friday at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe began working at the newspaper while in high school and  
continued his association with the paper throughout his life. He 
rose to editor of the Telegraph and was a co-owner and co-publisher 
from 1950-1971. He continued to write a column for the paper after 
his retirement until shortly before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	He was honored by the Nebraska Press Association with its Master  
Editor and Publisher Award. He was inducted into the Nebraska 
Newspaper Hall of Fame in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Known affectionately in western Nebraska as ``Mr. Sidney,'' Lowe  
was mayor of Sidney from 1952-1954 and served three times as 
interim city manager in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first executive director of Panhandle Growth Inc.  
from 1973 to 1978 and then served as the first president of the 
shortline Sidney &AMP; Lowe Railroad until its construction was 
completed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, daughter and son-in-law.

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Karl Yoneda, a Japanese-American  
longshoreman who was vilified for his marriage to a white woman, 
died Sunday at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the United States but educated in Japan, Yoneda opposed  
Japan's rising militarism and dodged being drafted into the 
Imperial Japanese Army by returning to America in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	He adopted the name Karl, after Karl Marx.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, while taking part in an unemployment demonstration, he  
was beaten and thrown into a Los Angeles jail. Elaine Black, then 
secretary of the Community International Labor Defense Committee, 
bailed him out. 
</P>
<P>
	The two began living together -- they could not legally  
intermarry in California. Dubbed ``Tiger woman'' by the Hearst 
papers and revered as the ``Red Angel'' by her admirers, she later 
married Yoneda. Their lifelong partnership ended only when she died 
at age 81 a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoneda later became a longshoreman, his wife an office worker.  
Both continued their activism, opposing the Vietnam War and the 
neutron bomb and joining in the ``Free Angela Davis'' campaign.

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Longtime television and print newsman John  
Masterman, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 for an expose 
of corruption in Amarillo, Texas, died Thursday of congestive heart 
failure at University Medical Center. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Ithaca, N.Y., in 1928, he got a start on his journalism  
career while a student at Cornell University. His first job out of 
college was at the Amarillo Daily News, where he rose from general 
assignment reporter to city editor. 
</P>
<P>
	For four years, Masterman worked for Rep. Walter Rogers,  
D-Texas, in Washington, leaving that post to join NBC's Capitol 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	He then covered a variety of stories for radio and television,  
including presidential campaigns, the United Nations and war in the 
Middle East. He also was a frequent contributor to ``The 
Huntley-Brinkley Report'' and ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Masterman is survived by his wife Lucy; his daughters Carrie  
Masterman and Shelby Masterman of New York City; his sons David 
Masterman of Washington, D.C. and Thomas Masterman of Stockholm, 
Sweden.

<P>
	BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Paul Scott Makela, a cutting-edge  
graphic designer whose bold experimentation helped create new 
visual forms that typify the computer-age esthetic, has died. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of a graphic arts business in this Detroit suburb and  
co-director of the Cranbrook Academy of Arts' graphic arts 
department died May 7 of epiglottitis at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital 
in Pontiac. He was 39. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in St. Paul, Minn., in 1960, Makela received degrees from  
the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota College of Art and 
Design, and from Cranbrook in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Makela and his wife, Laurie Makela, founded a  
design-consulting studio that specialized in advanced-technology 
projects for corporate and cultural clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scott was a leading figure in the creation of a new '90s  
electronic esthetic,'' Rick Poynor, former editor of Eye, an 
international design magazine, told The New York Times for a story 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	To Poynor, Makela's graphic visions ``gave an intoxicating  
foretaste of what total immersion in digital media might someday be 
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Makela's survivors include a daughter,  
Carmela, and a son, Nikolai.

	In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court began confronting the legality  
of racial segregation in a case from Louisiana. More than half 
century later, the high court ended publicly sanctioned school 
segregation with its ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education of 
Topeka. The following are some of the court's key rulings in school 
desegregation cases: 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1896. Plessy vs. Ferguson. Upheld 1890 Louisiana law requiring  
railroads to provide ``equal but separate accommodations for the 
white, and colored races.'' Sanctioned state-imposed segregation. 
Became key to widespread racial segregation in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1899. Cumming vs. Richmond County Board of Education. Rejected  
bid to force Augusta, Ga., schools to close high school for whites 
until it reopened black school. Sanctioned unequal treatment. First 
school case to reach the court. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1927. Gong Lum vs. Rice. Allowed Mississippi district to  
require a Chinese-American girl to attend a segregated black school 
instead of school for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1950. McLaurin vs. Board of Regents of the University of  
Oklahoma. Rebuffs rules physically segregating a black student from 
whites in a graduate education program. Considered a precursor to 
the end of state-sanctioned segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1954. Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka. After review of  
cases in Delaware, Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, 
unanimously declared separating elementary and secondary students 
by race violates black children's constitutional rights to equal 
protection of the law. Viewed as landmark ruling, making 
desegregation law of the land. (A year later, court orders the 
districts in the original Brown cases to compy with its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1958. Cooper vs. Aaron. Rejected Little Rock, Ark., district's  
bid to delay desegregation because of the upheaval surrounding the 
opening of its high school the year before to a handful of black 
students. Hampered resistance efforts in South. 
</P>
<P>
	--1964. Griffin vs. Board of Education. Ruled that Prince Edward  
County, Va., one of the districts involved in Brown, was avoiding 
integration by keeping its public schools closed, as it had done 
since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1968. Green vs. New Kent County School Board. Declared in a  
case from Virginia that districts must dismantle segregation among 
students and faculty, staff, transportation and extracurricular 
activities. Court later used six ``Green factors'' to decide 
whether a district had met its desegregation obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1971. Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education.  
Authorized mandatory busing, redrawn attendance zones, and the 
limited use of quotas to be used in desegregation in this case from 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1991. Board of Education of Oklahoma City vs. Dowell. Allowed  
the district to return to neighborhood school formula, saying that 
federal judges should lift such decrees if districts have complied 
with them in good faith and remedied past discrimination ``as far 
as practicable.'' Reaffirmed the notion that desegregation orders 
were supposed to be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1995. Missouri vs. Jenkins. Struck down magnet school plan in  
Kansas City, making it harder for federal judges to order city 
school desegregation plans designed to attract white students from 
the suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Adds Preakness to Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Charismatic, sent off as only the fifth betting  
choice despite his Kentucky Derby victory, moved to the threshold 
of the Triple Crown by winning the Preakness on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strapping chestnut, racing for the fourth time in 42 days,  
unleashed a powerful stretch run that carried him to a victory over 
Menifee, the favorite who also was runner-up in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic looked like a winner even in the post parade as he  
pranced on his toes. In the race, he was back in the pack in the 
backstretch and then unleashed a powerful move four wide on the 
final turn. He took the lead turning for home from his D. Wayne 
Lukas-trained stablemate, Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Charismatic who was a 31-1 shot in the Derby, went off at  
8-1 in the Preakness. His odds certainly will be shorter when he 
tries to become the 12th Triple Crown winner in the Belmont Stakes 
on June 5 at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third year in a row that there is a chance for  
the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. Silver Charm 
tried and failed by three-quarters of a length in 1997, and Real 
Quiet came up a nose short last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, the only filly in the field who was trying to  
give trainer Bob Baffert a third straight Preakness win, was pulled 
up on the backstretch by jockey Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very charismatic,'' said winning jockey Chris Antley,  
who didn't ride last year because of weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
	At the three-eighths pole, Gary Stevens, riding Stephen Got  
Even, was outside Antley. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't have a lot of horse left and he gave me a little  
shot to get out,'' Antley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic shot through that opening and opened a daylight lead  
before Menifee made a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic raced 1 3-16 miles in 1:55 1-5 and won by 1 1/2 lengths  
over Menifee. Badge, a longshot, finished third, another head back. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish were Stephen Got Even, Patience  
Game, Adonis, Cat Thief, Kimberlite Pipe, Valhol, Vicar, Torrid 
Sand and Worldly Manner. Excellent Meeting did not finish. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just another exciting chapter in one of the most  
interesting stories in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, purchased by Bob and Beverly Lewis for $200,000 as  
a weanling, ran for a $62,500 claiming tag on Feb. 11 at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	During the week leading up to the Preakness, Lukas, who now has  
12 victories in Triple Crown races, told anyone who would listen, 
``Don't discredit the horse because I was foolish enough to run him 
in a claiming race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic earned a start in the Derby by finishing fourth in  
the Santa Anita Derby on April 3. Lukas wanted to get another race 
into the colt, who holds his weight, and so he ran in and won the 
Lexington at Keeneland on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Next it was the win in the Derby. And now, the triumph in the  
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be a two-week horse and he's ready to run,'' Lukas  
warned before the race.

<HEADLINE> Base-Closing Plan Fails Senate Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal for another round  
of military base closings has hit a congressional roadblock for the 
third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	In closed-door sessions earlier this week, the Senate Armed  
Services Committee rejected in mostly party line votes both the 
administration's bid for two new rounds of base closings in 2001 
and 2005 and a proposed single round in 2001. The votes came on a 
$288.8 billion military spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans remain upset over what they say was presidential  
meddling to save jobs at bases in vote-rich California and Texas 
during his 1996 reelection campaign. Committee Democrats promised 
another try on the Senate floor but faced an uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the legislation were made public Friday at a news  
conference held by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John 
Warner, R-Va., and Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the committee's 
senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill -- which now goes to the full Senate -- provides $8.3  
billion more than Clinton asked for a variety of Pentagon programs 
for next year, including a 4.8 percent across-the-board military 
pay raise next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It would beef up security at the nation's nuclear weapons  
laboratories in the aftermath of reports of alleged Chinese 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	The package includes $35 million to enhance computer security at  
Energy Department nuclear labs and another $17 million to upgrade 
security clearance investigations of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in a gesture reflecting impatience with Moscow, the panel  
authorized the Pentagon to cut its fleet of 18 
ballistic-missile-carrying Trident submarines to 14, enabling it to 
go ahead with its plans to refit four of the subs for other 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	That move came despite a law requiring the Pentagon to maintain  
the nuclear fleet at 18 until Russia makes parallel reductions as 
part of a 1993 arms-reduction treaty known as START II. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Russian parliament has stalled on the treaty for six  
years. Committee members said they got tired of waiting, suggesting 
NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia and internal political turmoil in 
Moscow make ratification by the Russian Duma even more 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's argument that many U.S. military bases have  
outlived their usefulness and are now costly burdens on scarce 
resources was conceded by Warner. But he said finding a formula to 
completely isolate the process from politics remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I racked my brain to try to find the words to legislate trust.  
I could not do it,'' he said. ``Communities (where the bases are) 
must have total trust in the process. That trust was lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen contends that failure to close  
antiquated bases -- many of them Cold War relics -- could cost the 
Pentagon $20 billion that could be better spent on aircraft 
carriers, jet fighters and other crucial equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said he regretted the  
committee decision. While the administration will continue to press 
Congress for base-closing approval this year, ``I don't think the 
chances are high at this stage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we continue to hope that Congress will see that it's more  
important, particularly at times when our forces are at risk, 
flying over enemy territory, to invest in the future than it is to 
continue to paint buildings that we don't occupy or need anymore,'' 
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing process calls for Congress to authorize a round of  
closings, then for the independent Base Realignment and Closure 
Commission to select which bases to close. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans claim Clinton poisoned the process in an effort  
to save jobs at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif., and 
Kelly AFB in San Antonio, Texas., both targets of a 1995 
base-closing round. The administration denies doing anything 
illegal in its efforts to find private-sector jobs for base 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest rejection comes at a time when both the  
administration and the Republican-led Congress are straining to 
find money to pay for the Balkans conflict and to meet longer-term 
Pentagon needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats alike are still reeling from the  
economic devastation to communities of earlier base closings. Three 
rounds -- in 1991, 1993 and 1995 -- closed 70 bases and depots. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin said he will mount an effort on the Senate floor to  
authorize at least one new round of base closings, even offering 
language he said would effectively remove Clinton and Vice 
President Al Gore from the planning process. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Michigan Democrat admitted it would still be a hard  
sell. ``The problem is that it's difficult for any of us to vote 
for any additional base closings,'' Levin said. ``It's a fact of 
life around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, additional base-closings are opposed by both Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., both with bases in their states that could end up 
on the chopping block.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Poised for Kill Against Kings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings found themselves back  
in the Delta Center on Saturday, still stunned from their 
last-second loss the night before on a last-second shot by John 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we should have had to come back to Utah,''  
Chris Webber said hours after the Kings made a series of defensive 
blunders and gave away Game 4 of their first-round series with the 
Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how that happened. We had it right in our hands.  
That was an unbelievable game for us to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The upstart Kings won two of the first three games in the  
series, and on Friday night, they had a five-point lead at home 
with 90 seconds to play. One Sacramento basket or one miss by Utah 
almost certainly would have meant the Jazz's earliest playoff exit 
in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kings couldn't throw the knockout punch -- and couldn't  
guard anyone, either. Shandon Anderson scored eight straight points 
for Utah, including back-to-back wide-open 3-pointers, and Karl 
Malone and Stockton scored on consecutive pick-and-rolls in the 
final 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton's 23-footer with less than a second to play was the  
final, miraculous blow in Utah's 90-89 win. 
</P>
<P>
	The series-deciding Game 5 is set for Sunday afternoon, and at  
least one King doubts his team's chances on the road against the 
back-to-back Western Conference champs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the game won,'' Jon Barry said. ``I'm not afraid, but  
let's be realistic -- the fifth game of a series in Utah?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the loss was wrenching, the Kings tried to stay loose  
before their Saturday practice. Webber, Jason Williams and Corliss 
Williamson gathered around a courtside television to catch part of 
the Spurs-Timberwolves game before the shootaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we don't truly realize what an opportunity we lost, and  
maybe that's a good thing,'' Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said. 
``We made so many defensive mistakes down the stretch ... but we're 
still real positive, and we know we can win in here, because we've 
done it once already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Jazz played it cool -- even if they didn't look  
that way when they left the Arco Arena court whooping and hugging 
after stealing Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I've never been involved in a game in my life where I  
didn't think we were going to win,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had us on the ropes. I think everybody expected them to  
finish us at their place,'' Malone said. ``There's pressure on 
them. They let it slip away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a late-night flight out of Sacramento which didn't arrive  
in Salt Lake until 2:30 a.m., the Jazz were back at the Delta 
Center 10 hours later for a short practice. They appeared to relish 
the opportunity the Kings gave them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to feel good to put it all on the line,'' Malone  
said. ``This is what you play the game for. We've got our destiny 
back in our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Jazz taught the Kings a lesson in playoff basketball  
during their 30-point blowout win in Game 1, Sacramento has given 
Utah a reminder of what it's like to be young and hungry. Aside 
from Malone's 24.8 points per game, the Jazz have been carried by 
their young players in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know how to get ourselves ready to play in games like  
this,'' said Howard Eisley, who is averaging 12.5 points per game 
and has been Utah's most consistent guard. ``That's an advantage 
for us, all our big-game experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz used a lineup with three guards and small forward Bryon  
Russell in the closing minutes of the Game 4 win. Russell, who 
mildly sprained his ankle in Game 2 of the series, was limping 
noticeably before Saturday's practice, but he and his teammates 
weren't giving away any information on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be fine, and he's going to play,'' said  
Anderson, Russell's closest friend on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz were looking forward to playing in front of their home  
crowd after two games in a noisy Arco Arena. The Jazz complained 
about fans ringing cowbells and blowing whistles from the stands 
behind their bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they expect their own notoriously rowdy faithful to show the  
Kings what unbalanced fanaticism is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to running through that tunnel tomorrow  
and playing this game. My friends are going to have elk calls and 
duck calls and all that,'' Malone said with a grin. ``That stuff in 
Sacramento is over with now. They can use that cowbell next year.''

<HEADLINE> Utah Olympics Pick Cuddly Mascots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A snowshoe hare, a coyote and a bear -- all  
characters in western Indian myth -- will be the mascots for the 
next Winter Olympics, 1,000 days from now. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuddly mascots were being introduced Saturday night to  
thousands of onlookers in downtown Salt Lake City, the host of the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-foot high clock to count down the days also was unveiled  
in a long-awaited celebration in this city rocked by Olympic 
scandal. The mascots had been scheduled to debut in February, but 
revelations over the excessive wooing of International Olympic 
Committee members by Salt Lake bidders earlier this decade stalled 
the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	The hare, coyote and bear are representative of the land and  
culture of Utah and the American West, said Mitt Romney, president 
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their stories are a wonderful translation of a Native American  
legend into the symbolism of the Olympic movement,'' he said. ``The 
theme of swifter, higher, stronger crosses the boundaries of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee will depend on the mascots -- stitched  
on everything from T-shirts to gimme caps and sold as stuffed 
animals -- to bring in a good share of $40 million to $50 million in 
merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing three instead of one mascot trebles the marketing  
opportunities, an approach favored by recent Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee made its choice of mascots 1 1/2 years ago  
after consulting five American Indians, including experts in 
ancient rock art, as well as focus groups in Phoenix, Milwaukee and 
Salt Lake. The IOC approved the mascots last December. 
</P>
<P>
	The local committee tried to blend the Olympic and western  
themes, with the hare representing swifter, the coyote higher and 
the bear stronger. The Olympic motto Citius, Altius and Fortius in 
Latin translates to swifter, higher, stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah schoolchildren will begin voting on names for the mascots  
on Monday, and a national mascot-naming contest is planned this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals appear as major characters in the myth and  
stories handed down to modern Native Americans, the descendants of 
the ancient artists who produced rock art,'' said Laurel Casjens, 
curator of collections at the Utah Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	Each mascot wears a charm around its neck that has been  
fashioned after the original Anasazi or Fremont-style petroglyph, 
two Utah tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first known Olympic mascot was Smoky, a dog who likely  
wandered into the Olympic Village at the Los Angeles Games in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not until 1968 that organizers began using characters  
to market the Olympics. The 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble, France, 
used Schuss, a bubble-headed creature on skis, and the 1972 Games 
in Munich used Waldi the dachshund. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Winter Olympics in the United States, at Lake Placid in  
1980, used Roni the raccoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary was the first to have multiple mascots -- Hidy and Howdy  
in 1988. Nagano, Japan, had the Snowlets, four cartoon owls, last 
year, and Sydney's 2002 Summer Games have Oly the kookaburra, 
Millie the echidna and Syd the platypus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday is actually 1,000 days before the games, but in this city  
conscious of setting aside that day for rest, worship and family, 
the celebration was planned the night before, ending at 11:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Man Runs on Pimlico Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Disaster nearly struck at Pimlico Race Course  
on Saturday when a man made his way onto the track during the 
seventh race but somehow avoided being trampled by the onrushing 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred several hundred yards from the finish line  
and about 2 1/2 hours before the running of the Preakness. As fans 
gasped in disbelief, horses charged by on both sides of the man 
without hitting him. The man punched at two horses as they galloped 
past him, forcing jockey Jorge Chavez to pull up Artax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to pull my horse up completely,'' Chavez said. ``I saw  
him and I did not know whether to go to the left of him or go to 
the right of him. I waited until the last second to avoid him (and 
then) he punched at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security officers quickly apprehended the man, with one officer  
throwing him to the ground and putting his face into the dirt. He 
was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore police arrested 22-year-old Lee Ferrell and took him  
to Sinai Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Charges are 
pending, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's completely crazy and determined to commit suicide  
by walking on a race track, there's nothing anyone can do to stop 
that,'' said Joe DeFrancis, president and CEO of the Maryland 
Jockey Club, which operates Pimlico and Laurel. ``We don't assume 
people are going to come here and try to kill themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrancis said there were more than 1,000 security personnel at  
Pimlico on Saturday, but they did not line the track along the 
stretch as they do during the running of the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The man had made his way to the track from the infield, getting  
past numerous security men. After negotiating a fence separating 
the fans from the turf course, he staggered to the inside rail, 
which he pounded with his fist before ducking under it and getting 
onto the main track. 
</P>
<P>
	There he stood with his fists clenched and arms upraised  
awaiting the oncoming horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The stewards posted an inquiry into the race, and after several  
minutes, allowed the order of finish to stand but money was 
refunded to those who bet on Artax, the 4-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True, ridden by Jerry Bailey won the race, the $200,000  
Maryland Breeders' Cup. The Trader's Echo was second and Purple 
Passion third in the eight-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I turned for home I couldn't believe my eyes,'' Bailey  
said. ``I thought I saw a man standing in the track. And as I got 
closer, I realized it was ... As I got closer, he seemed to spread 
his legs and brace his arms to get hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Wilson also was amazed.  
</P>
<P>
	``My horse just checked himself,'' said Wilson, who was aboard  
Purple Passion. ``I've never seen anything like this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Preakness a year ago, a power outage shut down betting  
windows in the clubhouse and grandstand about 90 minutes before the 
big race. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire at a transformer three blocks from the track just before  
the fifth race, after a circuit overloaded in the 96-degree heat as 
homeowners cranked up their air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The track lost nearly $2 million. Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.  
spent millions to replace transformers in the area and track 
officials installed five generators near the backstretch to prevent 
another catatrosphe.

<HEADLINE> Report Probes Minority Health Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minorities lag behind whites in the United  
States on nearly every health measure, from life expectancy and 
disease rates to health insurance and access to care, according to 
a report documenting the widespread disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	The disparities are well-known among health professionals, who  
point to economics, health systems, racism and culture in trying to 
explain them. 
</P>
<P>
	``No simple solutions would eliminate these disparities,''  
concludes the report, released Friday by the Commonwealth Fund, a 
New York-based research group. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher has made eliminating racial health  
disparities one of his primary goals, and he frequently speaks on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The disparities are not just in the receipt, but also the  
delivery, of health care. While 24 percent of Americans are black, 
Hispanic or Native American, just 7 percent of the doctors are. 
</P>
<P>
	The report offers a collection of statistics that together paint  
a comprehensive picture of racial disparities in health: 
</P>
<P>
	At birth:  
</P>
<P>
	--A white boy born in 1996 has a life expectancy of 74 years; a  
black boy's life expectancy is 66. For a white girl, it's nearly 
80; for a black girl, just over 74. 
</P>
<P>
	--Infant mortality is more than twice as high among blacks than  
whites and more than 1.5 times higher among native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than twice as many black babies are born underweight than  
white babies. 
</P>
<P>
	As children:  
</P>
<P>
	--Black infants were more than twice as likely to die of sudden  
infant death syndrome as white babies in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	--29 percent of Hispanic and 19 percent of black children lack  
health insurance, compared to 11 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in three black adolescents often feels unsafe at school, at  
home and in his neighborhood. Among whites, it's 15 percent. Rates 
are also high for Hispanics, at 22 percent, and Asian Americans, at 
26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As adults:  
</P>
<P>
	--Black men are some 38 percent more likely to get prostate  
cancer than white men and more than twice as likely to die of it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Black women are less likely to get breast cancer but more  
likely to die of it. 
</P>
<P>
	--About one in four blacks and one in four Hispanics rates his  
own health as fair or poor. Just 18 percent of whites do. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 39 percent of blacks and 46 percent of Hispanics do not  
have a regular doctor. Among whites, it's just 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--64 percent of whites age 25 and up visited a dentist in 1993.  
Among blacks and Hispanics, it was 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--38 percent of Hispanics and 24 percent of blacks did not have  
health insurance in 1996. Among whites, it was 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mother Recalls Rescue From Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MULVANE, Kan. (AP) -- A miracle and a blessing.  
</P>
<P>
	It's how Karen Kraus describes the five-hour rescue of her  
17-month-old son, Jessy, who had fallen into a well in the family's 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	The toddler was released Friday from HCA Wesley Medical Center  
12 hours after his nationally televised rescue in Mulvane, 20 miles 
south of Wichita. He had been trapped 16 feet below ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters dug a hole by hand alongside the well to get him  
out because they feared the use of heavy equipment would injure 
him. Rescuers and neighbors cheered when Jessy was brought to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``He smiled for me. He knew me. He looked at me. It is a smile I  
won't ever forget,'' Mrs. Kraus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessy suffered from exposure and some scrapes, said Dr. Curt  
Pickert at the Wichita hospital. The boy ate a plate of scrambled 
eggs at the hospital Friday, then went home to take a nap. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little boy is going to live and have a normal life thanks to  
them,'' said Annie Schlaegel, the boy's maternal grandmother, of 
his rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kraus and her husband, Jerry, who also have an 8-year-old  
son, Cody, were digging the dirt well in a new subdivision. It is 
only 8 to 10 inches wide and 25 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus, a truck driver, saw his son fall in but couldn't reach  
him in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it took was one second,'' Mrs. Kraus said.  
</P>
<P>
	Under flood lights, about 50 emergency workers dug a hole  
alongside the well shaft, seven feet away. Warm air and oxygen were 
pumped to the boy, and a video camera lowered into the well showed 
he was active and not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighter Tim Deneen dug through the last few inches of dirt  
to reach Jessy, comforted him and then slid him out onto a 
backboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordeal was reminiscent of that of a Texas toddler in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
	In Midland, Texas, 18-month-old Jessica McClure created a  
nationwide sensation after she fell into an abandoned well and 
became trapped 22 feet down in a hole 8 inches wide. It took 
emergency crews 2 1/2 days to reach the little girl. Jessica recovered 
from her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Choking back tears at a news conference, Jerry Kraus said he  
couldn't think of a word big enough to thank everybody. Mrs. Kraus 
found some words of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think you are heroes, and we want to thank God for letting  
us keep Jessy,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Paint Toxins Banned in S. Calif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DIAMOND BAR, Calif. (AP) -- In a move that could cost paint  
manufacturers millions of dollars, regulators approved new air 
quality regulations for Southern California in an attempt to 
eliminate toxic compounds thought to contribute to smog and ozone. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted the  
regulations Friday over strong opposition from the industry, which 
said the requirements could force smaller manufacturers out of 
business. The rules will be phased in between 2002 and 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters believe the rules for paint, wood stains and other  
coatings could influence manufacturers across the nation in the 
same way that California laws forced automakers and gasoline 
refiners to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a historic moment in the long-term battle for  
clean air,'' said Barry Wallerstein, the air-quality agency's 
executive director. ``As technology advances and good products 
become available, there isn't any reason for other areas of the 
country not to use them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the rules not only will cost too much but are  
counterproductive. Home and business owners will have to paint more 
frequently because new paints won't have the same durability under 
the hot California sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are faced with a rule that would essentially ban all the  
products we manufacture,'' said Jerry Mulnix, president and general 
manager of Cal Western Paints in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	El Rap, a paint industry association formed to fight the new  
rules, said it may take legal action to prevent them from taking 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The happiest people are regulators who still have not proven  
anything'' about the dangers of paint vapors, said Ken Khachigian, 
a lawyer for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations are designed to reduce ``volatile organic  
compounds,'' vapors released from paint as it dries. Such compounds 
typically are found in highest quantities in glossy, oil-based 
paints used to cover bridges, storage tanks and other outdoor 
structures. In homes, such paints are often used to paint exterior 
doors, bathrooms and kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	Water-based paints used for most home interiors usually are low  
in volatile compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Air quality officials estimate that paint fumes are responsible  
for putting 58 tons of pollutants into the air during the spring 
and summer, when outdoor painting is heaviest. By 2010, the amount 
is expected to climb to 63 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than the amount of pollution produced by 1.8 million  
automobiles or all petroleum refining, storage and transfer 
activity in the region, according to the air-quality agency. The 
new rules would remove an estimated 22 tons of paint pollutants 
from the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has estimated it will cost the paint industry $800  
million to meet the new standards. Industry officials figure it 
will cost much more. 
</P>
<P>
	To be fully compliant, they said, manufacturers would have to  
replace 7,000 formulas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider these regulations to require numerous  
technological breakthroughs,'' said Madelyn K. Harding, product 
compliance administrator for Sherwin Williams, the big paint 
manufacturer based in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> V.A. Probes Unprocessed Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs is trying  
to determine why 1,200 letters and other mail addressed to the 
agency's Board of Veterans' Appeals were delivered but never 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the mail is at least six months old with ``some as  
old as about a year and a few stragglers even older than that,'' 
Richard Standefer, the board's vice chairman, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is responsible for processing all disputed claims  
related to VA benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery was made between May 1-2, when workers were  
reorganizing one of the board's administrative offices and moving 
equipment and furniture. As everything in the office was being 
consolidated, workers discovered the old mail among all the 
correspondence they collected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The methodology was to round up everything, and that universe  
of everything included approximately 1,200 pieces of 
correspondence,'' Standefer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The type of mail discovered was ``all over the ball yard'' but  
mainly included standard correspondence like status inquiries and 
address changes. However, some mail included more time sensitive 
material related to hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation is being conducted by the VA's Inspector  
General Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no need for great, great alarm in terms of the impact  
on huge numbers of veterans,'' Standefer said. ``We're going to 
move very quickly to make whole anybody who has been harmed in 
terms of something that has fallen through the cracks by way of 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	VA officials have been evaluating the mail to determine whether  
it includes material that could have affected a past decision. 
Those cases would be reopened and reassigned to different staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Standefer said the missing mail probably wasn't noticed earlier  
because administrative employees handle up to 500 items of 
correspondence at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be when the workload is perfectly current,'' he  
said. Annually, the appeals board handles ``somewhere in the six 
figures of correspondence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mail under investigation came from the following states:  
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and 
Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE>  Baffert Filly Wins Black-Eyed Susan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Pegram planned to watch today's Preakness  
from an owner's box at Pimlico Race Course, dreaming of what could 
have been for his star filly, Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for Mike, he's going to be sitting in the stands  
and not be involved,'' Silverbulletday's jockey, Gary Stevens, said 
Friday after the filly set a stakes record in winning the $200,000 
Black-Eyed Susan. 
</P>
<P>
	The best filly in the land was set to run in the Preakness and  
challenge the boys for the first time, but after she drew the 
outside No. 14 post, trainer Bob Baffert and Pegram -- the owner of 
'98 Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet -- opted for the rail and 
an easy race against fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Could she have done the same against the boys?  
</P>
<P>
	``Gary let her out of the gate and she just went with it,''  
Baffert said. ``From the 14 hole, she would have to sustain that 
run all the way. I don't know if even she could do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She did whatever she wanted Friday. A 1-9 favorite,  
Silverbulletday took care of six challengers in a hurry, winning by 
a comfortable two lengths over Dreams Gallore. Vee Vee Star was 
third, 16 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little like a consolation prize,'' Baffert said. ``I  
know the Black-Eyed Susan is a great race, but we had her ready for 
the Preakness. But I always put her before me and I always will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday won her eighth straight race and 11th in 12  
career starts. She covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 4-5, 2-5ths of a second 
better than the stakes record set by Imaginary Lady in 1989. The 
winning time was 3-5ths of a second off the track record set by 
Private Terms, also in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving from the No. 1 post, Silverbulletday took the lead  
around the first turn, and was briefly challenged along the 
backstretch by The Happy Hopper. The daughter of Silver Deputy then 
took charge, moving to a six-length lead with just under 5-16ths of 
a mile left. And even though Dreams Gallore began gaining ground, 
the finish was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could get to her,'' Robby Albarado, Dreams  
Gallore's jockey, said. ``But I thought I could get to her the last 
time (in the Kentucky Oaks). She's a sensational filly, and 
everybody knows it.''

<HEADLINE>  Baffert Filly Wins Black-Eyed Susan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Pegram planned to watch today's Preakness  
from an owner's box at Pimlico Race Course, dreaming of what could 
have been for his star filly, Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for Mike, he's going to be sitting in the stands  
and not be involved,'' Silverbulletday's jockey, Gary Stevens, said 
Friday after the filly set a stakes record in winning the $200,000 
Black-Eyed Susan. 
</P>
<P>
	The best filly in the land was set to run in the Preakness and  
challenge the boys for the first time, but after she drew the 
outside No. 14 post, trainer Bob Baffert and Pegram -- the owner of 
'98 Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet -- opted for the rail and 
an easy race against fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Could she have done the same against the boys?  
</P>
<P>
	``Gary let her out of the gate and she just went with it,''  
Baffert said. ``From the 14 hole, she would have to sustain that 
run all the way. I don't know if even she could do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She did whatever she wanted Friday. A 1-9 favorite,  
Silverbulletday took care of six challengers in a hurry, winning by 
a comfortable two lengths over Dreams Gallore. Vee Vee Star was 
third, 16 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little like a consolation prize,'' Baffert said. ``I  
know the Black-Eyed Susan is a great race, but we had her ready for 
the Preakness. But I always put her before me and I always will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday won her eighth straight race and 11th in 12  
career starts. She covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 4-5, 2-5ths of a second 
better than the stakes record set by Imaginary Lady in 1989. The 
winning time was 3-5ths of a second off the track record set by 
Private Terms, also in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving from the No. 1 post, Silverbulletday took the lead  
around the first turn, and was briefly challenged along the 
backstretch by The Happy Hopper. The daughter of Silver Deputy then 
took charge, moving to a six-length lead with just under 5-16ths of 
a mile left. And even though Dreams Gallore began gaining ground, 
the finish was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could get to her,'' Robby Albarado, Dreams  
Gallore's jockey, said. ``But I thought I could get to her the last 
time (in the Kentucky Oaks). She's a sensational filly, and 
everybody knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was worth $180,000 to Pegram and boosted  
Silverbulletday's earnings to $2,271,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday returned $2.20, $2.10 and $2.10. Dreams Gallore,

<HEADLINE> Hiss Ruling May Open More Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secret grand jury testimony once was  
considered sealed forever. Now, lawyers say a judge's order to 
release such records in the 50-year-old Alger Hiss spy case may 
lead to opening other long-kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility, lawyers say, is the grand jury testimony  
gathered in the 1951 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg atomic spy case. 
But such disclosures still are expected to be extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``This principle of having historic documents that stay closed  
forever doesn't make much sense,'' said Page Putnam Miller, 
director of the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion 
of History, a consortium of 53 organizations. ``We recognize their 
sensitivity and it will always be very exceptional cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a federal judge in New York ordered the release of  
thousands of pages of grand jury testimony in the Hiss case during 
the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the debate continues to this day as to whether Hiss  
was a Soviet spy, U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure said, ``The 
materials should languish on archival shelves behind locked doors 
no longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department opposed releasing the Hiss records and  
has not said whether it will appeal the ruling. Grand jury secrecy 
rules ``are among the most important in our criminal justice 
system,'' U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiss himself sought the release of the same grand jury records  
during the 1970s, and the Justice Department supported him. 
</P>
<P>
	Leisure's order was unusual, but not the first to release grand  
jury records because of historical interest. In 1987, a federal 
judge in New York allowed the release of grand jury records in a 
35-year-old investigation of alleged government spy William Walter 
Remington. In 1990, a federal judge in Tennessee ordered the 
release of records from a grand jury investigation of race riots 45 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury secrecy rule is based on a tradition ``older than  
our nation itself,'' the Supreme Court once said. The secrecy is 
intended to protect people investigated but never prosecuted, 
encourage disclosures by witnesses and ensure free deliberations by 
the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaks from last year's grand jury investigation of President  
Clinton led to public debate about the secrecy rule. In that case, 
the testimony was publicly disclosed by the House of 
Representatives after it received independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr's impeachment report. 
</P>
<P>
	The secrecy rule is not absolute. While it's a crime for  
prosecutors or jurors to disclose what happens in the grand jury 
room, witnesses are free to do so. And federal trial rules list 
limited circumstances when judges can allow testimony to be 
disclosed. For example, grand jury testimony can be released for 
use in a related civil case. 
</P>
<P>
	Historical interest is not one of the listed exceptions. But the  
New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in 1997 that 
judges sometimes can allow grand jury records to be released in 
long-past cases of ``significant historical interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1807 treason investigation of Aaron Burr might be one such  
case, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenberg investigation might be another, said David  
Vladeck, the Public Citizen Litigation Group lawyer who represents 
four historical organizations seeking the Hiss papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is secrecy an end to itself or does the public have a right to  
its history?'' Vladeck said after Leisure's ruling. ``The court 
quite rightly concluded that history is more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vladeck and other lawyers predicted few cases would qualify for  
such disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're not going to see a mass application of this,''  
said Peter Vaira, the former U.S. attorney in Philadelphia. ``I'll 
bet someone will try the Rosenbergs next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Watergate case might one day be a candidate for disclosure,  
said St. John's University law professor John Q. Barrett, a former 
federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a person who thinks grand jury secrecy should be  
forevermore,'' Barrett said. ``We have to start to think about what 
the right interval is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Saltzburg, a George Washington University law professor,  
said the Hiss case ``seems to me a pretty easy case'' because of 
the long passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``It's going to raise the question of how long do  
you have to wait?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are not patient people,'' Saltzburg said,  
adding that Justice Department lawyers may be worried that someone 
might try to get secret records from more recent cases, such as the 
Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawyer suggests that might not be a bad thing.  
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a presumption in favor of disclosure after a  
certain period of time,'' perhaps as little as 10 years, said 
Michael Ross, a New York City criminal defense lawyer who headed an 
American Bar Association panel on grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of society's primary interests is in casting light on the  
commission of crimes and illuminating the way the executive branch 
of government prosecutes crimes,'' Ross said. ``The reason for 
secrecy evaporates over time.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Wins Against Telemarketers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, Va. (AP) -- It all started with a phone call.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, telemarketers called Diana Mey and asked if she was  
interested in buying siding from Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. She said no. 
But the phone kept ringing -- and ringing -- and ringing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey endured 16 months of aggravation and lawsuits in her bid to  
stop the calls, but got no satisfaction until Friday, when Sears 
officials traveled from Illinois to her home in Wheeling with a 
personal apology and a check. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to Mey was ``highly unusual, so it's not  
surprising we would take some unusual steps in response,'' said Tom 
Nicholson, director of public relations for Sears. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Catlett, president of the New Jersey-based Junkbusters  
Corp., credits Mey for being ``far more diligent than most 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were just a few thousand people like Diana Mey taking  
telemarketers to court and making them stick to the law, this 
nation would not suffer such constant interruptions to their dinner 
times,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey's battle began Jan. 5, 1998, with a call from American Home  
Pro, then an independent telemarketing contractor for Sears. She 
told them she wasn't interested, but they kept calling, even when 
Mey requested to be put on the company's ``do not call'' list. 
Under federal law, that means a telemarkerter can't call the number 
again for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey filed a $5,000 lawsuit, but American Home Pro and Sears  
responded with a $10,000 countersuit for wiretapping because she 
tape-recorded her conversations with the telemarketers -- which is 
legal under West Virginia law. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey hired a lawyer, and eventually wound up with an undisclosed  
settlement and an apology from Sears. The countersuit, which had 
flabbergasted Catlett, was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pressing for punitive damages,'' Catlett said. ``The  
idea they should try to punish this woman for trying to protect 
herself ... is a grossly offensive concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mey said she is not trying to put telemarketers out of business.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want them to comply with the law,'' she said. ``People  
think this is a nuisance they have to put up with. They don't.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes Presidential Pay Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The House has begun moving legislation that  
would provide for doubling the president's annual salary to 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A House subcommittee approved the measure Friday. It would  
increase the chief executive's pay effective at noon on Jan. 20, 
2001, the day President Clinton leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjustment would mark the first raise in the president's  
salary since Lyndon Johnson retired 30 years ago. It would double 
the chief executive's salary to $400,000 annually, The Washington 
Post said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation cleared the House Appropriations Committee's  
Treasury-Postal Service subcommittee as part of a $13.6 billion 
spending bill. The House Government Reform Committee's panel on 
management, information and technology is scheduled to review the 
issue May 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The last pay increase for a president was in January 1969, when  
the salary was doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 upon Richard Nixon 
assuming office. A $50,000 annual expense account established by 
Congress for the president also became effective then. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Constitution, pay raises can only be enacted at the  
change of administrations.

<HEADLINE> Pontiac Time Trials Rescheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Winston Cup drivers won't have long to work  
on qualifying for tonight's Pontiac 400 at Richmond International 
Raceway. About seven hours before the race, they'll start trying to 
make the field. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady rain Friday washed out first-round qualifying, forcing  
NASCAR to reschedule time trials to today. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a good thing the drivers know and like this place.  
</P>
<P>
	And they do. Almost everyone looks forward to coming to  
Richmond's three-quarter-mile, D-shaped oval. They say it allows 
for traditional short-track racing with side-by-side duels, and it 
holds rubber better than most layouts because of a sealer applied 
to the track before each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richmond allows more finesse because it's a wider track than  
most small tracks,'' Derrike Cope said. ``You can find a secondary 
lane. It's easier to find your way around someone without having to 
shove their car aside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a twice-a-year stop on stock car racing's premier circuit,  
most veterans have at least one memory from RIR that they recall 
fondly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess Richmond has been pretty good to me and I've been  
pretty good to Richmond,'' said Ernie Irvan, who made his Winston 
Cup debut at RIR in 1987 on the old layout and has two victories 
and two poles on the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had four big days at the track, five if you count my  
first Winston Cup race. I'm looking for another big day'' in the 
race tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett was viewed as a superspeedway specialist with  
problems on tracks of less than a mile until 1997, when he won the 
second race on Bristol's .533-mile oval and shortly thereafter 
gained his only RIR triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett almost had another victory in the spring race last June,  
but was bumped off the lead by Terry Labonte going through the 
fourth turn with two laps to go, and wound up second. Still, he 
enjoys racing here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a number of opportunities'' to win, he said. ``The  
night we actually won the race, that was one we didn't expect. We 
had other times that we thought we were better and didn't win the 
race, so you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Points leader Jeff Burton, a native of South Boston, Va., about  
100 miles southwest of the track, knows winning at Richmond. He 
raced as the defending champion Friday night in the Hardee's 250 
Busch Grand National race, and last fall outran Jeff Gordon in the 
Exide 400 Winston Cup event. 
</P>
<P>
	That race, in which Gordon tailed Burton for the last five laps,  
was considered by many the most exciting event of the season. 
Burton said having a handle on the track's wear and tear helps a 
lot as the race winds down. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the sealer gets worn out on the bottom groove, you try to  
find it somewhere else,'' he said of the sticky asphalt coating. 
``Everywhere else you try to stay out of the sealer. Here you try 
to stay in it.''

<HEADLINE> President's Plane Avoids Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A small commuter plane approaching Air Force  
One as it was preparing to land at Los Angeles on Saturday prompted 
the president's plane to quickly ascend 400 feet and turn left to 
avoid possibly coming too close. 
</P>
<P>
	The two planes never violated the 1,000-foot vertical separation  
requirement, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not a near-miss by any calculation,'' he said. ``They  
at all times maintained required separation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the president, who was aboard, was never in danger.  
</P>
<P>
	Air Force One is equipped with TCAS system, a traffic collision  
avoidance mechanism which alerted the pilot that the oncoming 
commuter plane was ascending to 9,000 feet just as Air Force One 
was descending to 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force pilot responded by taking the president's plane  
higher as a precaution.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Cut in Movie Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- In California for a Hollywood bash to  
raise $2 million for Democrats, President Clinton urged the 
entertainment industry today to re-evaluate the way it portrays 
killing in light of the Littleton, Colo., shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still too much violence on our nation's screens,  
large and small,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hopes the killings at Columbine High School will  
galvanize the public behind a national campaign against youth 
violence. As he headed to a Los Angeles dinner with some of the 
biggest names in Hollywood, Clinton challenged the entertainment 
industry in his weekly radio address to review its ratings systems 
and reconsider the effects on children of glorified screen 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of us has a role to play in giving our kids a safe  
future, and those with greater influence have greater 
responsibility,'' Clinton said. ``We should see movies and music, 
TV programs, video games and advertising for them made by people 
who made them as if their own children were watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he challenged the industry to stop showing guns in  
ads and previews children might see; to strictly enforce ratings 
systems at video stores and theaters; and to re-evaluate the 
ratings system, especially the PG rating, ``to determine whether it 
is allowing too much gratuitous violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among stars on the guest list for the dinner at Greystone  
Mansion in Beverly Hills were Meg Ryan, Dennis Quaid, Goldie Hawn, 
Kurt Russell and Whoopi Goldberg. Political glitterati were headed 
by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and Senate Democratic leader 
Tom Daschle, and the event's hosts were DreamWorks partners Steven 
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized Clinton  
for taking money from some of the same people Lott blamed for an 
increasing laxity in morals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend, the Clinton-Gore regime will be begging for cash  
from one of the polluters responsible for our nation's moral 
decline,'' he said in a statement issued by his office. ``What's 
the message to our children? Democrats care about your safety -- 
unless it's inconvenient to their partners in Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's focus on the entertainment business' influence on the  
climate of violence in America rankled some industry chiefs, and 
there was some thought that some might withdraw their support for 
Saturday's fund-raiser to benefit House and Senate Democrats in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said no one had backed out to protest Clinton's  
remarks on violence. Not even Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive 
officer of the Seagram Co. Ltd., who shortly after Clinton hosted a 
White House conference on youth violence last week publicly scoffed 
at those who would link the Littleton killings to television and 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the American people who really look to  
their government for leadership instead get finger-pointing and 
chest-pounding,'' said Bronfman, who as the chief executive of 
Universal Studios' parent company oversees an empire that includes 
movies, music and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronfman wasn't attending Saturday's event, but he wrote the  
party a check for an unspecified amount this week. 
</P>
<P>
	From events in Seattle, the San Francisco Bay area and Los  
Angeles, Clinton continues Sunday to fund-raisers in San Diego and 
Las Vegas. The four-day take is expected to reach more than $3 
million for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who plans to visit Littleton with the first lady  
Thursday, applauded Hollywood for its voluntary ratings system for 
TV shows and the V-chip to enforce parents' decisions on what 
children may watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But still, he said, the typical American sees 40,000 dramatized  
murders by age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still too many vulnerable children who are steeped  
in this culture of violence, becoming increasingly desensitized to 
it and to its consequences and, therefore, as studies show, 
hundreds of them more liable to commit violence themselves,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He lashed out again at the Republican-led Senate for passing new  
gun-show restrictions that he said were ``riddled with new 
loopholes.'' ``If the Senate wants to fix the problem, it should 
fix the problem, not make it worse,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Baffert Filly Wins Black-Eyed Susan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Pegram planned to watch today's Preakness  
from an owner's box at Pimlico Race Course, dreaming of what could 
have been for his star filly, Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for Mike, he's going to be sitting in the stands  
and not be involved,'' Silverbulletday's jockey, Gary Stevens, said 
Friday after the filly set a stakes record in winning the $200,000 
Black-Eyed Susan. 
</P>
<P>
	The best filly in the land was set to run in the Preakness and  
challenge the boys for the first time, but after she drew the 
outside No. 14 post, trainer Bob Baffert and Pegram -- the owner of 
'98 Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet -- opted for the rail and 
an easy race against fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Could she have done the same against the boys?  
</P>
<P>
	``Gary let her out of the gate and she just went with it,''  
Baffert said. ``From the 14 hole, she would have to sustain that 
run all the way. I don't know if even she could do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She did whatever she wanted Friday. A 1-9 favorite,  
Silverbulletday took care of six challengers in a hurry, winning by 
a comfortable two lengths over Dreams Gallore. Vee Vee Star was 
third, 16 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little like a consolation prize,'' Baffert said. ``I  
know the Black-Eyed Susan is a great race, but we had her ready for 
the Preakness. But I always put her before me and I always will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday won her eighth straight race and 11th in 12  
career starts. She covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 4-5, 2-5ths of a second 
better than the stakes record set by Imaginary Lady in 1989. The 
winning time was 3-5ths of a second off the track record set by 
Private Terms, also in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving from the No. 1 post, Silverbulletday took the lead  
around the first turn, and was briefly challenged along the 
backstretch by The Happy Hopper. The daughter of Silver Deputy then 
took charge, moving to a six-length lead with just under 5-16ths of 
a mile left. And even though Dreams Gallore began gaining ground, 
the finish was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could get to her,'' Robby Albarado, Dreams  
Gallore's jockey, said. ``But I thought I could get to her the last 
time (in the Kentucky Oaks). She's a sensational filly, and 
everybody knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was worth $180,000 to Pegram and boosted  
Silverbulletday's earnings to $2,271,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday returned $2.20, $2.10 and $2.10. Dreams Gallore,  
second to Silverbulletday in the Kentucky Oaks two weeks ago, paid 
$2.10 and $2.10. Vee Vee Star returned $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison's Charm was fourth, followed by Mysterious Jak, The  
Happy Hopper and Magic Broad, who was more than 36 lengths behind 
Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Preakness draw on Wednesday, Baffert figured the poor  
post was a message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to tell us not to run,'' Baffert said.  
``She's a great filly. The Preakness is a great race. But these 
fillies come around rarely. I have to be really careful what I 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Supremacist Gets Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Despite sparing the life of his  
codefendant, a federal jury recommended that a white supremacist be 
executed for murdering an Arkansas family. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Lee, 26, of Yukon, Okla., was convicted along with Chevie  
Kehoe for killing gun dealer William Mueller, his wife Nancy and 
her 8-year-old daughter Sarah Powell. The three were bound in 
plastic and tape and dumped into a bayou. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the jury recommended life without parole for Kehoe this  
week, they ruled Friday that Lee should die for the murders. Lee's 
attorney, Jack Lassiter, said the defense would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the sentencing that Chevie Kehoe received, I'm  
struggling to understand the verdict,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 11-week trial, the prosecution case was pinned on  
Kehoe's role as the leader of a scheme to establish up a 
whites-only nation in the Pacific Northwest. Prosecutors said Lee 
was one of Kehoe's henchmen. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sentencing phase, Kehoe's attorneys portrayed him as  
a loving father of some intelligence who could still do some good, 
even if in prison. Attorneys for Lee argued that he was abused as a 
child and never had the chance at a productive life. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee and Kehoe were convicted last week of racketeering,  
conspiracy and three counts of murder. The jury was assigned only 
to recommend a penalty for the murders; U.S. District Judge G. 
Thomas Eisele will determine the penalty for the other convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimma Gurel, a sister of Nancy Mueller, said she was satisfied  
with the jury's decision Friday. She said she felt that, of the two 
men, Lee was the more volatile. But, she added, ``I believe that 
Chevie deserved the death penalty, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's mother maintained that her son did not commit the crimes.  
</P>
<P>
	``Danny is innocent, regardless of what the verdict is,'' Lea  
Graham said.

<HEADLINE>  Vicar To Run in Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Trainer Carl Nafzger changed his mind today,  
and Vicar was to start from the No. 13 post in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to run,'' Nafzger said at Pimlico after he had  
maintained since Wednesday's post-position draw that he would 
scratch the colt rather than have him start from No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger said one reason he changed his mind was that he measured  
the track and found that the 13 post is not on the crown of the 
track as he believed, but is inside the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said another reason he changed his mind was that the  
Florida Derby winner, a disappointing 18th in the Kentucky Derby, 
was doing so well. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen 3-year-olds had been entered for the 1 3-16-mile  
Preakness, but when the filly Silverbulletday drew No. 14, she was 
scratched by trainer Bob Baffert. She won the Black-Eyed Susan for 
fillies on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert was to try for a third straight Preakness win with the  
filly Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field was Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic.

<HEADLINE> GOP Gov. Calls for Better Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Improving America's schools is the key to  
winning the war on drugs and solving other social ills, 
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said today in the weekly Republican 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge, a two-term governor who has expressed interest in the  
vice presidency, urged policy-makers to base decisions on what is 
good for children and parents, even if those choices are not 
favorable to the education system or the ``adults employed in that 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly, when it comes to improving education I believe we have  
lost our way,'' Ridge said. ``When we talk about improving 
education ... it seems we only talk about the system of education 
and the employees of education,'' such as school board members, 
superintendents and unionized teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge said the United States must make education ``a national  
imperative'' to compete in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we provide our children with a quality education, then I  
believe there is no challenge we cannot overcome,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poverty, urban decay, long-term economic prosperity, a strong  
national defense -- ``all are (challenges) within reach if we give 
our young people the best education in the world. And none are in 
reach if we do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks taped Wednesday before leaving on a 10-day economic  
development trip to Asia, Ridge praised Republican leaders in 
Congress and GOP governors for moving toward an emphasis on 
children and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that Congress recently passed a bill giving states  
greater leeway in spending federal education dollars. President 
Clinton signed the measure into law April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new approach to education,'' Ridge said. ``It gives  
more control to the people who are closest to the kids and less to 
the politicians and bureaucrats in Washington. In other words, it 
puts children first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke of efforts in Texas, Florida and Virginia to improve  
schools and the lives of children and talked of Pennsylvania's 
publicly financed, privately run charter schools that can ``better 
respond to parents' desire and students' needs in their own 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also gave a plug for school choice such as that provided by  
voucher systems favored by Republicans but opposed vigorously by 
Democrats in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``School choice lets parents use a portion of the taxes they pay  
to do what they believe is best for their children,'' Ridge said. 
``It's the ultimate in local control. It puts parents and children 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, however, Ridge failed to get a legislature  
controlled by his own party to approve giving vouchers that parents 
can use to send their children to public, private or parochial 
schools of their choice.

<HEADLINE> Woman Wins Against Telemarketers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, Va. (AP) -- It all started with a phone call.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, telemarketers called Diana Mey and asked if she was  
interested in buying siding from Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. She said no. 
But the phone kept ringing -- and ringing -- and ringing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey endured 16 months of aggravation and lawsuits in her bid to  
stop the calls, but got no satisfaction until Friday, when Sears 
officials traveled from Illinois to her home in Wheeling with a 
personal apology and a check. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to Mey was ``highly unusual, so it's not  
surprising we would take some unusual steps in response,'' said Tom 
Nicholson, director of public relations for Sears. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Catlett, president of the New Jersey-based Junkbusters  
Corp., credits Mey for being ``far more diligent than most 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were just a few thousand people like Diana Mey taking  
telemarketers to court and making them stick to the law, this 
nation would not suffer such constant interruptions to their dinner 
times,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey's battle began Jan. 5, 1998, with a call from American Home  
Pro, then an independent telemarketing contractor for Sears. She 
told them she wasn't interested, but they kept calling, even when 
Mey requested to be put on the company's ``do not call'' list. 
Under federal law, that means a telemarkerter can't call the number 
again for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey filed a $5,000 lawsuit, but American Home Pro and Sears  
responded with a $10,000 countersuit for wiretapping because she 
tape-recorded her conversations with the telemarketers -- which is 
legal under West Virginia law. 
</P>
<P>
	Mey hired a lawyer, and eventually wound up with an undisclosed  
settlement and an apology from Sears. The countersuit, which had 
flabbergasted Catlett, was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pressing for punitive damages,'' Catlett said. ``The  
idea they should try to punish this woman for trying to protect 
herself ... is a grossly offensive concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mey said she is not trying to put telemarketers out of business.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want them to comply with the law,'' she said. ``People  
think this is a nuisance they have to put up with. They don't.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Focuses on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, beginning to  
outline his agenda for the 2000 presidential race, is promoting an 
education package focusing on school safety, after-school programs 
and accountability of teachers and students, advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	To lay out the campaign theme, Gore chose his commencement  
speech Sunday at Graceland College in Lamoni, a small private 
school in the state where precinct caucuses launch the presidential 
nominating season shortly before New Hampshire's primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president plans a series of public policy speeches to  
fill out the political agenda he will offer in seeking the 
Democratic nomination to replace his boss, President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The education package, as described Saturday by Gore aides,  
stresses: 
</P>
<P>
	--An end to ``social promotions'' of youngsters unable to meet  
academic standards while ensuring the students held back have the 
support to help them improve. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stronger testing programs to increase accountability for  
students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	--An increase in technology in the schools.  
</P>
<P>
	--Better school safety.  
</P>
<P>
	In early campaigning, Gore has touted Clinton administration  
efforts to lower class sizes and upgrade crumbling schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll make it clear to people that education is a key  
priority,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley, among those 
Gore consulted on the package. ``I know he's committed to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also sought out school officials from Boston to Chicago and  
with top elected officials such as Democratic Gov. Gray Davis of 
California, where voters put in place limits on class size. 
</P>
<P>
	The speeches come during a crucial period for Gore's  
presidential campaign as he tries to define himself for voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who has announced an exploratory committee for the  
nomination, faces opposition from only one Democrat, former Sen. 
Bill Bradley of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown voters generally happy with the direction the  
country is headed but with questions about Gore's leadership. He 
faces the challenge of defining himself apart from the 
administration without appearing to break with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll released Saturday, Newsweek found most voters  
considered Gore honest, ethical and likable, but they were split on 
his leadership qualities: 44 percent said those qualities are 
strong, 46 percent said they are not. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 19 percent had a lot of confidence in Gore's ability to  
handle foreign policy and 23 percent a lot of confidence in his 
grasp of domestic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found, however, that while Gore still trailed GOP Gov.  
George W. Bush of Texas 51-42 percent if an election were held 
today, that margin was 6 percentage points improved from a Newsweek 
poll a week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll interviewed 431 registered voters Friday and had a  
margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Saturday for Iowa, the vice president stood at  
the Capitol steps and spoke to the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal 
Order of Police in praise of colleagues who died in the line of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the country to honor police contributions to society.  
``We must stand behind the badge,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Luyendyk Begins Practice for 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Arie Luyendyk thought he had seen  
everything. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, who will retire after the  
May 30 race, took his first few practice laps on Saturday and was 
signing autographs for fans along the fence in front of the Tower 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Steve Knapp, the 1998 Indy 500 rookie of the year,  
approached Luyendyk and asked him to sign the front of his driver 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought he was kidding, but he was serious,''  
Luyendyk said. ``That was a first for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, who won the Indy Racing League season finale last  
year, did not compete in the first three races of the season and 
plans to call it quits after his 15th start at Indianapolis. He 
already holds track records for speeds in practice, qualifications 
and the race and in career winnings with more than $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with defending Indy champion Eddie Cheever and season  
points leader Scott Goodyear, Luyendyk was among the favorites as 
practice got under way. Qualifications on May 22-23 will determine 
the 33-car starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I made the decision to retire, I didn't want to just stop  
like that. I didn't feel that was the right way for me,'' Luyendyk 
said. ``To make Indianapolis my last race is the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started in road racing, but people know me because I've won  
the Indianapolis 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk was the 1985 Indy rookie of the year, when he finished  
seventh. He won the race in 1990, when he finished the 200 laps at 
a still-record 185.981 mph, and added his second victory in 1997. 
He also finished second in 1993 and third in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, a two-time runner-up, was second to then-teammate  
Luyendyk in 1997. He also finished second to Al Unser Jr. in 1992 
by .043 second, the closest margin in Indy 500 history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning the Indianapolis 500 has been a dream of mine since I  
first ran here in 1990. Since '92, it's become a focus,'' Goodyear 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian driver, who now lives in the Indianapolis suburb of  
Carmel, was second in the season-opener at Orlando, Fla, and won 
the second race in Phoenix. The third, two weeks ago in Concord, 
N.C., was canceled after three spectators were killed by debris 
from a crash early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, who won in Orlando and was 17th at Phoenix, is third in  
the season standings, behind Goodyear and Jeff Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever switched from the Aurora to the Infiniti engine this  
season and practiced for 58 laps on Saturday, with a top speed of 
221.888 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went very, very well,'' he said. ``We put a brand new car  
on the track today. It ran very well. It's probably the best out of 
the three we have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a bit of a workhorse Infiniti engine in the back and it  
ran very strong, so I'm very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Cheever, the quickest of more than 30 drivers on the  
opening day of practice included Greg Ray at 223.203 mph, 1998 IRL 
series champion Kenny Brack at 222.910, 1996 Indy 500 winner Buddy 
Lazier at 222.596, Sam Schmidt at 222.376 and Goodyear at 221.626. 
Luyendyk was clocked at 216.763.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Rice Idled by Sore Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Glen Rice, averaging  
almost 19 points per game in the playoffs, was a late scratch and 
did not dress for Saturday's playoff game against Houston because 
of a sore right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Fox made only his second start of the year at forward for  
the Lakers in Game 4 of the best-of-5 series, which Los Angeles led 
2-1 heading into Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice underwent surgery on the elbow in January and did not play  
until March 12, when he made his debut with the Lakers two days 
after he was traded from Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Rice, who topped the Lakers with 29 points in their  
101-100 victory in Game 1, was shooting almost 55 percent from the 
field during the series with the Rockets and was a perfect 5-for-5 
from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 25 games he started for Los Angeles, the Lakers were  
16-9. Rice scored in double figures in all but three games.

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Takes Pole for Monaco GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Defending champion Mika Hakkinen won  
the pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix by posting the fastest 
time in today's qualifying session that ended in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a question concerning Hakkinen's lap because he was  
driving too quickly under a yellow flag after Damon Hill's 
Jordan-Mugen-Honda's engine blew up. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen said he was aware of the situation on the final lap.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely. I saw the yellow flag and that's why I put my my  
arm up and slowed down,'' the Finnish driver said. ``I know it 
doesn't look like that because I sitting here with pole position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, whenever have yellow flags you have to be careful  
about it because you know something is in front of you,'' Hakkinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than an hour, the times became official and Hakkinen  
gained his fourth pole position of the season and 14th of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He drove his McLaren Mercedes around 2.092-mile street circuit  
was 1 minute, 20.547 seconds. Michael Schumacher's Ferrari followed 
with 1:20.611. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's time held up for most of the session until Hakkinen  
took it away with a ride that actually ended after the checkered 
flag had officially ended the one-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hakkinen had already started his last lap and was  
allowed to finish with a time that counts. Seconds later Schumacher 
finished his last lap in 1:20.771. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher crashed in today's morning warmup yet still posted  
the fastest time then. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unfortunate I damaged my car at the end of the morning  
session as the spare car wasn't quite as good,'' Schumacher said. 
``But the difference between them was very small as we improved it 
through the session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Todt, the Ferrari team director, thought Schumacher could  
have gone faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael did his best time of his second run but was slowed on  
the third run by another car. Then on his final run, with Hill 
stopped on the track and yellow flags being waved, it was obvious 
he could not improve and Michael drove a cautious lap,'' Todt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Third was Hakkinen's teammate, David Coulthard in 1:20.956  
followed by Eddie Irvine in a Ferrari, 1:21.011. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubens Barrichello in a Stewart-Ford was fifth in 1:21.530.  
Heinz-Harald Frentzen followed with 1:21.556 in a 
Jorden-Mugen-Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivier Panis, who was third in Thursday's free practice in a  
Prost-Peugeot, was down in 18th, 1:22.916. He won in 1996 when 
Schumacher, who had won the two previous races at Monaco, crashed 
on the first lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen's victory at Monaco last year's race helped him to the  
world title. This year, he is trailing Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher is leading the standings for a change entering the  
Monaco race with his Ferrari. In the three previous years here 
behind the wheel of the Italian car, he was always trailing. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after his win at San Marino, he has 16 points compared to  
teammate Eddie Irvine's 12 with Hakkinen tied with Heinz-Harald 
Frentzen at 10 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher has won the Monaco Grand Prix three times but had a  
tough time last year when a wheel arm broke and he stuggled to 10th 
as Hakkinen won.

<HEADLINE> Storm Trackers Learn on Trail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Inside a truck hurtling down the highway,  
Steve McDonald's eyes lock on his radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
	He and fellow University of Oklahoma researchers have been  
tracking small tornadoes across the prairie all afternoon. But on 
the outskirts of Oklahoma City, the saucer-like radar mounted to 
the truck's tail suddenly relays a burst of color that fills the 
monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald can't believe the chaos it shows hidden inside the  
clouds just ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my God, this thing is huge!'' he gasps.  
</P>
<P>
	Storm trackers watch in awe and horror as twisters drop from a  
boiling sky and unleash their deadly power. They stay on the trail, 
knowing the risks they are taking might save lives in the future -- 
maybe, even, that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the experiences of a lifetime, and one I hope I  
never live through again,'' says Brian Swiatowy, who on May 3 
coordinated teams of trackers for KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City. ``But 
you can't help but learn from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike scientists portrayed in the movie ``Twister,'' real  
researchers don't rush headlong into the swirling masses. If they 
did that, they'd be dead, says Joshua Wurman, head of the 
University of Oklahoma's Doppler on Wheels project. 
</P>
<P>
	Most chases end without ever seeing a tornado. But the storms  
that killed 44 people in Oklahoma outdid even Hollywood 
imaginations when it came to number and ferociousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intercepted nine tornadoes that day,'' Wurman says,  
explaining how the truck gets as close as half a mile from the 
funnels to capture radar images that might explain how tornadoes 
are born. ``We were worse than `Twister.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, a ``nice, neat'' little twister pops from the  
clouds in southwestern Oklahoma near Lawton as the researchers 
begin the chase, says McDonald, a university staff member in his 
first season of tracking. 
</P>
<P>
	That twister and a second one dissipate, but the storm keeps  
growing as it moves northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Television stations from Oklahoma City have storm trackers on  
the trail, too. These trackers take video footage that is broadcast 
as meteorologists announce warnings from the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Castor, a meteorologist who tracks storms for KWTV, watches  
as a third tornado spirals down, slender and ropelike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got so close, we got good video of the debris flying,'' he  
says. ``As we were watching it, we didn't know it, but another 
strong powerful storm had formed east of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the darkest, meanest looking sky he has seen in 13 years of  
storm chasing. 
</P>
<P>
	KFOR helicopter pilot Jim Gardner is airborne when he sees a  
tornado drop from this churning sky. He watches as hangars at the 
Chickasha airport disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner moves within three-quarters of a mile of the storm at  
one point but no closer, fearing being sucked into its powerful 
inflow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an edge you ride,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter can change course at will to keep out of harm's  
way. It's a different story on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the Doppler-mounted trucks, navigator Myshelle Bryant  
has to find the roads that will keep them close to the storm 
without landing in its path. It's the first time the meteorology 
student has seen a tornado, but there is no time to marvel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a job to do,'' she says. ``If I didn't do it, it  
could get us into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They shout instructions to each other, but McDonald falls silent  
when his radar shows a half-dozen spinning cyclones and an eye big 
enough to hold a football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really worried about what was in the path,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Motorists speed past them, right into the storm. Rain conceals  
the twister at one point. Swiatowy worries how people in the 
storm's path will react if his teams don't capture it on video. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just thinking to myself, `I'm hoping these people are  
taking this seriously even though they can't see it on their 
televisions,''' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Suburban residents have up to 30 minutes of warnings before the  
twisters hit. 
</P>
<P>
	KOCO storm trackers arrive in one neighborhood about two minutes  
behind the tornado. Residents are still trapped in the wreckage of 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where you have to make a decision to say, OK, let the  
tornado go,'' Swiatowy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trackers steer wide of damaged areas, knowing downed power  
lines might turn them into casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained storm trackers see danger for amateurs looking for the  
thrill of the chase. McDonald says he would never pursue a storm 
without radar to tell him where twisters are forming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because the clouds look flat doesn't mean one won't pop  
out of it,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a day, the chasers are already trailing new storms.  
Castor predicts his plans for this weekend will include a mad-dash 
somewhere across the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually starting Friday, Saturday and Sunday, it looks like a  
chance of chasing all three days,'' he says. ``It's just that kind 
of year.''

<HEADLINE> Feminist Educator Fights Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A controversial feminist theologian at Boston  
College who refuses to allow males into her classes has asked a 
judge to bar the school from telling people she is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Daly said the college's claim that she planned to retire is  
a lie, and an attempt to get rid of an ``uppity woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is thug behavior,'' she said. ``In effect, they're firing  
a tenured professor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College officials say they had almost settled on a  
retirement package with Daly when she took them to court on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She agreed to retire,'' said BC spokesman Jack Dunn. ``We have  
no intention of letting her renege on her commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beside stopping BC officials from saying she retired, Daly's  
lawsuit also seeks to stop BC from distributing its catalog, which 
doesn't list her courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, 70, is considered a pioneer in the radical feminist  
movement, and has written several books. She believes that since 
religious structure is male-dominated, it is abusive and immoral. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly has taught women-only courses at the Jesuit college for 25  
years, saying that women tend to defer to men when one is in the 
room. Daly said she offers men individual instruction.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Olympics Picks Mascots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Some suggested Rich Uncle Pennybags of  
Monopoly fame. Also proposed was a giraffe named GRRafte and the 
ever-popular Wally the Wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	Even The Wall Street Journal pitched in with the idea for a  
cuddly money-grubber, Tickle-My-Palm Elmo. 
</P>
<P>
	But no. Organizers of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics decided  
on a more traditional -- and positive -- approach for a mascot to 
help sell their scandal-plagued event. 
</P>
<P>
	And so at a public party expected to draw up to 20,000 people on  
a chilly Saturday night, the representatives of the 2002 Winter 
Games were being introduced, joining a three-decade-old menagerie 
that has been profitable -- and sometimes embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's choice was a Wild West trio -- a rabbit, or more  
specifically a snow hare; a coyote; and an American black bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the mascots represented the Olympic motto of  
``Faster, Higher, Stronger.'' The hare had speed, the coyote lifted 
his head high to the heavens and the bear brought the power of the 
snowcapped Wasatch Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, the mascots have no names. They will be  
decided in a national contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Plucked from the modern-day marketing maze of focus groups and  
brand recognition, the mascots will be sold on products ranging 
from T-shirts and coffee mugs to plush toys and golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll make millions for cash-strapped Salt Lake Olympic  
organizers. But can the critters -- their debut already delayed 
three months because of the $1 million bribery case -- help the 
games bounce back? 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't hurt,'' said Bob Christianson, an Olympics historian  
and authority on the mascots. ``The mascots tend to put a friendly 
face on the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also put money in the bank.  
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Thomas, senior vice president of communications for the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, said mascot products should produce 
``the core, a huge segment'' of the $40 million-$50 million in 
expected sales from licensed Olympic merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The choice of the mascot was made with that in mind,'' she  
said. ``We conducted focus groups across the country. We did 
research into aspects of appeal and what would make people smile. 
We worked with experts in the field of toy manufacturing to 
determine the look and the feel of the mascot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted something that was meaningful to the American West  
and to Utah but also we recognized the importance of making sure we 
had a viable image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first known Olympic mascot was a real one -- Smoky, a dog at  
the Los Angeles Games in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must have wandered into the Olympic Village,'' Christianson  
said. ``He's seen in a lot of photos of the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was another 36 years before organizers hit upon using a  
character to try to promote the Olympics. Schuss, a bubble-headed 
creature on skis, helped sell lottery tickets to finance the 1968 
Winter Games in Grenoble, France. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost another two decades, Christianson said, the mascots  
stayed in the background. He bought his first, a plush Amik the 
beaver, for 50 cents off a leftover table at the Montreal Games in 
1976. Similar toys now sell for $500 and up at auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market was flooded by Misha, the jolly bear of the  
1980 Moscow Olympics, and Sam the Eagle from the 1984 Los Angeles 
Games, mascots turned into cash cows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become one of the symbols of the games, along with the  
medals and the torch,'' Christianson said. 
</P>
<P>
	They are not always instant winners. Cobi, the flat-headed  
cartoon dog from Barcelona in 1992, was reviled at first, but 
turned into a crowd favorite. Izzy, the first computer-generated 
mascot, drew more pans than praise in Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of Nagano's 1998 Winter Games wanted their mascot to  
be Snowple the ermine -- which they listed as a ``snow weasel.'' 
They wound up with the Snowlets, four cartoon owls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess someone told them that you stay away from weasels,''  
Christianson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Snowlets turned out to be wildly popular, although some of  
their work pushed the limits for Olympic sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	A beer ad that showed one of the owls appearing pie-eyed ``maybe  
sent the wrong message,'' Christianson said. And he noted that the 
Snowlets had their own brand of Olympic condoms, in two sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The four owls continued a recent run of multiple mascots,  
starting with polar bears Hidy and Howdy in Calgary in 1988 and 
continuing through Sydney's 2000 threesome -- Oly the kookaburra, 
Millie the echidna and Syd the platypus. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a perfect marketing ploy, since collectors must buy several  
versions of each item instead of just one, and one that Salt Lake 
embraced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake choice was made 1 1/2 years ago and approved by the  
International Olympic Committee last year. Unveiling was first 
scheduled for Feb. 8, three years before the start of the games, 
but was postponed until Saturday because organizers didn't think 
the middle of a corruption scandal was the time to launch such a 
lighthearted project. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the time when mascot jokes abounded, with Wally,  
GRRafte, Elmo and others. Because the scandal broke with news of a 
scholarship program for the children of IOC members, some thought 
the choice would be the sons and daughters of former mascots. 
</P>
<P>
	``One person is surmising it's a spider whose legs form the  
Olympic rings. Someone else suggested a wedge of cheese,'' Thomas 
said. ``We haven't had those jokes lately. We've seen a real show 
of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake unveiling took 10 minutes in a ``four-hour  
festival'' of bands, dancing groups, children's activities -- and, 
of course, mascot souvenir stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to say thank-you to the community,'' Thomas said.  
``It's been a rough past several months. But we feel like we've 
turned the corner.''

<HEADLINE> Eclectic Mix Adds to Preakness Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- As they settled in for the 124th running of the  
Preakness Saturday, folks in Pimlico's infield had two questions: 
</P>
<P>
	Horses? What horses?  
</P>
<P>
	The big race wasn't scheduled to begin until about 5:30 p.m.,  
but by 9 a.m., hundreds were laying out crime scene tape, staking 
out their piece of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get an interesting mix of people,'' said Mike Dana, 19, of  
Ellicott City, Md., as he and a few friends nursed cans of beer. 
``It's a Maryland thing. A lot of people, they won't even bet. In 
the end, some of them are going to get arrested because they don't 
want to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50,000 people paid $24 apiece to enter Pimlico's  
grassy infield, where they spent a luscious spring day ignoring the 
second jewel of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown and welcomed 
summer with a beer can to their lips. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Saturday morning cartoons were over, infield revelers  
were becoming animated, guzzling beer and cheering the antics of 
fellow fans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the grandstand, fans paying $50 to $160 could only peer  
through their binoculars and guess what went on behind those 
hedges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too much,'' said Margie Stock, 58, a Baltimore fan  
wearing the race's traditional black-eyed Susans in a straw hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a lot of fun -- you get to see the people you don't  
see any other time of the year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the action was in the infield. Across a heavily guarded  
chain-link fence, more genteel fans sipped whiskey sours, munched 
crab cakes and asparagus and strolled between white canvas tents, 
compliments of a handful of corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Here the bathrooms came complete with a uniformed attendant  
handing out paper towels, peppermint candies and, on demand, tiny 
packets of Tylenol. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the fence, the Port-o-Lets lines grew as  
pounding rock-and-roll poured from a stage. Between races, a 
Baltimore radio station sponsored a ``Perfecta Body'' contest in 
which 30 contestants posed and pranced for a $5,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seem really nice -- just a little drunk,'' Carolyn Evans  
said as she waited backstage during her first trip to the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk McEwen, a host of the station's morning show, said the  
crowd was a true Baltimore cross-section of blue-collar fans, 
college students and professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our people,'' he said. ``It's our little Mardis  
Gras.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another of the hosts, a 46-year-old known only as Lopez, called

	About 1,000 security guards keep fans in place. But they didn't  
prevent one man from running onto the track during the seventh

	Over the years, the party has evolved and become more refined,

	``It's not as rough as it used to be,'' McCarty said.

<P>
	He arrived before 7 a.m. to stake out a large, choice chunk of  
grass just inside the infield fence.

	``There's something about Preakness morning,'' he said. ``It's

summer. Memorial Day's the actual day, but this is where it all 
begins in Baltimore.''

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Strong explosions have been reported  
in Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's hometown, 40 miles 
southeast of Belgrade late Saturday. Meanwhile, NATO officials say 
they don't know if 87 ethnic Albanians reportedly killed by

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The federal agency responsible for making  
charts and maps used by military pilots has a history of providing 
incomplete and inaccurate data, resulting in fatal mishaps such as 
the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, the Los Angeles 
Times has reported. The National Imagery and Mapping Agency and its 
predecessor organization have produced charts or maps that played a 
role in at least a dozen accidents since 1985, some involving 
fatalities and loss of military aircraft, according to documents

his popular prime minister three days earlier. Lawmakers turned 
down all five impeachment motions, any one of which could

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of patients are being

doctors -- the business of testing experimental drugs on people, The 
New York Times has reported. The newspaper said a 10-month 
investigation revealed a system that is fraught with conflicts of 
interest; that relies on government and private monitoring that can 
be easily fooled and that some researchers said is inadequate; and 
that secretly offers a share of the cash to other health 
professionals who might influence patients to join a study.

Also recommended for scrutiny was the so-called ``cause'' exclusion

<HEADLINE> Hate Crimes Bill Fails in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas lawmakers have abandoned a hate  
crimes bill designed to protect homosexuals, with Democrats blaming 
Gov. George W. Bush for its failure and accusing the Republican 
presidential prospect of showing no leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill named for James Byrd Jr., the black man dragged to  
death behind a pickup truck in East Texas, had the backing of 
President Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have toughened the state's hate crimes law by  
increasing the criminal penalties. It would also would have 
specifically included homosexuals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked repeatedly about the bill, Bush has said only: ``I will  
look at the bill when it makes it to my desk, if it makes it to my 
desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, suggested that  
presidential politics is playing a role, with the sexual 
orientation provision a sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since our governor is a leading presidential hopeful, the eyes  
of the world are on Texas,'' Ellis said. ``Everything we do now 
takes on national implications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill sailed through the Democratic-controlled House but  
languished for weeks in a committee of the Republican-controlled 
Senate. It was abandoned late Friday, a day after two failed 
attempts by Democrats to force a full Senate vote. The Legislature 
adjourns May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``James Byrd Jr. is probably turning in his grave tonight,''  
said Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat. ``He cannot rest, and we 
should not rest, until Byrd and his family can bring closure to 
this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor's office offered  
ideas in an effort to break the stalemate, but critics weren't 
convinced of his support. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants the world to believe that he is a `compassionate  
conservative.' We want the world to know that his compassion does 
not extend to all the citizens of Texas,'' said the Rev. Michael 
Piazza of Dallas' Cathedral of Hope, which claims the world's 
largest homosexual congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dianne Hardy-Garcia, executive director of the Lesbian and Gay  
Rights Lobby of Texas, attacked Bush's neutrality. ``His 
unconscionable, immoral lack of leadership on this issue is both 
tragic and exasperating,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Astaire Honored on 100th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The most eloquent testimonials at a tribute  
to the late Fred Astaire on the 100th anniversary of his birth came 
in film clips showing off the dancer's grace. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Motion Picture Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater, guests  
watched Astaire climbing up the wall and dancing on the ceiling in 
``Royal Wedding,'' twirling cheek-to-cheek with Ginger Rogers in 
``Top Hat,'' trading machine-gun steps with Eleanor Powell in 
``Broadway Melody of 1940'' and playing a hobo with Judy Garland in 
``Easter Parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fred made everything seem so easy,'' said Joan Leslie, who  
danced with Astaire in ``The Sky's the Limit.'' ``But that was the 
result of hard and constant practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Forsythe presided Friday at ``A Centennial Tribute to Fred  
Astaire.'' Three of the dancer's co-stars made appearances, Leslie, 
Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse. 
</P>
<P>
	Astaire, who died in 1987, made his name as a song-and-dance man  
but also tackled dramatic roles, earning an Academy Award 
nomination for supporting actor in ``The Towering Inferno'' (1974).

<HEADLINE> Saints Sign Their Only Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Ricky Williams got an $8.8 million signing  
bonus -- the biggest the New Orleans Saints have ever paid. He also 
signed a contract that could tie him to the team for eight years, 
the longest deal an NFL rookie has ever signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a super contract,'' Saints owner Tom Benson said.  
``Ricky's going to make lots of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will if he can do in the NFL what he did in college.  
</P>
<P>
	The contract, loaded with incentives, is worth between $11.1  
million and $68.4 million, contingent on performance. 
</P>
<P>
	If Williams plays as well as the Saints expect, his contract  
would be the most lucrative ever given a rookie. If he fails to 
reach goals set in incentive clauses, he will earn the league 
minimum for the next seven years: $175,000 in year one, increasing 
annually to reach $400,000 in year seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here a long time and do a lot of great  
things,'' Williams said after signing the deal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints swapped their six 1999 picks and selections in the  
first and third rounds next year to move up to No. 5 in the NFL 
draft last month so they could pick Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka labeled Williams the final piece of the puzzle,  
saying a first-class ball carrier was all he needed to make the 
Saints a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans has not had a winning season in six years, going  
6-10 each of Ditka's first two years. The Saints' offense was 28th 
in the league last season; the running game was last. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a decade since New Orleans has had a 1,000-yard  
rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to make Ricky an important component of our  
offense,'' Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams finished his career at Texas as the NCAA's career  
rushing leader with 6,279 yards. He set 20 NCAA rushing records, 
including most rushing yards, all-purpose yards, highest average 
per carry, rushing touchdowns, total touchdowns and points scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is heavily loaded with incentives.  
</P>
<P>
	There are 26 targets that could earn him $50,000 for each one  
reached, up to a cap of $500,000. Those incentives include rushing 
for an average of 4.5 yards per carry or better, 12 or more rushing 
touchdowns, 12 or more receiving touchdowns, scoring 76 points, 
gaining 1,601 yards in total offense and playing in 35 percent of 
the offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there are two escalator clauses that could kick in.  
</P>
<P>
	The first escalator would boost Williams' salary each year in  
years 2-4 -- $1 million if he rushes for 1,600 yards, $1.5 million 
for 1,800 yards, $2 million for 2,000 yards, $2.1 million for 2,100 
yards. If he breaks the league single-season rushing record of 
2,105 yards by Eric Dickerson, he would get a $3 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The second escalator is based on Terrell Davis' contract, the  
richest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first four years, Davis rushed for 6,413 yards, had 7,594  
yards in rushing and receiving, averaged 4.8 yards per carry and 
scored 61 touchdowns for the Denver Broncos. If Williams hits three 
of those four marks, his contract will automatically duplicate 
Davis'. 
</P>
<P>
	If that escalator kicks in, Williams' contract would be worth a  
total of $68.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also has a $100,000 bonus for taking part in the  
Saints' offseason program and $100,000 for not weighing over 240 
pounds at each of four weigh-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is the second No. 1 pick to sign a contract. Tim Couch  
signed with Cleveland on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there had been speculation that Williams' agent, Leland  
Hardy of No Limit Sports, would be hard to deal with or slow to 
reach an agreement, Saints salary cap consultant Terry O'Neil said 
negotiations, many of which were done on the golf course, were 
exceptionally smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there were a lot of misunderstandings about No Limit  
and what we'd do,'' Hardy said. ``I hope this will quiet that.''

<HEADLINE> Rafter Pleased With Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Patrick Rafter has shocked even himself by reaching  
the semifinals of the Italian Open, especially considering the 
tournament is on clay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big surprise for me so far,'' Rafter said. ``You have  
all the top guys here and I came in with very little form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian serve-and-volleyer came back from a set and a  
break down to beat unseeded Nicolas Lapentti 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in one 
of Friday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why it is happening this week,'' said Rafter, who  
hadn't reached a semifinal since winning his second straight U.S. 
Open last September. ``But I have been trying to work hard, and I 
knew eventually things would turn around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Rafter wins in Rome, he would take over the No. 1 ranking  
from Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who was defeated by Brazil's 
Gustavo Kuerten in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter, currently ranked fourth, faced clay-court specialist  
Felix Mantilla of Spain in today's first semifinal. The other 
semifinal pitted 1997 Italian Open champion Alex Corretja against 
Kuerten, who won the French Open two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to have to play as well as I have been in order to  
have a chance out there,'' Rafter said of his match against 
Mantilla. ``He's is a very steady player and I'm going to have to 
get aggressive and attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantilla reached the semifinal by beating German qualifier David  
Prinosil 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Corretja gained a semifinal berth by defeating unseeded Franco  
Squillari 5-7, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 in three hours, while Kuerten also 
came from a set down to oust 10th seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia 
3-6, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rafter wins the $2.4 million tournament, it would be his  
first career victory on clay. By contrast, Mantilla, seeded 15th, 
has won all of his eight career ATP Tour titles on the slow 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rafter said the clay doesn't scare him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tend to have most of my successes on hard court. I don't  
play that much on clay,'' Rafter said. ``In a way, it is a little 
bit of a shock, but at the same time it isn't because I know I can 
go out there and compete with these guys on clay.''

<HEADLINE> White House Hacker Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A teen-ager identified as a computer hacker  
whose name appeared on the vandalized White House Internet site is 
facing charges he broke into another government computer. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of  
computer intrusion. Burns, reportedly known on the Internet as 
``Zyklon,'' was accused of breaking into a computer between August 
1998 and January 1999 in northern Virginia that is used by the U.S. 
Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyklon'' was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version  
of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for 
a few minutes before government computers automatically detected 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment returned Thursday also accuses Burns of breaking  
into two other computers, one owned by LaserNet of Fairfax, Va., 
and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Simon of Issue Dynamics said he was cooperating with the  
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that computer criminals need to be  
identified, prosecuted and caught, and we're pleased that the FBI 
is not treating this as a minor matter,'' Simon said. ``It wasn't 
an insignificant incident. It was a very concentrated, serious 
effort over a period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was not charged in the attack on the White House  
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening page of the White House site was altered briefly to  
show a black Web page with the names of two hacker organizations 
claiming responsibility, along with messages, ``Your box was 
own3d'' and ``Stop all the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The page also included the phrase, ``following peeps get some  
shouts,'' and listed a dozen names, including ``Zyklon.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton at Hollywood Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In California for a Hollywood bash to raise  
$2 million for Democrats, President Clinton urged the entertainment 
industry Saturday to re-evaluate the way it portrays killing in 
light of the Littleton, Colo., shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The president asked a star-studded crowd to consider whether  
violent movies and video games don't desensitize children who 
already feel alienated from their peers and their families. 
``Desensitizing them will be more likely to push those that are 
vulnerable into destructive behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't make anybody who makes any movie or any video  
game or any television program a bad person or personally 
responsible for one show with a disastrous outcome,'' he was quick 
to add. ``There's no call for finger pointing here. But we just 
look around and we know all these things go together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in his speech and in his weekly radio address the president  
implored entertainment leaders to reflect upon their responsibility 
in molding the nation's young. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still too much violence on our nation's screens,  
large and small,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hopes the killings at Columbine High School will  
galvanize the public behind a national campaign against youth 
violence. As he headed to a Los Angeles dinner with some of the 
biggest names in Hollywood, Clinton challenged the entertainment 
industry to review its ratings systems and reconsider the effects 
on children of glorified screen violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of us has a role to play in giving our kids a safe  
future, and those with greater influence have greater 
responsibility,'' Clinton said. ``We should see movies and music, 
TV programs, video games and advertising for them made by people 
who made them as if their own children were watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he challenged the industry to stop showing guns in  
ads and previews children might see; to strictly enforce ratings 
systems at video stores and theaters; and to re-evaluate the 
ratings system, especially the PG rating, ``to determine whether it 
is allowing too much gratuitous violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stopped briefly at movie mogul Lew Wasserman's home en  
route to the dinner at Greystone Mansion, an elegant, hilltop 
Gothic landmark owned by the city and often used as a set for 
movies and television programs. Among its recent credits: ``Murder 
She Wrote,'' ``Witches of Eastwick,'' ``Winds of War,'' and 
``Ghostbusters II.'' About 100 anti-war protesters waited at the 
bottom of Greystone's winding drive with placards decrying NATO's 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list for the event hosted by DreamWorks partners  
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, included Meg 
Ryan, Dennis Quaid, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Whoopi Goldberg. 
Political glitterati were headed by House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized Clinton  
for taking money from some of the same people Lott blamed for an 
increasing laxity in morals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend, the Clinton-Gore regime will be begging for cash  
from one of the polluters responsible for our nation's moral 
decline,'' he said in a statement issued by his office. ``What's 
the message to our children? Democrats care about your safety -- 
unless it's inconvenient to their partners in Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's focus on the entertainment business' influence on the  
climate of violence in America rankled some industry chiefs, and 
there was some thought that some might withdraw their support for 
Saturday's fund-raiser to benefit House and Senate Democrats in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said no one had backed out to protest Clinton's  
remarks on violence. Not even Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive 
officer of the Seagram Co. Ltd., who shortly after Clinton hosted a 
White House conference on youth violence last week publicly scoffed 
at those who would link the Littleton killings to television and 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the American people who really look to  
their government for leadership instead get finger-pointing and 
chest-pounding,'' said Bronfman, who as the chief executive of 
Universal Studios' parent company oversees an empire that includes 
movies, music and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronfman wasn't attending Saturday's event, but he wrote the  
party a check for an unspecified amount this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee political director  
Michael Meehan said the dinner raised ``more than $2 million'' and 
drew 135 people, none of whom expressed concern about Clinton's 
recent scolding of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks have been very supportive,'' Meehan said. ``We reached  
our goal and then some. That's the most tangible sign of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From events in Seattle, the San Francisco Bay area and Los  
Angeles, Clinton continues Sunday to fund-raisers in San Diego and 
Las Vegas. The four-day take is expected to reach more than $3 
million for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who plans to visit Littleton with the first lady  
Thursday, applauded Hollywood for its voluntary ratings system for 
TV shows and the V-chip to enforce parents' decisions on what 
children may watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But still, he said, the typical American sees 40,000 dramatized  
murders by age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still too many vulnerable children who are steeped  
in this culture of violence, becoming increasingly desensitized to 
it and to its consequences and, therefore, as studies show, 
hundreds of them more liable to commit violence themselves,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He lashed out again at the Republican-led Senate for passing new  
gun-show restrictions that he said were ``riddled with new 
loopholes.'' ``If the Senate wants to fix the problem, it should 
fix the problem, not make it worse,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists, Amateurs Search for ET </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speak up, ET. The world is listening.  
</P>
<P>
	Under a new program offered by a scientific society, thousands  
of amateurs who own personal computers may soon join in the search 
for extraterrestrial intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Planetary Society starts distributing a special computer  
program Monday that will allow computer owners worldwide to monitor 
radio whispers from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
	Called the SETI@home project -- SETI stands for ``search for  
extraterrestrial intelligence'' -- the program will use the idle 
power of personal computers to analyze radio signals collected by 
the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``With SETI@home, anyone, anywhere could be the person who helps  
discover intelligent life elsewhere in the universe,'' Planetary 
Society executive director Louis Friedman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Planetary Society announcement said a screen-saver program  
that analyzes the radio data will be available Monday for download 
by personal computer owners hooked up to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pasadena, Calif.-based society said participants can sign up  
by logging onto one of two Web sites, http://planetary.org or 
http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer program will work like a screen saver and be active  
only when the computer normally would be idle but turned on. It 
automatically will download a small segment of radio noise from the 
SETI web site, then search through the data for interesting radio 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	When the analysis is completed, the data automatically will go  
back to SETI headquarters. A new bit of unprocessed data will be 
sent to the computer when next it is logged onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The screen saver image of the SETI program will show the  
analysis under way, along with a map of the part of the sky being 
scanned. 
</P>
<P>
	Any interesting signals detected by the computers will be  
analyzed further by a large computer operated by SETI project 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Promising signals then will be verified by independent data from  
other sources before a positive identification could be made, the 
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Help Ailing Bison Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly extinct a century ago, the buffalo is  
back -- and taxpayers are paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo ranching is growing so fast there is not a market for  
all the meat. As a result, the federal government is stepping in to 
shore up the industry: The Agriculture Department recently 
announced it will buy $6 million in surplus ground bison this year, 
one-quarter of the industry's ground-meat production. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest beneficiary of the purchases likely would be  
billionaire Ted Turner, the industry's largest producer and its 
most prominent proponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who got into buffalo are basically the rich who got  
into it for a novelty,'' complains Randy Mosser, a North Dakota 
cattle rancher. ``Why do they need a bailout?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bison industry is a victim of its own success.  
</P>
<P>
	At the turn of the century there were fewer than 1,500. Now  
there are an estimated 250,000 nationwide, and the number is 
growing as much as 20 percent a year, according to industry 
insiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers are so eager to increase their herds that virtually  
every female calf is kept for breeding; only males are slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, vice chairman of Time Warner Inc., raises 17,000 bison  
on ranches totaling 1.4 million acres in Montana, Nebraska and New 
Mexico. He is buying 50,000 more acres, in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Bison steaks, roasts and similar cuts are popular in Europe and  
also sell well in restaurants and steakhouses in parts of this 
country. But the ground meat, which is too expensive and too lean, 
and therefore dry when cooked, for some consumers' tastes, has been 
stacking up in processors' warehouses. More than a third of a 
typical bison winds up as ground meat. 
</P>
<P>
	So the two major bison packers -- the North American Bison  
Cooperative, of which Turner is a member, and the Denver Buffalo 
Co. -- asked USDA to buy the surplus meat. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA bought $2.5 million worth of ground bison last year, and  
agreed in March to make the additional $6 million in purchases. The 
government is paying $3.45 a pound for the bison, more than twice 
what it pays for ground beef. The bison meat is being given to 
federal nutrition programs for Indians and migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made it very clear to the industry that they need to take  
some responsibility in adjusting their production to meet the 
market forces in the market place. We are not going to be buying 
bison indefinitely,'' said Enrique Figueroa, administrator of 
USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bison buyout will be only a fraction of the government's  
food purchases this year. USDA spends nearly $290 million a year 
just for meat for various nutrition programs, including school 
lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Turner's urging, members of the bison cooperative agreed  
last month to increase its marketing budget from less than $20,000 
a year to $2.5 million. The cooperative processes 65 percent of the 
nation's bison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that there is a market for the meat. ... but the  
industry has concentrated more on production than marketing,'' said 
Russ Miller, who manages Turner's ranches. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner aside, industry officials say it is unfair to portray  
bison ranchers as a wealthy lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Indian tribes are raising bison, and struggling farmers and  
cattle ranchers were drawn to the business by the relatively high 
prices they could get for bison meat. The buffalo is naturally 
suited to the harsh northern Plains climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Sexhus, whose grandfather homesteaded in North Dakota a  
century ago, planted his wheat farm to grass in 1994 and now raises 
100 bison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great use of the land,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> AOL Giving Money To Tornado Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDWEST CITY, Okla. (AP) -- America Online chairman Steve Case  
pledged up to $1 million to Habitat for Humanity on Saturday to 
help replace homes destroyed by tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stephen Case Foundation grant will match donations to  
Habitat chapters in tornado-ravaged areas of the state 
dollar-for-dollar up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Case made the announcement at a Habitat house that was finished  
six weeks early to accommodate a family that lost their apartment 
when tornadoes tore through the Oklahoma City area on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the world's largest online service, is based in  
Virginia. The company has about 2,000 employees at a customer 
service center in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Case said the storm destroyed 20 of his employees' homes, and  
not all were insured. The AOL Relief Fund has gathered $200,000 to 
help them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Felton, chairman of Central Oklahoma Habitat for Humanity,  
said Case's gift will help many displaced by the storm, which 
killed 44 people and left thousands homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Felton said Habitat for Humanity would begin raising money  
to match the foundation's offer immediately.

<HEADLINE> Youth Nabbed for Planting Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy angry with a classmate  
stalked her family and planted seven pipe bombs in her parents' 
cars -- one of which exploded while the mother was driving, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonya Corn was not injured in Friday's blast on a state highway  
about 60 miles west of Indianapolis. The device was one of three 
pipe bombs tied to her exhaust pipe. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the other two devices n the road, which was closed  
for about seven hours so the bombs could be detonated. Later, at 
the family's home in Brazil, four other bombs were found attached 
to the vehicle of Mike Corn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all happened today, and we ain't in the mood to discuss  
nothing,'' Corn said when contacted by The Associated Press. 
``We've told our story to the police 30 or 40 times today 
already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators arrested the boy, who was not identified, at his  
middle school on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The juvenile is being detained for an act that would be  
considered a felony, if committed by an adult,'' state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy began stalking the Corn family after their daughter told  
school officials the boy had brought a gun to school, authorities 
said. School officials say the girl's report was not confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents notified police and named the boy in a  
``stalking-type'' report several weeks ago, said Trooper David 
Kuhn. He is due to appear in juvenile court Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Getting Equipment from Nortel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nortel Networks has been chosen to supply key  
equipment for AT&AMP;T's ambitious plan to upgrade cable television 
systems for telephone and Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	No financial terms were disclosed about AT&AMP;T's order for 33 of  
Nortel's DMS-500 network switches. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Friday comes less than two weeks after AT&AMP;T  
nailed down the crucial third and fourth pieces of its planned 
multimedia cable system, winning a bidding war for MediaOne Group 
and forming an alliance with Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Including a proposed partnership with Time Warner, the nation's  
biggest cable company, and the recent purchase of No. 2 
Tele-Communications Inc., AT&AMP;T may now have access to the four 
largest systems in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts have applauded AT&AMP;T's strategy, the long-distance  
phone company must now upgrade many of those systems for digital, 
two-way transmission of voices, video and data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nortel switches ``will help us achieve our aggressive local  
expansion plans and provide new advanced voice services,'' said Al 
Hansen, senior vice president for AT&AMP;T Local Services.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Maggette To Enter NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corey Maggette has decided against Michael  
Jordan's advice and will become the third Duke player to leave 
school early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette told the Chicago Tribune on Saturday he would follow  
his heart and declare himself eligible for the June 30 NBA draft 
after his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in the NBA is what I've always wanted to do,''  
Maggette said in a story published in the Tribune's Sunday 
editions. ``It's a dream come true. In a way, it's hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many guys trying to make the pros, and I'm part  
of that 1 percent that has a chance to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke sports information director Mike Cragg said neither the  
athletic department nor the basketball program had any information 
about any decision involving Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette follows fellow Blue Devils Elton Brand and William  
Avery as the third underclassman to announce he will leave Duke 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, who called Jordan for his opinion, said he made up his  
mind Friday night, going against the three most influential people 
in his life -- his parents and his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-6, the athletic Maggette averaged 10.7 points and four  
rebounds in less than 18 minutes a game, with a season-high of 24 
points against North Carolina State. At 19, he will be among the 
NBA's youngest players next season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA scouts have said they are impressed with Maggette's raw  
power and potential for success. Despite his limited collegiate 
experience, he is being projected as a top 10 draft pick and could 
be one of the first three players chosen.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Waters Lowest in Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and Canadian officials are looking  
back to the warm winter of 1997-98 to explain low Great Lakes 
levels that are expected to dip even lower this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the International Joint Commission said Friday that  
the El Nino effect allowed extra water to evaporate from the 
warmer-than-average lakes, leading to levels that in some cases are 
the lowest in a generation. The International Joint Commission is 
an independent U.S.-Canada organization established by treaty to 
help manage shared waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last year alone, those ``unique climate conditions''  
have meant that ``the entire system is down significantly,'' said 
Tom Baldini, chairman of the commission's U.S. Section. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lake Superior dropped by 8 inches to its lowest level for May  
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lake Michigan and Lake Huron dropped about 26 inches to a  
level not seen since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lake Erie's average level dipped by 22 inches to a level last  
seen in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lake Ontario's level dropped by 29 inches, to levels last  
logged in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the Great Lakes basin, according to Baldini's  
Canadian counterpart, Leonard Legault, Lake St. Clair was 21 inches 
below its year-ago levels, comparable to measurements last seen in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Legault said Lakes St. Clair and Erie probably already have  
reached their spring peak levels, but Lakes Superior, Michigan, 
Huron and Ontario were expected to rise a bit before dropping 
again, as the lakes typically do in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Much will depend on how much rain the area experiences between  
now and autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two factors that have been driving this decline,  
precipitation and temperature,'' Baldini said. 
</P>
<P>
	The air has been warmer and precipitation lighter than average  
over the past fall and winter, adding to the El Nino-attributed 
declines of the previous year, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	For the people who use the lakes, low levels can produce myriad  
difficulties, Baldini and other commission members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleasure boaters can have trouble reaching their docks or island  
getaways because the water isn't deep enough to accommodate them; 
the taste and smell of water taken from the lakes can change; 
commercial shippers can be forced to carry less freight to avoid 
scraping the bottom in shallower ports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland-based Lake Carriers Association said the coal  
trade from the western Great Lakes already has felt the impact of 
the lower water levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the Superior Midwest Energy Terminal in Superior,  
Wis., loaded 33 vessels, the same number as last year, but shipped 
110,000 fewer tons of low-sulfur coal because the ships could not 
safely carry a full load, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate an expected barrage of dredging-permit requests,  
the corps has arranged to work with state authorities to expedite 
the approval process so that marina dredging can begin in a matter 
of weeks rather than months, said Col. Jim Houghnon of the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, which dredges navigation channels on the 
lakes.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim Recalls Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Shadows -- Lance Kirklin remembers seeing two of  
them just before the horror began at Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	Straining to speak despite a massive shotgun wound to his jaw,  
the 16-year-old student met with reporters for the first time 
Friday and described the school shooting in which he was almost 
killed. He was walking outside to smoke a cigarette with two 
friends when the ``shadows'' emerged and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we were the first ones shot,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lance suffered multiple wounds in the April 20 massacre in  
Littleton, Colo.; His 15-year-old friend, Daniel Rohrbough, was 
among the 15 people killed. His other friend, Sean Graves, was shot 
in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``His sheer survival is a miracle in itself,'' said Dr. Ernest  
Moore, chief of surgery and trauma services at Denver Health 
Medical Center, where Lance is hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance said when student gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold  
started firing at them, he thought it was a senior prank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two kids who were the shooters, I didn't know them,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance suffered multiple injuries: A pointblank gunshot blast  
shattered his jaw. A bullet severed an artery in his leg. He also 
was hit by three other bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had several surgeries, including a skin and bone graft  
from his leg to temporarily fill the hole in his jaw. Dozens of 
doctors and physical therapists have worked on him. His hospital 
bill is already close to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Lance likely will be released from the hospital  
within the week, but his recovery is not over. 
</P>
<P>
	Throat doctor Stephen Batuello said Lance probably will need at  
least six more operations on his face to help permanently close the 
``crater'' left by the shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough road,'' Batuello said.  
</P>
<P>
	Batuello said Lance suffered extensive damage in his jaw and a  
tiny hole left by the tissue replacement has not yet sealed. 
Consequently, he has to be fed by a tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance said he can't wait for the hole to close because he wants  
to drink apple juice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a hole in my face so it just drips out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lance said he wants to let the Columbine community know that he  
feels good. And he had a special message for his 15-year-old friend 
Sean, undergoing physical therapy for a spinal cord injury: ``I 
know it's hard, but you just got to push yourself and work hard to 
get back to normal.''

<HEADLINE> Astaire Honored on 100th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The most eloquent testimonials at a tribute  
to the late Fred Astaire on the 100th anniversary of his birth came 
in film clips showing off the dancer's grace. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Motion Picture Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater, guests  
watched Astaire climbing up the wall and dancing on the ceiling in 
``Royal Wedding,'' twirling cheek-to-cheek with Ginger Rogers in 
``Top Hat,'' trading machine-gun steps with Eleanor Powell in 
``Broadway Melody of 1940'' and playing a hobo with Judy Garland in 
``Easter Parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fred made everything seem so easy,'' said Joan Leslie, who  
danced with Astaire in ``The Sky's the Limit.'' ``But that was the 
result of hard and constant practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Forsythe presided Friday at ``A Centennial Tribute to Fred  
Astaire.'' Three of the dancer's co-stars made appearances, Leslie, 
Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse. 
</P>
<P>
	Astaire, who died in 1987, made his name as a song-and-dance man  
but also tackled dramatic roles, earning an Academy Award 
nomination for supporting actor in ``The Towering Inferno'' (1974).

<HEADLINE> Notes From the Preakness Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- It's often taken for granted that the Kentucky  
Derby winner will be favored in the Preakness -- or at least receive 
considerable backing from the bettors. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the windows closed at Pimlico for the start of the  
124th Preakness, Charismatic was the second-highest priced Derby 
winner in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Dark Star, sent off at 11-1 in the 1953 Preakness, was  
priced higher than Charismatic, who went off at odds of 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Derby, Charismatic was dismissed at 31-1.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LUKAS THEORY:* Trainer D. Wayne Lukas got his 12th victory in a  
Triple Crown race when he sent out Kentucky Derby winner 
Charismatic to win Saturday's $1 million Preakness Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Lukas addressed the growing debate about the  
large size of Triple Crown fields and the risk of injury. He said 
the races are so popular because they're different. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uniqueness of these races are the distance, the quality of  
all the regional horses coming together, and the large fields that 
cause problems,'' Lukas said. ``If the guys who run in the Indy 500 
next week could get down to 10 cars, they'd like it better, too. 
But it isn't going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what makes it so tough to win.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT SO EXCELLENT MEETING:* The filly Excellent Meeting was  
pulled up around the far turn by jockey Kent Desormeaux, suffering 
from a condition similar to asthma in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Bob Baffert, Excellent Meeting was the 52nd filly to  
run in the Preakness, and first since Winning Colors finished third 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The last filly to win the Preakness was Nellie Morse in 1924.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kent said he had no horse going down the backstretch,''  
Baffert said. ``But I think when he snatched her up on the first 
turn, she might have displaced her palate. She's fine back here in 
the barn. We haven't scoped her yet, but I think she was doing too 
good to come into the race and run the way she did. Now we'll just 
have to regroup.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *VICAR'S CASE:* Trainer Carl Nafzger, after a lengthy discussion  
with Vicar's owner, James Tafel, decided to run the colt in the 
Preakness after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger said he would scratch the Florida Derby winner before  
the race because he didn't want to break from the No. 13 post. On 
Saturday morning, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason?  
</P>
<P>
	``He's so focused and so laid back, and we were worried about  
the crown (a rise) on the track,'' Nafzger said. ``If we had 
started in the No. 14 hole, there is a slight crown where the 
horses come out. But we went out with some Pimlico officials and 
measured it. It's OK there (from the No. 13 post).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar finished 10th in the 13-horse field.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILIAR FACES:* The 13-horse Preakness field included a record  
10 who ran in the Kentucky Derby. The Derby-Preakness runners were 
Charismatic, Menifee, Cat Thief, Excellent Meeting, Kimberlite 
Pipe, Worldly Manner, Stephen Got Even, Valhol, Adonis and Vicar. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GO THE DISTANCE:* The Preakness was not always run at 1 3-16  
miles. In fact, it was run at six other distances until the change 
to 1 3-16 miles was made starting with the 1925 Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was run at 1 1/2 miles from 1873-88 and in 1890; 1 3/4 miles  
in 1889; 1 1-16th miles in 1894-90 and in 1908; 1 mile and 70 yards 
from 1901-07; 1 mile in 1909 and 1910; and 1 1/8 miles from 1911-24. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOWN THE STRETCH; Counting the field in Saturday's Preakness, a  
total of 1,060 horses have competed in the 124 runnings of the 
middle jewel of the Triple Crown. ... The most successful Preakness 
post position since 1909 remains No. 6, which has produced 14 
winners. ... In 124 races, the Preakness favorite has won 63 times. 
... Largest margins of victory in the Preakness? Survivor won the 
first edition by 10 lengths in 1873; the largest in modern times 
was Count Fleet's eight-length win in 1943.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 3, Fusion 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Mark Chung scored a goal and added  
two assists to lead the New York-New Jersey MetroStars to a 3-2 
victory over the Miami Fusion on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars (4-4) had scored just five goals in seven  
previous MLS matches this year and had been scoreless at home since 
their opener at Giants Stadium on March 28. The victory also 
snapped a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The match also served as a preliminary qualifier for the 1999  
U.S. Open Cup, and thus allowed the MetroStars to advance to the 
United States Soccer Federation's national championship tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion, meanwhile, suffered its third straight setback, and  
slipped deeper into the MLS East cellar with a 3-6 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Myers took a pass from Mike Sorber in the 36th minute and  
delivered a low cross in front of the Fusion goal. When Miami 
goalkeeper Jeff Cassar mishandled the pass, Chung was there to bury 
the ball in the back of the net from short-range. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was Chung's first of the season and ended a 315 minute  
home scoring drought for the MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars added two more tallies in the first six minutes  
of the second half as Bill Walsh headed in a free kick by Chung in 
the 48th minute and Chung and Eduardo Hurtado set up Mark Semioli 
for a goal in the 51st. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami got one goal back in the 58th minute when Jay Heaps headed  
in a cross off the foot of Maurizio Rocha. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion made it 3-2 in the 75th minute when Serna whistled a  
shot by MetroStars keeper Mike Ammann for his fourth goal of the 
season.

<HEADLINE> Pacers To Meet 76ers in 2nd Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers gained some answers but  
lost a day off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers ended practice Saturday not knowing who they would  
face in their next game, or when or where it would be played. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia's 101-91 victory over Orlando provided the answers  
and deprived Indiana the day off that coach Larry Bird would have 
given the team if the Magic had forced a fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 second round matchup will begin in Market Square  
Arena on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had time to relax and watch other people play to move on,''  
said Mark Jackson, who averaged 9.7 points and 9.7 assists in 
Indiana's three-game sweep of Milwaukee in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Jackson and his teammates will have to deal with NBA scoring  
leader Allen Iverson, who averaged 32.7 points in three games 
against Indiana during the regular-season -- two of them wins for 
the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of now, he's as good as it gets. He's dangerous and you've  
got to pay undivided attention to him,'' Jackson said of Iverson, 
who averaged 26.8 points in the regular season and 28.2 in the 
playoffs. ``If he gets to knocking down the jumper it can be a long 
night. You make him earn everything he gets. And then when he's 
penetrating, you have to hit him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Miller, who led Indiana with a 26.3 average against  
Milwaukee, will be matched against Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a great matchup,'' Miller said. ``I kind of accept  
that challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers are hoping to maintain the momentum they gained from  
a seven-game winning streak that began with the final four games of 
the regular season and produced a Central Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just playing well right now. We're doing the little  
things. The guys are really stepping up,'' Miller said. ``It's a 
team game and we're all not depending on someone else to do our 
job. Everyone is individually, and collectively doing what they 
have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Chris Mullin said the sweep of Milwaukee was big to  
Indiana, which is hoping to reach the Eastern Conference finals for 
the fourth time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to get a little bit of rest. They (Milwaukee)  
were a dangerous team,'' he said, adding that it was difficult to 
practice Saturday with their opponent unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things that both teams do that we worked on,''  
Mullin said. ``To be more specific, we had to wait and see. ... 
That's what we wanted to do, we're where we want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said he decided to have the morning practice rather than  
wait to learn the outcome of the Orlando-Philadelphia game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we needed to get as much rest as we could,'' Bird  
said. ``We're ready to go, they're energetic and we had a good 
practice. It's amazing what one day's rest can do. ... We're ready 
to move on. ... It was good to come in today and get going and let 
them have the rest of the afternoon off. ... I enjoy practicing in 
the evening sometime, but they earned the day off, it's going to be 
nice out today, so let them go and have a good time.''

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Defends Indian Trust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, defending  
his department's handling of $3 billion in Indian trust funds, 
accused his critics of being racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have called for removing the accounts from the Interior  
Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose workforce is 90 
percent Indian, and turning them over to a bank or private 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I profoundly disagree with that condescending approach,''  
Babbitt said in a taped address to BIA employees. ``It amounts to a 
deep condescension to the fact that any institution which is 
primarily managed by Indians is incompetent of managing in the 
modern world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government is being sued by Indian account holders for its  
long mismanagement of the funds. In February, the federal judge 
who's handling the lawsuit held Babbitt, outgoing Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin and another official in contempt for their 
delay in turning over records related to the plaintiffs' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs and two of the lawyers representing them are  
Indians, as is Babbitt's most prominent critic on the issue in 
Congress, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's comments brought expressions of outrage.  
</P>
<P>
	``If criticizing the BIA is anti-Indian, then most Indians are  
anti-Indian. We're the ones criticizing them. It's just an 
outlandish and ridiculous charge,'' said Keith Harper, a Cherokee 
and one of the attorneys in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Babbitt's sentiments were echoed in even stronger terms by  
Kevin Gover, Interior's assistant secretary for Indian affairs and 
a member of the Pawnee tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gover, in his own taped address, said the Indian workers were  
being painted as ``outdated relics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake, those who are saying the BIA can't fix this  
system are saying that American Indians cannot fix this system,'' 
Gover said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Gover canceled a negotiating session with some tribal  
leaders after they criticized his agency at a Senate committee 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior manages $2.5 billion belonging to tribes and an  
additional $500 million owned by individual Indians. The money 
includes lease revenue, royalties and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with the trust funds go back decades. Records have  
been lost or ruined, and ownership of reservation property has been 
divided so often through inheritances that only a few cents a year 
passes through many accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	BIA is to launch a new computer system for handling the accounts  
next month. Babbitt and Gover said they are confident the system 
will work, although the General Accounting Office recently warned 
that the agency hasn't planned the project properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, who plans to attend the system's startup June 25 in  
Billings, Mont., also said Friday that Indian account holders have 
been misled into thinking that they will receive a windfall from 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs have said the government could be  
liable for billions of dollars in underpayments.

<HEADLINE> Lead Em Home Wins Preakness Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lead Em Home's victory in Saturday's Sir Barton  
Stakes left trainer Phil Marino angry with himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have run this horse in the Preakness,'' Marino said  
Saturday after Lead Em Home beat Raire Standard by 1 1/4 lengths in 
the $100,000 Sir Barton, one of several stakes races on the 
Preakness undercard at Pimlico Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he ran, I'm kicking myself. Don't get me wrong, I'm  
excited about winning this race. We've come a long way in a short 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Marino withdrew Lead Em Home from Preakness  
consideration, saying he knew his colt would do ``all right'' in 
the second leg of the Triple Crown, but ``I'm using my better 
judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, Lead Em Home took the lead from  
Memory Tap in the stretch and then moved clear of the field and 
held off Raire Standard. Straight Man, the odds-on favorite trained 
by Bob Baffert , was second behind Memory Tap but faded around the 
turn and finished last in the 11-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead Em Home, who won the Derby Trial on April 24 at Churchill  
Downs, won for the third time in eight career starts. He also has 
three seconds and a third for owner Sandi L. Kleeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead Em Home returned $25.80, $12.80 and $6.60. Raire Standard  
paid $38.80 and $13, and Stellar Brush returned $2.80 to show. The 
winner covered the 1 1-16 miles in 1:43 1-5. Lead Em Home earned 
$60,000 for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	The race took place just before a frightening incident in the  
seventh race, the $200,000 Maryland Breeders' Cup, won by Yes It's 
True. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified man made his way onto the track and somehow  
avoided being trampled by the onrushing horses. The incident 
occurred several hundred yards from the finish line and about 2 1/2 
hours before the running of the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	As fans gasped in disbelief, horses charged by on both sides of  
the man without hitting him. The man punched at two horses as they 
galloped past him, forcing jockey Jorge Chavez to pull up Artax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to pull my horse up completely,'' Chavez said. ``I saw  
him and I did not know whether to go to the left of him or go to 
the right of him. I waited until the last second to avoid him (and 
then) he punched at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security personnel quickly apprehended the man, who was not  
immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The stewards posted an inquiry into the race, and after several  
minutes, allowed the order of finish to stand but money was 
refunded to those who bet on Artax, the 4-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trader's Echo was second and Purple Passion third in the  
eight-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	In other races, Middlesex Drive won the $200,000 Dixie and  
returned $7; Mil Kilates, a 10-1 shot ridden by Shane Sellers, beat 
Merengue by three lengths in the $200,000 Pimlico Distaff; and 
Perfect To A Tee ($29) won the $100,000 William Donald Schaefer 
Handicap.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Shaves Head on Lost Bet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELAVAN, Wis. (AP) -- Alex Slappey went from shaggy mop top to  
clean-shaven chrome dome when students at the Wisconsin School for 
the Deaf took up his challenge and surpassed fund-raising goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to sell my hair short,'' Slappey said Friday  
after watching his beard and collar-length hair disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I had short hair, I was 10,'' he said. His three  
children have never seen him without a beard, which he had for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Slappey, superintendent of the Wisconsin School for the Deaf,  
submitted to the shearing after losing his bet with the school's 
Parent-Staff Association and its 190 students that they couldn't 
sell more than 3,000 raffle tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The school sold 3,089 tickets. The proceeds go toward  
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Slappey figures his hair and beard would grow back by next year.  
Just in time for another bet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe next year, I'll get my eyebrows shaved for 4,000  
tickets,'' Slappey said, quickly adding that he will think on that 
offer before making the bet official.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Military Institute handed  
diplomas to two women on Saturday, the first time in the school's 
160-year history that females have graduated. 
</P>

	More than a dozen female cadets stood in the bleachers and  
shouted when Chih-Yuan Ho became the first woman to earn a VMI 
degree. Later in the ceremony, Melissa Kay Graham also graduated to 
cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You work hard, you keep on going and going and it feels like  
nothing will change,'' Ms. Graham said after the commencement, 
adding that she once called her father and told him she wanted to 
leave VMI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could have left,'' she said. ``I'm more than  
glad I stayed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ho, 23, and Ms. Graham , 21,entered VMI in August 1997 as  
transfer students along with 28 other women who were freshmen. The 
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that the state-run school's 
all-male admissions policy was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women had to endure the rat line with the freshman. In the  
rat line, freshman cadets -- known as rats -- are pushed to their 
limit physically and mentally for six months by the constant 
hounding of upperclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The women and 217 men received their diplomas after hearing  
commencement speaker G. Gordon Liddy, the Watergate figure and 
conservative talk show host, tell the audience that women should 
not fight in wars.

<HEADLINE> DWI Charged Dropped Against Pippen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A drunken driving charge against Houston Rockets  
forward Scottie Pippen has been dropped after prosecutors 
determined there was not enough proof he was intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion to dismiss the driving while intoxicated charge was  
accepted Friday in the Harris County Criminal Court-at-Law of Judge 
Sherman Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie knew all along that he wasn't intoxicated,'' said  
Rusty Hardin, Pippen's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, was arrested in early April 22 after running a red  
light downtown, the arresting officer said. Pippen denied being 
drunk afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested after faring poorly in a field sobriety test and  
was booked after refusing a breath blood-alcohol test. He spent 
less than six hours in jail before his release in lieu of $500 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrons of downtown's Jones Bar said Pippen was there after an  
April 21 game with teammates Charles Barkley and Matt Maloney. The 
Rockets had lost 109-95 to the Dallas Mavericks in Compaq Center, 
with Pippen scoring only four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen appeared in court briefly on April 30, and his next court  
date had been set for May 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harris County district attorney's office and Pippen could  
not immediately be reached for comment.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's computer makers and  
sellers will be responsible for paying any losses caused by the 
millennium bug, a newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Minister Renan Calherios said responsibility will fall  
on those companies making and selling computers since 1995, when 
the bug was common knowledge, the O Jornal Do Brasil daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they knew the risk of the bug, then nothing is fairer than  
for them to be responsible for the losses caused by their 
products,'' Calheiros was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers and sales outlets should correct problems or at  
least warn consumers of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say many computers could go haywire Jan. 1, 2000,

	BARAHONA, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Dominican authorities have  
arrested 800 Haitians in a continuing sweep against illegal migrant 
workers, Hoy newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, Haitians cross the border to work in the Dominican  
Republic, and the military annually retaliates with raids and mass 
deportations that sour relations between the two countries sharing 
the island of Hispaniola. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoy newspaper said the first raids of this year started Friday  
on coffee plantations 80 miles from the Dominican Republic's border 
with Haiti. The paper quoted army officials as saying those 
arrested had false documents and that the arrests would continue 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Haitian officials say such raids often include Haitians who have  
lived in the Dominican Republic for decades and children born to 
them who are denied Dominican citizenship.

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- British, Chilean and  
U.S. companies bought up 50 percent of the shares in the Dominican 
Republic's two state-owned power companies, part of a project to 
privatize the Caribbean country's troubled energy sector, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies, Itabo and Haina, with their thermal and  
turbogenerator plants, will be managed entirely by the private 
companies although the government maintained a 50 percent hold in 
each, presidential secretary Danilo Medina told reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will save $147 million a year spent on  
subsidizing the plants, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the televised bidding, the majority Chilean-owned company  
Gener S.A. and U.S. Coastal Power Generation, which formed the 
consortium New Caribbean Investment, paid $177 million to buy 50 
percent of Itabo.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Students have agreed to negotiate with  
university officials for the first time since their strike 
protesting tuition increases shut down Latin America's largest 
university nearly one month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Students voted Friday to form a 108-member negotiating  
commission, but university officials have said they oppose holding 
public negotiations open to the media as the students demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The students shut down the 268,000-student National Autonomous  
University on April 20. The strike has protested an increase in 
annual fees for new students from 2 cents to $145. 
</P>
<P>
	The university says the new fees are needed because of decreased  
government funding, while students point to constitutional 
guarantees of free education.

<HEADLINE> Nixon Compensation Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Julie Nixon Eisenhower thinks the government  
should compensate her father's estate for seizing his presidential 
papers and White House tapes, but she swore under oath that she and 
her sister would not be ``personally enriched'' by any financial 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a total fiction that any money will come to my sister and  
me,'' Mrs. Eisenhower said, according to a transcript of her 
deposition with government lawyers, which was released Friday. ``So 
not only will we not be personally enriched, but anything that 
comes in goes to the estate to pay taxes, attorneys' fees, et 
cetera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Eisenhower, who lives near Philadelphia, traveled to  
Washington last week for a three-hour deposition in connection with 
a lawsuit over whether the government must pay millions to 
compensate the Nixon estate for confiscating more than 40 million 
pages of documents, 3,700 hours of secret tape recordings and 
thousands of photographs when he resigned in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Justice Department and the Nixon estate have  
been arguing the case since last December. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that if anything must be paid to  
compensate the Nixon estate, a fair market value for the materials 
would be no more than $2.2 million. The Nixon estate places the 
value at $30 million or more -- and with interest, compensation 
could total $210 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was nearing its end when the Nixon estate sought to  
call Mrs. Eisenhower as a rebuttal witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers accused the estate of prolonging the  
trial and trying to call a new witness under the guise of a 
rebuttal witness. U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn agreed to 
let her testify, but gave the government permission to depose her 
and seek some relevant documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Following her May 7 deposition, the government moved again to  
block Mrs. Eisenhower's testimony, saying she has little personal 
knowledge of her father's plans for his presidential materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the judge had a chance to rule, the Nixon estate on  
Friday afternoon withdrew Mrs. Eisenhower as a potential rebuttal 
witness. The estate's lawyers said the government's request for 
documents to prepare for her testimony outweighed her expected 
contribution to their case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game at this point is not worth the candle,'' the lawyers  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Eisenhower won't be testifying, but during her deposition,  
she said she believes the privately-run Richard Nixon Library &AMP; 
Birthplace Foundation in Yorba Linda, Calif. needs to be funded 
like other presidential libraries run by the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Both she and her sister, Tricia Nixon Cox, are heirs to their  
father's estate. But Mrs. Eisenhower said proceeds from any court 
award would be used to pay legal bills and taxes and to help 
maintain and expand the library and foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father ``told Tricia and me on many, many occasions that he  
was continuing to fight the case because he wanted to be able to 
fund the library,'' Mrs. Eisenhower said. ``He was consumed with 
worry the last year of his life, particularly about the library.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorney Neil Koslowe asked Mrs. Eisenhower whether  
she recalled telling the director of the Nixon project at the 
National Archives that the lawsuit had to go forward because 
``otherwise the foundation would be broke?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't recall using those words or saying that,'' Mrs.  
Eisenhower said. ``I don't recall saying it in that way, no. I'm 
sure that I expressed concerns that the library had a line of 
credit, which it still does, and that funds needed to be raised, 
and that there was just compensation due to fund a library.''

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal Signed for Congo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- African leaders agreed Saturday in Libya on  
a peace deal that calls for a regional cease-fire and the first 
direct talks between Congo and its rebel fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached in the Libyan coastal city Sirte,  
where Congolese President Laurent Kabila and Rwandan Vice President 
Paul Kagame participated in an African summit. It was the first 
time the two had met together -- albeit in a gathering -- since 
Congo's war against Rwandan-backed rebels began nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``A nearing of the points of view was achieved between the  
parties of the conflict and the base of understanding between them 
was broadened,'' a statement issued at the summit's end said. The 
statement was broadcast on Libyan television, monitored in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, participants confirmed an earlier  
Gadhafi-brokered peace agreement between Congo and Uganda that 
called for a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops 
and the deployment of African peacekeepers. Rwanda and Congolese 
rebels were not party to that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear whether the rebels would be amenable to  
Saturday's agreement. Rebel leaders had expressed skepticism about 
the Libyan-brokered proposal with Uganda, saying no agreement was 
possible without their participation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the statement broadcast at the end of the summit,  
Saturday's agreement also called for a cease-fire between all 
``warring parties in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Congo has agreed to hold ``direct talks with  
all the opposition elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also calls for foreign ministers of the concerned  
parties to meet in Lusaka, Zambia. That meeting would include 
Congolese rebel representatives, it said. A date was not specified. 
</P>
<P>
	A final resolution to conflicts in the region is to be worked  
out at a regional summit, the statement said. A date for that 
summit also was not indicated.

<HEADLINE> GOP Won't Focus on Centrist Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To amend a political line from the  
conservative past, moderation in the pursuit of a Republican 
presidential nomination is no virtue. 
</P>
<P>
	At least it never has been.  
</P>
<P>
	When Barry Goldwater made his caustic comment on moderation 35  
years ago, he'd just been nominated. He defiantly declared that 
extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, moderation in the 
pursuit of justice, no virtue. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a jab in the eye of the centrist Republicans who had  
tried to block his conservative campaign, a break from the 
conventional course of the winner placating the losers in order to 
enlist them for the fall campaign. In Goldwater's case, GOP 
moderates weren't going to rally to his ticket anyhow, so the slap 
at them didn't make much difference. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the normal course of campaign events, presumably  
including 2000, political peacemaking with defeated rivals and 
their factions is priority business. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving rise to another piece of Republican lore, Richard M.  
Nixon's formula for winning: Move to the right to win GOP 
nominating votes, move to the center for the general election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	That bears retelling at this point as the 2000 Republicans  
maneuver for support in 1999, on issues as inflammatory as gun 
control and abortion, and as practical as education, social 
services, taxes, the scope of government. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, the topic is gun control, driven by the April 20  
high school shootings in Littleton, Colo., committed with weapons 
purchased at unchecked gun shows. Despite that, the 
Republican-controlled Senate initially rejected a measure for 
mandatory background checks on buyers at gun shows. Then, worried 
about a backlash, they reconsidered on Friday and approved a gun 
show provision, 48 to 47. President Clinton said it was still 
riddled with loopholes, and there may be more changes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole has been speaking on gun regulation to begin  
defining her differences with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leader 
of the Republican field for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't shy away from the tough issues, even if some in my  
party don't like it,'' she said at a women's conference in 
Washington Tuesday. ``That includes issues like allowing people to 
carry concealed weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wouldn't bar it with national legislation, saying it is up  
to the states to decide. Texas did. Bush signed concealed weapons 
legislation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole favors, and Bush opposes, mandatory child safety locks  
on guns. The other nine GOP prospects all oppose mandatory locks 
and concealed weapons bans. 
</P>
<P>
	When she raised the gun issue in general, and gun locks in  
particular, at a candidate forum in New Hampshire, the Republican 
audience was not impressed, judging by the scant applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Her campaign aides said that was OK because she was trying to  
reach out to moderate voters to expand the GOP, not just target the 
party regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is party regulars who settle presidential primary  
elections and caucuses. And the Republican base is a conservative 
one. On guns, add the power of the National Rifle Association, as a 
lobby and an outfit that can turn out activists in a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The clout of that conservative base is magnified when there is a  
crowd on a primary ballot, and a plurality wins. It wasn't a 
moderate who embarrassed 1996 nominee Bob Dole in the New Hampshire 
primary; it was Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	There are early hints that conservative insistence on  
point-by-point orthodoxy from GOP candidates may be yielding to a 
more pragmatic outlook, after two Democratic terms in the White 
House. That could spare a Bush, or perhaps another Dole, the 
sniping from the right that hurt his father and her husband, the 
last two GOP nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are polls suggesting that Americans are increasingly  
concerned about values, public ethics and the state of society, and 
that this could move the 2000 debate toward the center, since 
neither the moralizing of the right nor the paternalism of the left 
has delivered answers. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll conducted for the Democratic Leadership Council indicated  
that 57 percent of Americans feel the fabric of civil life is 
weakening, and want more accountability in government as one way to 
deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not new business, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 1968 campaign, for example, Michigan Gov. George Romney  
put up giant billboards in New Hampshire: 
</P>
<P>
	``Romney's right: We must stop moral decay.''  
</P>
<P>
	Nixon ran him out of the campaign before the first primary.

<HEADLINE> Scientists, Amateurs Search for ET </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speak up, ET. The world is listening.  
</P>
<P>
	Under a new program offered by a scientific society, thousands  
of amateurs who own personal computers may soon join in the search 
for extraterrestrial intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Planetary Society starts distributing a special computer  
program Monday that will allow computer owners worldwide to monitor 
radio whispers from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
	Called the SETI@home project -- SETI stands for ``search for  
extraterrestrial intelligence'' -- the program will use the idle 
power of personal computers to analyze radio signals collected by 
the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``With SETI@home, anyone, anywhere could be the person who helps  
discover intelligent life elsewhere in the universe,'' Planetary 
Society executive director Louis Friedman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Planetary Society announcement said a screen-saver program  
that analyzes the radio data will be available Monday for download 
by personal computer owners hooked up to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pasadena, Calif.-based society said participants can sign up  
by logging onto one of two Web sites, http://planetary.org or 
http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer program will work like a screen saver and be active  
only when the computer normally would be idle but turned on. It 
automatically will download a small segment of radio noise from the 
SETI web site, then search through the data for interesting radio 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	When the analysis is completed, the data automatically will go  
back to SETI headquarters. A new bit of unprocessed data will be 
sent to the computer when next it is logged onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The screen saver image of the SETI program will show the  
analysis under way, along with a map of the part of the sky being 
scanned. 
</P>
<P>
	Any interesting signals detected by the computers will be  
analyzed further by a large computer operated by SETI project 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Promising signals then will be verified by independent data from  
other sources before a positive identification could be made, the 
statement said.

 *Richard Bunkall    	
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Richard Bunkall, a painter and longtime  
art teacher whose battle with Lou Gehrig's disease inspired an 
episode on television's ``Touched by an Angel,'' died Wednesday of 
the illness. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, Bunkall  
was diagnosed in 1994 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an 
irreversible neuromuscular condition better known as Lou Gehrig's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his condition worsened, Bunkall refused to give up  
painting and relied on a respirator and a motorized wheelchair. 
With the help of an assistant, Bunkall painted until the end. For 
about a month, Bunkall taped a paint brush to his hand so he could 
complete his last piece. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tradition of baseball players who hang their mitts up  
when they retire, Bunkall's final picture was a baseball mitt 
hanging on a wall. He completed it two weeks ago, dedicating it to 
his sons -- 7-year-old twins John and Henry and 4-year-old George. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Williamson, executive producer of ``Touched by an  
Angel,'' saw Bunkall's work at a gallery and asked to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunkall's wife, Sally Storch Bunkall, had already been working  
on a script based on her husband's life. The two collaborated, 
along with Mrs. Bunkall's writing partner, Sally Howell, to create 
``Flight of Angels.'' The episode aired February 1998.

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Longtime television and print newsman John  
Masterman, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 for an expose of 
corruption in Amarillo, Texas, died Thursday of congestive heart 
failure. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Ithaca, N.Y., in 1928, he got a start on his journalism  
career while a student at Cornell University. His first job out of 
college was at the Amarillo Daily News, where he rose from general 
assignment reporter to city editor. 
</P>
<P>
	For four years, Masterman worked for Rep. Walter Rogers,  
D-Texas, in Washington, leaving that post to join NBC's Capitol 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered a variety of stories for radio and television,  
including presidential campaigns, the United Nations and war in the 
Middle East. He also was a frequent contributor to ``The 
Huntley-Brinkley Report'' and ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two daughters and two sons.

<P>
	BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Paul Scott Makela, a cutting-edge  
graphic designer whose bold experimentation helped create new 
visual forms that typify the computer-age esthetic, died May 7 of 
epiglottitis. He was 39. 
</P>
<P>
	Makela owned a graphic arts business in this Detroit suburb and  
was co-director of the Cranbrook Academy of Arts' graphic arts 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in St. Paul, Minn., in 1960, Makela received degrees from  
the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota College of Art and 
Design, and from Cranbrook in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Makela and his wife, Laurie Makela, founded a  
design-consulting studio that specialized in advanced-technology 
projects for corporate and cultural clients.

<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Charles W. Mapes Jr., whose hotel-casino  
attracted the rich and famous during its heyday in the 1950s and 
1960s, died Thursday at a San Diego hospital of complications 
following heart surgery. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-story Mapes Hotel opened on Dec. 17, 1947, and the  
glorious mountain views from atop its Sky Room once drew 
politicians, high rollers and Hollywood's elite, including Frank 
Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable and Shirley Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	But it closed 35 years later, on Dec. 17, 1982, and has stood  
shuttered ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, city officials unveiled a $46 million plan to spare  
the landmark from the wrecking ball and give it new life as 
timeshare units and a retail center. 
</P>
<P>
	Mapes' hotel was the first in the country to feature gambling,  
dining, entertainment and luxury accommodations under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mapes changed the whole thing here when he brought in the  
stars into the Sky Room. He was a great innovator of 
entertainment,'' said former performer Kenny Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those performing at the Mapes were Sammy Davis Jr., Mae  
West, the Marx Brothers, Gypsy Rose Lee and Danny Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Its unique art deco style earned it a listing on the National  
Register of Historic Places in 1984. The resort was named last year 
as one of the most endangered historic places in the country by the 
National Trust for Historic Preservation.

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Judge John Minor Wisdom, the last survivor of  
the federal appeals court that forced the Deep South to give up 
segregation, died Saturday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, while Martin Luther King was marshaling marchers  
and forcing the nation to reckon with the rights of its black 
citizens, Wisdom and his fellow federal judges issued a series of 
rulings forcing the Deep South to abolish its segregated society. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican appointed to the court by President Dwight  
Eisenhower, he wrote decisions that helped open the doors of the 
University of Mississippi to James Meredith and sow the seeds of 
affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom and three fellow members of the 5th Circuit Court of  
Appeals were called ``The Four'' by an outraged fellow judge who 
said they had destroyed the South. The others were Elbert Tuttle of 
Atlanta, John Brown of Houston and Richard Rives of Montgomery, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Working a decade after the U.S. Supreme Court called for school  
desegregation ``with all deliberate speed,'' the 5th Circuit judges 
fleshed out the Supreme Court's mandate and expanded it beyond 
education. They issued landmark decisions that struck down the 
barriers of discrimination in voting, jury selection and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Wisdom received a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the  
nation's highest civilian award. The following year, the 5th 
Circuit Court of Appeals building was renamed in his honor.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dr. Asrat Woldeyes, the British-educated  
surgeon and longtime leader of a major opposition group in Ethiopia 
critical of the ruling government, died Friday. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Asrat died of complications from his heart condition and general  
physical deterioration at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania, his nephew Youm Abey Fesseha, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asrat had served a five-year prison term in an Ethiopian jail on  
charges of encouraging armed insurrection in two speeches, and was 
awaiting trial on a third similar charge when he was temporarily 
released from jail in December to get medical treatment in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Asrat was president of the All-Amhara Peoples Organization. The  
personal physician of the late Emperor Haile Selassie was a strong 
critic of the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, and 
particularly critical of policies that led to the creation of new 
autonomous regions along linguistic and ethnic lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Fesseha said Asrat arrived in Philadelphia a month ago, and had  
been hospitalized the last three weeks. He said his uncle would 
also be remembered in Ethiopia as a pioneer for medical education, 
and as an advocate for poor and underprivileged people.
