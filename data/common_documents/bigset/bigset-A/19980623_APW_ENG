Newspaper criticizes BBC interview with Louise Woodward BBC 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with newspaper editorial criticizing
By EMMA ROSS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Daily Telegraph newspaper criticized the BBC
on Tuesday for doing what it called a ``glamor interview'' with the
former British au pair who recently returned home after being
convicted in the death of an American baby in her care.
	   ``The BBC has given her a forum to manipulate public perception
and cultivate her image as a celebrity victim,'' the newspaper said
of the interview with Louise Woodward that was broadcast Monday
night on British television.
	   A spokesperson for the British Broadcasting Corp. was not
immediately available for comment on the newspaper's criticism.
	   It was the first major interview Ms. Woodward has given since
returning home from the United States Thursday after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision to
reduce her second-degree murder conviction to manslaughter for the
death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. He sentenced her to the 279
days she had already spent in prison.
	   During the BBC interview, she said the jury in her trial did not
understand the medical evidence and Judge Hiller Zobel made a moral
decision when he reduced her murder conviction to manslaughter last
November. She said he had got as close as he could to acquitting
her for the baby's death in February last year.
	   ``It is one thing to raise legitimate questions about the case,
it is quite another to elevate Woodward to national stardom,'' The
Daily Telegraph said in an editorial. The newspaper added that
although she was not paid for the appearance she was being rewarded
``in a perverse manner.''
	   Ms. Woodward, looking confident and relaxed in a dark, tailored
suit and skillful make-up, had placed no restrictions on the
questions in the interview and talked freely about a variety of
subjects.
	   ``I believe that (the judge) believed my medical evidence'' that
the child's injuries were old and not the result of her shaking
him, as the prosecution claimed, Ms. Woodward said.
	   ``I don't think (the jury) understood the medical evidence,''
she said. ``To have two doctors giving two extremely different
interpretations of the same piece of evidence and to expect a lay
person to chose between the two I think is impossible.''
	   Told that she had been described as ``cold'' and calculating in
the witness box, she said: ``I guess maybe it is the British in me
that I'm naturally restrained. I saw it as my big chance to tell
everybody, and I did hold back with crying, because I was trying so
desperately to tell my story, to tell what happened.''
	   She said she found the recommendation by a Supreme Judicial
Court justice that she be barred from working with children
``incredibly hurtful.''
	   ``And there is a little bit of a stigma to it that I feel almost
that I've lost the right to look at a child, that I've lost the
right to tell a mother that her child is beautiful, or to coo at a
baby,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward, 20, said she was made a scapegoat for the baby's
death because authorities needed to blame someone.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. That seemed to be
the problem _ that, well, if the parents didn't do it, who did?
There's only you left. There was the whole feeling that somebody
had to pay and that somebody had to be me.''
	   Asked about her relationship with Matthew's parents, Deborah and
Sunil, she replied, ``I liked them. I think we got on pretty
well.'' But she added, ``We had our ups and downs. I mean I'd only
been living there 10 weeks. And I was 18 and there were the normal
frictions that you might expect when somebody comes to live in your
home.''
	   The Eappens were not immediately available for comment, but
Fredric Ellis, the attorney representing them in a civil suit
against Ms. Woodward said ``it is obvious she is now more
interested in her celebrity status than the truth.''
	   Paul Spellman, the baby's uncle, said Ms. Woodward already had a
chance to tell her story in court.
	   ``What she says after that is inconsequential,'' Spellman said.
``Whatever she says is not to be believed and she's proven that.

Bus plunges into river in north India, 40 tourists feared killed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A tourist bus winding down a mountain
from a popular northern Indian tourist resort plunged into a river
and 40 people were feared killed, a local official said Tuesday.
	   Workers recovered nine bodies from the wreckage of the bus after
it hurtled into the Beas river near Ramshila, 375 kilometers (230
miles) north of New Delhi, on Monday night, senior Himachal Pradesh
state government official R.D. Chaman said by telephone.
	   Thirteen tourists from the group, traveling to Chandigarh from
the popular hill resort of Manali, were rescued by divers who
borrowed rafts from other tourists, Chaman said.
	   The bus was carrying 53 people, all believed to be Indians.
	   Divers were fighting the deep, strong currents of the Beas to
look for the remaining passengers, most of whom were believed to
have been washed away.
	   Chaman said workers drove cranes through the night from the
provincial capital of Shimla to reach the site of the accident
early Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ When U.S. President Clinton arrives in Beijing,
he will meet a Chinese leadership beset by deepening problems _
from a slowing economy to challenges to its own political
authority.
	   For China, the summit is a chance to show itself as an emerging,
responsible global power. But global power ultimately depends on
internal stability, and China's leaders are struggling to keep the
world's most-populous nation on a stable course.
	   Among the problems now troubling Zhongnanhai, the high-walled
leadership compound in central Beijing:
	   _New Premier Zhu Rongji, touted as a pragmatist, wants to keep
economic growth strong and force failing state industries and banks
to play by capitalist rules. But his plans are imperiled by Asia's
financial upheaval, worsening unemployment and bureaucratic
resistance.
	   _As the economy slows, risks are growing for the ruling
Communist Party. Outbursts of protest and crime by dispossessed
members of the once-protected proletariat are rocking cities.
	   _Morale in the military _ the ultimate protector of party power
_ is sinking. Feeling the economic pinch, the People's Liberation
Army's own industries are laying off workers, many of them the
wives of servicemen. Officers worry about how to support their
families on meager salaries.
	   The domestic unease has stripped some gloss off the bright
prospects for Zhu and his Cabinet, which marks its 100th day in
office Friday, the day Clinton lands in Beijing.
	   For Clinton, eight days of negotiating and toasting Chinese
leaders offers opportunities. They may be in a mood to compromise
to preserve their huge stake in the U.S. market and win a
presidential seal of approval to inspire foreign investors.
	   ``The initiative is all in the United States' hands,'' said Wang
Shan, an author and political commentator. ``China needs so many
things from the United States.''
	   At his inaugural news conference in March, Zhu promised 8
percent growth, a threshold seen as critical to meeting his
three-year goal to turn around loss-making state industries and
absorb more than 30 million state workers to be laid off.
	   The plans _ along with a paring of the bureaucracy _ would rid
the economy of the last vestiges of central planning and launch a
new phase in the acclaimed reforms that have quadrupled national
wealth and pulled tens of millions of Chinese out of poverty.
	   When Zhu was announcing his plans, few decision-makers expected
Asia's financial crisis to deteriorate and drag down China's
already slowing economy. Japan's economic torpor and sinking yen
have threatened a crucial export market and source of investment
for China.
	   Exports declined in May for the first time in nearly two years.
Foreign investment in the first five months of the year weakened.
	   Few economists now predict 8 percent growth. Even Finance
Minister Xiang Huaicheng, who insisted last week that the target
could be met, conceded ``relatively great effort will be
required.''
	   There may be a ``recession with Chinese characteristics'' _ a 5
or 6 percent clip that in other countries would be considered
booming _ said Lin Yifu, an economist at elite Beijing University.
	   Questions remain, however, whether that will be enough to create
jobs and keep simmering discontent in check. Layoffs are coming
relentlessly. Last month the coal industry alone predicted it would
lose a half-million workers in three years.
	   In a notice to all officials Monday, party and government
leaders acknowledged that China faces a ``crucial situation'' in
caring for the unemployed, with jobs and welfare funds scarce.
	   Hard-luck cities like Wuhan and Xi'an, once titans of centrally
planned industry, have been beset by demonstrations this month.
Some of the unemployed have turned to crime. Bombings have been
reported in Wuhan, Kunming and other cities.
	   ``People have no hope for the future,'' said Wang, the author.
	   Attempts to revive the economy and stave off unrest have taken
on ad hoc, totalitarian and even desperate overtones.
	   In a secret document, the Communist Party Central Committee
ordered all government agencies to be on guard for challenges to
the regime, Hong Kong newspapers have reported.
	   Sichuan province has ordered every official to ``adopt'' an
unemployed worker. As one solution, Chongqing city's state-run
trade union federation gave laid-off women textile workers
shoeshine boxes.
	   In the rust-belt capital of Shenyang, the mayor has peddled
state industries for as little as 12 cents. The catch: The buyers
must assume the enterprise's debts and massive social welfare
payments. There have been few takers.

Blue Jays beat the Expos, 14-2 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Juan Guzman pitched a seven-hitter for his first
win since May 26 and Jose Canseco homered Monday night, leading the
Toronto Blue Jays to a 14-2 rout of the Montreal Expos.
	   Guzman (4-9) walked one and struck out five in his first
complete game since Aug. 21, 1996. The right-hander had three
losses and a no-decision in his previous four starts.
	   Carlos Delgado and Juan Samuel also homered as the Blue Jays won
the first of four games this week between Canada's teams. Darrin
Fletcher went 4-for-5 with two RBIs and Mike Stanley had three of
Toronto's 18 hits.
 &UR; White Sox 5, Pirates 4 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, the Chicago White Sox scored four runs in the
first inning, then held off a Pittsburgh comeback with Ray Durham's
go-ahead homer in the sixth.
	   The White Sox survived a wildly ineffective start by Tom
Fordham, who left without retiring a batter, to win their second in
seven games.
	   Fordham, making his first start of the season and second of his
career, walked all three batters he faced and threw only three of
16 pitches for strikes. But Carlos Castillo (3-4) wriggled out of
the jam by allowing only one run, and went on to pitch five innings
for the victory.
	   The Pirates tied it with a three-run third on Kevin Young's
two-run homer and rookie Aramis Ramirez's RBI double. But Castillo
wound up the winner when Durham hit a two-out shot that was the
only run allowed by reliever Elmer Dessens (2-2) in 4 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Phillies 9, Red Sox 8, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Boston, Gregg Jefferies singled home Alex Arias in the 10th
inning as the Philadelphia Phillies rallied from a five-run deficit
to beat the Boston Red Sox.
	   Kevin Jordan singled to open the 10th against Tom Gordon (4-2),
Mark Lewis bunted pinch-runner Kevin Sefcik to second and Arias
walked. Doug Glanville singled to left, but Troy O'Leary's throw
beat Sefcik home and Scott Hatteberg held onto the ball despite a
jarring collision.
	   Jefferies followed with a single to right, and Darren Lewis'
throw wasn't in time. Wayne Gomes (6-2) earned the victory with 1
1-3 innings of scoreless relief and Mark Leiter pitched the 10th
for his 14th save.
 &UR; Royals 3, Reds 0 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Jeff King hit his fourth homer on Kansas City's
eight-game road trip and Shane Mack added a solo shot as the Royals
beat the slumping Cincinnati Reds.
	   The Reds lost their ninth straight _ their worst slump in more
than two years _ and had more turmoil before the game when hitting
coach Ken Griffey angrily left the stadium. He is expected to
rejoin the team on Tuesday and won't be fined.
	   Cincinnati has lost 17 of 20 in June to fall to 30-47. That's a
game worse than the 1982 team, which opened 31-46 and finished
61-101 to set the franchise record for losses in a season.
 &UR; Orioles 7, Mets 2 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Mike Mussina pitched a two-hitter and the
Baltimore Orioles handed Bobby Jones his first loss since April 30.
	   Mussina opened the game by getting five straight outs before
giving up successive homers to Brian McRae and Butch Huskey. The
Mets hit three balls out of the infield the rest of the way.
	   Mussina (6-4), who had an 8.44 ERA in three starts since being
sidelined three weeks with a broken nose, struck out seven in his
second complete game of the season.
	   Jones (6-4) was 5-0 in his previous eight starts. He gave up
five runs and 12 hits in six innings.
 &UR; Yankees 6, Braves 4 &QC; 
	   In New York, Tim Raines hit a two-run double in the seventh
inning and the New York Yankees, in the opening matchup of what
many people predict will be a World Series preview, rallied past
the Atlanta Braves.
	   A crowd of 53,316 saw the Yankees come back three times in a
meeting of the teams that began the day with the two best records
in baseball.
	   Starting pitchers Greg Maddux and Andy Pettitte already were
gone when the Yankees struck for three runs in the seventh against
three Braves relievers.
	   Dennis Martinez (2-4) took over for Maddux with a 4-3 lead, but
instead lost his 13th straight decision to the Yankees.
	    &UR; Indians 3, Cubs 1 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Dwight Gooden continued to dominate the Cubs and
Omar Vizquel hit a tiebreaking RBI single in the seventh inning as
the Cleveland Indians beat Chicago.
	   David Bell hit a solo homer for the Indians, who won for the
fifth time in 12 games. The Cubs have lost five of their last
eight.
	   Chicago's Sammy Sosa, who needs one more homer in June to tie
the major league record of 18 in any month, went 0-for-4. He struck
out twice, hit into a double play and popped out.
	   Gooden, who beat the Cubs 27 times while pitching for the New
York Mets, pitched six strong innings to improve his career record
against Chicago to 28-4. Gooden (2-3) gave up one run and four
hits.
 &UR; Twins 5, Astros 3 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Eric Milton won for the first time since May 15 and
Terry Steinbach homered as Minnesota defeated Houston.
	   Milton (4-6) allowed two runs and two hits in 6 2-3 innings. The
left-hander, who won his major league debut on April 5, had four
no-decisions and two losses since beating the Yankees last month.
	   Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 15th save.
 &UR; Cardinals 4, Tigers 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Todd Stottlemyre pitched eight strong innings and
Brian Jordan drove in two runs as the St. Louis Cardinals won their
season-high fifth straight.
	   It was the first meeting between the teams since the 1968 World
Series, won by the Tigers in seven games.
	   The Cardinals made it seven victories in eight games despite
another quiet game from Mark McGwire, who went 1-for-4 with two
strikeouts. McGwire, who leads the majors with 33 homers, hasn't
hit one in his last 17 at-bats.

China wants President Clinton to make statement on Taiwan 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China wants U.S. President Bill Clinton to
reaffirm publicly that the United States will abide by commitments
not to sell Taiwan advanced weapons, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said Tuesday.
	   A public pledge on Taiwan appears to be the only concrete
measure China is expecting to result from Clinton's summit with
President Jiang Zemin later this week in Beijing.
	   Pressed for examples of other actions that would help make the
Clinton's visit a success, Tang said only that he expected talks
between the two leaders to be ``wide ranging and quite rich.''
	   ``The president should, at an appropriate occasion, make a
public statement reiterating what the U.S. has already promised on
the Taiwan question,'' Tang said during a pre-summit news
conference. ``The U.S. side should also indicate it will take
concrete actions to match the commitment it has made with deeds.''
	   Tang said that U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan remained a divisive
issue. Taiwan was a staunch U.S. ally for much of the Cold War but
Beijing considers the island a rebel province to be retaken by
force if necessary.
	   ``The United States should not sell advanced weapons or
equipment to Taiwan and it should gradually reduce and eventually
phase out arms sales to Taiwan,'' Tang said.
	   Despite aggressive lobbying by Beijing for a new agreement to
bolster three previous joint communiques on Taiwan _ including a
1982 agreement to gradually reduce U.S. arms sales to Taipei _ top
U.S. officials have indicated no such statement is planned.
	   Tang declined to comment on whether a U.S. refusal to offer a
stronger commitment on Taiwan could sour the atmosphere of a summit
the Chinese have said they want to be an ``all-round success.''
	   ``Since the president hasn't arrived yet and the meetings
haven't occurred it would be premature to comment at present,'' he
said.
	   Only a slew of minor agreements are expected on educational and
military affairs during Clinton's June 25-July 3 visit.
	   To wrest concessions on Taiwan, China might slow recent progress
on military relations and discussions of differences over human
rights, according to Chinese and Western scholars.
	   On trade, little progress has been made, despite China's desire
to join the World Trade Organization and U.S. displeasure over its
growing trade deficit with China, dlrs 49.7 billion by Washington's
count last year.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky called a new
Chinese market-opening proposal for gaining entry to the WTO
insufficient at the end of talks last week in Beijing.
	   Barshefsky was due to return to Beijing this week in a last
ditch effort to reach agreement, Chinese trade minister Shi
Guangsheng said Monday.
	   China also would like to see the United States lift sanctions
imposed by Washington after the 1989 military suppression of
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, in which hundreds, if
not thousands, of civilians died.
	   Tang contended that the restrictions imposed by the United
States and other Western countries had not influenced China's
policies.
	   ``Sanctions are not a good thing. They merely are a reflection
of power politics,'' Tang said.

Canada: APEC has room for trade flexibility 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-APEC
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's representative at a meeting of
Pacific-Rim trade ministers said Tuesday that developing countries
would be given more ``flexibility'' in a plan to quickly open up
nine markets to free trade.
	   ``Canada wants this issue to move along as directly as
possible,'' said Julian Reed, the parliamentary secretary to the
minister of international trade.
	   The United States is leading the call for setting specific
tariff-rate reduction targets and dates under a plan known as early
voluntary sector liberalization.
	   The plan would eliminate trade barriers on environmental
products and services, energy, fishery, forestry, toys, jewelry,
medical goods, chemical products and telecommunications.
	   But APEC members disagree on how fast to go. Japan, which has
just fallen into recession, has argued the group's weakest
economies should be given more time to lower tariffs in markets
ranging from forestry and fisheries to telecommunications.
	   Those are precisely the areas which big commodity exporting
countries, such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, would
like to see opened up right away.
	   Industries included under the voluntary sector liberalization
plan represent dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of trade among APEC members.
The plan calls for the liberalization process to begin in 1999.
	   Reed said he was optimistic an agreement would be reached at the
meeting.

Japan fears effects of South Asian nuke tests on Asian security 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan threaten the
security balance in Asia, but the continent's economic crisis has
slowed military growth in the region, Japan's Defense Agency said
in a report Tuesday.
	   The annual report also noted that increasing military contacts
in the region between Japan, the United States, China and Russia
have helped to balance instability in Asia.
	   The nuclear weapons tests in India and Pakistan last month have
sparked concern their long-standing rivalry could lead to nuclear
war and drag the region into conflict.
	   ``The tests could affect not only the security of South Asia,
but also efforts toward the nonproliferation of weapons of mass
destruction,'' the Defense Agency said.
	   Japan, the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack, has
imposed sanctions on the two countries and cosponsored a U.N.
resolution demanding that they refrain from further tests.
	   Starting in 1996, the Defense Agency's annual report has
targeted China as Japan's largest military concern. But this year's
paper reflected the growing complexity of the Asian security scene.
	   The agency noted, for example, an expansion of military
capabilities around Asia since the end of the Cold War, thanks in
large part to the region's burgeoning economic power.
	   The growth in military power is troubling, considering the list
of unsolved conflicts and possible flashpoints in the region, such
as the Korean Peninsula and disputed territory, the report said.
	   But the economic troubles brought with the onset of the Asian
financial crisis last July have squeezed military budgets, stemming
the increase in military might in the region.
	   ``Since last July, they have been cutting back on military
spending, stopping purchases of new weapons and trimming budgets
for exercises,'' the report said.
	   For example, Thailand is now reviewing its planned purchase of
F/A-18 fighters, the agency said.
	   The report devoted an entire chapter to last year's revision in
the guidelines for the U.S.-Japan defense treaty, which triggered
fears in the region of a wider military role for Tokyo in Asia.
	   Although Japan limits its combat troops to a strictly defensive
role, the new guidelines called for increased Japanese cooperation
with the American military in case of an emergency in the area
around Japan.
	   In Tuesday's report, the Defense Agency attempted to assuage
Asian neighbors by stating that the phrase ``area around Japan''
was not directed at any particular country or geographical area.

Tycoon returns from North Korea with investment projects 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's richest man, fresh from
a trip to North Korea, said Tuesday he has signed a contract to
start sightseeing tours of the North's scenic east coast.
	   Chung Ju-yung, founder-owner of the giant Hyundai group, said
the tour project could start as early as this fall if the Seoul
government approves it.
	   ``I've returned after signing a contract to develop Diamond
Mountain and start sightseeing tours of the scenic tourist site,''
Chung told reporters at Panmunjom, a neutral village inside the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
	   Chung said his Hyundai group plans to send as many as 1,000
tourists a day aboard a cruise ship to see the mountain near his
birthplace, Tongchun.
	   Hyundai officials accompanying Chung said tourists would go to
Wonsan, a major port on the North's east coast, by ship and then
travel to the mountain by land.
	   The 82-year-old tycoon said he also discussed several industrial
projects with North Korean officials, including the possible
relocation of some of Hyundai Motors Co.'s subcompact car assembly
lines. North Korean labor costs are cheap _ about one-eighth of
those in South Korea.
	   Industry officials warned, however, that Chung's projects are
vulnerable to political and military tensions on the divided
peninsula. They cited the discovery of a North Korean submarine
entangled in a fishing net off South Korea's east coast on Monday.
	   The submarine was seized in the general area where a larger
North Korean sub ran aground in 1996 _ an incident that left 37
people dead and sent inter-Korea relations to their lowest level in
years.
	   Chung went to the North on June 16 with 500 cattle as a gift. In
the North, he visited his birthplace and several industrial plants
and tourist sites.
	   The 500 cattle _ 250 cows and 250 bulls _ were part of 1,000
cattle and 60,000 tons of corn Chung has promised to give in
exchange for his latest visit, his second since 1989.
	   Chung was the first South Korean civilian to cross the border
into North Korea unaccompanied by government officials since the
peninsula was divided into the communist North and the capitalist
South.
	   The peninsula is technically in a state of war, with no peace
treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Trying to reassure investors, government rallies behind major bank throughout

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials rallied behind one of the
nation's largest lenders Tuesday, hoping to calm investors in what
is fast becoming a major test of how effectively Japan can handle a
bad-debt crisis looming over its banking system.
	   Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd., which is saddled with more
than 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans, rebounded
Tuesday after Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga and other top
financial officials expressed confidence in the bank's ability to
stay afloat.
	   Matsunaga stressed that LTCB's individual depositors and
institutional investors are fully protected. But he added, ``We
welcome any plan that the bank takes to strengthen its
operations.''
	   Worries about the bank have swelled as Japan, slogging through
its worst recession in decades, has come under pressure to move
more aggressively to fix its troubled financial system.
	   Ruling-party politicians are discussing the establishment of a
government-run ``bridge bank'' to support the overall financial
system by taking over banks' bad loans.
	   The party has pledged to announce the details of its plan in two
weeks, but Finance Ministry officials say that the idea needs a
good deal more study.
	   ``There are still many details to be worked out, such as how to
prevent losses from new loans and where to get the funds for the
bank,'' Administrative Vice Finance Minister Koji Tanami said on
Monday.
	   Investors fear greater determination by the government to clean
up the bad-loan mess may mean it will let more weak banks fail _
and the Long-Term Credit Bank has become a focus of their concern.
	   Bank officials have vehemently denied rumors that the bank is on
the verge of collapse, but concerns over its stability ballooned
after Moody's Investors Services lowered its credit rating on
Friday.
	   On Monday, two larger banks _ Daiwa Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd. _ denied reports they were negotiating to merge
with the LTCB, sending its stock plunging 45 percent, to 62 yen (45
U.S. cents), before trading was halted by exchange rules that limit
declines.
	   The stock recovered Tuesday, rising 14 yen to 76 yen in early
trading.
	   The LTCB, which has 3,600 employees and 28 trillion (dlrs 203
billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks established at the
end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in an
effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   But as deregulation has made it easier for companies to raise
money directly by issuing stocks or selling bonds, the banks' role
has been largely lost.
	   LTCB's bad loans are also just a fraction of the stunning 76
trillion yen (dlrs 550 billion) in bad debt held by all Japanese
banks.
	   Even so, it is being seen as a test of how the government will
handle the banking crisis.
	   Speaking at a regular press conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Kanezo Muraoka said the Bank of Japan would provide ``full
support'' if Long-Term Credit Bank had difficulty raising operating
funds.
	   The central bank can make emergency loans to banks when necesary
to stabilize the financial system.
	   A report Tuesday in the Yomiuri, Japan's largest circulation
newspaper, said ruling-party officials have also suggested a merger
between the Long Term Credit Bank and the Japan Development Bank, a
quasi-public institution.
	   Financial authorities customarily have orchestrated buyouts of
troubled banks by stronger institutions as a way of avoiding the
lost jobs that would come from an outright bank failure.
	   But it's not clear whether that custom _ never explicitly
acknowledged as government policy _ still holds. Last week, the
Finance Ministry said any possible mergers were for banks to decide
on their own.
	   And investors are well aware of what can happen when the
government keeps its distance.
	   In November, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd., the largest Japanese
bank to fail, went under with 5,400 employees and 8.5 trillion yen
(dlrs 62 billion) in assets.

French blame German squads of `thugs' for violence England-Romania game.

Eds: UPDATES with 10 people arrested in minor scuffles after
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The matches went on, but much of the soccer
world's attention was on a hospital in this northern French city,
where a policeman lay struggling for his life after his head was
bashed in by a German fan wielding an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, was in a deep coma
after suffering ``repeated violent blows from a massive object''
after Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said
Monday night. They could barely hide their pessimism about his
chances.
	   Nivel was cornered by a group of neo-Nazis on a narrow street in
Lens, a nearby town in northern France. He collapsed unconscious in
a pool of blood on the sidewalk.
	   At the other end of the country in Toulouse, 1,800 police were
in force Monday outside the England-Romania game, to guard against
a repeat of the violence that plagued Marseille, site of England's
last contest.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars appeared to
keep most violence in check. About 10 people were arrested and
three injured in a couple of minor scuffles, police said.
	   A British reporter, Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association,
broke his collarbone when English fans, who accused him of giving
them a bad name, threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   A 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested for attacking Nivel.
His name wasn't released. Police announced late Monday that his
detention had been extended for another 24 hours, and he was to
appear before a judge Tuesday afternoon.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged. One
German fan was sentenced to three months in prison in connection
with weekend mayhem.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But, he said, the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.
	   In a statement released at the end of an emergency meeting, FIFA
denounced ``the barbaric acts of violence by those who have nothing
to do with soccer or any other sport.''

International pilots: SilkAir crash in Indonesia won't be solved 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The cause of December's SilkAir crash in
Indonesia, in which 104 people died, will probably remain a mystery
because so much of the Boeing 737 was destroyed, an official of an
international pilots' group was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   ``In order to investigate, you've got to have information,
you've got to have parts,'' Capt. Paul McCarthy, of the
International Federation of Airline Pilots' Association told The
Straits Times newspaper.
	   The paper quoted McCarthy as saying the destruction of the
SilkAir passenger jet was so total ``that probably the best we will
ever be able to do is to give it our best guess. We may never know
for certain what happened.''
	   The SilkAir plane was on its way to Singapore when it fell from
the sky and plunged into the Musi River on the Indonesian island of
Sumatra on Dec. 19.
	   The remaining parts of the plane were moved a few months ago
from Indonesia to Singapore, where they were reconstructed in a
hangar. Investigators, overseen by Indonesian aviation officials,
have made public no information since March 10.
	   Investigation has been hampered by the fact that the flight data
and cockpit voice recorders stopped functioning moments before the
crash.
	   Usually the information on those recorders, detailing what the
plane and crew were doing in the final minutes, are vital clues to
the cause of a crash.

Japan seen stalling Pacific-Rim trade opening talks CHANGES overline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with talks stalled by Japan, ADDS comment;
By BETH DUFF-BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Talks among Pacific-Rim trade ministers
appeared stalled Tuesday by Japan's insistence that it be given
more ``flexibility'' in opening its markets to free trade.
	   With the backdrop of the year-long Asian crisis ever present,
the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum took
up for a second day a formidable plan to begin liberalizing trade
in nine industries by next year.
	   New Zealand's Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said Japan was
holding up finalization of the liberalization pact, known as early
voluntary sector liberalization, which ministers were expected to
sign off on in time for APEC's November summit in the Malaysian
capital, Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``We've almost got unanimity,'' Smith said. ``We're still
discussing the package with the Japanese, that's it.''
	   By midday, the Japanese trade minister was in his hotel room and
not attending the talks.
	   Delegates to the talks said the ministers were now considering
several options, including a plan to defer the plan for three
months, since Japan appeared reluctant to compromise.
	   Since the last time the APEC trade ministers met, Asia has been
wracked further by plummeting currencies, shrinking economies and
the downfall of several leaders. Asia's powerhouse, Japan, is in
full-blown recession. Its banking sector is crumbling and the yen
has taken a beating.
	   The United States and New Zealand are at the forefront of
pushing the EVSL concept, insisting market liberalization is an
important means out of the Asian economic slump. It wants specific
dates and tariff reductions set in the nine industries representing
dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   And it wants Japan on board.
	   ``Japan has a responsibility, as the second largest economy in
the world to participate,'' said a senior U.S. trade official who
asked not to be named.
	   ``We view it as critical to reaffirm the commitment to
liberalization in this part of the world to show that this setback
is temporary and will not undermine the process which we consider
to be essential for growth in trade and prosperity to people in the
region.''
	   Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia are calling
for more emphasis on the APEC principles of voluntarism and
flexibility in liberalizing ``sensitive'' industries, particularly
fish and forests.
	   Sources say Japanese Trade Minister Mitsuo Horiuchi told U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on Monday that fast-track
liberalization must be voluntary.
	   According to a senior Japanese official, Horiuchi told
Barshefsky that full APEC participation would be ``very difficult''
if countries reluctant to open their markets were denied
flexibility in setting free-market schedules.
	   APEC's mission is free trade among the developed member nations
by 2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fishery, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   For Japan, six of those sectors _ fish, forestry, toys, jewelry,
energy and environment _ are seen as ``sensitive'' industries. In
particular, the forestry and fish industries are seen as vulnerable
to foreign competition.
	   Thailand's deputy commerce minister, Photipong Lamsam, said
Thailand planned to support the EVSL plan, but also said it needed
more leeway in opening its chemical and toy markets.
	   ``We are not going to undermine the integrity of the package as
a whole,'' Photipong told the Associated Press. ``But some
sacrifices may have to made in the way of flexibility.''
	   South Korean trade minister Han Duck Soo told AP on Monday night
that his country, too, would call for ``flexibility'' in opening up
its fisheries and forestry markets.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

	   In Arlington, Texas, Andy Benes pitched eight scoreless innings
and Dave Dellucci went 3-for-4 as Arizona handed Texas its first
shutout loss of the season.
	   Benes (6-7) gave up six hits, struck out five and allowed just
two runners past first. Rangers starter John Burkett (4-8) allowed
five runs and nine hits in 7 1-3 innings.

	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Antonio Alfonseca pitched out of a
bases-loaded, one-out jam in the 12th inning to give the Marlins a
victory over the Devil Rays in the first game between Florida's two
teams.
	   The first regular-season game between the clubs only drew 25,623
to Tropicana Field, and only about half of the crowd remained at
the end.
	   Wade Boggs singled to open the 12th off Alfonseca (1-2) and
Aaron Ledesma sacrificed. After Fred McGriff was walked
intentionally, Rich Butler singled to load the bases.
	   Alfonseca, the Marlins' seventh pitcher, then got Dave Martinez
on a forceout at home and retired John Flaherty on a grounder to
end it.

give the surging Padres their 13th victory in 14 games.
	   Leyritz, acquired in a trade with Boston on Sunday, lined an RBI
double in the fourth and hit a two-run bloop double in the sixth as
San Diego tied Atlanta for the best NL record at 50-26.
	   Reliever Dan Miceli (7-2) got the victory despite giving up a
game-tying two-run double to Alex Rodriguez in the seventh.
Rodriguez also hit a solo homer for the Mariners, who lost for the
seventh time in nine games.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 23rd straight save this
season, and 31st in a row overall.
 &UR; Angels 6, Dodgers 5 &QC; 
	   In Anaheim, California, Glenn Hoffman, making his major league
managing debut, watched as the Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen
squandered another big lead in a loss to the Anaheim Angels.
	   The game ended when Jim Bruske, the Dodgers' third reliever in
the ninth inning, walked Tim Salmon on five pitches to force home
the winning run.
	   Hoffman was named Los Angeles' interim manager less than 24
hours earlier, replacing the fired Bill Russell.
	   Charles Johnson drove in three runs for the Dodgers, who have
lost seven of their last nine. The Angels, by contrast, have won 19
of 22 and built their AL West lead to 3 1/2 games over Texas by
beating the Dodgers for the first time in five interleague
meetings.
 &UR; Giants 12, Athletics 8 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Brian Johnson had a pair of RBI singles
in the fifth and the San Francisco Giants scored nine runs in the
inning to beat the Oakland Athletics.
	   Darryl Hamilton added a two-run double and Chris Jones had a
two-run single as the Giants sent 13 batters to the plate in the
fifth.
	   Rey Sanchez added a three-run homer in the seventh for the
Giants, who had six doubles in the game _ including two by Barry
Bonds.
	   The nine-run fifth was the biggest inning of the season for the
Giants, who had scored eight in the fifth inning of their June 1
game at home against Cincinnati.

Japan ready to challenge entry to disputed islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is ready to take action if Chinese activists
from Hong Kong illegally challenge its control over a group of
uninhabited islands, the coast guard said Tuesday.
	   ``We are prepared to respond appropriately to any illegal
entry,'' said Akira Suzuki, spokesman of the Maritime Safety
Agency's regional headquarters on Okinawa.
	   Suzuki also said the agency, Japan's coast guard, maintains air
and sea patrols around the disputed islands, known as the Diaoyu in
Chinese and the Senkaku in Japanese.
	   The islands, located about 220 kilometers (136 miles) northeast
of Taipei in the East China Sea, are controlled by Japan but
claimed by both Taiwan and China.
	   A group of 25 activists set out in a 10-ton trawler from a Hong
Kong port Sunday with the intention of joining a separate group
from Taiwan to protest Japanese control over the disputed
territory.
	   The group plans to plant a Chinese flag on one of the islands to
protest Japan's rival claim, expedition leader Albert Ho has said.
	   Two years ago, a Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned
on a similar expedition when Japanese coast guard vessels kept him
from landing on the islands.
	   On a later protest expedition, several activists from Taiwan and
Hong Kong succeeded in planting a flag briefly on one of the
islands.
	   Also, in May 1997, the coast guard prevented Japanese right-wing
activists from reaching one of the islands, where they have built
two lighthouses. One of the lighthouses later was reportedly
knocked down by a storm.

Philippine stocks end mixed as investors still cautious on Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed Tuesday
as investors remained cautious in the absence of significant news
to provide much-needed market direction, traders said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 6.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,695.86, following
Monday's 2.9 percent fall.
	   Decliners, however, edged out gainers 53 to 40 and 38 issues
were unchanged as most investors remained bearish toward Asian
stocks in general on continuing concerns over Japan's weakening
economy, traders said.
	   Most blue-chip stocks, though, have reached oversold levels
following the index's 7.6 percent fall over the previous two
sessions. This has provided a few investors an opportunity to
accumulate fundamentally sound index issues, traders said.
	   Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional
sales at Orion-Squire Securities Inc., said investors were hoping
in vain to get some direction from other Asian stock markets and
Wall Street overnight.
	   ``With the lack of direction, there was no confidence to buy
stocks so the market upside was limited,'' he said.
	   Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said the market
isn't likely to stage a rally in the near term. The volume of
trades is also expected to remain thin as investors stay on the
sidelines.
	   Bank stocks were hard-hit Tuesday as flag carrier Philippine
Airlines Inc.'s debt problems were featured prominently in
newspaper headlines. The airline last week filed a rehabilitation
plan with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to mounting
losses and nearly dlrs 2 billion in debt it won't be able to
service.
	   With the economy slowing down and the peso still weakening
against the dollar, traders feared more companies may be unable to
service their debts, to the detriment of the banking sector.
	   The peso, meanwhile, fell against the dollar in heavy morning
trading, with strong demand for the U.S. currency because of
continuing concerns over Japan's weakening economy, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.331 pesos in morning trading, compared to
Monday's 41.235 pesos.
	   Regional markets are closely monitoring the Japanese
government's plans for dealing with the banking sector's problems,
traders said.

Japan seen stalling Pacific-Rim trade opening talks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comments saying Japan lone holdout
By BETH DUFF-BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Talks among Pacific-Rim trade ministers
appeared stalled Tuesday by Japan's insistence that it be given
more ``flexibility'' in opening its markets to free trade.
	   With the backdrop of the year-long Asian crisis ever present,
the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum took
up for a second day a formidable plan to begin liberalizing trade
in nine industries by next year.
	   New Zealand's Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said Japan was
holding up finalization of the liberalization pact, known as early
voluntary sector liberalization, which ministers were expected to
sign off on in time for APEC's November summit in the Malaysian
capital, Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``We've almost got unanimity,'' Smith said. ``We're still
discussing the package with the Japanese, that's it.''
	   Several other senior officials attending the talks said Japan
was the lone holdout.
	   ``I don't know why Japan (won't) participate,'' said Michael
Fradkov, the Russian delegate observing the talks before Moscow is
admitted to APEC in November. ``Maybe they have their own agenda.''
	   A senior Japanese official, when asked whether there would be a
compromise by the end of the day, said: ``I don't see how.''
	   Delegates to the talks said the ministers were now considering
several options, including a plan to defer the plan for three
months, since Japan appeared reluctant to compromise.
	   Since the last time the APEC trade ministers met, Asia has been
wracked further by plummeting currencies, shrinking economies and
the downfall of several leaders. Asia's powerhouse, Japan, is in
full-blown recession. Its banking sector is crumbling and the yen
has taken a beating.
	   The United States and New Zealand are at the forefront of
pushing the EVSL concept, insisting market liberalization is an
important means out of the Asian economic slump. It wants specific
dates and tariff reductions set in the nine industries representing
dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   And it wants Japan on board.
	   ``Japan has a responsibility, as the second largest economy in
the world to participate,'' said a senior U.S. trade official who
asked not to be named.
	   ``We view it as critical to reaffirm the commitment to
liberalization in this part of the world to show that this setback
is temporary and will not undermine the process which we consider
to be essential for growth in trade and prosperity to people in the
region.''
	   Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia are calling
for more emphasis on the APEC principles of voluntarism and
flexibility in liberalizing ``sensitive'' industries, particularly
fish and forests.
	   Sources say Japanese Trade Minister Mitsuo Horiuchi told U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on Monday that fast-track
liberalization must be voluntary.
	   According to a senior Japanese official, Horiuchi told
Barshefsky that full APEC participation would be ``very difficult''
if countries reluctant to open their markets were denied
flexibility in setting free-market schedules.
	   APEC's mission is free trade among the developed member nations
by 2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fishery, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   For Japan, six of those sectors _ fish, forestry, toys, jewelry,
energy and environment _ are seen as ``sensitive'' industries. In
particular, the forestry and fish industries are seen as vulnerable
to foreign competition.
	   Thailand's deputy commerce minister, Photipong Lamsam, said
Thailand planned to support the EVSL plan, but also said it needed
more leeway in opening its chemical and toy markets.
	   ``We are not going to undermine the integrity of the package as
a whole,'' Photipong told the Associated Press. ``But some
sacrifices may have to made in the way of flexibility.''
	   South Korean trade minister Han Duck Soo told AP on Monday night
that his country, too, would call for ``flexibility'' in opening up
its fisheries and forestry markets.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

Clinton, Republicans view China through different lenses An AP News Analysis AP Special Correspondent

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and his Republican
critics in Congress sound as though they are talking about
different Chinas in debating his policy on the eve of his summit
journey there.
	   Where he sees a prospective partner, they warn of a potential
rival riding an acquiescent American policy.
	   He advocates engagement; they call his course hollow.
	   He claims progress; they see intransigence.
	   A Democratic ally, Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, said Monday
there has been phenomenal progress in China, and that it is 10
times as likely to keep going with engagement as with attempts at
punishment.
	   But Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham of Michigan called it
``hollow engagement'' in which China's leaders figure they can do
what they choose without risking U.S. rebuff.
	   ``It is not a policy of give and take,'' said Republican Sen.
Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas. ``It is give and give.''
	   The argument in the Senate is a strange sendoff for Clinton's
nine days in China, the first presidential journey there in nine
years. One Democrat pleaded for a pause in the congressional debate
on China policy while he travels there, saying that is traditional
when a president goes abroad.
	   Perhaps so, but not this time. Hutchinson pushed four amendments
to impose new U.S. sanctions against China to punish human rights
abuses. He said he wasn't trying to embarrass Clinton and that they
ought to strengthen his hand in arguing for human rights. The House
has approved a series of punitive measures, on that score and
against American technology exports and satellite launches.
	   None have cleared Congress, and Republicans are divided on the
current Senate amendments, so they are likely to be blocked.
Congress will act later on Clinton's renewal of normal trade status
for China, an annual exercise, annually extended.
	   A special House committee has just been set up to investigate
U.S. satellite exports for Chinese launchings, to determine whether
they led to technology leaks harmful to U.S. security, and whether
Clinton's approval of them was influenced by Democratic campaign
contributions.
	   He says no on both counts.
	   All told, 10 congressional committees have been looking into
various aspects of U.S.-China policy. There are more than 75 bills
in Congress to deal with China, most involving sanctions. That's
more than were proposed during the previous three congresses
combined.
	   To an extent, that goes with the territory in a politically
divided government, with a Democratic president setting foreign
policy and a Republican-controlled Congress trying to influence it.
The administration said Clinton invited Congress to send a
bipartisan delegation to China with him, but only Democrats
accepted.
	   On China policy, there are differences within as well as between
parties; conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are allied,
as usual, in opposing renewal of the most-favored nation trading
status the president, as usual, renewed.
	   In the current Senate debate, five Republican committee and
subcommittee chairman and five senior Democrats joined in urging
the rejection of the anti-China amendments. They said the measures
would do serious damage to the policies that can foster change in
China toward human rights, the control of arms proliferation and
more open trade.
	   Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware said Congress should
have granted Clinton a respite from action on measures involving
China, even though some may be justified. ``The president's mission
is going to be made more difficult as a consequence of the debate
that is under way,'' he said.
	   The punitive amendments are not new business. The House passed
its versions shortly after Clinton's 1997 Washington summit with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Amid this year's controversy over
missile technology and campaign contributions, 152 House members _
all but one Republicans _ signed a letter urging Clinton to put off
the trip. The House also adopted a resolution saying he shouldn't
go to Tiananmen Square, where his formal welcoming ceremony will be
held Friday night, because it is a symbol of the 1989 massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
	   For all the advice to Clinton, members of Congress are no
strangers to China. At least 105 have gone there in the past 20
months, among them 17 who signed the letter saying Clinton
shouldn't be going now.

Tensions ease as police allow public gathering to continue 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Tensions between state authorities
and various opposition groups eased Tuesday after police allowed a
gathering of opposition party members and lawyers to go on
unhindered.
	   ``I commend the police for a more open and tolerant attitude to
public meetings,'' said the opposition leader in Parliament, Lim
Kit Siang, who is also secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party.
	   Over a period of 10 days last month, police broke up three DAP
meetings and briefly detained Lim's son, Lim Guan Eng, twice when
he spoke on politics.
	   However, police did not obstruct a lawyers' forum called ``The
Return of Legal Eagles'' at a downtown hotel in Kuala Lumpur, which
lasted until late Monday.
	   About 300 lawyers and leaders of various opposition parties
attended the meeting, in which the panelists called for ``justice,
freedom, democracy and good governance'' within the Malaysian
government.
	   Meanwhile, a consumer rights group which had earlier been banned
from organizing a forum to discuss severe water cuts in the
capital, said Monday that it would drop legal action against the
government of Selangor state.
	   The President of the Federation of Malaysian Consumer
Associations, Mohd. Hamdan Adnan, said his organization would no
longer sue the state as long as the government improved the supply
of water to nearly 2 million parched residents here.
	   ``We are now convinced that the state is doing its utmost to
tackle the problem,'' Hamdan Adnan told the New Straits Times
daily. However, he added he still wanted to see that the government
``is capable of resolving the problem.''
	   The rationing began in March. Consumer activists blame
government officials for mismanaging the country's plentiful water
resources but the state's water authorities blame the El Nino
weather phenomenon for the water shortage.
	   Rationing is likely to continue through September, when monsoons
are expected to bring rain to the region and its depleted
reservoirs.

Russia postpones satellite launch 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia postponed a planned launch of six
international satellites on Tuesday after a minor equipment
failure, a news agency reported.
	   The launch was rescheduled for Wednesday, the Interfax news
agency said, citing Russia's strategic rocket forces.
	   The launch from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan was
postponed after specialists spent time checking out a failure in
unspecified ground equipment, the report said.
	   The failure was determined to be minor, but space officials
decided to postpone the launch until the following day to ensure
there was adequate time to place the satellites in precise orbit.
	   The Zenit-2 booster is to carry into orbit satellites from six
countries, including Germany, Israel, Chile, Australia, Thailand
and Russia.
	   Russia has been pushing commercial satellite launches as a way
to help fund its space program, which struggling after the loss of
Soviet-era subsidies. Russia launched 48 commercial satellites last
year.
	   Kazakstan's Baikonur space center, built in Soviet times, is
operated by Russia under an agreement with the Kazak government.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks fall 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday
after traders and investors took profits following a surge in the
U.S. currency the day before. Tokyo stock prices fell amid worries
about Japan's economy.
	   The dollar bought 137.82 yen at midday, down 0.72 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 138.16 yen
overnight.
	   Overseas investors sold dollars to book profits after the U.S.
currency's 3 1/2 yen rise Monday, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent, to close at 15,054.60. On
Monday, the Nikkei gained 41.11 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
jointly intervened to halt the yen's slide after the dollar hit an
eight-year high against the Japanese currency.
	   The dollar rose back sharply Monday after the Japanese
government failed to offer concrete steps to prop up the yen at a
weekend meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
	   Dealers also hesitated to push the dollar higher ahead of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to China later this week.
	   Market participants said there was a good chance the United
States and Japan would again act jointly to support the yen if it
falls too much ahead of or during the visit. China has complained
that the falling yen was putting pressure on its own currency.
	   On the stock market, share prices moved lower as investors
awaited more details of Japanese government measures to tackle the
nation's sagging economy and bad debt problems at banks.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with details by July 8 of a proposed ``bridge bank''
that will take over bank debt, a main negative factor weighing on
the economy.
	   ``People are still nervous about the Liberal Democratic Party's
ability to come up with a plan'' to deal with the bad debt problem,
said Jon Yang, a salesman in the futures and options group at
Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, whose shares plunged on
Monday by 50 yen, the limit allowed under exchange rules, rose 9
yen to 71 yen Tuesday after government officials vowed support for
the troubled bank.
	   The main trigger for the steep drop in the bank's shares, which
began Friday, was the expectation that more aggressive efforts by
the government to clean up bad debts would mean letting weak banks
fail.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 11.89 points, or 1.00 percent, to 1,175.42. The TOPIX
closed up 0.04 points, insignificant in percentage terms, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.260 percent from Monday's finish of 1.255
percent, driving its price lower to 111.53 yen from 111.57 yen.

Committee: Removing children from poor countries risks repeating mistakes Associated Press 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN THORNHILL
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Removing children from poor countries
such as Romania to a supposedly better life elsewhere risked
repeating past mistakes which condemned thousands of British
children to lifelong separation from their families, two British
legislators warned Tuesday.
	   David Hinchcliffe, who heads a committee studying the
experiences of up to 10,000 children who were removed from Britain
and sent to Australia and New Zealand after World War II, said this
is one of the early lessons learnt from its work.
	   The committee is visiting Australia to interview people who came
to Australia under these schemes, and have heard experiences of
sexual and other abuse at the hands of some of their carers,
including clergy, and other bitter experiences.
	   Many of the children experienced psychiatric problems and some
attempted suicide in later life, the committee has heard.
	   Hinchcliffe said there are many contemporary lessons to be
learnt from their experiences.
	   ``In Europe, we have lots of pressures to remove poor children
from countries such as Romania and place them in better-off
countries,'' he said. ``Lessons need to be learnt.''
	   Hinchcliffe said civil and church authorities in postwar Britain
put young mothers who did not have enough money to care for their
children under great pressure to give them up.
	   ``It is quite clear that the churches leaned on these mums to
release these babies and children to come over here,'' Hinchcliffe
said.
	   ``That might seem a good idea, but when one looks back at this
scene, what ought to have happened was addressing the poverty and
problems within the U.K..''
	   Howard Stoate, another committee member, said he had been
reduced to tears by the tales of some of the former British child
migrants to Australia.
	   One witness told the committee he had prospered in Australia,
but that he would have gladly traded all his success for 10 more
minutes in the arms of his natural mother, Stoate said.
	   Hinchcliffe said that despite the trauma of family separations,
the policies under which the relocations occurred had undoubtedly
been well intentioned.
	   Committee member Audrey Wise disagreed.
	   ``I believe that there was a great deal of empire building, at
three levels, national, church and personal,'' Wise said.
	   Hinchcliffe estimated that more than 150,000 British children
were sent overseas as child migrants to countries including South
Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand under policies which ran
from before World War II until about 1970.

Japan to extend emergency rice aid to Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will extend 10.99 billion yen (dlrs 79.63
million) in emergency grant aid to help economically battered
Indonesia import rice, Japanese officials said Tuesday.
	   The Indonesian government will use the sum to import 500,000
tons of rice from Japan under lease contracts signed in Tokyo on
Tuesday.
	   Akihiro Ishibashi, spokesman of the government's Food Agency,
said the first shipments of rice will arrive in Indonesia in
August.
	   Separately, Japan will provide about 100,000 tons of rice to
Indonesia under a 1995 food aid program, the Food Agency said.
	   Hit by financial and political turmoil, Indonesia has also
suffered big grain shortages in many provinces due to prolonged
drought.

Study indicates 60 percent of coral reefs threatened 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Embargoed for release at 1300 GMT
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Nearly 60 percent of the Earth's living coral
reefs, some of which are more than 2 million years old, are
threatened by human activity from coastal development and
overfishing to inland pollution, a pro-environmental research group
said Tuesday.
	   The study by the World Resources Institute was described by its
authors as the first systematic global assessment of the health of
the Earth's ecologically precious concentrations of coral.
	   ``Like rainforests, reefs harbor much of the planet's wealth of
species and are being rapidly degraded by humans,'' said Dirk
Bryant, one of the authors. ``The news is grim.''
	   The study came only weeks after President Bill Clinton
highlighted ecologists' concerns about coral reef degradation at a
conference on oceans in Monterey, California, at which he pledged
dlrs 6 million to help restore degraded reefs in U.S. coastal
waters.
	   Coral reefs, some of which are still alive after 2.5 million
years, consist of thousands of small organisms and an outside cover
of a single-cell plant that gives off the coral's distinctive
bright colors. They are home to a fourth of all marine fish
species, according to scientists. Sensitive to pollution and even
to unusually warm water, the coral when it dies gives off a
bleached appearance.
	   The World Resources report said despite recent campaigns _
including the declaration of 1997 as the ``Year of the Reef'' and
1998 the ``Year of the Ocean'' _ there still is no concerted effort
to reverse coral reef degradation in many parts of the world.
	   Furthermore, said the study, ``we still lack comprehensive
estimates regarding the status of, and the magnitude of threats to
these aquatic ecosystems.''
	   Studies published in 1993 suggested 10 percent of the world's
coral reefs were dead and 30 percent were likely to die over the
next few decades, but scientists acknowledge these statistics,
widely circulated, were only estimates and in some cases guesswork.
	   The World Resources study included analysis of 14 types of
global maps, data collected from 800 sites known to be degraded and
information gathered by coral reef scientists to develop a model
showing the extent of reef damage and expected future degradation.
	   The results are ``an indicator of the threats to this vital
ecosystem,'' said Lauretta Burke, another of the co-authors. She
acknowledged more study is needed to identify reefs that are at
greatest risk and how best to reclaim them.
	   Among the study's findings:
	   _About 58 percent of the world's reefs are at risk of
degradation because of coastal development, destructive fishing and
pollution from inland runoff from deforestation and farming.
	   _Coastal reefs of Southeast Asia are most threatened, with more
than 80 percent at risk, primarily from coastal development and
fishing.
	   _In the United States, most reefs face some risks, with all
reefs off Florida facing potential degradation because of coastal
development and farming-related pollution.
	   _Two-thirds of the Caribbean reefs are in jeopardy, including
high risks to reefs off Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
Jamaica and Barbados. The principal culprits are overfishing and
pollution including high levels of nutrients that cause algae
growth.

South Korea captures North Korean submarine tighten

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea towed a captured North
Korean submarine into this major naval base Tuesday, unsure if its
crew was still aboard but angered by ``a clear armed provocation.''
	   Sonar scans of the submarine's hull showed no signs of life
inside, indicating that the crew was either dead or had escaped
before the boat was taken in tow, the national news agency
reported.
	   But the navy was having trouble towing the submarine to a pier
for a closer examination because it was mostly submerged and
officials said it had struck bottom in a harbor shallow.
	   The submarine, moored well out in the harbor and surrounded by
four warships, could barely be seen from the coast. Reporters were
allowed inside the naval base, but kept away from the shore.
	   The news agency Yonhap quoted Maj. Gen. Lim Jong-chun,
operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying the
ship was listing about 60 degrees.
	   ``It probably means that the inside is filled with water and
that the crew perhaps drowned or suffocated due to lack of
oxygen,'' Lim was quoted as saying.
	   ``However,'' he told Yonhap, ``it cannot be excluded that the
crew may have escaped before the navy was called to the scene'' on
Monday.
	   Officials said North Korea was questioned about the intrusion at
a meeting Tuesday between generals of the communist nation and the
United Nations Command, their first in seven years.
	   U.N. officials declined comment following the meeting.
	   ``The fact that the North Korean submarine infiltrated across
our coastal sea areas is a clear armed provocation and a violation
of the armistice agreement,'' said the Joint Chiefs' Lim.
	   ``Our side will take proper action later,'' Lim said.
	   Although Lim didn't elaborate, the sub's incursion was sure to
further cloud relations between North and South Korea just as the
new government of President Kim Dae-jung was beginning to reach out
to its reclusive northern rival.
	   North Korea's official news agency reported Tuesday that one of
the country's submarines ``seems to be wrecked in ocean currents
and waves'' off the coast of Kosong, a northern port.
	   The Korean Central News Agency said the submarine reported to
its base at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) Sunday ``that it had troubles in a
nautical observation instrument, oil pressure system and submerging
and surfacing machines.
	   ``Now the life or death of the crew is unknown,'' KCNA said.
	   The meeting between three U.N. generals and a trio of North
Korean generals at the border village of Panmunjom was designed
only as a get-acquainted session after the long moratorium on such
talks.
	   But a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs said the submarine's
intrusion into South Korean waters was taken up by the U.N.
officers, headed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Michael Hayden.
	   North Korea broke off armistice talks at Panmunjom in 1992,
angered that a South Korean general had been named to lead the U.N.
team. The North sees South Korea as a U.S. puppet and refuses to
talk to it.
	   The sub was captured Monday after it became entangled in a
fishing net off the east coast. It was first towed to the small
port of Yang-Yang, just south of the North Korean border, but
officials later decided to bring it to the better equipped naval
base at Donghae, 60 kilometers (40) miles down the coast.
	   ``We need to take extra precautions (with the sub) because (the
crew) might blow it up,'' said a Defense Ministry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He added, however, that it was
unclear whether anyone was aboard the vessel.
	   At one point during the night of towing, South Korean sailors
pounded on the surface of the sub with a hammer, but there was no
response from within.
	   The submarine was seized not far from where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground in 1996 _ an incident that ended with
37 people dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst
in years.
	   Military officials said as many as six North Koreans might be
aboard the vessel seized Monday. It was described as a ``midget
submersible'' used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct
coastal surveillance.
	   North Korean agents are said to be told to commit suicide to
avoid capture. In the 1996 submarine incursion, 11 North Koreans
were reportedly shot to death by one of their commanders, who then
killed himself.
	   South Korean officials said the periscope and propeller of the
submarine seized Monday got caught in the fishing net about 18
kilometers (10 miles) east of the town of Sokcho, just south of the
North Korean border and 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of
Seoul.
	   Sokcho is about five miles (8 kilometers) from where the North
Korean submarine ran aground in 1996, touching off a 53-day manhunt
for its 26 occupants. The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and
police ended with 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans
dead. One North Korean was captured and another was believed to
have escaped.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

China wants President Clinton to make statement on Taiwan background 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with People's Daily commentary, adds
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China wants U.S. President Bill Clinton to
reaffirm publicly that the United States will abide by commitments
not to sell Taiwan advanced weapons, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said Tuesday.
	   ``The president should, at an appropriate occasion, make a
public statement reiterating what the U.S. has already promised on
the Taiwan question,'' Tang said at a pre-summit news conference.
``The U.S. side should also indicate it will take concrete actions
to match the commitment it has made with deeds.''
	   China also would like to see the United States lift sanctions
imposed by Washington after the 1989 military suppression of
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, in which hundreds, if
not thousands, of civilians died.
	   Tang contended that attempts by the United States and other
Western countries to penalize China for its violent handling of the
protests and its suppression of dissent had not influenced China's
policies.
	   ``Sanctions are not a good thing. They merely are a reflection
of power politics,'' Tang said.
	   Beijing blames the sanctions _ frozen U.S.-backed loans for
American companies; banned sales of weapons; and restricted exports
of civilian technology such as supercomputers that have military
uses _ for contributing to a trade deficit with China that grew to
dlrs 49.7 billion by Washington's count last year.
	   ``If only the United States could lift its sanctions against
China and greatly ease its restrictions on the export of high and
new technology, its trade deficit would naturally decline,'' the
Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said in a front-page
commentary Tuesday.
	   The criticism Clinton faces from members of Congress and human
rights groups for being the first U.S. president to travel to China
since the 1989 crackdown makes an immediate easing of the sanctions
unlikely.
	   Given the scant progress on other issues, a public pledge by
Clinton on Taiwan appears to be the only concrete measure China
expects from the summit with President Jiang Zemin on Saturday in
Beijing.
	   Only a few minor agreements are expected on educational and
military affairs, and prospects for a breakthrough on trade appear
bleak.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky called a new
Chinese market-opening proposal for getting into the World Trade
Organization insufficient at the end of talks last week in Beijing.
Chinese Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said he and Barshefsky will
try again for an agreement later this week before Clinton arrives
Friday.
	   Pressed for examples, apart from a statement on Taiwan, that
could help make Clinton's eight-day China visit a success, Tang
said only that he expected talks between the two leaders to be
``wide-ranging and quite rich.''
	   Beijing has been lobbying aggressively for a new agreement to
bolster three previous joint communiques on Taiwan _ including a
1982 agreement to gradually reduce U.S. arms sales to Taipei.
	   ``The United States should not sell advanced weapons or
equipment to Taiwan and it should gradually reduce and eventually
phase out arms sales to Taiwan,'' Tang said.
	   Top U.S. officials have reassured Taiwan, a staunch U.S. ally
during the Cold War, that no such statements are planned.
	   To wrest concessions on Taiwan, which Beijing considers a rebel
province to be retaken by force if necessary, Jiang could slow
progress on military relations and discussions on human rights.
	   Tang declined to comment on whether a U.S. refusal to offer a
stronger commitment on Taiwan could sour the atmosphere of a summit
the Chinese have said they want to be an ``all-around success.''
	   ``Since the president hasn't arrived yet and the meetings
haven't occurred it would be premature to comment at present,'' he
said.

Biggest Puerto Rican union, electricity, joins strike 
</HEADLINE>
By SANDRA IVELISSE VILLERRAEL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's union of electricity
workers, the biggest on the island, on Tuesday joined striking
telephone workers amid escalating violence in a protest against
privatization.
	   The 6,500-strong Union of Electrical Industry Workers announced
their plans for three-day strike hours after a trade union of the
U.S. Caribbean commonwealth called for a general strike against the
government's privatization policy and sale of controlling shares in
the telephone company.
	   On Monday, picket-line clashes left 10 people injured, including
four police officers, after some militant university students and
electricity and water company employees joined striking telephone
workers.
	   An angry police Chief Pedro Toledo mobilized riot police.
	   Fearing they would lose their jobs, some 6,400 unionized
employees began striking Thursday to stop the government from
selling control of Telefonica.
	   ``Organized sabotage'' of telephone lines cut service to 75,000
of 1.3 million customers, said Carmen Ana Culpeper, president of
the telephone company commonly called Telefonica.
	   Telephone unions denied sabotage and blamed lack of maintenance
because their members were striking. However, some fiber optic
cables and other telephone lines have been cut in recent days.
	   Also out of service were 210 of the island's 750 automated bank
machines, as well as some cellular telephones in this U.S.
commonwealth of 3.8 million people.
	   Jose Valentin, president of the state electricity workers'
union, refused to say what effect their strike would have when he
announced Monday night that members would stop work Tuesday through
Thursday.
	   Delegates from two unions representing the state water utility
also voted Monday to join the strike and said they were just
waiting for a go-ahead from their trade union.
	   The Telefonica sale is the centerpiece of Gov. Pedro Rossello's
policy to privatize largely inefficient state companies on the
island, saying they cannot compete in a newly opened and
competitive global market. Despite labor protests, Rossello's
government has sold hotels and a shipping company and courted
private investment in the power industry.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate already has approved the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale of Telefonica to U.S. communications giant GTE Corp., which
has promised no layoffs for a year. The local House of
Representatives was expected to vote for the sale Wednesday.
	   In a surprise announcement Monday, the president of the house,
Edison Misla Aldarondo, appealed to the Spanish company Telefonica
Internacional S.A. to make public its offer to buy Telefonica.
	   The Spaniards, who already own the island's long-distance
company, announced Monday that they would make a better offer
shortly.

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About a dozen men waited in a run-down
restaurant at the edge of town, reloading their assault rifles and
joking nervously as mortar shells exploded outside and bullets
ricocheted down the empty street.
	   One was a young track star, another his former coach; their
commander was a writer and former political prisoner.
	   ``When it's a question of existence, you have to do it,'' said
Lume Hagjiu, a 40-year-old author of eight books of poetry,
sweating in his heavy camouflage uniform and gripping a worn
Kalashnikov assault rifle. ``But I hate the war.''
	   For weeks, Serbs trying to wipe out the Kosovo Liberation Army
have targeted villages along Kosovo's border with Albania, aiming
to seal off the secessionist province and prevent an influx of new
arms and fighters.
	   One of the biggest villages still controlled by the KLA along
the border, Junik is fighting back with everything it's got,
determined to keep its border open.
	   None of the men in Junik, about five miles (eight kilometers)
from the border, relished the fighting Monday, which began at
midafternoon and lasted about 90 minutes.
	   But they were used to it. Serb forces positioned on the
surrounding high ground have opened fire almost every day since the
first attack on May 29, killing five villagers and wounding at
least 10, they said.
	   The buildings show some of the battle scars: The roof of one
house was destroyed; another house had a hole blown in the side.
	   ``The first day was very difficult _ all the families and
children were here,'' said Gani Shehu, another KLA commander. Serb
forces hit them with guns, grenades and mortars _ ``everything they
had.''
	   But the town of 12,000 knew what was coming and got ready, with
help from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``We learned a lesson from Drenica,'' Shehu says, referring to
the site of the first Serb crackdown in March, where about 80
ethnic Albanian villagers were killed. ``We picked up guns and
decided to do something.''
	   Most of the town's women, children and elderly have fled, some
to Albania, some to safer villages. A third group of about 1,000
are trapped in the hills, the commanders say, surrounded by Serbs
and unable to cross the border, which was sealed last week by the
Yugoslav army.
	   On June 15, Serb forces shot at those refugees from helicopters.
It's not clear what casualties they suffered, Shehu says.
	   About 4,000 people remain in the village, mostly men of fighting
age, all with guns. All say they're willing to lay down their lives
to defend their homes and win Kosovo's freedom from Serbia.
	   Junik hasn't had electricity for two months, and food is running
out. The men have started slaughtering farm animals left behind.
``Better we eat them than let the Serbs shoot them,'' Hagjiu says.
	   The men don't dare venture out of Junik openly _ the first Serb
police checkpoint is just a half-mile (800 meters) down the road.
But neither do the Serbs move in _ the road is blocked by twisted,
rusting iron and guarded by KLA fighters.
	   Most of the men in Junik don't have uniforms; they wear old
jeans or work clothes. All carry guns, however, and they quickly
took up positions behind the front line when the first burst of
machine-gun fire rang out. A house, a barn, even a haystack _
wherever they could find cover.
	   When their clips ran out, and the mortar shells and grenades
started falling, they retreated into the thick-walled restaurant,
now a community kitchen.
	   KLA fighters farther up the hills continued to return fire.
	   Junik has held out for 24 days, Hagjiu says. He has no idea how
much longer the fighting will last, but doesn't hold out much hope
for a negotiated peace.
	   Despite Western pressure, the Serbs refuse to pull back until
the separatist attacks stop. Out on the main highway Monday,
convoys of Yugoslav army tanks and heavy guns were moving toward
the area.
	   Truckloads of Serb police, singing and waving Yugoslav flags,
roared through neighboring Decani, where buildings were burned and
windows smashed.
	   A few miles (kilometers) in the other direction, the hamlet of
Prilep was empty except for police and the stench of rotting farm
animal carcasses.
	   The men of Junik say they won't let that happen to their town.
And they won't stop shooting until the Serb forces stop shooting at
them.
	   Hagjiu was jailed under the communists from 1979-83 for his
poems about love and freedom for Kosovo. He made it to Sweden in
1985 and worked there as a translator until February, when he came
back to fight with his people.
	   Shpejtim Maloku, the 18-year-old long-distance runner, proudly
shows off his T-shirt commemorating a Kosovo-wide track meet last
year in which he won the 5,000 meters in under 15 minutes.
	   With a bashful grin, he says he dreams of being a professional
athlete. ``But first of all my dream is for Kosovo to be free.''

Indonesian protesters stage demonstration against United States 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Several dozen protesters demonstrated
peacefully outside the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday, accusing the United
States of trying to delay the resumption of aid to economically
battered Indonesia.
	   The protesters said the United States was interfering in
Indonesia's internal affairs and held up banners, including one
that read ``U.S. is a great liar.''
	   The United States is a key player in the International Monetary
Fund. The Washington-based lending agency suspended a dlrs 43
billion bailout plan for Indonesia last month because of political
turmoil that led to the ouster of President Suharto.
	   However, IMF officials have said they will resume loan
disbursements in early July.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers visited Jakarta
on Monday and said he supported Indonesia's efforts to revive its
shattered economy.

Mexican police arrest suspect in priest slaying 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ Police have arrested a suspect in the
murder of a rural priest, the government's Notimex news agency
reported.
	   Oaxaca state Deputy Attorney General Yairshino Garcia said at a
news conference that Miguel Ferraez Cortes, arrested on Saturday in
Salina Cruz, had admitted being present when Mauro Andres Ortiz
Carreno was shot to death.
	   Ortiz Carreno was the parish priest of San Juan Ozolotepec, an
impoverished village about 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of
Oaxaca city. He was found dead in the trunk of a car May 6 in this
state capital.
	   According to Garcia, Ferraez said another man, Zenon Esteban
Zafra Lopez, killed the priest in a dispute over a debt he owed
Ortiz Carreno. Zafra Lopez remains at large.
	   At the time, church officials suggested the priest might have
been killed because he tried to organize sales of wood in a region
where timber is a coveted resource and illegal logging is common.

Motorola to lay off employees in Singapore 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. electronics giant Motorola says it will
lay off 380 employees from its Singapore operations as the regional
economic downturn begins to bite.
	   ``The restructuring in Singapore is necessary for the company to
respond to the economic decline in Asia that caused the reduction
in demand for its communication products,'' said a statement from
the Singapore arm of Motorola, obtained Tuesday by DowJones
Newswires.
	   Motorola, which now employs 4,200 people in Singapore, has never
retrenched staff in its 24 years here.
	   The move is part of a worldwide reorganization. Motorola plans a
10 percent reduction of its global work force _ or 15,000 employees
_ over the next year to stem the steady erosion of its profits and
market share.
	   Prior to the layoffs, Motorola had resorted to reducing the
number of work days at some of its factories here. For example, the
company has been encouraging workers to use their annual leave
early, and is shutting down one of its plants five days this month.
	   The company said it has also brought new products on line at its
pager manufacturing facility to minimize the effect of a
considerable downturn in demand.
	   ``Together with these plans to introduce new products,
Motorola's voluntary severance plan will allow the company to renew
itself, better able to face new challenges and seize new
opportunities in the global telecommunications and advanced
electronics industries,'' the statement added.
	   Motorola's announcement came only four days after U.S.
electronics giant Texas Instruments said it too will lay off
employees. The company will retrench 600 workers at its subsidiary
Silicon Systems Singapore before moving that operation to Taiwan.

Palestinians complain to Security Council about house demolitions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The PLO has complained to the U.N. Security
Council about the demolition of Palestinian homes by Israel, a
Palestinian lawmaker said Tuesday, a day after an Arab house was
razed on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
	   Israel routinely demolishes Palestinian homes built without
license in Jerusalem and West Bank areas still under Israeli
control. The Palestinians say Israel rarely grants construction
licenses to Palestinians, and that those with expanding families
are forced to build without obtaining permission.
	   The United States has urged Israel to refrain from demolishing
homes, but the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
ignored the appeal.
	   On Monday, Israeli bulldozers razed the home of 37-year-old
Mustafa Dadean on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, leaving
eight people homeless. A group of about 30 friends and relatives
arrived at the scene, sitting on sofas and cupboards amid debris
and rubble.
	   ``I will start to rebuild the house again because this is the
way we have of confronting the Israeli authorities,'' Dadean said.
	   Palestinian legislator Salah Taameri said the PLO has asked the
U.N. Security Council to discuss the house demolitions as part of a
debate on Israel's plan to expand Jerusalem. Under that plan,
Israel would extend Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
	   ``Netanyahu is pushing the area towards an explosion. We have
done everything possible to stop these house demolitions. We have
objected both in the international community and in the streets,''
Taamari said. ``All we can do is to protest once more to the
international community.''

Election watchdog says Cambodian elections unlikely to be free, fair 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Citing ``serious and widespread''
violations of the voter registration process, an election watchdog
group warned Tuesday that Cambodia's upcoming polls are unlikely to
be free and fair.
	   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia _ COMFREL
_ said that while it was encouraged by a high voter turnout, ``many
concerns remain, including ones that could bring into question the
credibility of a free and fair election on July 26.''
	   COMFREL is an independent group, linked to several local human
rights organizations.
	   Village leaders, commune chiefs and government officials _ loyal
to Cambodian strongman Hun Sen's ruling party _ were at almost all
registration stations, ``directly interfering with the registration
process,'' the group said in a statement.
	   Uniformed police and army officials _ also loyal to Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party _ were seen loitering within 200 meters
(yards) of the stations, COMFREL wrote.
	   Registration officials often demonstrated a lack of training,
procedures were in many cases unorganized or chaotic, and many
prospective voters were denied an opportunity to register their
names, it said.
	   Cambodia's elections are scheduled just one year after Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, who won Cambodia's multibillion-dollar
U.N.-sponsored election in 1993, was ousted by his co-premier, Hun
Sen, in a bloody coup.
	   As many as 90 of the prince's supporters were killed in the
aftermath of the coup, apparently by Hun Sen's forces, according to
the U.N. Center for Human Rights.
	   The government has failed to seriously investigate any of those
killings, adding to a climate of fear nationwide.
	   In a bid to win back legitimacy and aid lost after his violent
takeover, Hun Sen agreed to go ahead with new elections this year.
	   But critics say the electoral process has been skewed in his
favor and that Hun Sen's party has engaged in intimidation, threats
and killings of members of the opposition in the provinces.
	   The European Union, which will help to assess whether or not
Cambodia's upcoming polls are free and fair and is contributing
more than dlrs 11 million to help stage the elections, has
nevertheless said it believes minimum conditions for credible polls
are in place.
	   COMFREL lauded the high turnout of people who registered to
vote, saying that it indicated a willingness by the Cambodian
people to cast ballots.
	   More than 90 percent of all eligible voters registered,
according to the EU and the national election committee, and the
process appeared to be relatively violence-free.
	   COMFREL observers noted, however, that they were themselves
often threatened or intimidated.

Japan joins protest over Belarus diplomatic compound 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Japan joined a protest by six other
nations Tuesday, recalling its envoy to object to Belarus' attempts
to evict ambassadors from a diplomatic compound.
	   The ambassadors of six countries _ the United States, Britain,
Germany, France, Greece, and Italy _ left Belarus on Monday to
consult with their governments over the dispute.
	   A spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said Tokyo was taking the action in line
with the other countries.
	   Belarus' government has been trying for weeks to evict the
ambassadors from their homes on the wooded outskirts of Minsk that,
officials say, urgently need sewer and plumbing repairs.
	   But the countries maintain that violates international law,
which designates ambassadors' home as the territory of their home
countries. The host country must ask permission to enter and cannot
demand that residents leave.
	   Belarus took offense. The Foreign Ministry called the
ambassadors' departures ``unjustified'' and Belarus' president,
Alexander Lukashenko, complained that the dispute has been blown
out of proportion.
	   ``I am surprised that such a common problem of daily life is
being brought to such a high political level,'' he told reporters.
	   Led by the authoritarian Lukashenko, Belarus is perhaps the most
Soviet of all post-Soviet countries, with a penchant for stirring
trouble with the West.
	   But nothing Lukashenko has done before has created quite such a
stir in diplomatic circles as his decision to order the ambassadors
out of their homes.
	   ``He's driving his country further into isolation and is hurting
human rights and contract law,'' German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said in a television interview Monday.
	   In addition to the recalls, Germany has asked the Belarusian
ambassador to go home, and the United States told Belarus not to
send its ambassador back to Washington.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the United States
may take other ``proportionate responses,'' but said the embassy in
Minsk would remain open.
	   It is not clear how many of the 22 ambassadors who live at the
disputed Drozdy diplomatic compound remain. A number of other
nations, including Poland and Bulgaria, are also expected to leave.
	   On Friday, the Belarusian government cut water and power
supplies and had ditches dug inside the compound's gates, which
prevented cars from entering.

Trying to reassure investors, government rallies behind major bank 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing stock price, fresh quotes
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials rallied behind one of the
nation's largest lenders Tuesday, hoping to calm investors in what
is fast becoming a major test of how effectively Japan can handle a
bad-debt crisis looming over its banking system.
	   Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd., which is saddled with more
than 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans, rebounded
Tuesday after Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga and other top
financial officials expressed confidence in the bank's ability to
stay afloat.
	   Matsunaga stressed that LTCB's individual depositors and
institutional investors are fully protected. But he added, ``We
welcome any plan that the bank takes to strengthen its
operations.''
	   Analysts said the government will likely do whatever is
necessary to prevent its collapse, including arranging a merger or
providing short-term loans. LTCB is so big that its failure could
shatter the already fragile faith Japanese depositors have in their
banks.
	   ``The Ministry of Finance's first priority is to ensure the
smooth functioning of the financial system _ that's what is coming
into question right now,'' said James Fiorillo, senior analyst with
ING Barings Securities. Ltd.
	   LTCB is a major player _ it was listed as the world's 22nd
largest bank by Forbes magazine.
	   But worries about its ability to survive have swelled as Japan,
slogging through its worst recession in decades, has come under
pressure to move more aggressively to fix its troubled financial
system.
	   Ruling-party politicians are discussing the establishment of a
government-run ``bridge bank'' to support the overall financial
system by taking over banks' bad loans.
	   The party has pledged to announce the details of its plan in two
weeks, but Finance Ministry officials appear hesitant.
	   ``There are still many details to be worked out, such as how to
prevent losses from new loans and where to get the funds for the
bank,'' Administrative Vice Finance Minister Koji Tanami said on
Monday.
	   Investors fear greater determination by the government to clean
up the bad-loan mess may mean it will let more weak banks fail _
and the Long-Term Credit Bank has become a focus of their concern.
	   Bank officials have vehemently denied rumors that the bank is on
the verge of collapse, but concerns over its stability ballooned
after Moody's Investors Services lowered its credit rating on
Thursday to B1 from Ba1.
	   A low rating is especially damaging to a credit bank like LTCB
because it raises money by selling bonds instead of by taking
deposits. Bond investors tend to pay more attention to credit
ratings than ordinary depositors.
	   The bank's decline accelerated Monday after two major banks
denied that they were considering merging with it. LTCB shares
plunged 45 percent, to 62 yen (45 U.S. cents), before trading was
halted by exchange rules that limit declines.
	   The stock recovered slightly Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen.
	   The LTCB, which has 3,600 employees and 28 trillion (dlrs 203
billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks established at the
end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in an
effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   But deregulation has made it easier for companies to raise money
directly by issuing stocks or selling bonds, and the banks' role
has been largely lost.
	   And though LTCB's bad loans are just a fraction of the stunning
76 trillion yen (dlrs 550 billion) in bad debt held by all Japanese
banks, it is being seen as a test of how the government will handle
the banking crisis.
	   So far, officials have voiced strong support.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka said the Bank of Japan
would provide ``full support'' if Long-Term Credit Bank had
difficulty raising operating funds.
	   Another ruling-party official suggested merging the bank with
the government-affiliated Japan Development Bank.
	   Financial authorities customarily have orchestrated buyouts of
troubled banks by stronger institutions as a way of avoiding the
lost jobs and financial turmoil the failure of a major bank might
cause.
	   But it's not clear whether that custom _ never explicitly
acknowledged as government policy _ still holds. Last week, the
Finance Ministry said any possible mergers were for banks to decide
on their own.
	   Investors are well aware of what can happen when the government
keeps its distance.
	   In November, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd., the largest Japanese
bank to fail, went under with 5,400 employees and 8.5 trillion yen
(dlrs 62 billion) in assets.

Bulgaria deputy premier sees CEFTA membership in 1999 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Bulgaria will become a full member of
the Central European Free Trade Area next year, increasing the
country's ability to trade with its traditional markets, Deputy
Prime Minister Alexander Bozhkov said Tuesday.
	   Membership in CEFTA leads to a reduction in customs duties for
industrial and agricultural products in trade among members, with
full liberalization of trade planned for 2001. Current members are
the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and
Slovenia.
	   ``It would enable Bulgaria to rejoin its traditional markets,''
said Bozhkov, who is attending an economic summit of top officials
from Central and Eastern Europe. ``It is a preparatory step to
joining the European Union.''
	   Bulgaria has applied to join the EU, but is not among the five
Eastern European countries that have already begun negotiations.
	   Trade among central and eastern European countries has declined
since the fall of communism in the region.
	   Bozhkov said Bulgaria sells only 3.2 percent of its exports to
CEFTA countries, and buys 5.2 percent of its imports from members
of the agreement. By contrast, some 40 percent of Bulgaria's trade
is with the E.U..

Italian mobsters escape using underground tunnel at own trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ Authorities were searching Tuesday for two
mobsters who escaped through an underground tunnel during their own
trial, dealing a further blow to Italy's already disgraced justice
system.
	   Dozens of security guards as well as several lawyers,
prosecutors and judges were present when the two snuck away from
the gym that served as a court in this southern Italian city.
	   Accomplices of Giuseppe Autorino and Ferdinando Cesarano
allegedly built the tunnel, which emerged in a field outside the
gym. Police found guns and grenades in the tunnel, apparently meant
to be used by the two if they had been followed.
	   But no one noticed they had slipped away until it was too late.
	   Policemen said they saw Autorino and Cesarano emerge from the
field and flee on a car parked nearby.
	   Already serving life sentences for mob-related crimes, the two
were among dozens of defendants at the trial against one of the
most powerful Camorra clans in the region.
	   The Camorra crime syndicate operates in the Naples area and is
the equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia.
	   Justice Minister Giorgio Napolitano called the incident
``extremely serious,'' and promised to punish those responsible.
	   Last month, the country's justice system was deeply embarrassed
by the disappearance of two high-profile criminals.
	   Sicilian Mafia boss Pasquale Cuntrera, who is 63 and confined to
a wheelchair, fled Italy just days before an appeals court upheld
his conviction and 21-year sentence for running an international
drug ring.
	   Licio Gelli, a 79-year-old financier convicted in the fraudulent
bankruptcy in 1982 of what was then Italy's biggest private bank,
disappeared days before officers came to arrest him.
	   Cuntrera was recaptured in Spain several days after his escape
while Gelli is still at large.

Romanian official sees limited prospects for economic growth 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Romania's economy could contract this
year and will grow by no more than 2 percent next year, Romanian
Finance Minister Daniel Daianu said Tuesday.
	   ``Next year we don't expect growth substantially above 1.5
percent or 2 percent,'' Daianu said in a speech at the World
Economic Forum's annual meeting on eastern Europe in Salzburg.
	   The government had forecast that growth would be flat in 1998,
but Daianu said gross domestic product could fall by as much as 2
percent.
	   ``We would be satisfied if at the end of the year it was not
below minus 2 percent,'' he said.
	   Romania's economic reform program stalled in 1997, with GDP
declining by 6 percent. Government efforts to stabilize the economy
were further disrupted in 1998 by political crises that led to the
ousting of then-Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea in March.

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea towed a captured North
Korean submarine into this major naval base Tuesday, unsure if its
crew was still aboard but angered by ``a clear armed provocation.''
	   Sonar scans of the submarine's hull showed no signs of life
inside, indicating that the crew was either dead or had escaped
before the boat was taken in tow, the national news agency
reported.
	   But the navy was having trouble towing the submarine to a pier
for a closer examination because it was mostly submerged and
officials said it had struck bottom in a harbor shallow.
	   The submarine, moored well out in the harbor and surrounded by
four warships, could barely be seen from the coast. Reporters were
allowed inside the naval base, but kept away from the shore.
	   The news agency Yonhap quoted Maj. Gen. Lim Jong-chun,
operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying the
ship was listing about 60 degrees.
	   ``It probably means that the inside is filled with water and
that the crew perhaps drowned or suffocated due to lack of
oxygen,'' Lim was quoted as saying.
	   ``However,'' he told Yonhap, ``it cannot be excluded that the
crew may have escaped before the navy was called to the scene''
Monday.
	   Officials said North Korea was questioned about the intrusion at
a meeting Tuesday between generals of the communist nation and the
United Nations Command, their first in seven years.
	   U.N. officials declined comment following the meeting.
	   ``The fact that the North Korean submarine infiltrated across
our coastal sea areas is a clear armed provocation and a violation
of the armistice agreement,'' said the Joint Chiefs' Lim.
	   ``Our side will take proper action later,'' Lim said without
elaboration.
	   Despite Lim's tough talk, an aide to President Kim Dae-jung said
the sub's incursion would not sidetrack the new government's
efforts to reach out to its reclusive northern rival.
	   ``The submarine incident will not shake our sunshine policy,''
the aide told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
government will try even harder to embrace the North to prevent the
repetition of similar incidents. ... We will deal with the North
with patience.''
	   North Korea's official news agency reported Tuesday that one of
the country's submarines ``seems to be wrecked in ocean currents
and waves'' off the coast of Kosong, a northern port.
	   The Korean Central News Agency said the submarine reported to
its base at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) Sunday ``that it had troubles in a
nautical observation instrument, oil pressure system and submerging
and surfacing machines.
	   ``Now the life or death of the crew is unknown,'' KCNA said.
	   The meeting between three U.N. generals and a trio of North
Korean generals at the border village of Panmunjom was designed
only as a get-acquainted session after the long moratorium on such
talks.
	   But a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs said the submarine's
intrusion into South Korean waters was taken up by the U.N.
officers, headed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Michael Hayden.
	   North Korea broke off armistice talks at Panmunjom in 1992,
angered that a South Korean general had been named to lead the U.N.
team. The North sees South Korea as a U.S. puppet and refuses to
talk to it.
	   The sub was captured Monday after it became entangled in a
fishing net off the east coast. It was first towed to the small
port of Yang-Yang, just south of the North Korean border, but
officials later decided to bring it to the better equipped naval
base at Donghae, 60 kilometers (40) miles down the coast.
	   ``We need to take extra precautions (with the sub) because (the
crew) might blow it up,'' said a Defense Ministry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He added, however, that it was
unclear whether anyone was aboard the vessel.
	   At one point during the night of towing, South Korean sailors
pounded on the surface of the sub with a hammer, but there was no
response from within.
	   The submarine was seized not far from where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground in 1996 _ an incident that ended with
37 people dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst
in years.
	   Military officials said as many as six North Koreans might be
aboard the vessel seized Monday. It was described as a ``midget
submersible'' used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct
coastal surveillance.
	   North Korean agents are said to be told to commit suicide to
avoid capture. In the 1996 submarine incursion, 11 North Koreans
were reportedly shot to death by one of their commanders, who then
killed himself.
	   South Korean officials said the periscope and propeller of the
submarine seized Monday got caught in the fishing net about 18
kilometers (10 miles) east of the town of Sokcho, just south of the
North Korean border and 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of
Seoul.
	   Sokcho is about five miles (8 kilometers) from where the North
Korean submarine ran aground in 1996, touching off a 53-day manhunt
for its 26 occupants. The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and
police ended with 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans
dead. One North Korean was captured and another was believed to
have escaped.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Japan's juvenile delinquents increase, grow more violent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's growing ranks of juvenile delinquents are
more violent and more likely to use knives and start committing
crimes at younger ages than a couple of years ago, a government
report said Tuesday.
	   The Justice Ministry study said the number of juvenile offenders
has been on the rise in recent years, from 270,000 under-20
criminals in 1995 to about 300,000 last year.
	   Japan's youngest criminals are also getting more dangerous.
Weapons were used in 83 percent of murders or murder attempts by
juveniles, with knives and other sharp objects accounting for 30
percent of the weapons used, the report said.
	   A series of high-profile crimes by teens has focused attention
on juvenile criminals in Japan. Last year, for example, a
14-year-old boy decapitated a younger boy and left the severed head
at a school gate.
	   According to a survey of probation officers cited in the Justice
Ministry study, many said the juveniles are committing more violent
crimes and increasingly younger teens are breaking laws.
	   Still, Japan's juvenile delinquent problem is much smaller than
in the early 1980s. The number of young offenders has dropped
dramatically since it hit 600,000 in 1983.
	   The report will be used for discussions on toughening Japan's
juvenile crime laws, which have come under increasing criticism as
being too lenient. Children under 16 are now protected from
prosecution.

Reports: Ransom paid for Swiss engineer's release 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss engineer held for 7 1/2
months after being kidnapped near Chechnya was released after a
large ransom was paid, reports Tuesday said.
	   Peter Zollinger, 36, arrived in Zurich Sunday. The clan chief of
the kidnappers had Zollinger taken Saturday to the airport of
Nazran in the Ingushetia region that borders Chechnya, said the
family lawyer. There he was handed over to a contact person for the
family.
	   Neither the lawyer nor Swiss officials would comment on how the
release occurred.
	   Zollinger, employed by the Seibert-Stinnes AG construction
company, was kidnapped by an armed commando from a building site at
the airport last November.
	   Speaking on Swiss television Monday night, building site manager
Robert Heel claimed that Zollinger's family paid a ransom of
between dlrs 200,000 and 500,000, leading to his quick release.
	   Zollinger declined to confirm the figure. Speaking on the same
program, he said his kidnappers had kept him handcuffed and chained
to a heating pipe.
	   He said he had been fed three times a day, mostly with tea and
bread or potatoes.
	   Citing ``Chechen sources,'' the Moscow daily Izvestiya reported
Tuesday that dlrs 1 million was paid in ransom for Zollinger.
	   Zurich's Tages-Anzeiger daily reported that the kidnappers'
ransom demand had fluctuated between dlrs 300,000 and 700,000.

Malaysia's premier promises full disclosure on contracts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister has
promised to release more names of people awarded government
contracts to allay public suspicions of nepotism and cronyism in
the government.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Monday his administration
would continue to disclose the companies that have been awarded
lucrative projects, as well as the names of individuals who
received shares allotted by the government.
	   ``If this is what the public wants, we will do so,'' Mahathir
told reporters.
	   On Saturday, Mahathir turned the tables on his critics in his
United Malays National Organization party by releasing lists of
hundreds of Malays awarded government contracts.
	   His move was aimed at muffling growing accusations at the
party's annual convention that powerful politicians had misused an
affirmative action program for the dominant Malays by giving
government contracts and awarding share quotas to their cronies.
	   The documents also identified people who receive preferential
shares and stakes in private companies and special licenses for
public transport companies.
	   Included in the lists were the names of Mahathir's sons and
relatives of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as well as that
of Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the outspoken leader of the UMNO Youth wing,
who was seen to be spearheading a campaign against Mahathir. He had
claimed that nepotism and cronyism determined contract allotments.
	   On Sunday, Zahid was forced to tersely deny that he himself
profited from any sweetened government deals.
	   Mahathir had earlier denied charges made by Zahid, saying that
all indigenous Malays had benefited from Malaysia's National
Economic Policy, started in 1971.
	   The affirmative action program was designed to give Malays _
``Bumiputera,'' or ``sons of the soil'' _ a bigger role in
business, once dominated by ethnic Chinese.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis and this week's urgent
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund prompted an
extraordinary meeting on Tuesday between the president, premier,
the entire Cabinet and top legislative officials.
	   The meeting comes three months to the day since President Boris
Yeltsin jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,
saying it had failed to improve Russia's economy and living
conditions.
	   Since then, the Russian economy has only been battered further
by a slide in world oil prices, the financial crisis in Asia, and
scattered workers' protests, including the blockage of major rail
arteries last month.
	   ``Russia stands on the brink of bankruptcy,'' wrote the Novye
Izvestiya daily. ``Not only can it not pay teachers and miners,
energy workers and soldiers, but it also can't pay foreign
financial institutions and its own banks.''
	   At Tuesday's crisis meeting, Premier Sergei Kiriyenko was to set
out _ for at least the fourth time _ his plan for how to battle the
country's financial crunch. Broadly speaking, the program comprises
deep spending cuts and sharply increased tax collection.
	   It also includes government support for Russian exports, debt
rescheduling for industry, and shifting most of the tax burden from
the production sphere to consumption, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Other measures include centralizing tax collection, reducing the
number of customs posts and creating a state company to oversee the
production of _ and revenues from _ liquor, the Izvestiya daily
reported.
	   An IMF team arrived in Moscow on Monday night to negotiate terms
for the release of the latest, dlrs 670 million installment of an
existing loan to Russia, and conditions for the dlrs 10 billion to
dlrs 15 billion bailout Russia is seeking.
	   Both the fund and Russian officials have adopted hard stances.
The IMF last week said it was delaying the loan installment to
Russia because the government needs to take further steps to comply
with conditions for receiving the money.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky reiterated Monday
that some of the IMF's conditions are simply unacceptable to
Russia.
	   The fund's demand that the government undertake land reform,
allowing for private ownership and unfettered sales of arable land,
has met vocal opposition from the hard-line lower chamber of
parliament. It's doubtful the government could overcome that
resistance.
	   A bigger question mark hovers over the fund's demand that Russia
split up its huge energy monopolies. Russia has so far resisted.
	   Top privatization official Alexander Braverman said Tuesday that
the government would sell a 5 percent stake in the natural gas
monopoly RAO Gazprom.
	   The gas monopoly has long pressed for the government to reduce
its 40 percent stake, arguing that it would raise money for the
state budget.
	   The government has been leaning heavily on Gazprom for tax
revenues. Gazprom owes billions of rubles in back taxes, but argues
it can't pay because its clients, mostly state-controlled
companies, haven't paid their bills.

Kenyan tries to avoid deportation after jail for spreading HIV 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A Kenyan musician jailed for
deliberately infecting five women with HIV was ordered deported
Tuesday, after an appeal to let him stay in New Zealand failed.
	   The High Court in Auckland rejected an appeal against
deportation by Peter Mwai, the first person in New Zealand to be
convicted of deliberately having unprotected sex with partners
while knowingly being infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
	   Mwai claimed he did not realize the significance of his HIV
infection. Two of at least five women with whom Mwai had
unprotected sex have developed the HIV infection.
	   The Removal Review Authority ordered that Mwai be deported
immediately upon his release from jail Wednesday after serving four
years of a seven-year sentence, on grounds his remaining in New
Zealand was not in the public interest.
	   Mwai appealed the decision, claiming he should be allowed to
remain on humanitarian grounds.
	   Mwai's lawyer Dawn Patchett told the court he has a 6-year-old
daughter with a New Zealand woman and that he should be allowed to
stay with them for the rest of his life, which had been shortened
by his terminal illness.
	   The High Court rejected the application Tuesday.
	   Mwai's lawyers said they are seeking an application to prevent
him being put on an airplane back to Africa on Wednesday.
	   Immigration Minister Nick Smith Tuesday told Parliament he
wanted Mwai deported as soon as possible.
	   The musician's court actions alone had cost taxpayers more than
U.S. dlrs 250,000 (500,000 New Zealand dollars), not including his
medical bills for treatment of his HIV-AIDS and a secondary
tuberculosis infection, Smith said.

South Korea captures North Korean submarine statement

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ The South Korean navy towed a
captured North Korean submarine into this major naval base Tuesday,
unsure if its crew was still aboard. A top military official called
the intrusion ``a clear armed provocation.''
	   Sonar scans of the submarine's hull showed no signs of life
inside, indicating that the crew was either dead or had escaped
before the boat was taken in tow, the national news agency
reported.
	   But the navy was having trouble towing the submarine to a pier
for a closer examination because it was mostly submerged and
officials said it had struck bottom in a harbor shallow.
	   The submarine, moored well out in the harbor and surrounded by
four warships, could barely be seen from the coast. Reporters were
allowed inside the naval base, but kept away from the shore.
	   The news agency Yonhap quoted Maj. Gen. Lim Jong-chun,
operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying the
ship was listing about 60 degrees.
	   ``It probably means that the inside is filled with water and
that the crew perhaps drowned or suffocated due to lack of
oxygen,'' Lim was quoted as saying.
	   ``However,'' he told Yonhap, ``it cannot be excluded that the
crew may have escaped before the navy was called to the scene''
Monday.
	   Officials said North Korea was questioned about the intrusion at
a meeting Tuesday between generals of the communist nation and the
United Nations Command, their first in seven years.
	   The U.N. Command declined to characterize the North Korean
response, but said in a statement that ``both sides reaffirmed the
importance of continuing dialogue to build confidence, prevent
misunderstanding and reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula.''
	   The U.N. Command said the meeting was a ``good first step in
establishing a crisis management mechanism to help prevent or deal
with any military incidents'' _ a need it said was underscored by
the seizure of the North Korean sub.
	   ``The fact that the North Korean submarine infiltrated across
our coastal sea areas is a clear armed provocation and a violation
of the armistice agreement,'' said the Joint Chiefs' Lim.
	   ``Our side will take proper action later,'' Lim said without
elaboration.
	   Despite Lim's tough talk, an aide to President Kim Dae-jung said
the sub's incursion would not sidetrack the new government's
efforts to reach out to its reclusive northern rival.
	   ``The submarine incident will not shake our sunshine policy,''
the aide told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
government will try even harder to embrace the North to prevent the
repetition of similar incidents. ... We will deal with the North
with patience.''
	   North Korea's official news agency reported Tuesday that one of
the country's submarines ``seems to be wrecked in ocean currents
and waves'' off the coast of Kosong, a northern port.
	   The Korean Central News Agency said the submarine reported to
its base at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) Sunday ``that it had troubles in a
nautical observation instrument, oil pressure system and submerging
and surfacing machines.
	   ``Now the life or death of the crew is unknown,'' KCNA said.
	   The meeting between three U.N. generals and a trio of North
Korean generals at the border village of Panmunjom was designed
only as a get-acquainted session after the long moratorium on such
talks.
	   But a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs said the submarine's
intrusion into South Korean waters was taken up by the U.N.
officers, headed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Michael Hayden.
	   North Korea broke off armistice talks at Panmunjom in 1992,
angered that a South Korean general had been named to lead the U.N.
team. The North sees South Korea as a U.S. puppet and refuses to
talk to it.
	   The sub was captured Monday after it became entangled in a
fishing net off the east coast. It was first towed to the small
port of Yang-Yang, just south of the North Korean border, but
officials later decided to bring it to the better equipped naval
base at Donghae, 60 kilometers (40) miles down the coast.
	   ``We need to take extra precautions (with the sub) because (the
crew) might blow it up,'' said a Defense Ministry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He added, however, that it was
unclear whether anyone was aboard the vessel.
	   At one point during the night of towing, South Korean sailors
pounded on the surface of the sub with a hammer, but there was no
response from within.
	   The submarine was seized not far from where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground in 1996 _ an incident that ended with
37 people dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst
in years.
	   Military officials said as many as six North Koreans might be
aboard the vessel seized Monday. It was described as a ``midget
submersible'' used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct
coastal surveillance.
	   North Korean agents are said to be told to commit suicide to
avoid capture. In the 1996 submarine incursion, 11 North Koreans
were reportedly shot to death by one of their commanders, who then
killed himself.
	   South Korean officials said the periscope and propeller of the
submarine seized Monday got caught in the fishing net about 18
kilometers (10 miles) east of the town of Sokcho, just south of the
North Korean border and 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of
Seoul.
	   Sokcho is about five miles (8 kilometers) from where the North
Korean submarine ran aground in 1996, touching off a 53-day manhunt
for its 26 occupants. The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and
police ended with 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans
dead. One North Korean was captured and another was believed to
have escaped.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Tokyo stocks slip, dollar lower 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with late-afternoon bond and dollar rates
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices fell Tuesday as investors waited
for the government to announce its plan to clean up the nation's
bad loan mess. The U.S. dollar declined against the yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
sank 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent, closing at 15,054.60. On
Monday, the Nikkei had gained 41.11 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The dollar bought 137.75 yen in late afternoon, down 0.79 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
138.16 yen overnight.
	   The government was expected to begin announcing soon details of
its plan to tackle the sagging economy by cleaning up bad debt
problems at banks.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with a plan by July 8 for a ``bridge bank'' to handle
bad loans.
	   ``People are still nervous about the Liberal Democratic Party's
ability to come up with a plan'' to deal with the problem, said Jon
Yang, a salesman in the futures and options group at Jardine
Fleming Securities.
	   Investors have been especially worried about the health of banks
amid a dramatic decline in the shares of Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan. The decline began last week after Moody's Investors Service
lowered the bank's credit rating. LTCB's stock plunged on Monday by
50 yen, the limit allowed under exchange rules.
	   LTCB shares recovered slightly Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen,
after government officials promised support for the troubled bank.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 11.89 points, or 1.00 percent, to 1,175.42. It had
edged up 0.04 points, insignificant in percentage terms, the
previous day.
	   Trading on the main section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 410 million shares, up from 370.24 million Monday.
Declines outnumbered advances 692 to 406, while 166 issues were
unchanged.
	   The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen after traders and
investors took profits following a 3 1/2 yen surge in the U.S.
currency the previous day.
	   The dollar was quoted as high as 138.07 yen and as low as 137.33
yen during Tokyo trading.
	   Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
jointly intervened to halt the yen's slide after the dollar hit an
eight-year high against the Japanese currency.
	   The dollar rose sharply Monday after the Japanese government
failed to offer concrete steps to prop up the yen at a weekend
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
	   Dealers also hesitated to push the dollar higher ahead of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to China later this week.
	   Market participants said there was a good chance the United
States and Japan would again jointly support the yen if it falls
before the end of the visit. China has complained that the falling
yen was putting pressure on its own currency.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.260 percent from Monday's finish of 1.255
percent, driving its price down to 111.53 yen from 111.57 yen.

Italian chamber debates NATO expansion 1000 gmt 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: updates with Prodi addressing chamber; vote expected around
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi called on lawmakers to put
aside partisan differences on Tuesday and ratify NATO's eastward
expansion with a resounding ``yes'' vote.
	   ``We cannot reply with a refusal to this request from from
eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he said, asking the entire Chamber
of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the name of the Italian people.''
	   In the days leading up to the vote, Prodi's center-left
government had trouble rounding up the necessary votes because its
usual ally, the Communists, oppose NATO expansion.
	   It appeared to secure the support it needed Monday when the
center-right opposition decided to vote for NATO membership for
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
	   But opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi also called on Prodi to
resign. He said any government that needed opposition help on
something so important lacked the backing to continue governing.
	   The spat did not appear to be a serious threat since the
Communists have said they'll support Prodi if things come to a
confidence vote.
	   ``Today the issue is not the government majority, but an
important choice for the country,'' Prodi told the Chamber of
Deputies.
	   The Senate has already ratified the expansion, which must be
approved by all 16 NATO countries as well as the three membership
candidates.

German agent in Scientology spying case formally charged 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ A German security agent who in April
was arrested for attempting to spy on the Church of Scientology has
been formally charged, the Basel state prosecutor's office said
Tuesday.
	   The agent, who was not identified, is charged with breaking
Swiss law by carrying out ``illegal business for a foreign state,''
working for a political information service and falsifying
identification documents.
	   Employed by the Baden-Wuerttemberg branch of Germany's domestic
security agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution,
he was bailed out of detention three days after being arrested in
Basel.
	   The agent was arrested as he was leaving a restaurant where he
had met with two Swiss women, one of whom was also charged Tuesday.
	   The unidentified woman from Zurich is thought to have been in
contact with the German department for several months. She is
charged only with working for a political information service.
	   The agent was accused of soliciting the help of the other woman
at the meeting, Swiss Socialist lawmaker Susanne Haller, in
collecting information on the church.
	   Haller, who alerted police to the meeting, is not under
investigation.
	   Germany apologized to Switzerland for the incident. The agent
was bailed after the Baden-Wuerttemberg state interior ministry
guaranteed he would return to stand trial.
	   Germany contends that Scientology, which has missions both in
Basel and nearby Freiburg, Germany, engages in coercive activities
and is out to bilk its members.
	   The U.S. government, which has extended Scientology tax-free
status as a religion since 1993, has criticized Germany's treatment
of the Scientologists.
	   The Church of Scientology, which claims 8 million members
worldwide, was founded in 1954 by the late science fiction writer
L. Ron Hubbard.
	   It has mounted an advertising campaign denouncing German
treatment of its 30,000 adherents, such as banning them from public
jobs.

U.S. company forms joint tractor-producing firm in Ukraine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's huge Yuzhmash plant and the U.S.
Case Corp. signed a deal to form a joint venture to produce
tractors, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The deal was signed in Kiev on Monday by Case's chairman and
chief executive officer Jean-Pierre Rosso and Yuzhmash director
Yuri Alexeyev, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The new venture, Dnipro-Case, is to produce Case tractors for
agricultural purposes, with a production run of 500 planned by the
end of the year, Alexeyev said. Production should increase to 4,500
a year by 2003, he said.
	   Yuzhmash and Case Corp. have yet to finalize financial
arrangements and the size of the venture's founding capital, in
which they would have equal shares, Alexeyev said. He said Case is
expected to supply equipment for the joint venture.
	   The share of the Dnipropetrovsk-based Yuzhmash in the actual
production would be around 10 percent during the first year, to
rise to about 50 percent in three to four years, the report said.
	   Yuzhmash, one of the world's largest missile plants, was one of
the Soviet Union's most carefully guarded weapons facilities. It
continues to produce rocket technology for civilian purposes.

Malaysian private policemen arrested for forging medical leave

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In the second such case in a week against
Malaysians working in Singapore, police have arrested 20 on charges
of using forged medical leave forms to take paid days off, the
state-run television reported Tuesday.
	   The latest case involves employees of Commercial Industrial
Security Corp., which supplies private policemen employed by
private companies and the government for a variety of security and
enforcement tasks.
	   Eighteen officers from CISCO pleaded guilty Tuesday to
submitting forged medical certificates, while two others pleaded
innocent.
	   Last week, 97 Malaysians working for Seagate Technology were
arrested for submitting similarly faked medical leave forms. They
lost their jobs and were fined.
	   In both cases, the certificates were reported to have been
obtained from the Sultana Aminah Hospital in Malaysia's southern
city of Johor Bahru, just across the border from Singapore.

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ An Iberia domestic aircraft carrying 131
people was hijacked Tuesday during a flight between Seville and
Barcelona.
	   The Boeing 727 was diverted to the eastern city of Valencia,
where eight children and three elderly people were released shortly
after landing, an Israel radio correspondent said.
	   The hijacked airplane landed at Valencia's Manises airport at
8:40 a.m. (0640 GMT), apparently to begin refueling, a police
spokesman said.
	   The three people hijacked the Iberia plane, carrying 124
passengers with a crew of seven, during its flight between the
southern city of Seville and Barcelona in the northeast, national
radio reported.
	   The hijackers demanded to be taken to Athens, then on to Tel
Aviv, the radio said. Details on the identities of the people on
board was not immediately available.
	   One of the hijackers carried a package, together with a remote
control device, and said he would explode the package unless his
demands were met, Israel radio reported.

China raps Israel for new Jerusalem blueprint 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Tuesday that a new Israeli blueprint
for Jerusalem would complicate peace efforts in the Middle East.
	   China hopes Israel ``will stop doing anything that might
aggravate the situation'' and abide by U.N. resolutions and the
Oslo peace accords to push forward the stalemated Middle East peace
process, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.
	   He said Israeli plans for Jerusalem ``will inevitably further
complicate the situation in the Middle East'' and went against
``positive efforts'' made by other parties involved in the region
to promote the peace process.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has assured the U.S.
government that the new blueprint for Jerusalem does not expand the
city's authority into the West Bank.
	   According to some press reports, however, the plan expands
Jerusalem's municipal borders and its administrative reach. The
Washington Post said that at the heart of the plan is a significant
expansion to the west and south to include a number of
overwhelmingly Jewish towns and villages.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis and this week's urgent
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund prompted an
extraordinary meeting Tuesday between the president, premier, the
entire Cabinet and top legislative officials.
	   The meeting comes three months to the day since President Boris
Yeltsin jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,
saying it had failed to improve Russia's economy and living
conditions.
	   Since then, the Russian economy has only been battered further
by a slide in world oil prices, the financial crisis in Asia, and
scattered workers' protests, including the blockage of major rail
arteries last month.
	   At Tuesday's crisis meeting, Premier Sergei Kiriyenko was to set
out _ for at least the fourth time _ the state of Russia's economy
and his plan for how to battle the country's financial crunch.
	   The program noted that the government was spending an increasing
amount of money servicing its debt. The sum this year could top 35
percent of the budget, it said.
	   ``There is a clear threat of a new dangerous debt crisis, which
may develop into a new wave of aggravation of the general crisis of
the general economy,'' the program said.
	   It said that as of June 1, the government owed 66.9 billion
rubles (dlrs 10.8 billion) in back wages, it said.
	   Broadly speaking, Kiriyenko's plan comprises deep spending cuts
and sharply increased tax collection. It calls for budget revenues
to exceed spending by 2 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product, and for reducing spending by up to 42 billion rubles (dlrs
6.8 billion) a year.
	   The plan also includes government support for Russian exports,
debt rescheduling for industry, and shifting the tax burden to
consumption instead of production, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. Interest rates should be lowered to 20 percent to 25
percent per annum, so that companies can afford them, the program
said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials rallied behind one of the
nation's largest lenders Tuesday, hoping to calm investors in what
is fast becoming a major test of how effectively Japan can handle a
bad-debt crisis looming over its banking system.
	   Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd., which is saddled with more
than 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans, rebounded
Tuesday after Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga and other top
financial officials expressed confidence in the bank's ability to
stay afloat.
	   Matsunaga stressed that LTCB's individual depositors and
institutional investors are fully protected. But he added, ``We
welcome any plan that the bank takes to strengthen its
operations.''
	   Analysts said the government will likely do whatever is
necessary to prevent its collapse, including arranging a merger or
providing short-term loans. LTCB is so big that its failure could
shatter the already fragile faith Japanese depositors have in their
banks.
	   LTCB is a major player _ it was listed as the world's 22nd
largest bank by Forbes magazine.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's richest man, fresh from
a trip to North Korea, said Tuesday he has signed a contract to
start sightseeing tours of the North's scenic east coast.
	   Chung Ju-yung, founder-owner of the giant Hyundai group, said
the tour project could start as early as this fall if the Seoul
government approves it.
	   ``I've returned after signing a contract to develop Diamond
Mountain and start sightseeing tours of the scenic tourist site,''
Chung told reporters at Panmunjom, a neutral village inside the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
	   Chung said his Hyundai group plans to send as many as 1,000
tourists a day aboard a cruise ship to see the mountain near his
birthplace, Tongchun.
	   Hyundai officials accompanying Chung said tourists would go to
Wonsan, a major port on the North's east coast, by ship and then
travel to the mountain by land.
	   The 82-year-old tycoon said he also discussed several industrial
projects with North Korean officials, including the possible
relocation of some of Hyundai Motors Co.'s subcompact car assembly
lines. North Korean labor costs are cheap _ about one-eighth of
those in South Korea.
	   Industry officials warned, however, that Chung's projects are
vulnerable to political and military tensions on the divided
peninsula.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's Communist Party and government leaders
warned Tuesday that more needs to done to find jobs for millions of
workers laid off from struggling state industries.
	   Stronger measures must be taken in order to reform state
enterprises and preserve social stability, the Communist Party's
policy-setting Central Committee and the State Council, or Cabinet,
said in a circular issued Monday and carried in leading official
newspapers Tuesday.
	   The order said government at all levels must expand retraining
programs and provide stipends so that laid-off workers can get by
until they find work.
	   The central government has repeatedly stressed that coping with
mounting unemployment will be difficult but critical for reforms.
Protests by workers complaining they have not received stipends,
pensions or wages have erupted in cities throughout China.
	   The leadership's statement promised more than 50 percent of
laid-off workers this year would find new jobs. But it warned it
would take five more years to establish a social security system
that would guarantee welfare, unemployment, medical and pension
payments.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. electronics giant Motorola says it will
lay off 380 employees from its Singapore operations as the regional
economic downturn begins to bite.
	   ``The restructuring in Singapore is necessary for the company to
respond to the economic decline in Asia that caused the reduction
in demand for its communication products,'' said a statement from
the Singapore arm of Motorola, obtained Tuesday by DowJones
Newswires.
	   Motorola, which now employs 4,200 people in Singapore, has never
retrenched staff in its 24 years here.
	   The move is part of a worldwide reorganization. Motorola plans a
10 percent reduction of its global work force _ or 15,000 employees
_ over the next year to stem the steady erosion of its profits and
market share.
	   Prior to the layoffs, Motorola had resorted to reducing the
number of work days at some of its factories.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asiaweek, a regional news magazine published in
Hong Kong, will be allowed to increase its circulation in Singapore
an additional 3,000 copies per week, up to 21,000, the government
said Tuesday.
	   No reason was given in the statement by the Ministry of
Information and the Arts.
	   Asiaweek, whose circulation was cut from 10,000 to 500 copies
per week after a 1987 dispute with the government, remains listed
under a Government Gazette that allows the ministry to limit
circulation and control distribution of the news magazine.
	   Asiaweek, like other news publications, also must obtain an
annual license from the government.

Indonesian president to meet Nobel prize winner on East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's new president will meet
Wednesday with a Nobel Peace Prize-winning critic from the troubled
territory of East Timor, the government said.
	   President B.J. Habibie and Bishop Carlos Belo are expected to
discuss the bitter dispute in East Timor, which was invaded by
Indonesian forces in 1975 and annexed a year later.
	   Habibie's decision to open dialogue on East Timor is a major
shift from the intransigence of his authoritarian predecessor,
Suharto. However, a peaceful solution still seems distant.
	   A small group of separatist rebels continues to fight and many
people in the former Portuguese colony want a vote on independence,
which Habibie has ruled out.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, a vigorous defender of Indonesian
control of East Timor, will attend the meeting at the presidential
palace, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Tuesday.
	   ``Anything might be discussed,'' Tanjung said.
	   Offering a deal on East Timor, Habibie has said he will release
jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao and grant some
measure of autonomy to the territory. In exchange, he said, the
world community must recognize Indonesian control.
	   Portugal and other critics of Indonesian policy have rejected
the suggestion. Belo, a symbol of opposition to Indonesia, has said
East Timorese should decide their political future.
	   Belo shared the Nobel prize in 1996 with East Timorese activist
Jose Ramos-Horta for their efforts to bring peace to their
homeland.
	   Habibie, who is pursuing an agenda of democratic reform, took
office May 21 after Suharto resigned amid political and economic
turmoil.

Malaysia's opposition demands royal inquiry into corruption 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with opposition demand
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's main opposition leader
on Tuesday demanded an independent probe into allegations of
corruption in government and cronyism and nepotism by powerful
politicians.
	   ``I have today submitted a motion for next month's Parliament
(session) on setting up of a royal commission of inquiry into
cronyism and nepotism,'' said Lim Kit Siang, leader of the
Democratic Action Party. Parliament is scheduled to convene July
13.
	   Lim said he was not demanding an investigation into the affairs
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad specifically, but was seeking a
broader probe.
	   ``I am not suggesting that the public hearings of these
investigations be confined to inquiries into Mahathir and his three
sons, Mirzan, Mokhzani and Mukriz,'' Lim said.
	   Royal commissions of inquiry are appointed by Malaysia's king
and are expected to be free from government interference.
	   Mahathir, meanwhile, has promised to release more names of
people awarded government contracts to allay public suspicions of
nepotism and cronyism in the government.
	   Mahathir said Monday his administration would continue to
disclose the companies that have been awarded lucrative projects,
as well as the names of individuals who received shares allotted by
the government.
	   ``If this is what the public wants, we will do so,'' Mahathir
told reporters.
	   On Saturday, Mahathir turned the tables on his critics in his
United Malays National Organization party by releasing lists of
hundreds of Malays awarded government contracts.
	   His move was aimed at muffling growing accusations at the
party's annual convention that powerful politicians had misused an
affirmative action program for the dominant Malays by giving
government contracts and awarding share quotas to their cronies.
	   The documents also identified people who receive preferential
shares and stakes in private companies and special licenses for
public transport companies.
	   Included in the lists were the names of Mahathir's sons and
relatives of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as well as that
of Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the outspoken leader of the UMNO Youth wing,
who was seen to be spearheading a campaign against Mahathir. He had
claimed that nepotism and cronyism determined contract allotments.
	   On Sunday, Zahid was forced to tersely deny that he himself
profited from any sweetened government deals.
	   Mahathir had earlier denied charges made by Zahid, saying that
all indigenous Malays had benefited from Malaysia's National
Economic Policy, started in 1971.
	   The affirmative action program was designed to give Malays _
``Bumiputera,'' or ``sons of the soil'' _ a bigger role in
business, once dominated by ethnic Chinese.

Holbrooke arrives for `last-chance' demands on Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat arrived in the
Balkans on Tuesday with what could be a final warning for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic before NATO takes steps to try to end
the fighting in Kosovo.
	   The visit by Richard Holbrooke, a troubleshooter for the region
and the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is seen as a
last diplomatic effort to get Milosevic to stop his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Western nations, who sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in a
warning to Milosevic earlier this month, have been deliberating on
what measures they will take if Milosevic refuses.
	   Holbrooke stopped in neighboring Macedonia en route to Belgrade
for talks with Milosevic later Tuesday, meeting in the capital
Skopje with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and President Kiro
Gligorov.
	   He also was expected to meet with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, who supports a peaceful settlement but has limited if any
influence over the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The West fears the Kosovo conflict could spread to Macedonia,
which borders on Kosovo and also has a sizeable community of ethnic
Albanians.
	   Holbrooke is credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo.
	   Last week, Milosevic met in Russia with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to work toward peace in Kosovo, including holding new
talks with Rugova. But he has refused demands to pull back and
cease security forces' fire.
	   A team of Russian diplomats toured the region Sunday and Monday,
but without clear results. Russia, a fellow Slavic nation, opposes
Western military pressure on its long-time ally.
	   Continuing clashes between Serb and KLA forces have been
reported this week.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday in
Washington that Holbrooke would demand that Milosevic adhere to
conditions imposed on him by the Contact Group of leading Western
nations on the Balkans.
	   ``He will be making clear in a very strong message to President
Milosevic, that the Contact Group's demands are not a menu from
which he can choose,'' Rubin said.
	   ``He must not only follow through in a way that he has not yet
followed through, on the requirements to allow access for
humanitarian organizations in Kosovo, but he also must pull back
and canton appropriately the forces that have been involved in the
violence there.''
	   The U.N. Security Council plans to discuss Kosovo next Monday.
Diplomats there said they are awaiting the results of the visits by
the Russians and Holbrooke before deciding what to do.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers agree they need to pump
less oil to try to improve the depressed price, but they were at
odds Tuesday over how to get the job done.
	   Analysts say OPEC needs to slash output by more than the 620,000
barrels a day already promised. OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu
Lukman of Nigeria acknowledged Tuesday that changes may be
necessary, but he would not elaborate.
	   ``You're jumping the gun,'' Lukman told reporters as more
ministers arrived for the meeting that formally opens Wednesday.
``They haven't even had time to discuss the matter.''
	   OPEC is confronting the lowest oil prices since the disastrous
year of 1986 _ thanks to the group's ill-judged decision to produce
more crude in the winter, just as the southeast Asia economic
crisis started killing the growth in global demand.
	   OPEC came up slightly short on delivering an earlier round of
production cuts, which were agreed upon at an emergency meeting in
March, and prices fell further.
	   Saudi Arabia believes both rounds of cuts, including reductions
in output from OPEC as well as non-OPEC nations such as Mexico,
Russia, Oman and Norway, should total 2.3 million to 2.4 million
barrels a day, but a Gulf source acknowledged concerns about all
producers finding the willpower to stick with their promises. The
source spoke to reporters early Tuesday, only on condition of
anonymity.
	   The producers have pledged cumulatively to take about that many
barrels off the market, but analysts doubt OPEC will actually
deliver. The once-powerful oil cartel repeatedly has failed to meet
its production agreements in recent years.
	   Iran, meanwhile, has suggested cutting production by 10 percent
across the board from February's output levels, OPEC delegates say
privately. That's a potentially divisive idea because it would push
Saudi production far lower than Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi has
thus far agreed.
	   With his country producing 8.5 million barrels a day out of
OPEC's total output of around 28.2 million, Naimi is by far the
most influential player within OPEC.
	   OPEC's average oil price fell below dlrs 11 per barrel last
week, a bargain for gasoline-guzzling consumers but a nightmare for
the oil producers who will have severe problems meeting their
budget targets if the market doesn't bounce back quickly.
	   Analysts say prices probably won't be rescued by what OPEC has
thus far offered, although Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser
al-Sabah, gave traders a bit of optimism on Monday by suggesting
more cuts must be contemplated if the price doesn't rise.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August climbed 39 cents to
dlrs 13.24 per barrel on the London futures market, while in New
York, light sweet crude futures for August delivery were up 48
cents at dlrs 13.65 per barrel.
	   The futures prices are always somewhat higher than OPEC's
average price because they represent premium grades of crude oil.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Escaped murderer of French diplomat sentenced to another 15 years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Lebanese man who escaped from a prison
where he was serving a life term for killing a French diplomat was
sentenced in absentia to an additional 15 years for the breakout.
	   Hussein Mustafa Tleiss, a former army corporal, was sentenced
Monday by the Military Tribunal for his escape Feb. 24 from a
prison hospital with the help of eight gunmen disguised as prison
guards, judicial officials said Tuesday.
	   Tleiss was convicted in the 1986 fatal shooting of Col. Rene
Gouttiere, the military attache at the French Embassy in Beirut.
	   Until his escape, Tleiss was the only person convicted and
jailed in connection with numerous attacks on foreigners during the
1975-90 Lebanese civil war. He remains at large.
	   The court also sentenced in absentia eight men from the Tleiss
family to five years in prison at hard labor for helping in the
escape from the hospital north of Beirut.
	   Two prison guards accused of facilitating the escape were
sentenced to three months in prison, the officials added, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity. They will serve time.
	   Tleiss, 37, a Shiite Muslim from eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley,
was convicted in 1994 and sentenced to death. But the verdict was
commuted to life in prison under an amnesty covering politically
motivated crimes during the civil war.
	   During his trial, Tleiss confessed to killing Gouttiere and
later claimed he acted on orders of the Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   He said the slaying was in retaliation for a 1983 French air
raid on Baalbek, a Hezbollah stronghold in eastern Lebanon.

Ramos orders halt on work on Marcos grave until end of his term

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos ordered a halt
Tuesday to construction of a grave for former dictator Ferdinand
Marcos at a heroes' cemetery, saying he will not permit Marcos'
burial there for the remaining week of his term.
	   However, President-elect Joseph Estrada, a former Marcos
supporter who takes office June 30, has agreed to allow the burial
at Heroes' Cemetery in metropolitan Manila on July 11.
	   The emotionally charged dispute over whether Marcos should be
finally buried at the cemetery nearly nine years after dying in
exile in 1989 has divided Filipinos and reduced the massive popular
support Estrada received in last month's elections.
	   Marcos' body was not allowed to return to the Philippines until
September 1993. Since then, it has been kept in a glass coffin in
an air-conditioned mausoleum in his northern hometown.
	   Both Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon Aquino, refused to let
Marcos' body be brought to Manila, fearing conflicts between the
former strongman's supporters and opponents.
	   Estrada says burying Marcos will finally put those tensions to
rest.
	   But Ramos said Tuesday in ordering construction be halted on the
grave until the end of his term, ``I want to make it very clear
that my position ... with regard to that particular issue has
remained very consistent.''
	   Also Tuesday, opponents of the burial launched a ``Marcos is No
Hero'' movement, saying that instead of reconciliation, the burial
at the cemetery will open old wounds.
	   ``In no stretch of the imagination can you make Marcos a hero
worthy of emulation,'' said Sen. Alberto Romulo, a member of the
movement.
	   Retired navy Capt. Julian Advincula, whose son is buried at the
Heroes' Cemetery, also urged Estrada to reconsider the plan, which
he says will turn the area into a ``battleground'' for supporters
and opponents of the plan.
	   Other relatives of soldiers buried in the cemetery say they plan
to transfer their dead elsewhere if Marcos' burial proceeds.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial at the cemetery is appropriate
because he was a veteran who fought during World War II.
	   The government accuses Marcos and his associates of illegally
amassing billions of dollars during his 20-year rule. Marcos'
government also was accused of torturing and murdering political
dissidents.
	   Estrada says Marcos will not receive state honors during the
burial. He said he sent a letter to Mrs. Marcos on Sunday setting
the rules for the burial, including a ban on rallies along the
route to the cemetery.
	   He said only family members, not exceeding 50 people, will be
allowed in the cemetery and no political statements can be made
during the strictly religious ceremony.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly
higher Tuesday, a day after the government announced a
multibillion-dollar package to boost the territory's sagging
economy.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 15.46 points, or 0.1 percent, closing at 8,219.67. On Monday,
the index had slumped 387,70 points, or 4.5 percent.
	   Turnover amounted to 6.41 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
821 million), up from Monday's 5.65 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 724 million).
	   Brokers said shares were boosted in the morning by the
government's announcement Monday that it will suspend land sales to
help the slumping property market.
	   The government also said it is returning about 4 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 512 million) in real estate taxes, and that
it will provide 2 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 256 million)
to small businesses to help them secure credit.
	   Investors expect the economic stimulus package will provide a
short-term lift to the market ``but the long-term effects are
unknown,'' said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon Securities
Ltd.
	   Among gainers, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 1.30 Hong Kong
dollars to 32.50, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 90 cents to 29.00, China
Light rose 70 cents to 33.80, and Cheung Kong rose 20 cents to
36.50.
	   Going against the trend were HSBC Holdings, which fell 2.50
dollars to 178.00, and Hang Seng Bank, which fell 70 cents to
42.80.

region on a rail line between Nanning and Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi
province in north China.
	   Meanwhile, the railway between Yingtan in southeastern Jiangxi
province and Xiamen in neighboring Fujian was closed after
torrential rains Sunday damaged foundations, Xinhua said. Repairs
were expected to take one week.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A gas explosion in a coal mine killed nine people
and left one missing, feared dead, in Sichuan province in
southwestern China, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported
Tuesday.
	   The explosion Friday in a privately run mine in Renshou County
also seriously injured three people, the report said.
	   The local government twice told the mine to close in late May
and early June because of bad management, but the order was never
implemented, Xinhua said. Authorities were investigating the cause
of the blast, it said.
	   Coal mines have China's worst industrial safety record, with
thousands of deaths each year from cave-ins, fires, flooding and
explosions.

RETRANSMITTING
Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh comments, Iran pushing for 10
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers agree they need to pump
less oil to try to improve the depressed price, but they were at
odds Tuesday over how to get the job done.
	   Analysts say OPEC needs to slash output by more than the 620,000
barrels a day already promised. OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu
Lukman of Nigeria acknowledged Tuesday that changes may be
necessary, but he would not elaborate.
	   ``You're jumping the gun,'' Lukman told reporters as more
ministers arrived for the meeting that formally opens Wednesday.
``They haven't even had time to discuss the matter.''
	   OPEC is confronting the lowest oil prices since the disastrous
year of 1986 _ thanks to the group's ill-judged decision to produce
more crude in the winter, just as the southeast Asia economic
crisis started killing the growth in global demand.
	   OPEC came up slightly short on delivering an earlier round of
production cuts, which were agreed upon at an emergency meeting in
March, and prices fell further.
	   Saudi Arabia believes both rounds of cuts, including reductions
in output from OPEC as well as non-OPEC nations such as Mexico,
Russia, Oman and Norway, should total 2.3 million to 2.4 million
barrels a day, but a Gulf source acknowledged concerns about all
producers finding the willpower to stick with their promises. The
source spoke to reporters early Tuesday, only on condition of
anonymity.
	   The producers have pledged cumulatively to take about that many
barrels off the market, but analysts doubt OPEC will actually
deliver. The once-powerful oil cartel repeatedly has failed to meet
its production agreements in recent years.
	   Iran, meanwhile, has suggested cutting production by 10 percent

Philippine Airlines granted temporary debt relief to prevent closure 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A government commission allowed
Philippine Airlines Tuesday to temporarily suspend payments to
creditors to help it avoid closure due to a devastating 19-day
pilots' strike.
	   A U.S. court also has issued a restraining order to prevent
PAL's American creditors from foreclosing on its loans, a PAL
official said.
	   The airline has sought a suspension of payments on about dlrs 2
billion in loans owed to about 1,000 foreign and local banks and
aircraft lessors because of drastically reduced cash flow.
	   Perfecto Yasay, chairman of Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission, suspended all local financial claims against PAL for 30
days while a committee works out a rehabilitation plan for the
airline.
	   The airline owes local banks, chiefly Philippine National Bank,
an estimated dlrs 400 million, and owes another dlrs 1.6 billion to
U.S. and European creditors. Much of the money was borrowed to
bankroll an ambitious modernization program.
	   PAL filed a rehabilitation plan with the commission Friday,
saying it is unable to meet payments on its loans.
	   As part of the plan, the airline says it will slash its work
force by about 40 percent, dispose of 40 of its 54 planes, suspend
more than two-thirds of its routes and sell some subsidiaries.
	   PAL said the strike by more than 600 pilots that began June 5
has worsened financial difficulties caused by a regional currency
crisis, pushing Asia's oldest airline to the brink of closure. The
stoppage has cost PAL more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million)
in lost revenue, it says.
	   Last week, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than 13,000 workers in
an effort to scale down its operations and stave off more losses,
causing the airline's flight attendants and ground personnel to
threaten to strike as well.
	   PAL lawyer Estelito Mendoza said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of
the Northern District of California issued an order Monday
preventing the airline's U.S. creditors from foreclosing on its
loans before July 2.
	   The decisions by Manila's SEC and the U.S. court prevent PAL's
creditors from immediately seizing PAL's assets when the airline
fails to meet its financial obligations.
	   PAL's 625-strong pilots' union went on strike to protest an
airline plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   PAL now has 83 pilots, including some union members who have
returned to work, but needs a total of 200 to handle its
scaled-down operations, airline officials said. The airline said it
is also considering hiring Indonesian pilots laid off by
financially troubled Indonesian carriers.
	   Although the government holds a minority stake in PAL, President
Fidel Ramos said Tuesday he would not personally intervene in the
labor dispute at the country's flag-carrier.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada, who succeeds Ramos on June 30,
also has said he will not back a financial bailout of the company.
	   The airline says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ the biggest loss in its
57-year history.

Pakistan says Indian shelling kills two in Kashmir 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister on Tuesday
reiterated his call for international mediation in a border dispute
with India after Indian soldiers reportedly shelled Pakistani
territory, killing two people and injuring two others.
	   The attacks occurred Monday near the town of Balakot on the
border dividing the disputed region of Kashmir, Pakistani officials
and witnesses said. Some witnesses claimed as many as 60 shells
landed in the area.
	   Indian officials had no immediate comment.
	   India controls two-thirds of the Himalayan territory and
Pakistan the remaining one-third. The bitter enemies have fought
two wars over the mostly Muslim state since it was split between
them after the British left the Asian subcontinent in 1947.
	   A simmering secessionist uprising in Indian-held Kashmir began
in 1989, exacerbating tensions. India, a predominantly Hindu
nation, accuses Pakistan of backing militant Muslim secessionists,
who want either outright independence or union with Islamic
Pakistan.
	   The protracted dispute over Kashmir gained international
prominence last month after India and Pakistan both tested nuclear
devices and declared themselves nuclear powers, prompting many
countries to urge negotiations to end the dispute -- seen as a
likely flash point of a regional war.
	   Sporadic firing along the disputed border has become a common
occurrence. Pakistan claims dozens of people have died in the area
in recent weeks.
	   According to news reports Tuesday, Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif again called for international mediation, something
India has flatly rejected.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee instead Tuesday
called for one-on-one talks on Kashmir, reiterating his opposition
to mediation.
	   ``With our common experience of colonialism, we should be
cautious of such attempts to internationalize problems in the
region,'' he was quoted as saying by Indian news agencies.
	   Pakistan wants the Kashmir dispute settled through a plebiscite
that would give Kashmiris on both sides of the border the
opportunity to vote whether to join Pakistan or India. This demand
for a plebiscite is in keeping with a United Nations resolution
that dates back to 1948.
	   ``Bilateral talks have so far not produced any results and I
have informed the U.N. Secretary General about it,'' the
independent English language daily newspaper, The News, quoted
Sharif as saying.
	   ``We should adopt a pragmatic approach to address the Kashmir
issue and India should realize that threatening statements will
have a negative impact on the efforts to resolve all the
outstanding issues between India and Pakistan,'' he said.
	   Sharif said he received a letter from Vajpayee offering talks
during a summit of South Asian nations to be held sometime next
month in Sri Lanka. There was no official reaction to the letter.

Romania beat England 2-1 and qualified for the next round of the
World Cup.
	   Braving heavy rain for four hours, people hung out of
horn-honking trucks waving Romanian flags and celebrated in the
streets of Bucharest, Cluj, Brasov, Oradea, Iasi, Craiova and
Constanta.
	   ``We qualified, we qualified!'' people shouted in Bucharest's
University Square, a traditional point for celebrations and
protests where a popular anti-communist revolt raged in 1989.
	   A police spokesman, Col. Nicolae Secrieru, said there was no
trouble. He estimated the crowd in Bucharest at 200,000 people.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile, on a visit to Poland, skipped dinner
with Polish Premier Jerzy Buzek to watch the game with Romanian
officials.
	   Buzek later sent him a bottle of Champagne congratulating
Romania on its victory, national radio reported.

Romanian floods killed 22 people, officials say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A week of heavy rains and flooding
across a large portion of Romania killed 22 people and hundreds of
animals, destroying thousands of houses and fields, officials said
Tuesday.
	   The victims drowned or were killed by lightning or hailstones,
officials from the Water, Forests and Environment Ministry said.
	   The report said some 12,000 farms, 2,000 houses, 88 apartments,
86,000 hectares (210,000 acres) of crops and over 550 kilometers
(344 miles) of road and railway lines were destroyed by flooding.
	   The counties of Alba, Hunedoara, Mures in the northwest and
Bacau, Iasi and Neamt in the northeast were hit the worst.
	   It was the most serious flooding in Romania since 1977, when
thousands of people died.
	   There was no immediate damage evaluation, but the report says
damage runs to tens of billion of lei (millions of dollars).
	   Soldiers waded deep into floodwaters to rescue inhabitants and
build dikes in the last few days. Rivers and high waters have
subsided in recent days.

Russian government to meet over economic crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin told the Cabinet on
Tuesday that the difficult financial situation in Russia ``remains
alarming'' and that ``radical measures'' were needed to restore
order to the economy.
	   ``The price of dragging-out and delays, squabbling and discord,
is too high,'' Yeltsin said as he opened an extraordinary meeting
prompted by Russia's economic crisis and this week's urgent
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
	   The meeting came three months to the day since President Boris
Yeltsin jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,
saying it had failed to improve Russia's economy and living
conditions.
	   Since then, the Russian economy has only been battered further
by a slide in world oil prices, the financial crisis in Asia, and
scattered workers' protests, including the blockage of major rail
arteries last month.
	   Yeltsin said that the laws needed to set the government's
emergency economic program in motion should be passed before the
parliament breaks for the summer.
	   ``We don't have more time left,'' he said, hinting that if
parliament fails to act, he will push through the reforms by
decree.
	   ``Other measures will be taken,'' he said.

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ An Iberia domestic aircraft carrying 131
people, including the mayor of Seville, was hijacked on Tuesday
during a flight between Seville and Barcelona by three people
demanding to go to Tel Aviv, authorities said.
	   The Boeing 727 was diverted to the eastern city of Valencia's
Manises airport, where 17 children and one adult woman were
released shortly after landing at 8:40 a.m. (0640GMT), interior
ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Officials at Ben-Gurion International airport outside Tel Aviv
said any decision on whether the plane would be allowed to land
there would be up to the government.
	   Delgado of the interior ministry said the hijackers of Iberia
flight 1121 were armed but could not confirm radio reports in Spain
and Israel that one of them carried a package, together with a
remote control device, and had threatened to explode the package
unless his demands were met.
	   Information regarding the nationality of the passengers and the
identity of the hijackers was not immediately available.
	   The red, white and yellow plane was parked some 500 (547 yards)
from the main terminal in an isolated area and was surrounded at a
discrete distance by Civil Guards and National Police and their
all-terrain vehicles.

Captured North Korean submarine sinks

Eds: UPDATES with sub sinking, trims

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ A captured North Korean submarine
sank Tuesday as it was being towed into this naval base by a South
Korean warship. The fate of its crew was unclear.
	   The midget submarine, already mostly submerged and listing
badly, broke away from one of two tow ropes and went nose down into
the harbor, a military spokesman said.
	   ``Chances are that the crew has died already, but we don't
exclude the other possibility'' that they escaped before the sub
was discovered Monday, Maj. Kim Jong-woo said.
	   Earlier sonar scans of the submarine's hull showed no signs of
life inside, the national news agency Yonhap reported, but the navy
never got the vessel to a pier for a closer examination, and there
was no response to a hammer pounding on the hull.
	   Kim said it sank 1.8 kilometers (one mile) off shore, putting an
end to what one high-ranking military official called ``a clear
armed provocation.''
	   Before it sank, the submarine was moored well out in the harbor
and surrounded by four warships. Because it was riding so low in
the water, it could barely be seen from the coast.
	   Yonhap earlier quoted Maj. Gen. Lim Jong-chun, operations
officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying the ship was
listing about 60 degrees.
	   ``It probably means that the inside is filled with water and
that the crew perhaps drowned or suffocated due to lack of
oxygen,'' Lim was quoted as saying, adding that they might have
escaped.
	   The vessel was described as a ``midget submersible'' used
primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct coastal surveillance.
Military officials said as many as six North Koreans might have
been aboard.
	   Officials said North Korea was questioned about the intrusion at
a meeting Tuesday between generals of the communist nation and the
United Nations Command, their first in seven years.
	   The U.N. Command declined to characterize the North Korean
response, but said in a statement that ``both sides reaffirmed the
importance of continuing dialogue to build confidence, prevent
misunderstanding and reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula.''
	   The U.N. Command said the meeting was a ``good first step in
establishing a crisis management mechanism to help prevent or deal
with any military incidents'' _ a need it said was underscored by
the seizure of the North Korean sub.
	   ``The fact that the North Korean submarine infiltrated across
our coastal sea areas is a clear armed provocation and a violation
of the armistice agreement,'' said the Joint Chiefs' Lim.
	   ``Our side will take proper action later,'' Lim said without
elaboration.
	   Despite Lim's tough talk, an aide to President Kim Dae-jung said
the sub's incursion would not sidetrack the new government's
efforts to reach out to its reclusive northern rival.
	   ``The submarine incident will not shake our sunshine policy,''
the aide told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
government will try even harder to embrace the North to prevent the
repetition of similar incidents. ... We will deal with the North
with patience.''
	   North Korea's official news agency reported Tuesday that one of
the country's submarines ``seems to be wrecked in ocean currents
and waves'' off the coast of Kosong, a northern port.
	   The Korean Central News Agency said the submarine reported to
its base at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) Sunday ``that it had troubles in a
nautical observation instrument, oil pressure system and submerging
and surfacing machines.
	   ``Now the life or death of the crew is unknown,'' KCNA said.
	   The meeting between three U.N. generals and a trio of North
Korean generals at the border village of Panmunjom was designed
only as a get-acquainted session after the long moratorium on such
talks.
	   But a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs said the submarine's
intrusion into South Korean waters was taken up by the U.N.
officers, headed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Michael Hayden.
	   North Korea broke off armistice talks at Panmunjom in 1992,
angered that a South Korean general had been named to lead the U.N.
team. The North sees South Korea as a U.S. puppet and refuses to
talk to it.
	   The sub was captured Monday after it became entangled in a
fishing net off the east coast. It was first towed to the small
port of Yang-Yang, just south of the North Korean border, but
officials later decided to bring it to the better equipped naval
base at Donghae, 60 kilometers (40) miles down the coast.
	   The submarine was seized not far from where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground in 1996 _ an incident that ended with
37 people dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst
in years.
	   North Korean agents are said to be told to commit suicide to
avoid capture. In the 1996 submarine incursion, 11 North Koreans
were reportedly shot to death by one of their commanders, who then
killed himself.
	   South Korean officials said the periscope and propeller of the
submarine seized Monday got caught in the fishing net about 18
kilometers (10 miles) east of the town of Sokcho, just south of the
North Korean border and 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of
Seoul.
	   Sokcho is about five miles (8 kilometers) from where the North
Korean submarine ran aground in 1996, touching off a 53-day manhunt
for its 26 occupants. The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and
police ended with 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans
dead. One North Korean was captured and another was believed to
have escaped.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

England crashes to loss 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROTORUA, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand Maori inflicted
England's fifth loss from five games on its southern hemisphere
rugby tour with a 62-14 win Tuesday.
	   England's second string outfit tackled poorly as the Maori
players ran in nine tries to two and scored 50 points before the
tourists got on the scoreboard.
	   The Maori team continued its four year run without a loss,
adding England's scalp to previous wins over Ireland and Argentina
of the leading test nations.
	   Norm Berryman scored a double for the New Zealand team against
an English outfit thrashed 76-0 by Australia and 64-22 by the All
Blacks in the two tests so far on tour.
	   ``It looked easy but it was not,'' said a charitable Berryman.
``It is always hard out there.
	   ``They have just got to work on the positive aspects of their
game.''
	   England loose forward Tony Diprose, who captained the tourists
in the loss against Australia before being dropped, said tackling
proved the downfall Tuesday.
	   ``We came out with thoughts of winning today but for the first
20 minutes we never saw the ball,'' Diprose said. ``We missed
one-on-one tackles. They missed four, we missed 24. That has been
the difference between the sides.''
	   Scorers:
	   New Zealand Maori 62 (Norman Berryman 2, Jim Coe, Tony Brown,
Adrian Cashmore, Dallas Seymour, Rhys Duggan, Tony Marsh, Roger
Randle tries; Cashmore 7 goals, 1 penalty goal) def. England 14
(Spencer Brown, Tony Diprose tries; Tim Stimpson 2 goals).

Italian chamber debates NATO expansion 1000 gmt 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: updates with Prodi addressing chamber; vote expected around
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi called on lawmakers to put
aside partisan differences on Tuesday and ratify NATO's eastward
expansion with a resounding ``yes'' vote.
	   ``We cannot reply with a refusal to this request from from
eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he said, asking the entire Chamber
of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the name of the Italian people.''
	   But as Tuesday's vote neared, Proodi appeared to be lacking the
opposition support he needs for ratification.
	   His center-left government was forced to reach out to the
opposition because its usual ally, the Communists, oppose NATO's
expansion into Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
	   The government appeared to secure the support it needed Monday
night when the center-right opposition decided to vote for NATO
enlargement.
	   But opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, a media mogul and
former premier, also called for Prodi to resign, saying a
government that needs opposition help on something so important
lacks the backing to continue governing.
	   In his address Tuesday, Prodi rejected Berlusconi's call and
said his government was still sound.
	   ``The NATO vote doesn't put the majority at stake; the
government will go on with its program,'' he told lawmakers.
	   The reaction was swift and harsh. Opposition whip Beppe Pisanu
blasted Prodi for his ``arrogant challenge'' and said the
center-right might now vote against ratification.
	   If the center-right backs out, that means Prodi would have to
round up centrist votes. His prospects for getting them were
unclear.
	   Despite the parliamentary fireworks, the NATO spat did not
appear to be a serious threat since the Communists have said
they'll support Prodi if things come to a confidence vote.
	   The Senate has already ratified NATO expansion, which must be
approved by all 16 countries in the alliance as well as the three
membership candidates.

Iraqi official off to Germany in bid to normalize relations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A senior Iraqi official left for Germany to
explore the possibility of normalizing relations and expanding
economic ties, an Iraqi newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Abduljabbar al-Douri, a Foreign Ministry undersecretary, will
arrive in Bonn next week to urge the German government to reopen
its embassy in Baghdad and encourage German firms to resume their
business with Iraq, Al-Ittihad said.
	   The weekly paper did not say where al-Douri would travel first.
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said he left Monday.
	   Germany was among Iraq's main trading partners before Baghdad's
1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War. The United
Nations imposed sweeping sanctions on Iraq after the invasion.
	   Iraq's trade with Germany under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program is meager, totaling just dlrs 32 million since the deal
went into effect 18 months ago.
	   But government-controlled newspapers said this week that a trade
delegation representing major German companies would visit Iraq
next month to boost trade.

King dissolves Cabinet for first time in his 26-year-reign 
</HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR MAX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ One of the world's last governing
monarchs is firing Cabinet members who were not chosen by the
people and proposing political reform for Bhutan.
	   The national newspaper Kuensel, received from the insular
country in neighboring India Tuesday, said King Jigme Singye
Wangchuck told his 22-member Cabinet of the move last week and
submitted a proposal for political change to the speaker of the
National Assembly for discussion.
	   Details of the proposed changes won't be known until the
assembly begins its biannual session next Monday.
	   Any reform was almost certain to fall short of demands by
pro-democracy advocates who seek a constitutional monarchy. The
42-year-old king, the fourth in the dynasty ruling Bhutan since
1907, is the head of government and the final source of authority.
He ascended the throne in 1972.
	   Six directly elected ministers will remain in the Cabinet until
their three-year terms expire, as will two ministers chosen by the
clergy. The other 14 appointed by the king will lose their seats,
Kuensel said. Among them is the world's longest serving foreign
minister, Dawa Tsering, who has been in his post 26 years.
	   Although it was not immediately known how the 14 would be
replaced, Bhutanese officials said the 150-member National Assembly
was likely to gain more authority in a gradual process of
democratization.
	   Over the past 15 years, the king has moved to decentralize
authority, establishing local committees to help determine
development policy and decide local issues.
	   The king began instituting political reforms in the early 1980s
to bring popular opinion into the decision-making process. The king
was once quoted as saying Bhutan cannot rely in the future on
having a ``wise king.''
	   Two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly are chosen
from local districts, either through consensus or by elections. The
remaining third are appointed by the king or chosen by the clergy.
	   Bhutan, a landlocked nation of 600,000 people wedged between
China and India, is the last independent Buddhist kingdom in the
Himalayas. It shuns foreign influence to preserve its Buddhist
culture.
	   Most dissenters are in exile, and criticism of the monarchy is
rarely heard inside Bhutan. The core of dissent is among the tens
of thousands of people, most of them Hindus of Nepalese origin, who
were expelled or encouraged to leave Bhutan in the early 1990s.
Bhutan claimed they were migrants who had illegally settled in the
country, but the expulsions were widely condemned by human rights
groups.

Minister: Malaysia remains free of haze 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian skies were free of haze
and air pollution indices were well below danger levels, the
country's top environment official said Tuesday.
	   Daily satellite pictures showed that fires in Indonesia's
Kalimantan and Sumatra provinces had either been put out or were
under control, said Science, Technology and Environment Minister
Law Hieng Ding.
	   ``Fires in parts of Malaysia also have been extinguished,'' he
said at the launch of a cleanliness campaign ahead of the
Commonwealth Games at Kuala Lumpur's main sports complex.
	   Malaysian officials have worried that the haze might return
during the games, which begin Sept. 11. Some among the 68
participating nations have voiced concern that the haze could
affect athletes' health.
	   The Air Pollutant Index in most Malaysian cities was below 50, a
level that is considered good, said Law. Kuala Lumpur and an
adjoining port town had readings above 50 but less than 100.
	   An API reading of 0-50 is considered ``good,'' 50-100
``moderate,'' 101-200 ``unhealthy,'' 201-300 ``very unhealthy,''
and 300-500 ``hazardous'' to health.
	   Last September, the level exceeded 500 in the eastern state of
Sarawak, near Indonesia, forcing it to declare an emergency and
shut schools and businesses.
	   Forest fires raging in Indonesia's Kalimantan had sent up smoke
that blew across Malaysia and Singapore last year and earlier this
year.

Israel undecided whether the allow hijacked plane to land 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli officials said Tuesday they have
not decided whether to allow an Iberian Airlines plane hijacked
during a domestic flight in Spain to land in Tel Aviv, as requested
by the hijackers.
	   The Boing 727, which was on a flight between Sevilla and
Barcelona on Tuesday morning, was diverted to the eastern city of
Valencia.
	   More than a dozen children and elderly passengers were freed by
the hijackers in Valencia, and the hijackers demanded that the
plane be refueled. At one point, Iberia Airlines employees brought
food and water to the plane, Israel radio said.
	   Among the hostages aboard was the mayor of Sevilla, Soledad
Becerill, who was in contact with police through her mobile phone,
Ehud Gol, Israel's ambassador to Spain, told Israel radio. ``From
her reports, there appears to be only one hijacker,'' Gol said.
	   The identity of the hijacker or hijackers was not immediately
known, but Gol quoted police as saying that ``at least one hijacker
is definitely of Middle Eastern origin.''
	   Gol said one of the hijackers called himself Xavier Gomez.
	   Iberia Airlines officials in Israel said no Israelis were aboard
the hijacked plane, according to Israel army radio.
	   The hijackers first asked to be flown to Athens, and then to Tel
Aviv, but did not make demands, but Gol said they have not made any
other demands.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Israel had no first-hand information about the
hijacking and was not making special arrangements at Ben Gurion
International Airport near Tel Aviv.
	   No decision had been made on whether to allow the plane to land,
Bar-Illan said.
	   One Israeli official noted that the Spanish Prime Minister, Jose
Maria Aznar, was scheduled to arrive in Israel on June 26 for a
four-day visit to the Middle East that will take him to the
Palstinian Authority and Egypt, as well.
	   There was no indication if the hijacker's demand to come to
Israel was somehow connected with the planned visit, said the
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

Rebels abduct schoolgirls in northern Uganda 
</HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels raided a boarding high school in
northern Uganda over the weekend and abducted at least 40 girls,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The raid by the Lord's Resistance Army occurred Saturday at St.
Charles Lwanga Secondary School in Kalongo, about 400 kilometers
(248 miles) northeast of Kampala, the government-owned New Vision
said.
	   The rebels passed over the boys' dormitory and went straight to
the girls' dormitory where they forced the matron at gunpoint to
open it, the independent Monitor newspaper said.
	   The military spokesman was not available for comment, and his
aide said the army had no details.
	   ``The girls told us that there were 14 rebels,'' the Monitor
quoted a Defense Ministry spokesman as saying. ``They knew the name
of the matron and called her. When she came with the keys, they
opened the dormitory and took away those girls without firing a
bullet.''
	   The Guardian, another independent newspaper, said the rebels
abducted 39 girls. There was no explanation for the difference in
numbers.
	   The LRA rebels, who have been battling government troops for 11
years, routinely abduct both boys and girls from villages and
schools.
	   Both are given military training, but girls often become
``wives'' of rebel commanders.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch estimates that the
LRA has abducted between 8,000 and 10,000 children from northern
Uganda.
	   In October 1996, the LRA kidnapped 152 girls from St. Mary's
Roman Catholic school in northern Uganda. An Italian nun later
managed to convince the rebels to release 109 of the girls.
	   On May 21, the Ugandan government freed 42 Sudanese soldiers in
a deal they thought would secure the release of the remaining 21
girls. In the meantime, some had escaped and several had died.
	   Ugandan troops had captured the Sudanese soldiers when they
chased LRA rebels across the border into their haven in southern
Sudan.
	   On June 8 another rebel group, the Allied Democratic Forces,
attacked a training college near Kabarole (Fort Portal), 316
kilometers (196 miles) west of Kampala. When students refused to
come out, they set fire to three dormitories, killing at least 80
students.
	   Authorities say more than 100 students from the college are
missing and presumed abducted.
	   Both rebel groups are fighting to oust President Yoweri
Museveni, but have no known political programs. Uganda says Sudan
backs both groups, but Khartoum denies this.
	   Sudan also accuses Uganda of providing sanctuary and materiel to
rebels fighting in southern Sudan.

Indonesian president to meet Nobel prize winner on East Timor foreign minister 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from East Timorese bishop, Indonesian
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's new president and a Nobel
Peace Prize-winning critic from East Timor will debate the conflict
in the Indonesian-controlled territory on Wednesday.
	   President B.J. Habibie will meet Bishop Carlos Belo, a symbol of
opposition to Indonesian policy in the former Portuguese colony,
the government said Tuesday.
	   Habibie's decision to encourage talks on disputed East Timor is
a major shift from the intransigence of his authoritarian
predecessor, Suharto. However, a peaceful solution seems distant.
	   Indonesian forces invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a
year later. A small group of separatist rebels continues to fight
and many East Timorese want a vote on independence, which Habibie
has ruled out.
	   The search for the ``solution on the East Timor issue should be
handed to the people,'' the official Antara news agency quoted Belo
as saying.
	   Offering a deal on East Timor, Habibie has said he will release
jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao and grant special
status to the territory. In exchange, he said, the world community
must recognize Indonesian control.
	   Portugal and other critics of Indonesian policy have rejected
the suggestion, saying East Timorese should decide their political
future.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, a vigorous defender of Indonesian
control of East Timor, will attend the meeting between Belo and
Habibie at the presidential palace, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung
said.
	   Alatas said he was disappointed that Portugal and others had
disapproved of Indonesia's proposal of special status for East
Timor, which would entail some measure of autonomy.
	   ``Indonesia thinks the giving of special status to East Timor is
the most realistic solution,'' Antara quoted Alatas as saying.
	   Belo shared the Nobel prize in 1996 with East Timorese activist
Jose Ramos-Horta for their efforts to bring peace to their
homeland.
	   Habibie, who is pursuing an agenda of democratic reform, took
office May 21 after Suharto resigned amid political and economic
turmoil.

World Cup: Battle for 1st place in Group C to avoid Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A goalless draw would suit both France and
Denmark in their match here Wednesday. The host team would win
Group C and avoid Nigeria in the second round. Denmark would also
advance as the group runnerup.
	   Playing for a 0-0 tie seems a logical strategy, but both teams
claim they want none of such talk. Instead, each will play to win.
	   France has its reputation as a World Cup favorite to uphold and
does not want to upset that giddy momentum that has made Les Bleus
the idols of their countrymen.
	   ``We have to keep that competitive edge and winning spirit,''
said France's coach Aime Jacquet.
	   Against France's formidable attack, a Danish wait-and-see policy
would just be too risky.
	   ``We will not go for a 0-0 draw. That cannot be our objective,''
said Danish coach Bo Johansson.
	   France currently leads Group C with the maximum 6 points out of
2 games, ahead of Denmark, which has 4. South Africa has 1 point
and Saudi Arabia, already eliminated before Thursday's last
first-round game, has none.
	   A Danish loss combined with a big South African win could still
see the Africans through. But a Danish victory over France would
give the Scandinavians first place.
	   The second-place team in Group C will have to play Group D
winner Nigeria at Stade de France in Saint-Denis on Sunday, a task
any reasonable coach wants to avoid at that stage of the World Cup.
Brazil looms in the quarterfinals.
	   The Group C winner will face the Group D runnerup _ Spain,
Bulgaria or Paraguay _ which is considered a far easier task.
	   Denmark's chance of going through look brighter since French
star Zinedine Zidane was suspended for the match for kicking an
opponent last week. Furthermore, Jacquet is expected to sideline
several key players who already received a yellow card and could
risk suspension in the round of 16 if they received a second
warning.
	   ``The yellow cards worry me the most,'' said Jacquet. But he
warned that even without the quartet of starting defenders _
Laurent Blanc and Bixente Lizarazu and midfielders Didier Deschamps
and Emmanuel Petit _ France should hardly be underestimated.
	   ``Our team will be competitive and we will field the best
players for the occasion,'' he said.
	   Johansson needn't be warned. He is expected to reinforce the
wings to combat France's effective rushes from the sidelines.
``It's the defense that needs to be strengthened against the strong
French play on the wings,'' said Jacob Laursen, who could make a
return to the team for the decisive game.
	   Johansson could add a third forward to add thrust through the
center. With only one goal against outsiders Saudi Arabia and South
Africa, Denmark's offense has looked far from impressive.
	   If Johansson is considering changes to his team, so is Jacquet
by necessity.
	   His biggest problem is replacing Zidane, who will also miss the
round-of-16 game through suspension.
	   Jacquet is expected to turn to Robert Pires of Racing Metz to
fill in the gap and put Inter Milan star Youri Djorkaeff alongside
him.
	   In front of goal, Jacquet again has Stephane Guivarc'h again at
his disposal after the starting striker pulled up lame with an
injured left knee in the opening game.
	   Djorkaeff could be pulled into the center to provide authority
and help get balls to the two young forwards, Thierry Henry and
David Trezeguet, both 20.
	   Henry scored three goals in the first two games.
	   On top of that, Jacquet will be able to count on striker
Stephane Guivarc'h again. Guivarc'h was the starting World Cup
striker for France but he injured his left knee in the opening
stages of the first game.
	   Whatever happens, Zidane is convinced his World Cup role is far
from over.
	   ``I'll rejoin my colleagues in the quarterfinal,'' he said
confidently.

Philippine stocks end mixed as investors still cautious on Japan 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower; trims
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed Tuesday
as investors remained bearish toward Asian stocks in general on
continuing concerns over Japan's worsening economy, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, closed lower against the U.S. dollar, with
the market tensely looking for direction from the Japanese yen.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 6.17 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 1,695.86, following Monday's 2.9 percent fall.
	   Decliners, however, edged out gainers 53 to 40, and 38 issues
were unchanged.
	   Most blue-chip stocks, though, have reached oversold levels
following the index's 7.6 percent fall over the previous two
sessions. This has provided a few investors an opportunity to
accumulate fundamentally sound index issues, traders said.
	   Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said the market
isn't likely to rally in the near term. The volume of trades is
also expected to remain thin as investors hold back out of concern
over Japan's economy.
	   Bank stocks were hard hit Tuesday because of flag carrier
Philippine Airlines' serious debt problems. The airline last week
filed a rehabilitation plan with the Securities and Exchange
Commission due to mounting losses and nearly dlrs 2 billion in debt
it won't be able to service.
	   With the economy slowing down and the peso still weakening
against the dollar, traders feared more companies may be unable to
service their debts, hurting the banking sector.
	   The peso, meanwhile, fell against the dollar in heavy trading,
with strong demand for the U.S. currency because of continuing
concerns over Japan's weakening economy, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.329 pesos for the day, compared to
Monday's 41.235 pesos.
	   Traders noted that the financial problems of strike-hit
Philippine Airlines are having an adverse effect on foreign
investor sentiment.
	   They said regional markets are closely monitoring the Japanese
government's plans for dealing with its banking sector's problems.
	   Currency watchers believe that in the absence of positive news
out of Japan, the peso may test the sensitive level of 41.50 pesos
to the dollar Wednesday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger bus carrying pilgrims plunged off a
mountain road in the southern Russian republic of Ingushetia on
Tuesday, killing 12 people, a news agency reported.
	   The bus plummeted into a gorge, landing in the swift-moving Assa
river, hampering rescue operations, the Interfax news agency
reported, citing the Emergencies Ministry. Ten passengers were
still unaccounted for.
	   The bus was carrying villagers making a religious pilgrimage,
Interfax said.
	   Ambulance personnel and local residents were working at the
scene of the accident, near the village of Nizhny Alkun, about
1,400 kilometers (900 miles) south of Moscow, Interfax reported.

Asian crisis to hit Australian farmers, forecaster warns 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian farmers face big cuts in
their income because of the Asian economic crisis and falling
commodity prices, the government's agricultural commodities
forecaster said Tuesday.
	   The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
predicted in its latest forecast that local farm incomes will drop
by 20 percent in the 12 months to June 30, 1999.
	   ``The combined effects of the Asian financial downturn and lower
world grain prices points to a more subdued financial performance
from the farm sector in 1998-99,'' the agency said.
	   ``The net value of farm production is forecast to fall by 20
percent to U.S. dlrs 2 billion (3.3 billion Australian dollars) in
1998-99.''
	   Prices received by Australian farmers would fall 3 percent
overall during that period, the agency said.
	   It said prospects for Australia's wheat and wool returns have
deteriorated in recent months.
	   The bureau's director, Brian Fisher, was pessimistic about the
prospects of Australia's biggest export customer, Japan, which is
now in recession.
	   While the Japanese government's recently announced stimulus
package should stop the downward spiral of that country's economy,
it was unlikely to produce strong growth, Fisher said.
	   ``What it means is a very, very slow uptake of our
commodities,'' he said.

Social Democrats start efforts to form new Czech government 
</HEADLINE>
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Social Democratic leader Milos
Zeman prepared Tuesday for difficult talks with possible coalition
partners, a day after President Vaclav Havel asked him to try to
form a new government.
	   Zeman, winner of the country's early elections last weekend, is
expected to start formal negotiations with other party leaders on
Wednesday, Zeman's aide Karel Brezina said.
	   ``I will contact leaders of all parties that are represented in
the parliament,'' Brezina, who is organizing the talks, said.
	   Officials said the process of putting a new Czech government
together could take weeks.
	   Havel on Tuesday set July 7 as the date for the newly elected
lower chamber of Parliament to convene.
	   The Social Democrats captured the most votes and control 74
seats in the 200-seat legislature, but their chances to form a
majority government seem slim due to a lack of allies.
	   While Zeman seems to prefer a minority two-party government with
the Christian Democrats, their leader Josef Lux fears the Cabinet
could then fall hostage to the old-guard Communists, who have 24
seats in the parliament.
	   Lux's party also seems somewhat split over whose government it
should join, with some regional leaders clearly preferring a
center-right coalition.
	   ``If we form a coalition with the Social Democrats I'll leave
the party and I won't be alone,'' the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes
quoted Miloslav Macela, regional leader in east Bohemia, as saying.
	   Jan Ruml of the Freedom Union also has ruled out any coalition
with Zeman.
	   ``There are some possibilities to form a majority government,''
Finance Minister Ivan Pilip, of the Freedom Union, said in
Salzburg, Austria, where he is attending an economic forum. He said
the coalition will most probably be center-right.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts, Havel will likely ask the
election runner-up and former Premier Vaclav Klaus to attempt the
same.
	   ``The president has no intention to leave him (Klaus) out in
such case,'' Havel's adviser Jiri Pehe told Mlada Fronta Dnes.
	   Klaus' Civic Democratic Party won 63 seats in the parliament. He
was scheduled to hold talks with Lux and Ruml on Tuesday.

World Cup: Chilavert hopes for help against Eagles 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Paraguay 'keeper Jose Luis Chilavert is
exactly the type of player who would fit in on Nigeria's team:
flashy and yearning to attack.
	   And while Chilavert, much to his coach's chagrin, has provided
Paraguay's offensive highlight thus far at the World Cup, he'll
have to slow the Super Eagles at the other end Wednesday for his
team to advance to the round of 16.
	   Nigeria has nothing to play for at Toulouse's Municipal Stadium,
having already clinched first place in Group D with wins over Spain
and Bulgaria.
	   Nonetheless, coach Bora Milutinovic insists his side will play
as it always does _ with abandon.
	   ``Our players are so competitive, it doesn't matter who they are
playing against. They always play to their full potential and try
to win,'' Milutinovic said. ``They will push forward.''
	   When they do, coming in waves with potential scorers at almost
every spot in the lineup, they will have to beat Chilavert, whom
Milutinovic knows well.
	   The Yugoslav native had Chilavert's services for one season, in
1984, at Argentine club San Lorenzo.
	   ``People always ask me if he is the best goalkeeper. I don't
know if he is the best, but his mentality is incredible,''
Milutinovic said.
	   ``He is a leader. He helps the team.''
	   Chilavert, 32, has recorded two shutouts at France 98, but his
team failed to score in either match. Paraguay came closest to a
goal in 180 minutes of play against Spain and Bulgaria came when
Chilavert moved up to take a 25-meter (yard) free kick against
Bulgaria. It was a brilliantly curved strike that 'keeper Zdravko
Zdravkov barely tipped over the bar.
	   ``I hope he doesn't kick a free kick against us,'' Milutinovic
said. ``I know he'll prepare for one against us just to show how
good he is.''
	   Chilavert is never afraid to leave his line for a surprise run
and his 33 career goals are a record for 'keepers.
	   Paraguay coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani, a player for Brazil at
the 1974 World Cup, has been working to find another weapon,
lamenting ``our lack of goals.''
	   ``I am planning some changes to strengthen the offense,'' he
said. ``Sometimes it looks like our forwards get nervous in front
of the goal. We have speed but we need to add more.''
	   Carpeggiani has tested the all-new attack duo of Hugo Brizuela
and 19-year-old Cesar Ramirez in training sessions, while Miguel
Angel Benitez will stay as the playmaking link at midfield.
	   Paraguay has two points and is second in the group standings.
Spain and Bulgaria, facing off in Lens also on Wednesday, have one
point apiece. If that game ends in a draw, Paraguay would need only
a draw with Nigeria to reach the second round. Only four other
times has a country advanced with three draws.
	   Nigeria is without captain Uche Ukechukwu, a central defender,
who has received two yellow cards. Milutinovic indicated he will
sit out his players who already have one booking _ Victor Ikpeba,
Jay-Jay Okocha and Mutiu Adepoju _ to avoid risking suspension for
the second round.

Bangladesh unveils South Asia's longest bridge 
</HEADLINE>
By HASAN SAEED
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BHUAPUR, Bangladesh (AP) _ Cheered by thousands of villagers,
the Bangladeshi prime minister paid a toll and became the first
person to drive across South Asia's newest and longest bridge
Tuesday.
	   But the celebrations over the country's most ambitious
infrastructure project were dampened by complaints about the cost
of using the bridge.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina paid a 400-taka (dlrs 10) toll
before her car crossed the 4.8-kilometer (3-mile) Bangabandhu
Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge over the Jamuna, the world's fifth
largest river.
	   Many Bangladeshis, who earn an average of just dlrs 260 a year,
are complaining that the toll is too high. Bus owners have even
threatened to strike. The government has advised those who can't
afford to use the bridge to continue using ferries.
	   Bangladesh received a total of dlrs 600 million in loans from
the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese
government, which eventually will have to be repaid. The government
came up with another dlrs 300 million on its own to pay for the
bridge.
	   The bridge connects 30 million people in 16 underdeveloped
western districts who used to have to travel 12 to 36 hours using
road transport and river ferries to reach the national capital,
Dhaka, according to a statement by the World Bank. The bridge will
cut the time of that journey to a maximum of six hours.
	   ``This bridge will integrate Bangladesh's economy, commerce and
communications more than perhaps any other physical investment has
done,'' Pierre Landell-Mills, the World Bank representative in
Bangladesh, said in a statement.
	   Nearly 1.8 million workers, including 2,000 foreigners, worked
for nearly four years to complete the bridge, which also has two
railroad tracks and gas, power and telecommunication installations.
The World Bank said the bridge would tie Bangladesh's gas and power
networks into a national grid.
	   The bridge was designed and constructed by the Hyundai
Engineering Corporation of South Korea.
	   About 15,000 families had to be moved from homes along the shore
to make room for the bridge, the World Bank said. Households
affected by erosion and flooding around the bridge would be
compensated, it added.

Russia's economic crisis ``alarming'' Yeltsin says 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin told the Cabinet on
Tuesday that the difficult financial situation in Russia ``remains
alarming'' and that ``radical measures'' and a national consensus
are needed to restore order.
	   ``The price of foot-dragging and delays, squabbling and discord,
is too high,'' Yeltsin said as he opened an extraordinary meeting
prompted by Russia's economic crisis and this week's urgent
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
	   The meeting came three months to the day since Yeltsin
jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, saying it
had failed to improve Russia's economy and living conditions.
	   Since then, the Russian economy has only been battered further
by a slide in world oil prices, the financial crisis in Asia, and
scattered workers' protests, including the blockage of major rail
arteries last month.
	   Yeltsin said that the laws needed to set the government's
emergency economic program in motion should be passed before the
parliament breaks for the summer.
	   ``We don't have more time left, there is no other way,'' he
said, hinting that if parliament fails to act, he will push through
the reforms by decree.
	   ``Other measures will be taken,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin called on Russia's parties, national and regional
leaders, trade unions and entrepreneurs to unite in the name of the
national interest.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko set out _ for at least the fourth time
_ the state of Russia's economy and his plan for battling the
country's financial crunch.
	   He noted that over the past nine years, the share of Russia's
gross domestic product going to service the national debt has grown
to 44 percent. He said that this year, already 34 percent of the
nation's budget has gone to pay debt interest.
	   ``There is a clear threat of a new dangerous debt crisis, which
may develop into a new wave of aggravation of the general crisis of
the general economy,'' Kiriyenko's program said.
	   It said that as of June 1, the government owed 66.9 billion
rubles (dlrs 10.8 billion) in back wages.
	   Broadly speaking, Kiriyenko's plan comprises deep spending cuts
and sharply increased tax collection. It calls for budget revenues
to exceed spending by 2 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product, and for reducing spending by up to 42 billion rubles (dlrs
6.8 billion) a year.
	   The plan also includes government support for Russian exports,
debt rescheduling for industry, and shifting the tax burden to
consumers instead of producers. Interest rates should be lowered to
20 percent to 25 percent per annum, so that companies can afford
them, the program said.
	   Other measures include centralizing tax collection, reducing the
number of customs posts and creating a state company to oversee the
production of _ and revenues from _ liquor.
	   An IMF team arrived in Moscow on Monday night to negotiate terms
for the release of the latest, dlrs 670 million installment of an
existing loan to Russia, and conditions for the dlrs 10 billion to
dlrs 15 billion bailout Russia is seeking.
	   Both the fund and Russian officials have adopted hard stances.
The IMF last week said it was delaying the loan installment to
Russia because the government needs to take further steps to comply
with conditions for receiving the money.
	   The fund's demand that the government undertake land reform,
allowing for private ownership and unfettered sales of arable land,
has met vocal opposition from the hard-line lower chamber of
parliament. It's doubtful the government could overcome that
resistance.
	   A bigger question mark hovers over the fund's demand that Russia
split up its huge energy monopolies. Russia has so far resisted.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A petroleum-loaded train
collided with an empty tanker train early Tuesday, killing two
train employees in an explosion and shutting down traffic to
countries north of South Africa.
	   Spoornet spokesman Johan Hugo said a train loaded with diesel,
petrol and paraffin on its way to Zimbabwe from South Africa
collided with an empty train returning to Johannesburg.
	   The accident happened near Nylstroom, about 175 kilometers (110
miles) northeast of Johannesburg.
	   The driver and assistant in the fully loaded train died, while
the two men on the other train were treated for shock.
	   Hugo said the northbound line would be closed for the rest of
Tuesday.

IRA dissidents blamed for roadside bomb near Northern Ireland border 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A bomb exploded beneath a
roadway Tuesday, leaving a 20-foot-long (6-meter-long) crater but
missing the intended target of a passing British army foot patrol,
police said.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, but police and politicians
blamed Irish Republican Army dissidents opposed to the peace
process.
	   The blast caused no injuries and broke windows in a pub nearby
on the crossroads of Drumintee, South Armagh, a traditional hotbed
of IRA activity along Northern Ireland's border with the Irish
Republic.
	   A single-wing spotter plane circled slowly overhead as part of a
joint police and army search operation.
	   The early-morning explosion came two days before Northern
Ireland's voters elect a new 108-seat legislative Assembly, the
central plank of the April 10 peace agreement struck by the British
and Irish governments and eight parties.
	   The reputed commander of the breakaway group _ dubbed the
``Real'' IRA by local media _ lives in Dundalk, immediately across
the border from South Armagh. The dissidents have been blamed for
several car-bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and explosives finds
in the border area.
	   The breakaway group was last implicated in undermining the IRA's
July 1997 truce when Irish police stopped two stolen cars,
containing about 1,000 pounds (450 kgs) of homemade explosives, on
May 23 _ the day that results came in on an Ireland-wide referendum
to ratify the Belfast agreement.
	   The two men driving each of the cars were arrested and are being
held without bail awaiting trial on charges of conspiring to cause
explosions. Their cars were stopped on the southern side of the
border within 3 miles (5 kms) of Tuesday's blast.

World Cup: Distractions galore in South Africa-Saudia Arabia clash 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ The World Cup clash Wednesday between
South Africa and Saudi Arabia is contest of competing distractions.
	   In the past week, the winless Saudis fired coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira and sent home several delegation members, while South
Africa suspended two players for the rest of the tournament for
partying all night.
	   Both sides have since spent most of the time talking about
everything but playing each other.
	   The game means more to the South Africans, who still have a thin
chance of advancing to the second round of their first World Cup.
	   After losing 3-0 to France and drawing 1-1 with Denmark, they
need a multi-goal victory over the Saudis. They also need France to
defeat Denmark just as convincingly, allowing South Africa to pull
even with the Danes on points and overcome the current four-goal
deficit in scoring.
	   The Saudis have lost both matches so far _ 1-0 to Denmark and
4-0 to France _ and cannot advance. The disappointment of exiting
early after reaching the second round of Saudi Arabia's first World
Cup in 1994 resulted in Parreira's sudden dismissal Saturday.
	   ``We are eliminated from the championship so we don't have all
that pressure on us,'' said Mohammed al-Khuraishi, an assistant who
took over as coach. ``However, we hope to give our best for this
match.''
	   Saudi Arabia will be missing Mohammed al-Khilaiwi, who is
suspended for his red card in the first half against France. The
players say they also will miss Parreira, a Brazilian who coached
his country to the championship four years ago and has a lengthy
history in the Middle East.
	   ``He's a great coach who knows what to do in a given
situation,'' said striker Saeed al-Owairan, who was substituted by
Parreira in both matches so far.
	   South African coach Philippe Troussier also has missing player
problems. Starting midfielder Brendan Augustine of Lask Linz and
reserve Naughty Mokoena have been sent home for staying out all
Saturday night, and another midfielder, Alfred Phiri of Vanspor
F.C., is serving a three-game ban for his red card against Denmark.
	   In addition, striker Phil Masinga of Bari is out with a bad
ankle, leaving South Africa with 18 players, three of them
goalkeepers.
	   ``We need three substitutes and we have maybe five. I think
that's enough,'' Troussier said, adding that speedy VfL Bochum
midfielder Delron Buckley could take the starting spot of the
suspended Augustine.
	   ``I want us to attack, maybe take some risks at the back,'' he
said, in part because he thinks the Saudis will adopt different
tactics under al-Khuraishi.
	   ``Under Parreira they played a more defensive style. Now they
will push forward,'' Troussier said. ``I'm expecting a very tough
game.''
	   Even before the suspensions of Augustine and Mokoena, South
African players sounded like they were looking past the Saudis to a
possible second-round showdown with rival Nigeria. The Nigerians
have won Group D and would face the Group C runner-up in the next
round.
	   ``Actually we've been talking about both games. We know that if
we beat Saudi Arabia, then we have a chance to play Nigeria,'' said
midfielder Helman Mkhalele of Kaiseryspor, whose darting runs gave
Denmark trouble last week.
	   ``We know that to play a team without a coach is very difficult.
They will be very motivated,'' Mkhalele said. ``And they don't have
a point. They will want to get a point.''

Asian stock markets close lower 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Tuesday, with
shares slumping in Tokyo as investors remained nervous about the
Japanese government's ability to boost the country's faltering
economy.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 254.49 points, or
1.66 percent, closing at 15,054.60. On Monday, the Nikkei had
gained 41.11 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The Japanese government was expected to begin announcing soon
details of its plan to tackle the sagging economy by cleaning up
bad debt problems at banks.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with a plan by July 8 for a ``bridge bank'' to handle
bad loans.
	   ``People are still nervous about the Liberal Democratic Party's
ability to come up with a plan'' to deal with the problem, said Jon
Yang, a salesman in the futures and options group at Jardine
Fleming Securities.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 137.75 yen in late
afternoon, down 0.79 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below
its late New York rate of 138.16 yen overnight.
	   South Korean shares also tumbled, with the key index falling 2.6
percent on unconfirmed talk that the government will soon list
shares of state-owned Korea Telecom.
	   Analysts said a listing of the company's shares would be
expected to further hurt the bearish stock market because it would
sharply increase stock supply in an already oversupplied market.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index
fell 7.96 points to 303.31.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly higher, a day after
the government announced a multibillion-dollar package to boost the
territory's sagging economy.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 15.46 points, or 0.1 percent, closing at 8,219.67. On Monday,
the index had slumped 387,70 points, or 4.5 percent.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower, with brokers saying
that investors were gloomy about the region's economic prospects.
The key Straits Times Industrial Index fell 1.5 percent, or 16.20
points, to 1,082.25.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower in cautious
trading. The benchmark Composite Index slipped 0.36 points to
457.25.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on continued profit-taking.
The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 59.55 points, or
0.77 percent, to 7,633.36.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The NZSE-40
Capital Index rose 11.37 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,953.68.
	   MANILA: Shares closed mixed as investors remained cautious in
the absence of significant news to provide direction. The 30-share
Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 6.17 points, or 0.4 percent,
to 1,695.86, following Monday's 2.9 percent fall.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed mostly lower, having
stagnated for much of the afternoon session. The All Ordinaries
Index fell 14.2 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,582.60.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower in thin trading. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 1.84 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 274.06.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed mixed. The Composite Index rose
2.426 points, or 0.5 percent, to 423.085.

Rebels abduct schoolgirls in northern Uganda 
</HEADLINE>
BC-Uganda-Girls Abducted
By HENRY WASSWA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels raided a boarding high school in
northern Uganda over the weekend and abducted at least 40 girls,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The raid by the Lord's Resistance Army occurred Saturday at St.
Charles Lwanga Secondary School in Kalongo, about 400 kilometers
(248 miles) northeast of Kampala, the government-owned New Vision
said.
	   The rebels passed over the boys' dormitory and went straight to
the girls' dormitory where they forced the matron at gunpoint to
open it, the independent Monitor newspaper said.
	   The military spokesman was not available for comment, and his
aide said the army had no details.
	   ``The girls told us that there were 14 rebels,'' the Monitor
quoted a Defense Ministry spokesman as saying. ``They knew the name
of the matron and called her. When she came with the keys, they
opened the dormitory and took away those girls without firing a
bullet.''
	   The Guardian, another independent newspaper, said the rebels
abducted 39 girls. There was no explanation for the difference in
numbers.
	   The LRA rebels, who have been battling government troops for 11
years, routinely abduct both boys and girls from villages and
schools.
	   Both are given military training, but girls often become
``wives'' of rebel commanders.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch estimates that the
LRA has abducted between 8,000 and 10,000 children from northern
Uganda.
	   In October 1996, the LRA kidnapped 152 girls from St. Mary's
Roman Catholic school in northern Uganda. An Italian nun later
managed to convince the rebels to release 109 of the girls.
	   On May 21, the Ugandan government freed 42 Sudanese soldiers in
a deal they thought would secure the release of the remaining 21
girls. In the meantime, some had escaped and several had died.
	   Ugandan troops had captured the Sudanese soldiers when they
chased LRA rebels across the border into their haven in southern
Sudan.
	   On June 8 another rebel group, the Allied Democratic Forces,
attacked a training college near Kabarole (Fort Portal), 316
kilometers (196 miles) west of Kampala. When students refused to
come out, they set fire to three dormitories, killing at least 80
students.
	   Authorities say more than 100 students from the college are
missing and presumed abducted.
	   Both rebel groups are fighting to oust President Yoweri
Museveni, but have no known political programs. Uganda says Sudan
backs both groups, but Khartoum denies this.
	   Sudan also accuses Uganda of providing sanctuary and materiel to
rebels fighting in southern Sudan.

	   Earlier 18 people had been released by the hijacker, most of
them children. The remaining passengers, including Seville Mayor
Soledad Becerril, and the crew left the plane immediately after the
hijacker gave himself up.
	   The plane was diverted to Valencia's Manises airport in eastern
Spain and cordoned off by police in an isolated part of the airport
after it landed at 8:40 a.m. (0640GMT).
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Delgado was unwilling to confirm

Bookies offering odds on Hoddle's replacement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Odds on who would become Glenn Hoddle's successor
were posted less than 12 hours after England's 2-1 World Cup loss
to Romania.
	   British bookmakers William Hill on Tuesday installed
Middlesbrough boss Bryan Robson as 2-1 favorite to take over as
England manager.
	   Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson is second favourite at 4-1, Kevin
Keegan third at 5-1 and former England manager Terry Venables
fourth at 10-1.
	   The first foreign managers in the running are Ruud Gullit and
Arsene Wenger, both at 33-1. Deposed World Cup squad member Paul
Gascoigne is the outsider at 1,000-1.
	   Glenn Hoddle is only half way through a four-year contract but
William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said Hoddle would lose his job
if England failed to make it through the group stage.
	   England remains a 1-6 chance to progress to the next round but
the odds on England winning the World Cup slumped from 10-1 before
the loss to Romania to 14-1 after the game.
	   Rival bookmaker Ladbrokes have basically dismissed England as a
chance, offering 33-1 on England winning the World Cup. England was
8-1 fifth-favorite to win before losing to Romania.
	   William Hill makes Scotland 4-7 favourites to qualify for the
second stage and 7-2 to miss out.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Tuesday, with
shares slumping in Tokyo as investors remained nervous about the
Japanese government's ability to boost the country's faltering
economy. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 254.49 points,
or 1.66 percent, closing at 15,054.60. The Japanese government was

Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with a plan by July 8 for a ``bridge bank'' to handle
bad loans. Elsewhere, shares also fell in South Korea, Singapore,
Taiwan, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia. Shares rose in Hong Kong
and New Zealand. Shares closed mixed in the Philippines and
Indonesia. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Talks among Pacific-Rim trade ministers
appeared stalled Tuesday by Japan's insistence that it be given
more ``flexibility'' in opening its markets to free trade. With the
backdrop of the year-long Asian crisis ever present, the 18 members
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum took up for a second
day a formidable plan to begin liberalizing trade in nine
industries by next year. New Zealand's Trade Minister Lockwood
Smith said Japan was holding up finalization of the liberalization
pact, known as early voluntary sector liberalization, which
ministers were expected to sign off on in time for APEC's November
summit in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. Delegates to the
talks said the ministers were now considering several options,
including a plan to defer the plan for three months, since Japan
appeared reluctant to compromise. (MALAYSIA-OPEC)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials rallied behind one of the
nation's largest lenders Tuesday, hoping to calm investors in what
is fast becoming a major test of how effectively Japan can handle a
bad-debt crisis looming over its banking system. Shares of
Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd., which is saddled with more than 1.4
trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans, rebounded Tuesday
after Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga and other top financial
officials expressed confidence in the bank's ability to stay
afloat. Matsunaga stressed that LTCB's individual depositors and
institutional investors are fully protected. Analysts said the
government will likely do whatever is necessary to prevent its
collapse, including arranging a merger or providing short-term
loans. (JAPAN-BANK RESCUE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin told the Cabinet on
Tuesday that the difficult financial situation in Russia ``remains
alarming'' and that ``radical measures'' and a national consensus
are needed to restore order. ``The price of foot-dragging and
delays, squabbling and discord, is too high,'' Yeltsin said as he
opened an extraordinary meeting prompted by Russia's economic
crisis and this week's urgent negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund. The meeting came three months to the day since
Yeltsin jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,
saying it had failed to improve Russia's economy and living
conditions. Since then, the Russian economy has only been battered
further by a slide in world oil prices, the financial crisis in
Asia, and scattered workers' protests, including the blockage of
major rail arteries last month. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers agree they need to pump
less oil to try to improve the depressed price, but they were at
odds Tuesday over how to get the job done. Analysts say OPEC needs
to slash output by more than the 620,000 barrels a day already
promised. OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria
acknowledged Tuesday that changes may be necessary, but he would
not elaborate. ``You're jumping the gun,'' Lukman told reporters as
more ministers arrived for the meeting that formally opens
Wednesday. ``They haven't even had time to discuss the matter.''
OPEC is confronting the lowest oil prices since the disastrous year
of 1986 _ thanks to the group's ill-judged decision to produce more
crude in the winter, just as the southeast Asia economic crisis
started killing the growth in global demand. (OPEC)

Italian chamber debates NATO expansion; vote is touch-and-go president, Chamber in recess until after Italy-Austria World Cup game; other new material 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: updates throughout with opposition asking to meet with
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi called on lawmakers to put
aside partisan differences and endorse NATO's eastward expansion,
but his chances of winning ratification were murky as Tuesday's
vote neared.
	   ``We cannot reply with a refusal to this request from from
eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he said, asking the entire Chamber
of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the name of the Italian people.''
	   Prodi appeared to be lacking the opposition support he needed
for ratification in the hours leading upt to the vote.
	   His center-left government was forced to reach out to the
opposition because its usual ally, the Communists, oppose NATO's
expansion into Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
	   The chamber had been expected to vote at midday, but decided at
the last minute to take a lengthy break. It was scheduled to resume
around 1600 gmt, after the Italy-Austria World Cup game.
	   The government appeared to secure the support it needed Monday
night when the center-right opposition decided to vote for NATO
enlargement.
	   But opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, a media mogul and
former premier, also called for Prodi to resign, saying a
government that needs opposition help on such a crucial foreign
policy issue lacks the backing to continue governing.
	   In his address to the Chamber of Deputies Tuesday, Prodi
rejected Berlusconi's call. ``The NATO vote doesn't put the
majority at stake; the government will go on with its program,'' he
said.
	   The reaction was swift and harsh.
	   Opposition whip Beppe Pisanu blasted Prodi for his ``arrogant
challenge'' and said the center-right might now vote against
ratification. The opposition alliance asked for a meeting Tuesday
with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who acts as a political
mediator.
	   If the center-right fails to back NATO expansion Prodi would
have to round up centrist votes. His prospects for getting them
were unclear.
	   Despite the parliamentary fireworks, the NATO spat did d#E0IM4*e
membership candidates.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin told the Cabinet on
Tuesday that the difficult financial situation in Russia ``remains
alarming'' and that ``radical measures'' and a national consensus
are needed to restore order. ``The price of foot-dragging and
delays, squabbling and discord, is too high,'' Yeltsin said as he
opened an extraordinary meeting prompted by Russia's economic
crisis and this week's urgent negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund. The meeting came three months to the day since
Yeltsin jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,
saying it had failed to improve Russia's economy and living

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish hijacker holding more than 100
people hostage aboard an Iberia flight on Tuesday gave himself up
to police after a nearly four-hour standoff, authorities said. The
hijacker, who was not immediately identified, was described by an
interior ministry spokesman as mentally unstable. Iberia Flight
1121 was carrying 131 people when it was hijacked Tuesday during a
flight between Seville and Barcelona. The Boeing 727 was diverted
to the eastern city of Valencia, where it landed without incident
and 18 children and adults were released about two hours later. The
hijacked airplane landed at Valencia's Manises airport at 8:40 a.m.
(0640 GMT), apparently to begin refueling, a police spokesman said.
The plane was surrounded by security forces, however, and was not
being refueled, Israel radio reported, monitoring Spanish TV.
(SPAIN-HIJACK)
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ A captured North Korean submarine
sank Tuesday as it was being towed into this naval base by a South
Korean warship. The fate of its crew was unclear. The small
submarine, already mostly submerged and listing badly, broke away
from one of two tow ropes and went nose down in the harbor, a
military spokesman said. Earlier sonar scans of the submarine's
hull showed no signs of life inside, the national news agency
Yonhap reported, but the navy never got the vessel to a pier for a
closer examination. Maj. Kim Jong-woo said it sank about a
kilometer (mile) off shore. South Korean officials said the sub was
captured Monday after its periscope and propeller got caught in a
fishing net about 10 miles east of Sokcho, a town just south of the
North Korean border. (SKOREA-SUBMARINE)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat arrived in the
Balkans on Tuesday with what could be a final warning for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic before NATO takes steps to try to end
the fighting in Kosovo. The visit by Richard Holbrooke, a
troubleshooter for the region and the next U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, was seen as a last diplomatic effort to get
Milosevic to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the
secessionist Serbian province. Western nations, who sent NATO jets
buzzing over the region in a warning to Milosevic earlier this
month, have been deliberating on what measures they will take if
Milosevic refuses. Holbrooke stopped in neighboring Macedonia en
route to Belgrade for talks with Milosevic later Tuesday, meeting
in the capital Skopje with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and
President Kiro Gligorov. He also was expected to meet with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China wants U.S. President Bill Clinton to
reaffirm publicly that the United States will abide by commitments
not to sell Taiwan advanced weapons, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said Tuesday. ``The president should, at an appropriate occasion,
make a public statement reiterating what the U.S. has already
promised on the Taiwan question,'' Tang said at a pre-summit news
conference. ``The U.S. side should also indicate it will take
concrete actions to match the commitment it has made with deeds.''
China also would like to see the United States lift sanctions
imposed by Washington after the 1989 military suppression of
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, in which hundreds, if
not thousands, of civilians died. Given the scant progress on other
issues, a public pledge by Clinton on Taiwan appears to be the only
concrete measure China expects from the summit with President Jiang
Zemin on Saturday in Beijing. (CHINA-US)

High-speed rail link to Heathrow airport opens 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ High-speed trains began carrying passengers
between central London and Heathrow airport Tuesday, offering an
alternative to congested highways and slow-moving Underground
trains.
	   ``It's a stunning service,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said as
he officially opened the 17-mile (27-kms), 450-million-pound (dlrs
750 million) Heathrow Express service.
	   It offers trains every 15 minutes between Heathrow and
Paddington station, with top speeds of 160 kph (100 mph) during the
15-minute journey.
	   BAA PLC, the company which operates Heathrow, says it hopes that
the service will attract 7 million passengers per year within three
years.
	   Heathrow was the last of London's major airports to get rail
service to London, although it is connected to the London
Underground system. Gatwick airport is served by two rail lines
from south London, and the new Stansted airport also has frequent
train service from Liverpool St. station.
	   ``The Heathrow Express will transform people's first impressions
of London. We don't want their first experience to be the worst
aspects of Tube travel,'' Blair said, referring to the Underground
service.

	   Police contacted his psychiatrist in Seville who flew to

Izetbegovic wants Dayton implemented, or changed 
</HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Muslim president
Alija Izetbegovic said in comments published Tuesday that he wants
the Dayton peace agreement either fully implemented, or revised.
	   If Bosnian Serb and Croat hard-liners again triumph in September
elections, Bosnia's Muslims ``will rightfully request either the
total implementation of the Dayton peace agreement or its
alteration to ensure the proper functioning of the state,''
Izetbegovic told the Sarajevo daily Vecernje Novine.
	   Izetbegovic, leader of Bosnia's Muslims throughout the 1992-5
war, said he was aware how difficult it would be to undo the treaty
he helped negotiate in Dayton, Ohio in late 1995.
	   But his request reflects growing Bosnian and international
impatience at the continuing staying power of hard-liners.
	   Izetbegovic's Muslim party shares federal power with the Bosnian
Serb Democratic Party and the Croatian Democratic Union, both of
whom would rather see the country divided. Bosnia was partioned by
Dayton into two halves, a Bosnian Serb half, and a Muslim-Croat
half. A three-person executive _ Muslim, Serb and Croat _ rules the
whole state.
	   Izetbegovic's side was long the only one in power which
supported a unified country.
	   Last January, Milorad Dodik, an open supporter of Dayton, gained
power in the Bosnian Serb Republic.
	   Kresimir Zubak, Croat member of the presidency, has now turned
his back on the policy of division, forming his own party that is
likely to be more supportive of unifying the country.
	   If Dodik and Zubak win backing at September elections, there is
a chance for real peace in Bosnia, Izetbegovic said. If not, the
Muslims will not tolerate it, he added.
	   ``We will surely not accept matters remaining unresolved and
half-way down the road. We have enough jokers not to consent to
anything like that,'' he told the newspaper. Izetbegovic did not
reveal what he meant by ``jokers.''
	   Foreigners too, particularly Americans, want to see change and
``some kind of end to their presence in Bosnia,'' he added. ``We
think the condition for their departure is the arrival in power of
political forces that accept Bosnia as a united and democratic
country.''

World Cup: Spain tries to save face, Bulgaria looks to settle a score 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ For 65 years Bulgaria has had a score to
settle with Spain. On Wednesday when the two meet in Group D's
do-or-die battle, it has a perfect chance to take revenge.
	   Back in 1933, Spain set its highest scoring record by riddling
Bulgaria 13-0 when the two met for the first time ever. In Lens,
they meet on a more equal footing, both threatened with an
embarrassing first-round elimination if they lose.
	   Bulgaria, goes into the game at the bottom of the group with one
point and not a single goal scored.
	   Spain, also with one point, has the added burden of a decimated
morale following two World Cup disappointments _ a 3-2 defeat by
Nigeria and a scoreless tie with Paraguay. These results crashed
with pre-tournament expectations that the side might even make a
serious challenge for the trophy itself.
	   ``I'm convinced we will beat Bulgaria and start all over
again,'' said Spanish midfielder Guillermo Amor.
	   Both sides will have to keep one eye on how No. 2 Paraguay, with
two points, fares against group winner Nigeria in their game in
Toulouse the same day.
	   A victory for the South Americans would see them through to the
second round as runnerup to Nigeria, while a defeat would open the
door for the winner of the Spain-Bugaria match. Spain could also
qualify with a draw.
	   But no one is likely to take greater delight from sending Spain
packing than Bulgaria's pugnacious star Hristo Stoichkov, a former
ace with FC Barcelona.
	   At 32, Stoichkov and many of his teammates are most likely
playing their last World Cup and will be gunning to go out with a
bang from this the team's seventh tournament appearance.
	   A sturdy but swift-footed left winger, Stoichkov shared the
leading scorer ranking in the the 1994 World Cup with six goals
that helped Bulgaria reach an all-time high finish of fourth.
	   But so far neither he nor his colleagues, many of them 1994
veterans like striker Emil Kostadinov, 30, and key playmaker
Krassimir Balakov 32, have found the net in a 0-0 tie with Paraguay
and a 1-0 loss to Nigeria.
	   ``Our problem is with scoring,'' said coach Hristo Bonev. ``But
we will resolve that against the Spaniards.''
	   Known for his provocative character, Stoichkov has also been at
the center of a war of words with Spain in recent weeks as he
scoffed at his former colleagues' chances of a berth in the second
round.
	   Wednesday's game also comes in the wake of Bonev's decision to
impose harsh financial sanctions on Stoichkov and Lyuboslav Penev,
for not attending a training session Monday.
	   Spain goes into the game aware that elimination will cast the
side and coach Javier Clemente into disgrace for a long time to
come.
	   With a record of just one loss in 34 games prior to France,
something just hasn't clicked for the Spaniards so far in France.
Young stars such as Real Madrid's Raul Gonzalez have shown only a
flicker of their potential, while normally dependable old timers
like goalkeeper and captain Andoni Zubizarreta appear unsure of
themselves.
	   The players have been stung by the storm of criticism and in
recent days have retreated into a shell in mutual solidarity.
Wednesday will tell whether the taunts from the press and the likes
of Stoichkov will sink the team further or unleash some raging bull
inside.
	   ``Fortune is all we're missing,'' said defender Rafael Alkorta.
``We can't give much more. We've played our hearts out and have
been superior to both opponents. Against Bulgaria we will give it
all again.''

Taiwan reminds Washington of economic importance 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Wary of the impending U.S.-China summit,
the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that U.S. President Bill Clinton
should remember Taiwan's importance to the American economy before
making any concessions over the island.
	   Taiwan imports almost twice as much from America as does China,
supporting 810,000 jobs in the United States, Vice Foreign Minister
David Lee told reporters.
	   That is four times the number of jobs that China claims its
economy is responsible for creating in the United States.
	   ``Whether you consider democracy, freedom, human rights, or
economic markets, Taiwan is America's true friend,'' Lee said.
``China's future remains to be seen.''
	   Taiwan imported more than dlrs 23 billion worth of U.S. products
in 1997, nearly double the amount of 10 years ago. Chinese imports
from the United States were less than dlrs 13 billion.
	   Lee claimed even China's much-vaunted market for American
passenger jets still lags behind Taiwan's. Taiwanese airlines
bought U.S. dlrs 4.1 billion of American planes over the last two
years, a billion dollars more than China, Lee said.
	   In Clinton's June 27-28 summit with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, Beijing is expected to seek U.S. commitments not to sell
Taiwan advanced weaponry.
	   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province to be reunited with
the mainland by force if necessary, and cites arms sales to the
island as a major irritant in relations with Washington. Though it
doesn't recognize the government in Taipei, Washington maintains
strong unofficial relations and is Taiwan's main arms supplier.
	   Taipei says the United States has assured it Clinton will not
backtrack on support for Taiwan. But the government has promised to
protest loudly any agreement between the sides perceived as harming
Taiwan's interests.
	   While Washington has been frustrated in attempts to open wider
China's market for imports, Taiwan has reduced its trade deficit
with the United States and agreed to lower tariffs in preparation
for joining the World Trade Organization.

is fast becoming a major test of how effectively Japan can handle a
bad-debt crisis looming over its banking system.
	   Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd., which is saddled with more
than 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans, rebounded
Tuesday after Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga and other top
financial officials expressed confidence in the bank's ability to
stay afloat.
	   Matsunaga stressed that LTCB's depositors and investors are
fully protected. But he added, ``We welcome any plan that the bank
takes to strengthen its operations.''
	   Analysts said the government will likely do whatever is
necessary to prevent its collapse, including arranging a merger or
providing short-term loans. LTCB is so big that its failure could
shatter the already fragile faith Japanese depositors have in their
banks.
	   ``The Ministry of Finance's first priority is to ensure the
smooth functioning of the financial system _ that's what is coming
into question right now,'' said James Fiorillo, senior analyst with
ING Barings Securities. Ltd.
	   LTCB is a major player _ it was listed as the world's 22nd
largest bank by Forbes magazine.
	   But worries about its ability to survive have swelled as Japan,
slogging through its worst recession in decades, has come under
pressure to move more aggressively to fix its financial system.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government is planning to set
up a government-run ``bridge bank'' to clean up bad loans.
	   Its main function would be to finally get rid of banks' bad
loans and sell off any collateral.
	   The new institution would also extend loans to the healthy
clients of banks that fail, Hashimoto said.
	   Analysts said that's important because even strong companies may
have trouble finding a lender amid the current credit crunch.
	   ``What we have to do is to stabilize the financial system. We
need to strengthen sound banks,'' the prime minister said.
	   Hashimoto's party has pledged to announce its plan in two weeks,
but Finance Ministry officials appear hesitant.
	   ``There are still many details to be worked out, such as how to
prevent losses from new loans and where to get the funds for the
bank,'' Administrative Vice Finance Minister Koji Tanami said
Monday.
	   Investors fear greater determination by the government to clean
up the bad-loan mess may mean it will let more weak banks fail _
and the Long-Term Credit Bank has become a focus of their concern.
	   Bank officials have vehemently denied rumors that the bank is on
the verge of collapse, but concerns over its stability ballooned
after Moody's Investors Services lowered its credit rating Thursday
to B1 from Ba1. Both are considered speculative grades.
	   A low rating is especially damaging to a credit bank like LTCB
because it raises money by selling bonds instead of taking
deposits.
	   On Monday, LTCB shares plunged 45 percent, to 62 yen (45 U.S.
cents), before trading was halted by exchange rules that limit
declines.
	   The stock recovered slightly Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen.
	   LTCB, which has 3,600 employees and 28 trillion (dlrs 203
billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks established at the
end of World War II to rebuild Japan's economy by providing
long-term loans for industry.
	   But the banks' role has been largely lost as more companies turn
directly to stock and bond markets for funds.
	   And though LTCB's bad loans are just a fraction of the stunning
76 trillion yen (dlrs 550 billion) held by all Japanese banks, it
is being seen as a test of how the government will handle the
crisis.
	   So far, officials have voiced strong support.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka said the Bank of Japan
would provide ``full support'' if Long-Term Credit Bank had
difficulty raising funds.
	   Financial authorities customarily have orchestrated buyouts of
troubled banks by stronger institutions as a way of avoiding the
turmoil of an outright failure.
	   But it's not clear whether that custom still holds. Last week,
the Finance Ministry said any possible mergers were for banks to
decide on their own.
	   Investors are well aware of what can happen when the government
keeps its distance.
	   In November, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd., the largest Japanese
bank to fail, went under with 5,400 employees and 8.5 trillion yen
(dlrs 62 billion) in assets.

Palestinians complain to Security Council about house demolitions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The PLO has complained to the U.N. Security
Council about Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes, a
Palestinian lawmaker said Tuesday.
	   Israel routinely demolishes Palestinian homes built without
licenses in Jerusalem and West Bank areas still under Israeli
control.
	   The Palestinians say Israel rarely grants construction licenses
to Palestinians and that those with expanding families are forced
to build without obtaining permission.
	   The United States has urged Israel to refrain from demolishing
homes, but the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
ignored the appeal.
	   Palestinian legislator Salah Taamari said the PLO has asked the
U.N. Security Council to discuss the house demolitions as part of a
debate on Israel's plan to expand Jerusalem. Under that plan,
Israel would extend Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
	   ``Netanyahu is pushing the area towards an explosion. We have
done everything possible to stop these house demolitions. We have
objected both in the international community and in the streets,''
Taamari said. ``All we can do is to protest once more to the
international community.''
	   On Monday, Israeli bulldozers razed the home of 37-year-old
Mustafa Dadean on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, leaving
eight people homeless.
	   ``I will start to rebuild the house again because this is the
way we have of confronting the Israeli authorities,'' Dadean said.

EU to await vote to determine whether Cambodian polls fair made after elections if they're fair. ADDS byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with EU observer saying judgment will be
By ROBIN McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Acknowledging intimidation of
potential voters by authorities, the chief European Union observer
to Cambodia's elections said Tuesday that he will not decide ahead
of time whether they will be free or fair.
	   However, an independent watchdog group said earlier that
``serious and widespread'' violations of the voter registration
process showed the polls were likely to be compromised.
	   The state of Cambodia's electoral climate is becoming more
critical as official campaigning for the July 26 polls opens
Thursday. The opposition says the process is rigged in favor of
strongman Hun Sen and little is being done about it.
	   Sven Linder, chief EU observer, told reporters that he was aware
of ``a number of incidents of intimidation, mainly by village
chiefs and local authorities.''
	   Linder also said Hun Sen's government should take steps to find
and punish the perpetrators of about 100 political killings since
he overthrew his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
bloody coup last year.
	   But Linder said that the European Union, which is helping fund
elections that look certain to be won by Hun Sen, will not pass
judgment on the process until it is over.
	   The EU has ``in no way made any foregone conclusions,'' Linder
said. ``If violence, murders continue, if nothing concrete is done
about impunity, that will obviously influence my assessment.''
	   The Foreign Ministry in neighboring Thailand proposed that Thai
authorities start registering some of the 55,000 Cambodian refugees
on Thai soil to encourage them to return home and vote. Most are
the families of Khmer Rouge remnants who are fighting government
forces. Thailand was awaiting a green light from Phnom Penh.
	   Earlier, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia
said that while it was encouraged by a high voter registration _
the government has said about 95 percent of eligible voters have
signed up _ ``many concerns remain.''
	   Village leaders, commune chiefs and government officials loyal
to Hun Sen's ruling party were at almost all registration stations,
``directly interfering with the registration process,'' COMFREL
said in a statement.
	   Uniformed police and army officials _ also loyal to Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party _ were seen loitering within 200 meters
(yards) of the stations.
	   Registration officials often demonstrated a lack of training,
procedures were often unorganized or chaotic, and many prospective
voters were denied an opportunity to register their names.
	   COMFREL observers noted that they were themselves often
threatened or intimidated.
	   Hun Sen's coup shattered his tense co-premiership with
Ranariddh, which resulted from a multibillion-dollar U.N.-sponsored
election safeguarded by 20,000 peacekeepers in 1993.
	   No such huge operation is envisaged this time. U.N. and other
international assistance is limited to observers and technical aid.
	   The European Union, which is contributing more than dlrs 11
million, has said it believes minimum conditions for credible polls
are in place.
	   Critics say foreign countries, tired of Cambodia's woes, are
prepared to go along with the vote no matter what happens.

Yeltsin signs cooperation agreements with Angolan president 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos made his
first visit to Russia in a decade on Tuesday, trading messages of
goodwill and signing cooperation agreements with Russia's Boris
Yeltsin, a news agency reported.
	   One agreement pledged cooperation in the diamond industry, and
the two countries granted each other most-favored nation status,
easing trade restrictions, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin and dos Santos also signed a declaration pledging that
the two countries expand their political dialogue and ``exchange
information and experience in building a law-governed democratic
state,'' Interfax reported.
	   Russia, along with the United States and Portugal, is one of the
observer countries overseeing the delayed implementation of
Angola's 1994 peace agreement, which ended a two-decade civil war.

Russia earmarks less than dlrs 1 million for czar's burial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has allocated a relatively
modest 5 million rubles (dlrs 833,00) for next month's burial of
Czar Nicholas II and his family, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has signed a set of government
instructions describing how the government will carry out the royal
burial on July 17, Interfax said.
	   The burial, in St. Petersburg's Peter and Paul Cathedral, is
intended to put to rest one of the most painful episodes in Russian
history, the execution of the czar and his family by Bolsheviks on
July 17, 1918.
	   Originally planned as a grand ceremony that would symbolize a
renewal of Russian nationalism, the burial has since been scaled
back significantly and will be a relatively modest affair.
	   Neither President Boris Yeltsin nor Patriarch Alexei II, the
head of the Russian Orthodox Church, plan to attend. The government
will be represented by Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and
Minister of Culture Natalia Dementyeva.
	   The remains of the czar and his family were found in a pit near
Yekaterinburg in 1991. Repeated DNA testing has confirmed their
identities as Nicholas, his wife, three of their children and four
servants.

Apartheid-era crash subject of continuing questions 
</HEADLINE>
By PAT REBER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The widow of Mozambican
President Samora Machel, who died in a suspicious 1986 plane crash,
appeared Tuesday before a panel investigating apartheid-era crimes.
	   Graca Machel's testimony was to be given behind closed doors to
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which says it has new
information on the crash that killed 34 people.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, who is romantically
involved with Machel's widow, has vowed to find the truth about his
death. Mrs. Machel was to share the results of her own inquiries
into the death of her husband, the panel said.
	   An inquiry by the former apartheid government found that pilot
error caused the Russian-made Tupelov plane to crash into a hill in
eastern South Africa while on a flight from Malawi to Maputo,
Mozambique's capital.
	   But Russian experts concluded the pilots were following a decoy
signal, thinking it was transmitted from the airport in Maputo,
when the plane plowed into the ground.
	   Truth Commission spokesman Vuyani Green said recently that
evidence links activities of the apartheid-era South African
Defence Force to the crash. He did not elaborate.
	   The panel's investigation began earlier this month with
witnesses who went unnamed because of fears for their safety,
officials said.
	   A South African weekly newspaper said the investigators for the
apartheid government, who included former U.S. astronaut Frank
Borman, found the Russian pilots were grossly negligent, based on
the last flight recordings before the Tupelov went down.
	   For 32 seconds, the crew ignored an automatic signal that warned
the plane was approaching the ground. In the minutes before the
crash, the co-pilot was listening to a Moscow news and music
station, and the captain was trying to order soft drinks and beer
for the flight deck, the Mail and Guardian reported last week.
	   The crew failed to conduct the cross-checks that showed the
plane had made a wrong turn in trying to approach Maputo airport,
the newspaper said.
	   South Africa's apartheid government denied it used false signals
from navigation beacons to lure the plane off course. An
International Civil Aviation Organization team said there was
nothing mysterious or sinister about the accident.
	   Machel and South Africa's government had been at odds.
	   Mozambique gave refuge to South African anti-apartheid
guerrillas.
	   South Africa's white-minority government backed a rebel movement
in Mozambique _ RENAMO, the Portuguese acronym for the Mozambique
National Resistance _ that tried to unseat Machel's socialist
government.
	   The Truth Commission is investigating apartheid-era atrocities,
and can give amnesty to those who fully confess to human rights
abuses.

World Cup: Japan must score to beat Jamaica

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ When Miracle Nippon meets the
Reggae Boyz in the final World Cup match for both first-timers, the
game will help gauge the future prospects of twp teams with fine
potential.
	   The Japanese blame their lack of experience as the main reason
behind their 1-0 losses to Argentina and Croatia. So they hope to
finish the tournament Friday by chalking up a win against Jamaica,
another World Cup novice.
	   ``We will do our best until the end,'' said coach Takeshi Okada,
who has repeatedly warned that winning against Jamaica will not be
easy. ``You can never really tell in soccer. There's no predicting
what might happen.''
	   After Monday morning practice, the squad took the rest of the
day off. Okada scheduled closed practices for the rest of the week.
The team travels to nearby Lyon from this southeastern resort town
Thursday for their final first-round match.
	   Although Jamaica lost by bigger margins in Group H play _ 3-1 to
Croatia and 5-0 to Argentina _ Japan has yet to score a goal at the
World Cup.
	   ``Sometimes, when a goal comes along, we score easily,'' captain
Masami Ihara said. ``We want to make a goal in the next game and
win at the World Cup.''
	   Defender Naoki Soma said that his team must not allow Jamaica to
control the game and that ideally Japan must score first.
	   ``If they get the game into their rhythm, they can be very
dangerous,'' Soma said. ``We have to be aggressive, or else we're
left with nothing. All we have to do is go for the win.''
	   Friday's game may be insignificant for the tournament's outcome.
But the stands are sure to be quite a sight, gathering two groups
of the most vivacious supporters around.
	   Before kick off in Nantes last Saturday, the Japanese fans
rolled out a giant blue flag behind the goal. ``You'll never walk
alone,'' it said.
	   For the first two games, thousands of Japanese shouting,
``Nippon! Nippon!'' have filled the stadiums _ many paying
thousands of francs (dollars) for black market tickets to get in.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The PLO has complained to the U.N. Security
Council about the demolition of Palestinian homes by Israel, a
Palestinian lawmaker said Tuesday, a day after an Arab house was
razed on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
	   Israel routinely demolishes Palestinian homes built without
license in Jerusalem and West Bank areas still under Israeli
control. The Palestinians say Israel rarely grants construction
licenses to Palestinians, and that those with expanding families
are forced to build without obtaining permission.
	   The United States has urged Israel to refrain from demolishing
homes, but the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
ignored the appeal.
	   On Monday, Israeli bulldozers razed the home of 37-year-old
Mustafa Dadean on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, leaving
eight people homeless. A group of about 30 friends and relatives
arrived at the scene, sitting on sofas and cupboards amid debris
and rubble.
	   ``I will start to rebuild the house again because this is the
way we have of confronting the Israeli authorities,'' Dadean said.
	   City officials said the demolition took place outside the city
limits.
	   Palestinian legislator Salah Taamari said the PLO has asked the
U.N. Security Council to discuss the house demolitions as part of a
debate on Israel's plan to expand Jerusalem. Under that plan,

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat arrived in the
Balkans on Tuesday with what could be a final warning for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic before NATO takes steps to try to end
the fighting in Kosovo.
	   The visit by Richard Holbrooke, a troubleshooter for the region
and the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was seen as a
last diplomatic effort to get Milosevic to stop his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Western nations, who sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in a
warning to Milosevic earlier this month, have been deliberating on
what measures they will take if Milosevic refuses.
	   Holbrooke stopped in neighboring Macedonia en route to Belgrade
for talks with Milosevic later Tuesday, meeting in the capital
Skopje with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and President Kiro
Gligorov.
	   He also was expected to meet with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, who supports a peaceful settlement but has limited if any
influence over the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The West fears the Kosovo conflict could spread to Macedonia,
which borders on Kosovo and also has a sizeable community of ethnic
Albanians.
	   Holbrooke was credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo.
	   Last week, Milosevic met in Russia with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to work toward peace in Kosovo, including holding new
talks with Rugova. But he has refused demands to pull back and
cease security forces' fire.
	   A team of Russian diplomats toured the region Sunday and Monday,
but without clear results. Russia, a fellow Slavic nation, opposes
Western military pressure on its longtime ally.
	   Continuing clashes between Serb and KLA forces have been
reported this week.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday in
Washington that Holbrooke would demand that Milosevic adhere to
conditions imposed on him by the Contact Group of leading Western
nations on the Balkans.
	   ``He will be making clear in a very strong message to President
Milosevic, that the Contact Group's demands are not a menu from
which he can choose,'' Rubin said.
	   ``He must not only follow through in a way that he has not yet
followed through, on the requirements to allow access for
humanitarian organizations in Kosovo, but he also must pull back
and canton appropriately the forces that have been involved in the
violence there.''
	   The U.N. Security Council plans to discuss Kosovo next Monday.
Diplomats there said they are awaiting the results of the visits by
the Russians and Holbrooke before deciding what to do.

Swiss reject wartime Jewish refugee's cash claim 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A Jewish wartime refugee whose plea for
asylum in Switzerland was rejected by the Swiss during World War II
has had his claim for compensation from the Swiss government
rejected.
	   Joseph Spring lodged a claim for 100,000 Swiss francs (dlrs
66,756) with the government after he and two cousins were twice
refused refuge by the Swiss in 1943 from the occupying Nazi regime
in neighboring France.
	   Rejecting the claim Tuesday, Switzerland's governing federal
council ruled that the approach of the frontier authorities who
refused entry to Spring didn't constitute complicity in genocide.
	   ``The federal authorities, in contrast to the Nazi regime, have
not been guilty of any war crimes,'' said the federal finance
ministry in its ruling.
	   The council also said the claim had no legal basis. Under Swiss
law, Spring can appeal to Switzerland's supreme court.
	   Spring survived the Holocaust and emigrated to Australia in
1946, but his two cousins were murdered by the Nazis in the
Auschwitz death camp.
	   The case is the second of its type this year. In February, the
Swiss rejected a compensation claim for dlrs 69,000 filed last year
by another World War II Jewish refugee, Charles Sonabend. Sonabend,
66, claimed the country was responsible for his parents' deaths.
	   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, wartime Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews. But it
turned away an equal number, many of them to a certain death.
	   Switzerland has been accused of acting as Hitler's banker, and
its banks have been criticized for dragging their feet over
allowing Holocaust victims' heirs access to dormant accounts.
	   But it has also been praised for its efforts to fully
investigate and make amends for any wrongdoing.
	   The government has announced plans to set up a 7 billion francs
(dlrs 5 billion) Solidarity Foundation financed with 500 tons of
gold from the country's reserves in aid of all sorts of victims of
disasters and genocide, including the Holocaust.

Violence flares in Bedford after England defeat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEDFORD, England (AP) _ English soccer fans in Toulouse were
well behaved after England's 2-1 World Cup loss to Romania but the
result sparked violence at home for the second time in a week.
	   Police in riot gear made 24 arrests after being called in to
break up fighting in Bedford, north of London, about 21.30 GMT
Monday.
	   The violence flared on Bedford's High Street when drinkers who
had been watching the match on television at local pubs went out
onto the street.
	   A police spokesman said six officers in protective clothing were
sent to break up the violence when bottles and other missiles were
thrown.
	   ``We had nine arrests after the Tunisia game last Monday, and
there were problems during Euro 96 and the 1990 World Cup,'' the
police spokesman said.
	   But police were confident of dealing with trouble coinciding
with England's crucial match against Colombia Friday.
	   ``We hope people will behave themselves, but we have plans in
place for all eventualities.
	   ``Our message is enjoy the evening, enjoy the match. Why do you
need to fight?''

Social Democrats start efforts to form new Czech government 
</HEADLINE>
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Social Democratic leader Milos
Zeman prepared Tuesday for difficult talks with possible coalition
partners, a day after President Vaclav Havel asked him to try to
form a new government.
	   Zeman, winner of the country's early elections last weekend, is
expected to start formal negotiations with other party leaders on
Wednesday, Zeman's aide Karel Brezina said.
	   ``I will contact leaders of all parties that are represented in
the parliament,'' Brezina, who is organizing the talks, said.
	   Officials said the process of putting a new Czech government
together could take weeks.
	   Havel on Tuesday set July 7 as the date for the newly elected
lower chamber of Parliament to convene.
	   The Social Democrats captured the most votes and control 74
seats in the 200-seat legislature, but their chances to form a
majority government seem slim due to a lack of allies.
	   While Zeman seems to prefer a minority two-party government with
the Christian Democrats, their leader Josef Lux fears the Cabinet
could then fall hostage to the old-guard Communists, who have 24
seats in the parliament.
	   Lux's party also seems somewhat split over whose government it
should join, with some regional leaders clearly preferring a
center-right coalition.
	   ``If we form a coalition with the Social Democrats I'll leave
the party and I won't be alone,'' the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes
quoted Miloslav Macela, regional leader in east Bohemia, as saying.
	   Jan Ruml of the Freedom Union also has ruled out any coalition
with Zeman.
	   ``There are some possibilities to form a majority government,''
Finance Minister Ivan Pilip, of the Freedom Union, said in
Salzburg, Austria, where he is attending an economic forum. He said
the coalition will most probably be center-right.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts, Havel will likely ask the
election runner-up and former Premier Vaclav Klaus to attempt the
same.
	   ``The president has no intention to leave him (Klaus) out in
such case,'' Havel's adviser Jiri Pehe told Mlada Fronta Dnes.
	   Klaus' Civic Democratic Party won 63 seats in the parliament. He
was scheduled to hold talks with Lux and Ruml on Tuesday.

Russia's economic crisis ``alarming,'' Yeltsin says 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin told the Cabinet on
Tuesday that Russia's financial situation ``remains alarming'' and
that speedy, ``radical measures'' and a national consensus are
needed to restore order.
	   ``The price of foot-dragging and delays, squabbling and discord,
is too high,'' Yeltsin said in a firm and steady voice as he opened
an extraordinary meeting prompted by Russia's economic crisis and
this week's urgent negotiations with the International Monetary
Fund.
	   The meeting came three months to the day since Yeltsin
jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, saying it
had failed to improve Russia's economy and living conditions.
	   Yeltsin blamed Russia's latest woes on the financial crisis in
Asia and the slide in world oil prices, but he added that ``a
significant share of the blame lies with ourselves.''
	   ``Indecisiveness and slowness in implementing decisions cannot
be tolerated any longer. The government program must become a
program of action,'' said Yeltsin, looking tanned and relatively
fit.
	   He told the legislators present that the laws needed to set the
government's emergency economic program in motion should be passed
before parliament breaks for the summer.
	   ``We don't have more time left, there is no other way,'' he
said, hinting that if parliament fails to act, he will push through
the reforms by decree.
	   ``Other measures will be taken,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin called on Russia's parties, national and regional
leaders, trade unions and entrepreneurs to unite in the name of the
national interest.
	   ``You know, I don't believe in dramatizing the situation, but
the extreme tension in Russian society is obvious,'' he said.
	   In a detailed, brass-tacks address, Premier Sergei Kiriyenko set
out the state of Russia's economy and his plan for easing the
country's financial crunch.
	   He said the Russian economy was hurt by the current high
interest rates. The rates must be brought down because they cause
tremendous problems to companies and add to the budget deficit,
Kiriyenko said.
	   The Central Bank's key rates are now at 60 percent, and
benchmark one-year government bonds are yielding nearly as much.
	   He noted that over the past nine years, the share of Russia's
gross domestic product going to service the national debt has grown
to 44 percent. He said that this year, already 34 percent of the
nation's budget has gone to pay debt interest.
	   Kiriyenko's plan comprises 42 billion rubles (dlrs 6.8 billion)
in spending cuts and sharply increased tax collection, which should
net additional revenues of 20 billion rubles (dlrs 32.2 billion)
this year. The government also intends to raise land tax rates and
tighten customs controls.
	   The plan also includes government support for Russian exports,
debt rescheduling for industry, and creating a state company to
oversee the production of _ and revenues from _ liquor.
	   In all, some 20 draft laws accompanying the program set out the
steps the government hopes to follow to quell the crisis.
	   An IMF team arrived in Moscow on Monday night to negotiate terms
for the release of the latest, dlrs 670 million installment of an
existing loan to Russia, and conditions for the dlrs 10 billion to
dlrs 15 billion bailout Russia is seeking.
	   Both the fund and Russian officials have adopted hard stances.
The IMF last week said it was delaying the loan installment to
Russia because the government needs to take further steps to comply
with conditions for receiving the money.
	   The fund's demand that the government undertake land reform,
allowing for private ownership and unfettered sales of arable land,
has met vocal opposition from the hard-line lower chamber of
parliament. It's doubtful the government could overcome that
resistance.
	   A bigger question mark hovers over the fund's demand that Russia
split up its huge energy monopolies. Russia has so far resisted.

Dock workers vote for peace on waterfront, but give up 400 jobs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Dock workers in Melbourne voted
Tuesday in favor of a peace deal with a stevedoring company that
may end a protracted battle for control of Australia's waterfront,
at the cost of at least 400 unionized jobs.
	   At a five-hour meeting, about 400 dock workers voted to accept a
framework agreement reached between the Maritime Union of Australia
and Patrick Stevedores Holdings Pty. Ltd. in weeks of negotiations.
	   Talks between the company and the union began after the Federal
Court ruled in late April that Patrick must rehire 1,400 unionized
workers it had fired in an attempt to break union control of hiring
on the waterfront.
	   The firings triggered violent confrontations on Australia's
docks as workers went on strike nationally and the company tried
unsuccessfully to use non-unionized labor to break picket lines and
load and unload ships.
	   Union national secretary John Coombs said after Tuesday's
meeting that the vote in favor of the new agreement was
overwhelming, but conceded that about 400 union members' jobs would
become ``surplus.''
	   He said one condition of the agreement was that all legal action
be dropped, including a case alleging the company and the federal
government illegally conspired against the union and action by the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission against the union.
	   Other Australian states are expected to follow Melbourne's lead
in accepting the agreement, but the deal would not become final
until all members in all state branches had voted, Coombs said.
	   He said dock workers whose jobs would be replaced by contractors
as part of the agreement would receive payouts from Patrick.
	   Other initiatives included a reduction in overtime and the
introduction of annualized salaries.
	   Coombs denied the union had lost the waterfront battle.
	   ``We've had all our court costs paid; the wages have been paid
for all the time outside the gate; everyone's been reinstated;
there's voluntary redundancies, ... and you're asking me to tell
you who's won and who's lost,'' Coombs asked reporters.
	   ``I think actually we probably finished up just in front.''
	   The federal government welcomed the agreement, saying it would
inject U.S. dlrs 610 million (1 billion Australian dollars) into
the Australian economy.
	   A Patrick spokeswoman said the company would have no comment
until the deal had been signed.

Ukraine seeks to advance arms exports from drls 600 million in 1997 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine is exporting its weapons and
dual-purpose technologies to about 60 nations and last year's sales
amounted to about dlrs 600 million, a top weapons-exporting
official said.
	   The sum includes both weapons sales and dual-purpose technology
exported by all Ukrainian exporters, Valery Malevy, director
general of the state-run Ukrspetsexport company, said in an
interview published Tuesday.
	   ``We at Ukrspetsexport can be proud of increasing the volume of
foreign trade operations,'' Malevy told the official Uryadovy
Kurier newspaper.
	   The former Soviet republic, which produced up to a third of the
Soviet Union's weaponry, was 14th in world arms sales in 1996. Its
biggest contract was the dlrs 650 million deal with Pakistan to
sell it 320 T-80UD tanks. The 1996 contract is planned to be
completed next year, Malevy said.
	   Malevy said a Ukrainian-devised project of modernizing the
Soviet-made T-72 tanks to improve their movement and fire-control
characteristics has attracted attention abroad, along with the
country's NATO-standard caliber guns for former Soviet tanks.
	   ``Modernization of Soviet equipment is a promising direction of
our work, and we have interesting proposals from many countries,
particularly France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Israel,'' he
said.
	   Malevy said Ukrspetsexport and the Science and Technology
Ministry are setting up a new department which would attempt to
advance Ukrainian military technologies at world markets.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Jubilant soccer fans thronged
Bucharest and other Romanian cities into the early hours of Tuesday
after Romania beat England 2-1 and qualified for the next round of
the World Cup.
	   Braving heavy rain for four hours, people hung out of
horn-honking trucks waving Romanian flags and celebrated in the
streets of Bucharest, Cluj, Brasov, Oradea, Iasi, Craiova and
Constanta.
	   ``We qualified, we qualified!'' people shouted in Bucharest's
University Square, a traditional point for celebrations and
protests where a popular anti-communist revolt raged in 1989.
	   A police spokesman, Col. Nicolae Secrieru, said there was no
trouble. He estimated the crowd in Bucharest at 200,000 people.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile, on a visit to Poland, skipped dinner
with Polish Premier Jerzy Buzek to watch the game with Romanian
officials.
	   Buzek later sent him a bottle of Champagne congratulating
Romania on its victory, national radio reported.

Izetbegovic wants Dayton implemented, or changed Dodik or Zubak by name.

Eds: SUBS 9th graf to clarify that Izetbegovic did not identify
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Muslim president
Alija Izetbegovic said in comments published Tuesday that he wants
the Dayton peace agreement either fully implemented, or revised.
	   If Bosnian Serb and Croat hard-liners again triumph in September
elections, Bosnia's Muslims ``will rightfully request either the
total implementation of the Dayton peace agreement or its
alteration to ensure the proper functioning of the state,''
Izetbegovic told the Sarajevo daily Vecernje Novine.
	   Izetbegovic, leader of Bosnia's Muslims throughout the 1992-5
war, said he was aware how difficult it would be to undo the treaty
he helped negotiate in Dayton, Ohio in late 1995.
	   But his request reflects growing Bosnian and international
impatience at the continuing staying power of hard-liners.
	   Izetbegovic's Muslim party shares federal power with the Bosnian
Serb Democratic Party and the Croatian Democratic Union, both of
whom would rather see the country divided. Bosnia was partioned by
Dayton into two halves, a Bosnian Serb half, and a Muslim-Croat
half. A three-person executive _ Muslim, Serb and Croat _ rules the
whole state.
	   Izetbegovic's side was long the only one in power which
supported a unified country.
	   Last January, Milorad Dodik, an open supporter of Dayton, gained
power in the Bosnian Serb Republic.
	   Kresimir Zubak, Croat member of the presidency, has now turned
his back on the policy of division, forming his own party that is
likely to be more supportive of unifying the country.
	   If moderates win backing at September elections, there is a
chance for real peace in Bosnia, Izetbegovic said. If not, the
Muslims will not tolerate it, he added.
	   ``We will surely not accept matters remaining unresolved and
half-way down the road. We have enough jokers not to consent to
anything like that,'' he told the newspaper. Izetbegovic did not
reveal what he meant by ``jokers.''
	   Foreigners too, particularly Americans, want to see change and
``some kind of end to their presence in Bosnia,'' he added. ``We
think the condition for their departure is the arrival in power of
political forces that accept Bosnia as a united and democratic
country.''

	   Defense and energy sector workers, as well as others dependent
on government funds for their salaries, blocked eight roads and a
bridge in Ussurisk, a city in the Primorye region located 4,000
kilometers (2,500 miles) east of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Simultaneously, an estimated 500 people picketed outside the
region's headquarters in Vladivostok, and protesters staged rallies
in cities across the territory.
	   A group of workers from the Zvezda nuclear submarine repair
factory camped out in Vladivostok's main square, refusing to leave
until their 15-month wage arrears are paid in full, the news agency
said.

Royal birthday party may prompt Taiwan premier's visit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's premier may add an African leg to
a visit abroad next month in hopes of shoring up ties with allies,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Following his attendance at Tongan King Tauka'ahan's 80th
birthday celebration in early July, Premier Vincent Siew may travel
on to Swaziland to attend birthday celebrations for that southern
African kingdom's monarch, the United Evening News reported.
	   Visits to other African allies may also be added, the paper
said.
	   Home to eight of the 27 countries that recognize Taiwan, Africa
is a key battleground in China's efforts to diplomatically isolate
the island it considers a breakaway province.
	   China denies Taiwan's right to international recognition, and
refuses to have ties with countries that recognize the island.
	   Since the beginning of the year, the Central African Republic
and Guinea-Bissau have switched ties from Taipei to Beijing.
Reports in Taipei said both countries were promised large amounts
of development aid by China.

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About a dozen men waited in a run-down
restaurant at the edge of town, reloading their assault rifles and
joking nervously as mortar shells exploded outside and bullets
ricocheted down the empty street.
	   One was a young track star, another his former coach; their
commander was a writer and former political prisoner.
	   ``When it's a question of existence, you have to do it,'' said
Lume Hagjiu, a 40-year-old author of eight books of poetry,
sweating in his heavy camouflage uniform and gripping a worn
Kalashnikov assault rifle. ``But I hate the war.''
	   For weeks, Serbs trying to wipe out the Kosovo Liberation Army
have targeted villages along Kosovo's border with Albania, aiming
to seal off the secessionist province and prevent an influx of new
arms and fighters.
	   One of the biggest villages still controlled by the KLA along
the border, Junik is fighting back with everything it's got,
determined to keep its border open.
	   None of the men in Junik, about five miles (eight kilometers)
from the border, relished the fighting Monday, which began at
midafternoon and lasted about 90 minutes.
	   But they were used to it. Serb forces positioned on the
surrounding high ground have opened fire almost every day since the
first attack on May 29, killing five villagers and wounding at
least 10, they said.
	   The buildings show some of the battle scars: The roof of one
house was destroyed; another house had a hole blown in the side.
	   ``The first day was very difficult _ all the families and
children were here,'' said Gani Shehu, another KLA commander. Serb
forces hit them with guns, grenades and mortars _ ``everything they
had.''
	   But the town of 12,000 knew what was coming and got ready, with
help from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``We learned a lesson from Drenica,'' Shehu says, referring to
the site of the first Serb crackdown in March, where about 80
ethnic Albanian villagers were killed. ``We picked up guns and
decided to do something.''
	   Most of the town's women, children and elderly have fled, some
to Albania, some to safer villages. A third group of about 1,000
are trapped in the hills, the commanders say, surrounded by Serbs
and unable to cross the border, which was sealed last week by the
Yugoslav army.
	   On June 15, Serb forces shot at those refugees from helicopters.
It's not clear what casualties they suffered, Shehu says.
	   About 4,000 people remain in the village, mostly men of fighting
age, all with guns. All say they're willing to lay down their lives
to defend their homes and win Kosovo's freedom from Serbia.
	   Junik hasn't had electricity for two months, and food is running
out. The men have started slaughtering farm animals left behind.
``Better we eat them than let the Serbs shoot them,'' Hagjiu says.
	   The men don't dare venture out of Junik openly _ the first Serb
police checkpoint is just a half-mile (800 meters) down the road.
But neither do the Serbs move in _ the road is blocked by twisted,
rusting iron and guarded by KLA fighters.
	   Most of the men in Junik don't have uniforms; they wear old
jeans or work clothes. All carry guns, however, and they quickly
took up positions behind the front line when the first burst of
machine-gun fire rang out. A house, a barn, even a haystack _
wherever they could find cover.
	   When their clips ran out, and the mortar shells and grenades
started falling, they retreated into the thick-walled restaurant,
now a community kitchen.
	   KLA fighters farther up the hills continued to return fire.
	   Junik has held out for 24 days, Hagjiu says. He has no idea how
much longer the fighting will last, but doesn't hold out much hope
for a negotiated peace.
	   Despite Western pressure, the Serbs refuse to pull back until
the separatist attacks stop. Out on the main highway Monday,
convoys of Yugoslav army tanks and heavy guns were moving toward
the area.
	   Truckloads of Serb police, singing and waving Yugoslav flags,
roared through neighboring Decani, where buildings were burned and
windows smashed.
	   A few miles (kilometers) in the other direction, the hamlet of
Prilep was empty except for police and the stench of rotting farm
animal carcasses.
	   The men of Junik say they won't let that happen to their town.
And they won't stop shooting until the Serb forces stop shooting at
them.
	   Hagjiu was jailed under the communists from 1979-83 for his
poems about love and freedom for Kosovo. He made it to Sweden in
1985 and worked there as a translator until February, when he came
back to fight with his people.
	   Shpejtim Maloku, the 18-year-old long-distance runner, proudly
shows off his T-shirt commemorating a Kosovo-wide track meet last
year in which he won the 5,000 meters in under 15 minutes.
	   With a bashful grin, he says he dreams of being a professional
athlete. ``But first of all my dream is for Kosovo to be free.''

World Cup: Field leader Boban to play against Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia's captain and playmaker Zvonimir
Boban said Tuesday he expects to play in the last group game
against Argentina after sitting out one game with a pulled leg
muscle.
	   Croatia, a World cup newcomer, sorely missed the AC Milan
midfielder to direct its play Saturday when it struggled to beat
Japan 1-0 to secure a second-round spot. Friday's game will decide
whether Argentina or Croatia wins Group H, thus determining the
teams' next opponent.
	   Boban, 29, resumed team practice Tuesday after several days of
exercising on his own.
	   ``I now believe I will play against Argentina,'' he said.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic said he will field his strongest eleven
against the two-time world champion and will not make big changes
to counter Argentina star striker Gabriel Batistuta.
	   He indicated, though, that he may tinker with his back line
because defenders Zvonimir Soldo and Igor Stimac are carrying over
yellow cards from the two earlier games.
	   Even Blazevic, who usually loves to talk up his team, said
chances of winning against the South Americans were ``not more than
50 percent.''
	   ``Croatia is a good team but Argentina is a great team,'' said
Boban. ``We will do everything we can to win the game and the
group, but Argentina is the favorite.''
	   Croatia's soccer federation president hinted Monday that
Blazevic might call up some substitutes after several regulars had
poor showings against Japan, but the coach wouldn't give any
indication of such plans Tuesday.
	   Looking to the final 16, Blazevic said he was impressed with
both teams Croatia could likely face in the second round _ England
and Romania _ after their direct clash Monday.
	   England was unlucky to lose 2-1 in the dying minutes after
fighting back from a 1-0 deficit.
	   ``Before the game I would have said we would prefer to meet
England, but now both seem equally tough to me,'' he said.

Holbrooke arrives for `last-chance' demands on Kosovo kidnapped 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reports of Serbs fleeing homes, another six
By MISHA SAVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat headed for
Belgrade on Tuesday with what could be a final warning for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic before NATO takes steps to try to end
the fighting in Kosovo.
	   The visit by Richard Holbrooke, a troubleshooter for the region
and the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is seen as a
last diplomatic effort to get Milosevic to stop his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Western nations, who sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in a
warning to Milosevic earlier this month, have been deliberating on
what measures they will take if Milosevic refuses.
	   Holbrooke stopped in neighboring Macedonia en route to Belgrade
for talks with Milosevic later Tuesday, meeting in the capital
Skopje with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and President Kiro
Gligorov.
	   He also was expected to meet with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, who supports a peaceful settlement but has limited if any
influence over the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The West fears the Kosovo conflict could spread to Macedonia,
which borders on Kosovo and also has a sizeable community of ethnic
Albanians.
	   Holbrooke is credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported Tuesday that 800 Serb civilians
have evacuated one of the remaining Serb enclaves, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of the capital Pristina near the town of Klina.
They said ethnic Albanians had driven them out, burning down houses
there.
	   The Serbs' Media Center also said six more Serbs had been
kidnapped, bringing this week's total to nine.
	   Last week, Milosevic met in Russia with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to work toward peace in Kosovo, including holding new
talks with Rugova. But he has refused demands to pull back and
cease security forces' fire.
	   A team of Russian diplomats toured the region Sunday and Monday,
but without apparent results. Russia, a fellow Slavic nation,
opposes Western military pressure on its long-time ally.

Official: Malaysia hoping for huge U.S. investment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia hopes to attract dlrs 500
million in investment from the United States by the end of the year
for small and medium-size enterprises involved in its ambitious
Multimedia Super Corridor, the national news agency Bernama said
Tuesday.
	   ``Silicon Valley in California is successful because of these
investors,'' Bernama quoted Othman Yeop Abdullah, chief of the
Multimedia Development Corporation Malaysia, as saying at the World
Information Technology Congress. The congress began Monday in
Fairfax, Virginia.
	   MDC is on an intensive search for international venture
capitalists who are willing to invest in information technology
industries, he said.
	   Taiwanese venture capitalists have agreed to pump dlrs 500
million into the region for such companies, and MDC is also looking
elsewhere, including the Middle East, he added.
	   The economic crisis that has struck Malaysia and other Asian
countries has particularly hurt small businesses, which are finding
it hard to borrow from banks and obtain the capital needed to set
up their companies, he said.
	   Of the 107 companies that have confirmed participation in the
Super Corridor, 54 are foreign. Investment in the project is
expected to reach 4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) by the end of
1998, he said.
	   The multibillion-dollar media corridor is often touted as Asia's
version of Silicon Valley.

Spaniard gives himself up after hijacking domestic flight INCORPORATES Israel-Hijacking

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish hijacker described as mentally
unstable seized an Iberia Air Lines jet Tuesday, forcing the plane
to land and holding more than 100 people hostage before
surrendering peacefully to end a nearly four-hour standoff.
	   The hijacker, one of the 131 people aboard Iberia's early
morning flight 1121 between Seville and Barcelona, was unarmed.
Nobody was hurt during the four hours that the plane was held on
the ground at Valencia's Manises airport in eastern Spain, Interior
Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Delgado identified the hijacker as Javier Gomez from Seville.
The national news agency EFE said Gomez brandished a television
remote control device threatening to explode a bomb. A Spanish
official could not immediately confirm that report.
	   Gomez identified himself to the police who had cordoned off the
aircraft immediately after it landed at 8:40 a.m. (0640 GMT),
apparently to refuel, Delgado said. The plane was surrounded by
security forces, however, and no refueling took place, Israel radio
reported, monitoring Spanish TV.
	   Investigations revealed that the hijacker was under psychiatric
treatment and police contacted his doctor who flew to Valencia and
and talked the hijacker into giving up by cellular phone.
	   Gomez had earlier released 18 people from the aircraft, most of
them children. The remaining passengers, including Seville Mayor
Soledad Becerril, and the crew left the plane immediately after the
hijacker surrendered.
	   Among the hostages aboard Flight 1121 was the mayor of Seville,
Soledad Becerill, who was in contact with police through a mobile
phone, Ehud Gol, Israel's ambassador to Spain, told Israel radio.
Becerril was headed to a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, to
promote Seville's candidacy to host the 2008 Olympics.
	   Gol said Gomez first demanded to fly to Athens, then changed his
demand to Tel Aviv. Israel had asked Spanish authorities not to
permit the plane to take off, Gol said.
	   Initial reports were that three people hijacked the plane,
national radio reported, and asked to be flown to Greece. Athens
airport officials boosted security and placed anti-terrorist teams
on the alert.
	   Iberia employees brought water and food to the plane wearing
only bathing suits, as requested by the hijacker, so no weapons
could be hidden, Israel radio reported.
	   Troops soon surrounded the plane, which was parked out on the
tarmac away from the main airport and other planes.
	   After the hijacker surrendered, the remaining passengers and
crew left the plane without incident. No one was injured.

Report: Vatican in the black for fifth straight year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican announced Tuesday that it was in
the black for the fifth straight year in a row in 1997, in large
part to contributions from local churches and a healthy return on
its investments.
	   The Vatican, which went through 23 money-losing years until
1993, said in a report that it ended the year with a surplus of
nearly dlrs 11 million.
	   Several things have contributed to the turnaround in the Holy
See's finances. The Vatican is monitoring its spending more closely
and finding new ways to make money, such as marketing papal
recordings and merchandising ventures linked to its museums, post
offices and mint.
	   It has also pressed local churches to contribute more money by

	   ``Without the generosity of bishops, priests, religious and the

operations were dlrs 16.48 million in the red.
	   The losses were offset by dlrs 47.8 million in income from
investments and dlrs 27.6 million in income from real estate, the
report said.

Prime minister wants election to restore `political stability' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Tuesday he
hopes his party will win enough seats in upcoming parliamentary
elections to restore ``stability'' to Japanese politics.
	   Hashimoto said achieving a stable government is important for
pushing through political reforms and resolving the problems left
over from the bursting of Japan's speculative land and stock
``bubble'' of the late 1980s.
	   ``I want the public to choose between stability and confusion,''
Hashimoto told reporters in Tokyo.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party needs to regain a majority
in July elections for the upper house of Parliament to be able to
pass legislation without the help of coalition partners.
	   For the past four years, the LDP has been relying on votes from
the Social Democratic Party and the Sakigake Party to get bills
passed.
	   On economic issues, Hashimoto said the most serious problem is
the bad loan burden plaguing the country's banks after the bubble.
	   ``We must get rid of bad loans from bank balance sheets to
restore trust in the financial system,'' he said.
	   Hashimoto said the government will begin concrete efforts in
July to set up a ``bridge bank'' to take over bad loans and keep up
lending to sound businesses hurt by banks' current reluctance to
lend.
	   He said depositors at failed banks will ``absolutely'' be
protected.
	   Hashimoto expressed confidence that the economy will begin to
recover once the government's 16 trillion yen (dlrs 116 billion)
economic stimulus package is implemented.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Takako Doi, leader of the Social Democrats,
said her party would stand in opposition to Hashimoto's party in
the elections, campaigning on a platform favoring a society that
protects the weak and improves the role of women.
	   But Doi also defended her party's record during its years in the
governing coalition with the Liberal Democrats.
	   ``The government passed many bills that wouldn't have been
possible without us,'' Doi said.
	   Analysts say the left-leaning Social Democrats' reputation among
their usual backers was hurt by their alliance with the
conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats.
	   Another opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa of the Liberal Party,
called for a radical program of tax cuts and deregulation to help
restore long-term growth to Japan.
	   Ozawa advocates tax cuts worth 18 trillion yen (dlrs 130
billion) as well as bringing the national sales tax back down to 3
percent from 5 percent.
	   The government's decision last year to raise the sales tax by 2
percentage points is often blamed for playing a major role in
triggering Japan's current recession.

World Cup: Good seats still available? Only the World Cup organizers know for sure AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Trust us, say the French organizers of the World
Cup. The games are all sellouts. There are no tickets to be had
from authorized agents.
	   Want proof? Just look around, they say.
	   ``You can see the stadiums are full,'' said Bruno Travade, the
organizing committee's chief spokesman.
	   But, no, Travade said, there are no numbers to back this up.
	   At the World Cup, the biggest sports event on the planet, the
one with an estimated cumulative TV audience of up to 40 billion
people the organizers aren't able to count the number of fans in
the seats.
	   Travade said Tuesday that organizers had changed their policy
and would not release attendance figures for any more matches. He
said those numbers would just ``fool or confuse people.''
	   What's more, he said, the organizers had given up even trying to
compile attendance figures _ numbers so basic they're routinely
included in the statistics at sports events from the Olympics on
down.
	   Yes, Travade said, attendance was released from most of the
opening series of games. But because of seats set aside for the
news media, VIPs, security and other invitees _ a situation that
occurs at virtually every major event _ a stadium's capacity
changes from game to game. Thus, the organizers said, it thus was
unfair to try to compare attendance figures.
	   ``We want to avoid controversy,'' Travade said.
	   The lack of those figures, however, added another element to the
longest-running controversy of this World Cup, the distribution,
sale and _ sometimes _ out and out fraud connected with the ticket
system.
	   Thousands of fans who thought they had tickets suddenly found
out they did not. Three people have been arrested for ticket-sales
scams. The organizers themselves have filed complaints against one
of their licensed ticket agents and a firm with financial ties to
world soccer's marketing arm.
	   Critics, including the European Union, complained that the
ticket distribution was unfairly weighted in favor of French
companies and fans.
	   Through all of this, the organizing committee and FIFA, soccer's
world body, have said they played by the rules in dispersing
tickets, which quickly sold out when they went on the market last
year.
	   Travade said that should take care of anyone looking for the
number of spectators at any given match.
	   ``Two-and-a-half million tickets were sold. We can give you the
attendance in advance,'' he said. ``But let's be realistic. You can
see that the stadiums are full.''
	   Indeed, it's hard to spot more than a handful of empty seats at
the games. But not all tickets are in the hands of fans.
	   FIFA said Tuesday that it had given the U.S. Soccer Federation
permission to sell some 2,000 tickets it still had on hand for
Thursday's match against Yugoslavia in Nantes. The U.S. team was
eliminated from any chance of the second round with its 2-1 loss to
Iran on Sunday, and tickets for that final first-round match
suddenly went from super hot to ``Who needs two?''
	   If those tickets, priced at the equivalent of dlrs 25-60, are
not sold, they will still count as part of an official capacity
crowd, whatever that might be, because they were distributed by the
organizers. And at the World Cup, no-shows are no-nos because,
Travade said, the organizers can't say just how many seats are
available.
	   ``How can you calculate the theoretical capacity and the number
of spectators? Between the theoretical capacity and the number of
tickets?'' Travade said.
	   Rather than try to calculate the number of seats taken out of
circulation for press stands, camera positions and honored guests,
he said, ``we decided not to try to give out that information that
could fool or confuse people.''

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish hijacker who held a domestic
Iberian flight and demanded to be flown to Tel Aviv surrendered
peacefully to police after speaking to his psychiatrist,
authorities said.
	   The hijacker, one of the 131 people aboard Iberia's early
morning flight 1121 between Seville and Barcelona, was unarmed.
Nobody was hurt during the four hours that the plane was held on
the ground at Valencia's Manises airport in eastern Spain, Interior
Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Delgado identified the hijacker as Javier Gomez from Seville.
The national news agency EFE said Gomez brandished a television
remote control device threatening to explode a bomb.
	   Gomez identified himself to the police who had cordoned off the
aircraft immediately after it landed at 8:40 a.m. (0640GMT),
Delgado said.
	   Investigations revealed that the hijacker was under psychiatric
treatment and police contacted his doctor who flew to Valencia and
persuaded him to give up.
	   Gomez had earlier released 18 people from the aircraft, most of
them children. The remaining passengers, including Seville Mayor
Soledad Becerril, and the crew left the plane immediately after the
hijacker surrendered.
	   The authorities originally reported that the plane had been
hijacked by three armed people who demanded to be taken to Tel
Aviv.
	   The Israeli Ambassador to Spain, Ehud Gol, said Gomez first
demanded to fly to Athens, but then changed his demand to Tel Aviv.
He said Gomez spoke Spanish, but not fluently, leading the embassy
to believe he was of ``Middle Eastern origin.''
	   ``Perhaps he is a (Spanish) citizen, but not a native one,'' Gol
said in an interview broadcast on Israel radio.
	   Gol said Israel had asked Spanish authorities not to permit the
plane to take off.

Singapore to announce stimulus package as economy shrinks FOR RELEASE AT 1210 GMT JUNE 23, TIME SET BY SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As the Asian crisis looms ever larger,
Singapore plans to aid its slowing economy with long-anticipated
special measures, a Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
	   ``Next Monday, ... the finance minister will announce in
Parliament a package of off-budget measures to ameliorate the
economic slowdown,'' Information and Arts Minister George Yeo said
in a speech to international political and business leaders.
	   He said the measures will ``reduce business costs, and help
businesses to cope with this difficult period, rather than to
pump-prime the economy or stimulate consumption.''
	   Singapore has been inching toward possible recession since the
start of the year, though its leaders have been reluctant to side
with private forecasts that are increasingly pointing toward
contraction.
	   Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament on June 1 that the
government might introduce tax rebates and increase the pace of
infrastructure spending if second quarter data revealed slower
growth than expected.
	   Figures released Saturday showed that May non-oil exports, a key
measure of overall economic performance and the latest information
on second quarter activity, declined 4.8 percent from a year
earlier.
	   The next day, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong conceded that the
country could enter recession if the regional economic crisis
deepens or if domestic demand continues to dwindle.
	   In his speech Tuesday, Yeo added that the ``expected growth rate
for this year will have to be revised downward, although it is
still not likely to be negative.''
	   Despite growing dissent from the private sector over the past
few months, the government had stood by its forecast of growth
between 2.5 and 4.5 percent this year. That prediction was made in
February, however, before a clear picture of the severity of Asia's
economic crisis had emerged.
	   A number of private investment houses and economists have
forecast outright recession at some point this year, and the
majority have placed their growth estimates well below the
government's.
	   Yeo argued that although Singapore's banks and financial
institutions are among the strongest in Asia, the small island
republic cannot be ``fully isolated from the regional crisis.''
	   Singapore is highly vulnerable to external economic
developments. The resource-scarce country relies on its financial
services, which have been hit hard during the crisis, and on its
electronics sector, which has slowed amid a world slump in computer
component sales.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The head of the Romanian branch of
Austrian bank Creditanstalt has been charged with forgery and
acting against public interests, prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   Dan Pascariu was charged with faking a receipt in the early
1990s after he allegedly moved dlrs 100,000 from one company bank
account to another.
	   At the time, he was head of the Romanian Foreign Trade Bank.
	   The money was used for travel abroad, a statement from the
public prosecutors said.

Russia's economic crisis ``alarming,'' Yeltsin says

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial situation ``remains alarming''
and speedy, ``radical measures'' and national consensus are needed
to restore order, President Boris Yeltsin told his Cabinet on
Tuesday.
	   ``The price of foot-dragging and delays, squabbling and discord,
is too high,'' Yeltsin said in a firm and steady voice as he opened
a special session prompted by the economic crisis and this week's
urgent negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
	   The meeting came three months to the day since Yeltsin
jettisoned the government of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, saying it
had failed to improve Russia's economy and living conditions.
	   Yeltsin blamed Russia's latest woes on the financial crisis in
Asia and the slide in world oil prices, but he added that ``a
significant share of the blame lies with ourselves.''
	   ``Indecisiveness and slowness in implementing decisions cannot
be tolerated any longer. The government program must become a
program of action,'' said Yeltsin, looking tanned and relatively
fit.
	   He told the legislators present that the laws needed to set the
government's emergency economic program in motion should be passed
before parliament breaks for the summer.
	   ``We don't have more time left, there is no other way,'' he
said, hinting that if parliament fails to act, he will push through
the reforms by decree.
	   ``You know, I don't believe in dramatizing the situation, but
the extreme tension in Russian society is obvious,'' Yeltsin said.
	   In a brass-tacks address, Premier Sergei Kiriyenko detailed the
state of Russia's economy and his plan for easing the country's
financial crunch.
	   Russia's high interest rates must be brought down because they
cause tremendous problems to companies and add to the budget
deficit, Kiriyenko said.
	   The Central Bank's key rates are now at 60 percent, and
benchmark one-year government bonds are yielding nearly as much.
	   He noted that over the past nine years, the share of Russia's
gross domestic product going to service the national debt has grown
to 44 percent. He said that this year, already 34 percent of the
nation's budget has gone to pay debt interest.
	   Kiriyenko's plan comprises 42 billion rubles (dlrs 6.8 billion)
in spending cuts and a 20 billion ruble (dlrs 3.2 billion) in tax
collection increases this year. The government also intends to
raise land tax rates and tighten customs controls.
	   The plan also includes government support for Russian exports,
debt rescheduling for industry, and creating a state company to
oversee production and tax collection from the liquor industry _
which traditionally provides a significant portion of government
revenues.
	   ``The idea of the present period of transition is to pass from
decreasing state interference in the economy to raising the
efficiency of such interference,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   In all, some 20 draft laws accompanying the program set out the
steps the government hopes to follow to quell the crisis.
	   An IMF team arrived in Moscow on Monday night to negotiate terms
for the release of the long-delayed, dlrs 670 million installment
of an existing loan to Russia, and conditions for the dlrs 10
billion to dlrs 15 billion bailout Russia is seeking.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said that the negotiations
should be completed soon.
	   ``We don't have that much time,'' he said. ``I think it must be
done in two to three weeks.''
	   He insisted that the government is not considering devaluating
the ruble.
	   The head of the Central Bank, Sergei Dubinin, told the Cabinet
that foreign credit cannot solve Russia's financial crisis. At the
same time, however, such credit ``would certainly strengthen the
position of the Russian ruble.''

Iran proposes meeting of Muslim organization to discuss Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Iran wants foreign ministers of
Muslim countries to meet in Tehran to find ways to counter Israel's
plans to extend Jerusalem's borders, a Saudi official said Tuesday.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami suggested the meeting of
foreign ministers of the 55-member Organization of the Islamic
Conference in a letter to Saudi King Fahd, said the official,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The letter was carried by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, who arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. No date was set
for the proposed meeting in Tehran, where a summit of the
organization was convened in December.
	   Kharrazi was greeted at the airport in this Red Sea port by his
Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal. He is also expected to
meet Crown Prince Abdullah before returning to Iran Tuesday.
	   The Israeli Cabinet approved a plan Sunday for the expansion of
Jerusalem. Under Israeli-Palestinian agreements, the status of
Jerusalem is to be determined in negotiations, and both sides
pledged not to make changes on the ground in the meantime.
	   Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a state.
Jerusalem, which is holy to Christians, Jews, and Muslims, is home
to Al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's most revered shrines.
	   The Saudi official said Kharrazi would also discuss ways for
Tehran and Riyadh to coordinate oil policy in an effort to stop the
slide in oil prices, ahead of a meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna on Wednesday.
	   Khatami discussed the issue with Abdullah by telephone Sunday,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Saudi Arabia and Iran, OPEC's largest producers, have pledged
cuts of 325,000 barrels per day starting July 1.
	   Relations between former rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran have
improved since the election last May of Khatami, a moderate cleric.

`Junk food-free zones' planned around Thai schools 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Health and education experts in
Thailand are teaming up to halt the sale of junk food near primary
schools to promote better eating habits among children.
	   A newly established body to promote good health for students is
planning a pilot project to set up ``junk food-free zones,''
prohibiting the sale of snacks and soft drinks near four schools, a
member of the committee said Tuesday.
	   Dr. Hatai Chitanondh said tobacco and alcohol also would not be
sold within 200 meters (yards) of schoolyards.
	   The committee expects opposition from the business sector,
especially vendors who make their living selling junk food to
students, he said.
	   ``We will ask, for the sake of our children, for cooperation
from the shops and the business sector,'' said Hatai. ``But if it
leads to legal conflict, we are prepared to deal with it.''
	   He said the alcohol industry has been cooperative, agreeing to
withhold commercials from television before 10 p.m., but he expects
some confrontation with foreign cigarette distributors. Thai
cigarettes are made by a state enterprise.
	   Hatai said a study showed that within 20 years, the average
lifespan of Thai people could be reduced by 10 years if no serious
measures are taken soon. The lifespan is currently 68 years for men
and 72 for women.
	   ``We are unable to deal with the impact of social and economic
changes because our public accountability is weak and our
government agencies have overlapping responsibilities,'' he said.
	   The huge increase in automobile traffic is one example of such
change, he noted.
	   ``Road accidents account for about 100 billion baht (dlrs 2.5
billion) (in lost revenues) each year, and the number keeps
climbing,'' said Hatai, who is also president of the
non-governmental Thailand Health Promotion Institute.
	   In a separate development, the purchase of 14,000 anatomical
models by the Education Ministry under the previous government has
come under attack by the auditor-general's office, the Bangkok Post
reported.
	   The ministry paid 21,000 baht (dlrs 525) to a private supplier
for each of the human models, instead of buying them from a state
university that sells them for 15,000 baht (dlrs 375) apiece.
	   Deputy Education Minister Arkom Engchuan said several deals made
under the previous government were questionable, the newspaper
reported.
	   He said the National Primary Education Commission, a body set up
to purchase educational materials for public schools, should scrap
the overpriced deal and buy the dummies from the state university.

Holbrooke arrives for `last-chance' demands on Kosovo Serbs fleeing homes, another six kidnapped

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat arrived in the
Balkans on Tuesday with what could be a final warning for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic before NATO takes steps to try to end
the fighting in Kosovo.
	   The visit by Richard Holbrooke, a troubleshooter for the region
and the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was seen as a
last diplomatic effort to get Milosevic to stop his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Western nations, who sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in a
warning to Milosevic earlier this month, have been deliberating on
what measures they will take if Milosevic refuses.
	   Holbrooke stopped in neighboring Macedonia en route to Belgrade
for talks with Milosevic later Tuesday, meeting in the capital
Skopje with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and President Kiro
Gligorov.
	   He also was expected to meet with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, who supports a peaceful settlement but has limited if any
influence over the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The West fears the Kosovo conflict could spread to Macedonia,
which borders on Kosovo and also has a sizeable community of ethnic
Albanians.
	   Holbrooke was credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported Tuesday that 800 Serb civilians
have evacuated one of the remaining Serb enclaves, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of the capital Pristina near the town of Klina.
They said ethnic Albanians had driven them out, burning down houses
there.
	   The Serbs' Media Center also said six more Serbs had been
kidnapped, bringing this week's total to nine.

Netanyahu warns PLO not to go to Security Council on Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sharp exchange over Jerusalem, Israel and
the Palestinians on Tuesday accused each other of violating an
agreement not to make changes in the disputed city until its future
has been decided in peace negotiations.
	   Earlier this week, Israel's Cabinet approved a plan to extend
Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish West Bank
settlements, a step that falls short of annexation but strengthens
ties between the settlements and the city.
	   In response, the Palestinians turned to the U.N. Security
Council, requesting an urgent meeting on the Israeli plan which
they said was aimed at cementing Israeli rule over all of the city.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as a capital. Israel captured east
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, and has said it
would never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday defended the expansion plan, saying it did
not violate interim Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements which
stipulate that neither side should introduce changes in disputed
territory.
	   In a veiled criticism of the United States, Netanyahu said the
``international outrage is exaggerated.''
	   The United States initially called the plan ``provocative.'' On
Tuesday, U.S. State Department James Rubin toned down his reaction
somewhat, saying only that it was ill-timed.
	   Netanyahu warned the Palestinians that if they went ahead with
plans to bring up the Jerusalem plan for debate in the U.N.
Security Council, this would have serious repercussions for Mideast
peacemaking.
	   ``This will cause serious harm to the peace process,'' Netanyahu
said. ``We will not accept this.'' He did not explain what Israel's
response would be, but said in another veiled reference to the
United States that ``those who want make progress in the peace
process should try to stop this.''
	   Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, accused Netanyahu
of doing his utmost to wreck the negotiations.
	   ``He is the last person to speak about harming the peace
process,'' Erekat told The Associated Press, referring to Israeli
practices such as house demolitions in Jerusalem.
	   `The Palestinians are going to the Security Council to protect
the peace process from Netanyahu,'' he said.

Swiss reject wartime Jewish refugee's cash claim 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government has refused a
claim for compensation from a Jewish wartime refugee whose plea for
asylum was rejected during World War II.
	   Joseph Spring lodged a claim for 100,000 Swiss francs (dlrs
66,756) after he and two cousins were twice refused refuge by the
Swiss in 1943 when fleeing the occupying Nazi regime in neighboring
France.
	   In rejecting the claim Tuesday, Switzerland's governing federal
council ruled that the border authorities' refusal to allow Spring
into the country did not constitute complicity to genocide.
	   ``The federal authorities, in contrast to the Nazi regime, have
not been guilty of any war crimes,'' said the federal finance
ministry in its ruling.
	   The council also said the claim had no legal basis. Under Swiss
law, Spring can appeal to Switzerland's supreme court.
	   Spring survived the Holocaust and emigrated to Australia in
1946, but his two cousins were murdered by the Nazis in the
Auschwitz death camp.
	   The case is the second of its type this year. In February, the
Swiss rejected a compensation claim for dlrs 69,000 filed last year
by another World War II Jewish refugee, Charles Sonabend. Sonabend,
66, claimed the country was responsible for his parents' deaths.
	   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, wartime Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews. But it
turned away an equal number.

At least three killed in bus attack in western Rwanda 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At least three children were killed and
four wounded in an attack on a bus in western Rwanda, Radio Rwanda
said Tuesday.
	   The state-run radio said an armed group attacked a bus carrying
both children and adults Monday afternoon in Kivumu commune of the
western Kibuye region, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of the
capital, Kigali.
	   A technical school in Kibuye issued a statement to parents
saying three children were killed and four were wounded in the
attack.
	   The radio said there were no details on how many adults, if any,
had been killed or wounded.
	   The military spokesman and the supervising doctor at Kibuye
hospital could not be reached for comment.
	   An insurgency by former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and militiamen has
spread in recent months from the northwest corner of the country to
western and central Kibuye and Gitarama prefecture. There are
attacks on civilians nearly every week.

Umbrage taken as minister accuses Scots of being polite

	   LONDON (AP) _ Scottish lawmakers took offense Tuesday after a
government minister accused Scottish World Cup fans of being
polite.
	   Six Scots in the House of Commons called on Sports Minister Tony
Banks to ``withdraw this slur on good ambassadors for this
country.''
	   What seemed to annoy the Scots was Banks' suggestion that the
politeness stemmed from a questionable motive.
	   ``They are so determined to show up the English that they are
going out of their way to be unbelievably polite. The Scots are
doing this quite deliberately,'' the Scottish MPs quoted Banks as
saying..
	   A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Banks meant no offense to
the Scots. His comments, the spokesman added, were ``more a dig at
our own fans''.

Oldest human footprints saved for future generations 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
By PAUL HARRIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LANGEBAAN, South Africa (AP) _ Threatened by vandals and
erosion, the oldest-known set of human footprints were plucked from
the earth and ferried by helicopter and truck Monday to a
conservation workshop. They will later go to a museum.
	   For 117,000 years the tiny female footprints, dubbed ``Eve's
Footprints,'' lay undiscovered on the shores of Langebaan Lagoon
about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of Cape Town.
	   But since their discovery in 1995, the delicate tracks have
suffered at the hands of modern man, with visitors scratching their
names near the fossilized footprints and placing their feet in
them.
	   Set in crumbly sandstone, they are also vulnerable to the rain,
wind and waves.
	   ``If human beings don't get the footprints, nature will,'' said
geologist Dave Roberts who discovered them.
	   Aiming to save the prints, geologists and engineers toiled over
the weekend to cut them out in a single block of stone. Supported
by a steel box and covered with conservative resin, the mass was
lifted by helicopter onto a truck for the trip to Cape Town.
	   After a brief stop at an engineering workshop for more
conservation work, the prints will be moved to the city's South
African Museum at the end of this week.
	   A tense and edgy Roberts watched the prints being moved, and
said he would only relax when the steel box is opened and he sees
the prints have survived their journey unscathed.
	   ``I feel a distinct sense of relief,'' he said. ``But we are not
out of the woods yet.''
	   The footprints, 8 1/2 inches (20 centimeters) long, were made by
a person who measured about 5-foot-3 inches (160 centimeters).
	   This small stature led scientists to theorize they were made by
a young woman. Laid on a rainswept sloping dune, they were quickly
buried by wind-blown sand and gradually turned to stone.
	   Although much older footprints of ape-like human ancestors
exist, the tracks are the oldest prints made by anatomically modern
humans, indistinguishable from people living today.
	   Roberts believes it may be possible to follow the footprints
back into a cliff behind the sloping ledge on which they were
found. Prints of other individuals may also be uncovered.
	   Pockmarks on surrounding rocks could be heavily eroded prints
left by children, and Roberts says it would have been unlikely for
early humans to walk alone due to wild animals and rival tribes.
	   If any more ancient footprints are found, they will be preserved
on the site. It is hoped ``Eve's Footprints,'' will eventually be
returned to Langebaan to be housed in a specially-built museum.

	   PARIS (AP) _ At the halfway point of the World Cup, near the end
of a day of dull soccer, an 18-year-old spiced things up.
	   Michael Owen didn't win the game for England, but he tied it
with seven minutes to play and nearly did it again with a 30-yard
blast that hit the post in injury time.
	   In between, Dan Petrescu won a wrestling match with a defender
to score a 90th-minute goal in a thrilling finish for a 2-1 victory
that put Romania into the second round. It also gave everyone in
France a topic other than fan violence to discuss over this
morning's croissants and coffee.
	   ``The second half,'' Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu said,
``was really a wonderful show for all.''
	   The victory brought out tens of thousands of fans in a rainstorm
in Bucharest to celebrate the Romanian triumph.

One dead after collision between Albanian dingy and Italian coast guard ship 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LECCE, Italy (AP) _ An Albanian man died Tuesday after his
dinghy collided with an Italian coast guard vessel on the way home
from what police said was a people-smuggling trip to Italy's
southern coast.
	   Police in Lecce said the two other men aboard the dinghy
survived. They said the coast guard vessel was pursuing the rubber
boat when the collision took place.
	   The victim fell overboard and was rescued by the coast guard
vessel but died later in a hospital, they said.
	   Police have spotted at least 24 vessels in the Adriatic in the
past few weeks bringing Albanians to Italian shores. Many are
fleeing the violence in the Balkan province of Kosovo.
	   Italy is a popular destination for Albanians trying to escape
the poverty and instability of the Balkans. Last year an Albanian
refugee ship sank after colliding with an Italian navy; scores of
people drowned.

</HEADLINE>
EDs: LEADS with Saudis, Kuwaitis talking about more cuts, oil
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Some of the top players in OPEC met
Tuesday and discussed cutting oil production even more than
promised, hoping that might raise recent depressed prices.
	   ``We're all discussing further cuts,'' Kuwaiti oil minister
Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah said after talking privately with Saudi
oil minister Ali Naimi.
	   Sheik Saud would not say, however, whether the Saudis were open
to the idea of reducing their massive output by more than the
225,000 barrels a day that Naimi has already pledged.
	   The Saudis say they will take more barrels off the market than
anybody else, but they are by far the biggest producers and the
Saudi cuts are proportionately smaller than those pledged by other
producers.
	   Most members of OPEC have agreed to restrain production as they
struggle to lift oil prices off of recent 12-year lows.
	   OPEC has gotten a helping hand from non-OPEC producers Mexico,
Russia, Egypt and Oman _ but analysts say the cutbacks pledged thus
far won't be enough to rescue the battered market.
	   Traders are looking for total cuts of 1 million barrels or more,
but the promised reductions thus far come to just 823,000 barrels _
620,000 from OPEC and 203,000 from non-OPEC. And outside experts as
well as people within OPEC have their doubts about whether all the
producers will have the willpower to stick to their pledges.
	   Futures prices have been rising the past two days on speculation
that OPEC might agree to bigger cuts. Brent crude oil to be
delivered in August was up 34 cents per barrel, at dlrs 13.58,
early Tuesday on the International Petroleum Exchange in London,
adding to gains of 39 cents a barrel from Monday's session.
	   OPEC came up short on delivering a first round production cuts
agreed at an emergency meeting in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria acknowledged
Tuesday that some OPEC producers may need to modify the cuts they
have pledged, but he would not elaborate.
	   ``You're jumping the gun,'' Lukman told reporters as more
ministers arrived for the meeting that formally opens Wednesday.
``They haven't even had time to discuss the matter.''
	   OPEC is confronting the lowest oil prices since the disaster
year of 1986 _ thanks to the group's ill-judged decision to produce
more crude in the winter, just as the southeast Asia economic
crisis started killing the growth in global demand.
	   Iran has suggested cutting production by 10 percent across the
board from February's output levels, OPEC delegates say privately.
That's a potentially divisive idea because it would push Saudi
production far lower than the Saudi minister, Naimi, has thus far
agreed.
	   OPEC's average oil price tumbled below dlrs 11 per barrel last
week, although Monday's rally in the futures market pulled the
price back to dlrs 11.43, OPEC said Tuesday afternoon.
	   The average OPEC price is always somewhat lower than the New
York and London futures prices, which represent a premium grade of
oil.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Court convicts newspaper of contempt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The High Court found a major Hong Kong
newspaper guilty of contempt Tuesday for ordering a paparazzi-style
surveillance of a senior judge and printing abusive attacks on the
judiciary.
	   Chief Judge Patrick Chan said the Chinese-language Oriental
Daily News, one of Hong Kong's largest and raciest newspapers, had
``embarked in a campaign against the court.''
	   He said the paper's campaign since last year undermined ``public
confidence in the due administration of justice.''
	   Early this year, Oriental Daily had reporters mount a
paparazzi-style round-the-clock watch on Justice Gerald Godfrey
after he ruled against the paper in a legal battle with a rival
newspaper.
	   The paper said it was dissatisfied that Godfrey had likened a
senior Oriental Daily reporter, who spotted and photographed a
pregnant Hong Kong pop star, to a paparazzo. It said it wanted to
teach the judge ``a lesson'' about how true paparazzi behave.
	   Chan said the paparazzi watch was meant to be revenge, ``to pay
(Godfrey) back'' for his ruling against the paper.
	   Oriental Daily, which has frequent brushes with the law over its
racy contents, had published a series of articles last year that
contained ``abusive and scurrilous attacks and racist slurs''
against judges, Chan added.
	   It had called judges and members of a tribunal policing
pornography ``swinish white-skinned pigs'' and ``yellow-skinned
dogs,'' and warned that it would ``wipe them all out.''
	   The paper also said that it would ``strip (the judges) of their
wigs and robes, and trample them underfoot.''
	   The newspaper's holding company, Oriental Daily Press, and its
then-editor, Wong Yeung-ng, were found guilty of contempt of court.
	   Chan also said Ma Ching-fat, chairman of Oriental Daily Press,
had ``actually instigated the campaign,'' but acquitted him because
of a lack of evidence.
	   Sentencing was deferred until Saturday.
	   The newspaper's behavior has been roundly criticized in Hong
Kong, even by groups that have campaigned for press freedoms.

Iraq sends senior official to OPEC meeting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi delegation left for Austria to
attend a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, the official Iraqi News Agency said Tuesday.
	   The delegation was led by Sami Sharif, undersecretary at the Oil
Ministry, the agency said.
	   The OPEC meeting formally begins Wednesday in Vienna, where
ministers will seek more cuts in oil production to stabilize prices
that have slid to their lowest levels in years.
	   The lower prices make more difficult Iraq's efforts to earn the
dlrs 5.2 billion it is permitted during the current six-month
period of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
	   The program, which started in December 1996, originally
permitted Iraq exports of dlrs 2 billion. But the value was raised
up to dlrs 5.2 bilion in February.

Lithuanians detained in Ukraine, accused of selling Ecstasy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police detained two Lithuanians on
suspicion of trying to sell 910 Ecstasy pills in eastern Ukraine, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The two Lithuanians, whose names were not released, wanted dlrs
10,000 for the drugs, police officials told Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   Ecstasy, a hallucinogenic and stimulant predominantly used in
night clubs and at rave parties, is relatively rare in Ukraine, and
one pill sells for dlrs 20 to dlrs 25, the newspaper said.
	   The pills were apparently produced at a Dutch underground
laboratory and the newspaper said this was a sign that European
drug dealers were trying to expand their markets.

Thai central bank forex dealer moved to inactive post 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The top currency dealer at Thailand's
central bank, accused of playing a crucial role in the debacle that
led to the country's financial crisis last year, has been
transferred to a research post.
	   Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, the bank's chief of money market
operations during the 1997 crisis, was transferred June 8 to the
position of ``specialist'' in the economic research department, a
Bank of Thailand spokesman said Tuesday.
	   As speculators attacked the Thai currency last year, Paiboon
committed nearly dlrs 24 billion of the country's foreign reserves
to defending the Thai baht in forward currency markets. The
strategy nearly exhausted the reserves, forcing the government to
devalue the baht last July 2.
	   Last month, a government panel headed by former central bank
governor Nukul Prachuabmoh blamed Paiboon and other top central
bank officials for letting the crisis spin out of control.
	   All those named have since resigned or been transferred to less
powerful positions.
	   The report said then-governor Rerngchai Marakanond had little
knowledge of foreign exchange markets and so chose to rely on
Paiboon and his staff.
	   But it characterized Paiboon as inexperienced, saying ``he
didn't understand the basic thinking, problems, and techniques'' of
currency market players.
	   Paiboon also had been involved in the bank's campaign to limit
public exposure of its insecure position, making behind-the-scenes
efforts to limit press criticism.
	   In mid-1996, for example, the International Monetary Fund
sounded a warning to the Thai government that a crisis was looming,
saying Thailand's fixed exchange rate system was unsustainable.
When a copy of the report was leaked to a news agency, Paiboon
accused a reporter of breaching ``national security.''
	   Last year, when an economist expressed doubt about the accuracy
of reserves data being reported by the central bank, Paiboon vowed
to get even.
	   ``We'll make them suffer,'' he said of the investment house for
which the economist worked. His analysis, that the central bank was
disguising the drop in reserves through its strategy of intervening
to defend the baht in forward markets, turned out to be correct. A
few months later, the government devalued the baht and revealed
that the baht defense had nearly exhausted reserves.
	   The bank spokesman declined to say Tuesday why Paiboon was
transferred, but he said the transfer order was signed by Bank of
Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul. That order said Paiboon's
salary and perks will not be affected by the job change. Paiboon
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
	   He was replaced by Pongpen Ruengwirayudh, who also assumed
Paiboon's duties as assistant director of the banking department.

Suu Kyi's party demands military regime convene Parliament 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The opposition party led by Nobel Peace
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi demanded Tuesday that the military regime
convene by Aug. 21 the pro-democracy Parliament elected in 1990 but
never allowed to meet.
	   The demand marked the first time Suu Kyi's National League for
Democracy had set a deadline for the military to convene
Parliament. It was unclear what would happen if the ruling council
of generals refused to comply, as is likely.
	   The ruling State Peace and Development Council reversed an order
banning Suu Kyi's party from holding a congress May 27-28 and let a
gathering go ahead commemorating the anniversary of the 1990
elections, in which the NLD won 392 of 485 seats.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962, refused to honor the result when it became clear that
pro-military parties had lost.
	   The May congress decided that a deadline would be set for the
Parliament to meet, with the date to be determined later. The NLD
issued the demand Tuesday, signed by Chairman Aung Shwe, giving the
government 60 days.
	   The demand looks unlikely to break the deadlock between Suu Kyi,
who has consistently sought a dialogue with the generals, and the
government, which refuses to meet her. The government has said a
new constitution needs to be drafted and new elections held.
	   In 1995, the NLD walked out of a constitution-drafting assembly
it said was rigged in favor of prolonged military rule. The body
has not met since March 1996.
	   Suu Kyi, who vaulted to prominence during anti-government
protests in 1988 that were bloodily suppressed, has been under
house arrest or close confinement for most of the last nine years.
Hundreds of her supporters are in jail.
	   The NLD has been decimated since the 1990 poll victory. A
quarter of the victors have been imprisoned or exiled. Two have
died in prison.

Troops continue to mass along front with Eritrea despite calm 
</HEADLINE>
By ABEBE ANDUALEM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia continued to send troops
to its common border with Eritrea Tuesday, preparing for a possible
resumption of fighting after two weeks of calm, state radio and
television reported.
	   On Monday, the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front, the key faction
the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front,
called on citizens to ``take up arms to teach an unforgettable
lesson to the invading Eritrean army.''
	   The TPLF call was issued in commemoration of the 10th
anniversary of an air raid by the former military government on a
market in Howzen in northern Tigray region, home to many of the
rebels who succeeded in overthrowing the 17-year rule of Col. Haile
Mengistu Mariam in 1991.
	   Eritrean rebels helped their Ethiopian counterparts and were
rewarded with independence in 1993.
	   On May 6 fighting broke out between the former allies over
disputed territory along their common border. Several Eritrean
officers were killed.
	   After several cross-border air raids and artillery attacks that
began June 5, fighting has ebbed in recent weeks, with no confirmed
battles in the last 12 days.
	   Government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse denied reports of fresh
skirmishes at any of the three fronts.
	   But despite the calm, witnesses said militiamen continued to
arrive by the busload at various places at the front, particularly
at the border town of Zala Ambessa, 600 kilometers (372 miles)
north of Addis Ababa.
	   Selome said she had no figures on how many army troops and
civilian militia volunteers had massed along the border.
	   Both sides have agreed to a U.S.-brokered June 14 moratorium on
air strikes.
	   Officials of the Addis-based Organization of African Unity, who
are trying to facilitate a peaceful conclusion to the crisis, have
said both Ethiopia and Eritrea have committed to ceasing
hostilities while peaceful options are explored.
	   But a diplomat in Addis Ababa, who asked not to be further
identified, said tensions appeared to be on the rise.
	   Ethiopia has insisted that it will not negotiate until Eritrea
withdraws to positons held before May 6.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. World Food Program said Tuesday that it was
arranging to ship 240,000 metric tons of relief food for several
million Ethiopians who were suffering from shortages before the
fighting broke out.
	   The agency said it will be able to move at least 30,000 tons of
food into Ethiopia each month.
	   WFP cited complications arising from possible congestion in the
port of Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden, which now handles all
shipments to landlocked Ethiopia.
	   Before fighting began, many of the goods destined for Ethiopia
passed through Eritrea's Red Sea port of Assab, which is now closed
to Ethiopian traffic.

Netanyahu warns PLO not to go to Security Council on Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sharp exchange over Jerusalem, Israel and
the Palestinians on Tuesday accused each other of violating an
agreement not to make changes in the disputed city until its future
has been decided in peace negotiations.
	   Earlier this week, Israel's Cabinet approved a plan to extend
Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish West Bank
settlements, a step that falls short of annexation but strengthens
ties between the settlements and the city.
	   In response, the Palestinians turned to the U.N. Security
Council, requesting an urgent meeting on the Israeli plan which
they said was aimed at cementing Israeli rule over all of the city.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as a capital. Israel captured east
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, and has said it
would never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday defended the expansion plan, saying it did
not violate interim Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements which
stipulate that neither side should introduce changes in disputed
territory.
	   In a veiled criticism of the United States, Netanyahu said the
``international outrage is exaggerated.''
	   The United States initially called the plan ``provocative.'' On
Tuesday, U.S. State Department James Rubin toned down his reaction
somewhat, saying only that it was ill-timed.
	   Netanyahu warned the Palestinians that if they went ahead with
plans to bring up the Jerusalem plan for debate in the U.N.
Security Council, it would have serious repercussions for Mideast
peacemaking.
	   ``This will cause serious harm to the peace process,'' Netanyahu
said. ``We will not accept this.'' He did not explain what Israel's
response would be, but said in another veiled reference to the
United States that ``those who want make progress in the peace
process should try to stop this.''

Turkey condemns Armenian statement on Nagorno-Karabakh 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Tuesday condemned Armenia's
threat to unite with the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh lies inside Azerbaijan but is populated largely
by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in early 1988 and
drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   Last week, Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian said that
if Azerbaijan refuses to change its stance in long-stalled peace
talks, Armenia might one day agree to Nagorno-Karabakh's requests
to unite.
	   Turkey, which has close ethnic and cultural ties with
Azerbaijan, reacted angrily.
	   In a statement, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Oskanian's
statement could have ``very dangerous consequences for peace'' and
``once again discloses the real aims and the intransigent attitude
of Armenia'' in the negotiations.

U.S. Jews: won't curb contributions despite conversion controversy 
</HEADLINE>
By MASHA HERBST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Jews will keep donating money to Israel
despite misgivings about attempts by ultra-Orthodox rabbis to
restrict the influence of more liberal streams of Judaism, the head
of the United Jewish Appeal said Tuesday.
	   The UJA is the main fund-raising arm of American Jewry. The
Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism, which are trying to
gain a foothold in Israel against Orthodox objections, are
predominant among U.S. Jews.
	   Reform and Conservative rabbis have sought court recognition for
conversions performed by them in Israel. In response, Orthodox
rabbis have introduced legislation that would formalize the status
quo under which only Orthodox conversions are recognized. The
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to
mediate a compromise, to no avail.
	   Referring to the controversy, UJA chairwoman Carole Solomon told
parliament's Committee for Immigrant Absorption, said: ``The United
Jewish Appeal ... doesn't support any initiative that would make
any Jew feel disenfranchised or any less a part of the Jewish
state.''
	   However, American Jews ``are extremely committed and will remain
committed'' to giving to Israel, she said.
	   ``The commitment and purpose of what we have always been about
is not diminished one iota,'' Solomon said.

Cost of Moscow storm estimated at 1 billion rubles 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The estimated cost of cleaning up after a freak
weekend storm in Moscow rose 10 times on Tuesday to 1 billion
rubles (dlrs 166 million), city officials said. The death toll was
lowered to eight from nine.
	   Between 50,000 and 80,000 trees and 462 billboards were
destroyed in the storm Saturday night, according Boris Nikolsky, an
aide to Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. He also said 80 kilometers (50 miles)
of power lines were downed.
	   A thunderstorm, bearing near-hurricane force winds, raged for
about 30 minutes, uprooting trees, smashing windows and flattening
small shops. The Bolshoi Theater, Kremlin walls and Moskva Hotel
near Red Square were all damaged.
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), but
whirlwinds in some places gusted much higher, according to the
Moscow weather center.

Russia criticizes move to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Ministry accused Israel on
Tuesday of violating international law by planning to extend the
Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish settlements on the
West Bank.
	   Israel's decision, announced earlier this week, falls short of
annexation but would strengthen ties between the settlements and
the city.
	   The Foreign Ministry called the decision ``unacceptable''
because it would preempt Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the
ultimate status of the Palestinian-inhabited territories, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   In a statement, the ministry called on Israel to refrain from
unilateral actions and take a ``constructive approach'' to
relations with its Arab neighbors, Interfax said.
	   The Palestinians have accused Israel of trying to cement its
rule over the area, and have requested an urgent meeting of the
U.N. Security Council.

U.N.: `AIDS gap' putting have-nots in danger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Continuing lack of awareness of the ``silent
epidemic'' of AIDS is fueling alarming HIV infection rates in many
developing countries, U.N. experts said in a report Tuesday.
	   Lack of education about the virus is a major hurdle with an
effective cure ``at least 10 years'' away, UNAIDS Director-General
Peter Piot told a news conference.
	   Poor access to new therapies and treatment for AIDS-related
infections such as tuberculosis and diarrhea is the ``overwhelming
issue'' for some 90 percent of those living with the AIDS virus,
the World Health Organization and UNAIDS report said.
	   Decreasing infection rates in some countries are ``eclipsed'' by
huge rates in countries like South Africa, Piot said.
	   ``Let's be very aware AIDS is with us to stay for a very long
time,'' Piot said.
	   Some 2.9 million South Africans were living with the virus at
the end of 1997, 700,000 of them infected last year alone, the
study said. Almost 13 percent of adults aged between 15 and 49 were
infected.
	   The United States figure was 0.76 percent _ 820,000 people in
total. It was under one percent across Western Europe.
	   Zimbabwe and Botswana, where UNAIDS estimates around one in four
adults carry HIV, had the highest infection rates.
	   Political courage to prevent the spread of AIDS is the key to
narrowing the ``AIDS gap,'' Piot said, praising efforts in Uganda,
Thailand and Senegal.
	   North Africa and the Middle East are ``the great unknown,'' with
cultural difficulties in talking about the epidemic hampering
collection of statistics, UNAIDS said.
	   The report provided country-by-country statistics to back a
study released last November, which said some 5.8 million people
were infected in 1997, up from 5.3 million people the year before.
	   A total of 30.6 million live with HIV or AIDS globally,
two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa, it said.
	   The report estimated that 2.3 million people died of AIDS in
1997, up 50 percent increase on 1996.
	   The latest study comes ahead of the opening in Geneva Sunday of
the 12th World AIDS Conference, where 12,000 specialists and others
will discuss advances in HIV research.
	   Politicians' involvement in the conference and other efforts
against AIDS is crucial to combating the disease, Piot said.

Izetbegovic wants Dayton implemented, or changed 
</HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Muslim president
Alija Izetbegovic said in comments published Tuesday that he wants
the Dayton peace agreement either fully implemented, or revised.
	   If Bosnian Serb and Croat hard-liners again triumph in September
elections, Bosnia's Muslims ``will rightfully request either the
total implementation of the Dayton peace agreement or its
alteration to ensure the proper functioning of the state,''
Izetbegovic told the Sarajevo daily Vecernje Novine.
	   Izetbegovic, leader of Bosnia's Muslims throughout the 1992-5
war, said he was aware how difficult it would be to undo the treaty
he helped negotiate in Dayton, Ohio in late 1995. But his request
reflects growing Bosnian and international impatience at the
continuing staying power of hard-liners.
	   Izetbegovic's Muslim party shares federal power with the Bosnian
Serb Democratic Party and the Croatian Democratic Union, both of
whom would rather see the country divided. Bosnia was partitioned
by Dayton into two halves, a Bosnian Serb half, and a Muslim-Croat
half. A three-person executive _ Muslim, Serb and Croat _ rules the
whole state.
	   Izetbegovic's side was long the only one in power which
supported a unified country.
	   Last January, Milorad Dodik, an open supporter of Dayton, gained
power in the Bosnian Serb Republic.
	   Kresimir Zubak, Croat member of the presidency, has now turned
his back on the policy of division, forming his own party that is
likely to be more supportive of unifying the country.
	   If moderates win backing at September elections, there is a
chance for real peace in Bosnia, Izetbegovic said. If not, the
Muslims will not tolerate it, he added.
	   ``We will surely not accept matters remaining unresolved and
half-way down the road. We have enough jokers not to consent to
anything like that,'' he told the newspaper. Izetbegovic did not
reveal what he meant by ``jokers.''
	   Foreigners too, particularly Americans, want to see change and
``some kind of end to their presence in Bosnia,'' he added. ``We
think the condition for their departure is the arrival in power of
political forces that accept Bosnia as a united and democratic
country.''

EU finance chief urges Japan to act quickly against crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union Finance Commissioner
Yves-Thibault de Silguy on Tuesday urged Japan to take urgent steps
to tackle the steep decline of its economy.
	   ``Measures have to be taken urgently and steadfastly to reverse
the current trend,'' de Silguy told the European Parliament's
monetary subcommittee.
	   He said Japan should rapidly implement a package of stimulus
measures announced in April and structural reforms to restore
confidence in Japan and other east Asian economies which have been
shaken by months of financial turmoil.
	   De Silguy cautioned against interest rate cuts or higher public
deficits, given the fact that interest rates are already quite low
and the public deficit and debt levels are high.
	   He said further damage in Asia cannot be excluded, particularly
if China devalues its currency, the yuan, to survive the currency
shock.
	   Earlier this month China's Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng
said that his government was standing by its policy of maintaining
the yuan's value, even though this is hurting Chinese exports.
	   De Silguy said that although the situation in Japan is
``worrisome,'' it should not affect EU growth.
	   If the EU were to revise its economic growth forecasts for the
15-nation bloc, ``they certainly wouldn't be revised lower,'' de
Silguy said.
	   He added growth was 3.2 percent in the EU during the first
quarter of 1998. Latest EU forecasts published in March pegged
growth in the 15-nation EU at 2.8 percent this year and 3.0 percent
in 1999.

Spaniard gives himself up after hijacking domestic flight cellular phone communication between hostages and police, CORRECTS, from original source that pyschiatrist not flown to Valencia

Eds: UPDATES with hijacker ``short-circuiting;'' details of
<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish man who hijacked a domestic
Iberia Air Lines flight with 131 people aboard and demanded to be
flown to Tel Aviv surrendered peacefully to police after speaking
to his psychiatrist, authorities said.
	   The hijacker, identified as Javier Gomez, said he had
``short-circuited,'' police chief Juan Cotino told reporters in the
aftermath of four-hour standoff that had sent Spanish special
security forces into action.
	   It turned out that Gomez was unarmed when he forced Iberia's
flight 1121 between Seville and Barcelona to land in Valencia's
Manises airport in eastern Spain at 8:40 a.m. (0640GMT), Interior
Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Gomez was brandishing a remote control device and threatening to
explode a bomb, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Once Gomez had identified himself to police surrounding the
aircraft, it was discovered he was under psychiatric treatment. His
doctor persuaded him to give up in a cellular call from Seville.
Authorities earlier reported the psychiatrist was flown to
Valencia.
	   Several of the hostages, including Seville Mayor Soledad
Becerril and city councilor Jose Antonio Aguirre, were able to talk
to police and family using their cellular phones during the hijack.
	   Becerril and Aguirre were on their way to a meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland, to promote Seville's candidacy to hold the 2008
Olympics. After their release, most passengers continued on to
Barcelona, although Becerril's office reported she had missed her
connection and was returning to Seville.
	   Before giving himself up, Gomez had released 18 people from the
aircraft, most of them children. The remaining passengers and the
crew left the plane immediately after he surrendered.
	   The authorities originally reported that the plane had been
hijacked by three armed people who demanded to be taken to Tel
Aviv.
	   The Israeli Ambassador to Spain, Ehud Gol, said Gomez first
demanded to fly to Athens, but then changed his demand to Tel Aviv.
	   Gol said Israel had asked Spanish authorities not to permit the

police after holding an Algerian airliner with 35 people aboard for
eight hours. The bomb they claimed could blow up the aircraft
turned out to be a box containing a coffee grinder.

Myanmar leader says Western powers using media 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A senior general in Myanmar's military
government has accused Western powers of trying to discredit the
country by spreading lies through the news media.
	   Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the powerful head of military intelligence,
accused what he called ``neocolonialist countries'' of ``attempting
to dominate and control Myanmar.''
	   Khin Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the ruling State
Peace and Development Council, spoke Monday to open a conference of
the Myanmar Writers and Journalists Association, and urged members
to instill patriotism in the public.
	   Khin Nyunt accused hostile nations of ``disseminating fabricated
information and false accusations, through their own media,
orchestrated with their lackeys in the country, to discredit and
create false impressions of the country.''
	   The military regime has long accused the West of trying to
control Myanmar, also known as Burma, and of plotting with Aung San
Suu Kyi, leader of the stifled pro-democracy movement and winner of
the Nobel Peace Prize, to do so.
	   The suggestion that the international news media were being
manipulated marked a slight departure from the government's usual
accusations that the press is biased toward Suu Kyi, who has spent
most of the past nine years under house arrest or tight
restrictions.
	   ``They are misusing the power of the media for subversive
purposes, interfering with Myanmar's national sovereignty, and also
belittling Myanmar's culture and tradition aimed at imposing their
own Western culture in the country,'' Khin Nyunt said.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962. The current
generation of ruling generals came to power in 1988 after putting
down anti-government protests, killing thousands.
	   The government has since opened the country to foreign
investment but keeps a tight lid on dissent. Washington imposed
sanctions a year ago to stop U.S. companies from making new
investments in Myanmar.
	   Khin Nyunt called the sanctions ``weapons to interfere in the
internal affairs of developing countries'' and said that the
current Asian economic crisis resulted ``from outside
manipulation.''

India, Pakistan can talk at July South Asian summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpaypee looks to an upcoming regional summit as a chance to
improve relations with neighbor and rival Pakistan after weeks of
nuclear tension, an official said Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in host Sri Lanka on Tuesday
announced a three-day meeting of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation will begin in the Sri Lankan capital July 29.
	   The group comprises India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Nepal and the Maldives.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub has said the summit would
provide an opportunity for Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to meet.
	   Indian foreign office spokesman K.C. Singh said Tuesday that
Vajpayee had sent a letter June 14 to Sharif expressing the need to
improve ties with Pakistan. The longtime rivals have fought three
wars since both gained independence from Britain in 1947, and their
series of tit-for-tat nuclear tests raised fears of regional
nuclear war.
	   ``Vajpayee also conveyed to the Pakistan prime minister that the
presence of the two prime ministers in Colombo would enable them to
hold bilateral dialogue on all issues of mutual interest and also
decide on how to proceed further with dialogue,'' Singh told
reporters. The letter had not been public until Sharif mentioned it
to reporters in Pakistan Monday.
	   Pakistan's foreign office refused comment on Vajpayee's letter.
	   Discussions between Vajpayee and Sharif are likely to focus on
the troubled northern state of Kashmir, two thirds of which is
controlled by New Delhi and the rest by Islamabad. Both countries
have for years staked claim to the whole of the province, over
which they have fought two wars since independence from British
colonial rule in 1947.
	   Foreign office spokesman Tariq Altaf said at a recent briefing
that Pakistan is ready to hold bilateral talks with India although
it has repeatedly been disappointed by one-on-one negotiations.
	   Altaf said Pakistan sees international mediation as the only way
to find a solution to the Kashmir dispute. India resists anything
seen as outside pressure.
	   Pakistan wants residents of both sides of Kashmir to be allowed
to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan, but such a
plebiscite, as outlined in decades-old U.N. resolutions, is opposed
by India.
	   During last year's South Asian summit in Male, capital of the
Indian Ocean archipelago of Maldives, then Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral of India and Sharif met and launched a series of talks
at lower levels on their disputes, but those talks got bogged down.

Graf brought to tears by return to Wimbledon; rain holds up Tuesday
Eds: Updates with rain delay in grafs 5-7
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Just being back at Wimbledon was
enough to bring Steffi Graf to tears.
	   A year ago, the seven-time champion was in rehabilitation after
reconstructive knee surgery. Two months ago, her comeback
threatened by more injuries, she considered retirement.
	   So on Monday, after winning her first-round match in straight
sets on Centre Court, Graf was overcome by emotion. Twice during a
news conference, she broke down crying.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' said the German, playing her 13th Wimbledon. ``It's just
special to be here.''
	   After a rain-free opening day, the start of Tuesday's play was
delayed by light showers. At 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), all courts remained
covered.
	   While tournament officials were hopeful of a break in the
weather, more rain was forecast for Tuesday afternoon and
Wednesday.
	   Graf's tears represented a remarkable display from a player who
has rarely expressed her emotions on or off the court.
	   Graf said, 6th graf

Yeltsin spokesman says impeachment effort waste of time 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman said Tuesday
that an attempt to impeach the Russian leader was a waste of time.
	   ``It simply takes up the precious time which is needed for
working on concrete documents and laws,'' Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
reporters.
	   The lower house of the Russian parliament voted Friday to set up
a commission to draw up formal charges against Yeltsin that would
serve as a legal foundation for impeachment.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of several
transgressions, including instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining Russia's
economy.
	   Several previous attempts to impeach Yeltsin have failed, and
this one is likely to meet a similar fate.
	   Once the indictment is prepared, a two-thirds majority of the
450 Duma members is needed to launch the impeachment motion. Then
it would have to win confirmation from both the Constitutional and
Supreme Courts, as well as the upper chamber of parliament, the
Federation Council.

Spaniard gives himself up after hijacking domestic flight cellular phone communication between hostages and police, CORRECTS, from original source that pyschiatrist not flown to Valencia, CORRECTS slug 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with hijacker ``short-circuiting;'' details of
<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish man who hijacked a domestic
Iberia Air Lines flight with 131 people aboard and demanded to be
flown to Tel Aviv surrendered peacefully to police after speaking
to his psychiatrist, authorities said.
	   The hijacker, identified as Javier Gomez, said he had
``short-circuited,'' police chief Juan Cotino told reporters in the
aftermath of four-hour standoff.
	   After he surrendered police discovered Gomez was unarmed when he
forced Iberia's flight 1121 between Seville and Barcelona to land
in Valencia's Manises airport in eastern Spain at 8:40 a.m.
(0640GMT), Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Gomez was brandishing a remote control device and threatening to
explode a bomb, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Once Gomez had identified himself to police surrounding the
aircraft, it was discovered he was under psychiatric treatment. His
doctor persuaded him to give up in a cellular phone call from
Seville. Authorities earlier reported the psychiatrist was flown to
Valencia.
	   Several of the hostages, including Seville Mayor Soledad
Becerril and city councilor Jose Antonio Aguirre, were able to talk
to police and family using their cellular phones during the hijack.
	   Becerril and Aguirre were on their way to a meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland, to promote Seville's candidacy to hold the 2008
Olympics. After their release, most passengers continued on to
Barcelona, although Becerril's office reported she had missed her
connection and was returning to Seville.
	   Before giving himself up, Gomez had released 18 people from the
aircraft, most of them children. The remaining passengers and the
crew left the plane immediately after he surrendered.
	   The authorities originally reported that the plane had been
hijacked by three armed people who demanded to be taken to Tel
Aviv.
	   The Israeli Ambassador to Spain, Ehud Gol, said Gomez first
demanded to fly to Athens, but then changed his demand to Tel Aviv.
	   Gol said Israel had asked Spanish authorities not to permit the
plane to take off.
	   The last Iberia Air Lines plane to be hijacked was in 1996 when
a Lebanese man held an aircraft with 236 people aboard in Miami
after forcing a diversion from its Madrid to Havanna, Cuba, route.
	   Two years before that three Algerians gave themselves up to
police after holding an Algerian airliner with 35 people aboard for
eight hours. The bomb they claimed could blow up the aircraft
turned out to be a box containing a coffee grinder.

President, opposition leader claim victory in Togolese vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Supporters of President Gnassigbe Eyadema and
self-exiled opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio have claimed
victory for their candidates in presidential elections.
	   But the national election commission, which was supposed to have
released the results of the Sunday voting at a Tuesday morning
press conference, canceled the briefing at the last minute.
	   Interior Minister Gen. Seyi Memene said in a statement read
Tuesday on state radio that there was a clear indication from
ballot papers that Eyadema would win the vote outright.
	   But Bob Akitani, vice president of Olympio's party, said Olympio
had won 70 percent of the vote in southern Togo and 55 percent in
the north, putting him in a position to win.
	   Neither official, though, released specific details that could
back up their assertions.
	   Sunday's vote was the first round in presidential elections. If
a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, he automatically
becomes president. If not, the two top vote-getters face off in the
second round.
	   Eyadema was widely expected to make it to the second round.
	   Olympio, while the best known of Eyadema's five challengers, had
not been expected to reach the second round.
	   The son of Togo's first president _ who was killed in 1963 by a
military junta led by Eyadema _ Olympio fled to Ghana last year
after a series of attempts on his life, including a failed
assassination attempt in 1992 that seriously wounded him. It was
not clear whether he returned to Togo for the election.
	   Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support in the country's south,
and Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support
among Togo's intellectual class, were considered the two candidates
with the best chances of reaching the second round.
	   Eyadema ruled this tiny French-speaking country wedged between
Ghana and Benin as a military dictator for 26 years, until he won
widely criticized elections in 1993.
	   For the past two months, the president has launched a massive
television and radio campaign to assure another term in power,
while relegating opposition candidates to occasional slices of
airtime.

Northern European countries worried about Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NYBORG, Denmark (AP) _ Foreign ministers from countries
surrounding the Baltic Sea expressed concern Tuesday that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic will continue a crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Denmark's Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said there was
``a considerable amount of skepticism'' about Milosevic's pledge to
resume talks with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, made in
Moscow last week.
	   At the end of the two-day meeting in Nyborg, 150 kilometers (90
miles) west of Copenhagen, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov declined to comment. However, a senior U.S. diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia also had expressed
uncertainty that Milosevic will live up to his promise.
	   Russia, traditionally a Serb ally, has said it will try to
persuade Belgrade to ease up its attacks in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   ``Russia has done its very best but there are some doubts about
(Milosevic's) willingness,'' Helveg Petersen told reporters.
	   The foreign ministers from 11 countries also discussed human
rights in the Baltic Sea region where relations are strained
between Russia and its neighbors Estonia and Latvia over the
treatment of large Russian minorities in the two former Soviet
republics.
	   On Monday, Latvian lawmakers approved an amendment to a
citizenship law which says that all children born in the country
since it became independent from Russia in 1991 will automatically
be entitled to Latvian citizenship.
	   Primakov declined to comment on the amendment, but other
participants at the meeting said it was an important step for
integration in the Baltic region.
	   The meeting was attended by foreign ministers from Denmark,
Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Germany, as well as Iceland and Norway.

explode a bomb, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Once Gomez had identified himself to police surrounding the
aircraft, it was discovered he was under psychiatric treatment. His
doctor, Ildefonso Mateo, persuaded him to give up in a cellular
call from Seville.
	   ``After talking to him for four minutes, he softened and the
situation was resolved,'' Mateo said on Spanish television.
	   Authorities earlier reported the psychiatrist was flown to
Valencia.
	   Several of the hostages, including Seville Mayor Soledad
Becerril and city councilor Jose Antonio Aguirre, were able to talk
to police and family using their cellular phones during the hijack.
	   Becerril and Aguirre were on their way to a meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland, to promote Seville's candidacy to hold the 2008
Olympics. After their release, most passengers continued on to
Barcelona, although Becerril's office reported she had missed her
connection and was returning to Seville.
	   Before giving himself up, Gomez had released 18 people from the
aircraft, most of them children. The remaining passengers and the
crew left the plane immediately after he surrendered.
	   The authorities originally reported that the plane had been
hijacked by three armed people who demanded to be taken to Tel
Aviv.
	   The Israeli Ambassador to Spain, Ehud Gol, said Gomez first
demanded to fly to Athens, but then changed his demand to Tel Aviv.
	   Gol said Israel had asked Spanish authorities not to permit the
plane to take off.
	   The last Iberia Air Lines to be hijacked was in 1996 when a
Lebanese man held an aircraft with 236 people aboard in Miami after
forcing a diversion from its Madrid to Havanna, Cuba, route.
	   The last hijacking in Spain was two years before that on the
island of Mallorca where three Algerians gave themselves up to
police after holding an Algerian airliner with 35 people aboard for
eight hours. The bomb they claimed could blow up the aircraft
turned out to be a box containing a coffee grinder.

Singapore minister: Economic crisis most important event for Asia since WWII 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The economic crisis afflicting formerly
prosperous Asia is the most important event to shape the region
since World War II, a Singapore Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
	   ``All over Asia, economic and political structures have come
under great stress,'' Information and Arts Minister George Yeo said
while opening a conference on the regional crisis. ``Historically
speaking, this is the most important event reshaping the whole of
Asia since the second world war.''
	   Speaking to political and business leaders from around the
world, Yeo said the current turmoil ``is not a normal cycle which
will lead us back to more or less where we were before,'' but a
``major historical process'' that will change Asia irrevocably.
	   He said that how long the crisis will last or how severe it
might become are anyone's guess, and warned that Asia's slowdown
could spread like a contagion.
	   ``Its effects on North America and Europe can already be felt
and there is a risk that the Asian economic crisis could lead
eventually to a world economic crisis.''
	   Yeo stressed the critical role that U.S.-Japan relations, an
ascendant China, and the rise of a global market and information
technology all have to play in the formula for Asian success or
failure.
	   He said there was no substitute for U.S. leadership in the
foreseeable future since Japan remains ``politically weak,'' though
when change comes, Japan will shift ``suddenly, decisively and
comprehensively.'' Yeo also expressed concern over the United
State's increasing current account deficit.
	   ``We thus have a (dangerous) situation where the greatest power
on earth is also the world's largest debtor nation, while the
world's greatest creditor nation is, for historical reasons, unable
to lead.''
	   Yeo praised China for its recent decision not to devalue its
currency, saying that the country is ``willing to pay the price for
this decision because of its concern over Hong Kong and its sense
of regional responsibility.''
	   He said Asia must evolve from the ``old economic and political
institutions'' and adopt ``good leadership, good government and
wider political participation.''
	   Yeo also warned that the international financial markets ``must
somehow be tamed'' to create greater stability, though he conceded
that no one yet knows how to achieve this.

India considers Kashmir fence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ India's internal security minister said
Tuesday the country would consider fencing off its share of
disputed Kashmir to prevent attacks on Hindus by Muslims it charges
are trained and armed by neighboring Pakistan.
	   Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani spoke to about 500 terrified
Hindus in Doda, where attackers armed with AK-47 rifles shot and
killed 25 people last week. Doda is 150 kilometers (90 miles) south
of Srinagar, summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   Muslim militants who have been fighting a separatist war since
1989 frequently target the Doda area because Hindus are
concentrated there. Kashmir is India's only Muslim majority state.
	   Advani assured survivors in Doda that the military would
intensify patrols on the disputed border with Pakistan and consider
building a fence to check infiltration by guerrillas. India accuses
Pakistan of arming and training the guerrillas, a charge Islamabad
denies.
	   Pakistan says it will not allow India to build a barbed-wire
barrier along the disputed Jammu-Kashmir border.
	   Repeated attempts by the Indian army in the recent past to start
fencing a 210-kilometer (140-mile) stretch were abandoned when they
were fired upon by Pakistani soldiers across the border.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over the
control of Kashmir, since they won independence from Britain.
Kashmir is divided between them, with both sides claiming the
region in its entirety.
	   In Islamabad Tuesday, newspapers reported that Pakistan's Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif reiterated his call for international
mediation in the Kashmir dispute, and officials and witnesses
reported Indian soldiers reportedly shelled Pakistani territory the
day before, killing two people and injuring two others.
	   Indian officials had no immediate comment on the shelling.
Monday, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said he wanted
talks on Kashmir, but would not accept outside mediation.
	   Vajpayee, a foreign office spokesman said Tuesday, has written
Sharif that he wants improved relations and is looking forward to
talks along the sidelines of an upcoming regional summit. Officials
announced Tuesday that the summit of seven regional leaders would
be held July 29-31 in neighboring Sri Lanka.

U.S. music festival asks China to let banned opera travel 
</HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ The head of a New York music festival
lobbied Chinese censors Tuesday to let an opera troupe criticized
as ``feudal and pornographic'' perform in New York.
	   The timing of the dispute couldn't be more inconvenient for
Shanghai leaders, who are eager to highlight the city's
re-emergence as a commercial and cultural center during a stopover
by U.S. President Bill Clinton next week during a state visit to
China.
	   Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival '98, came
to Shanghai after the city's Cultural Bureau blocked plans to allow
the performance of the ``Peony Pavilion,'' a 400-year-old love
story. An elaborate 20-hour production of the opera is scheduled to
take place over six evenings beginning July 7.
	   Redden wouldn't give any details of his talks with Cultural
Bureau officials, but said he was optimistic the Shanghai Kunqu
Opera Company might be allowed to perform. The troupe also is
scheduled to appear at festivals in Hong Kong and Sydney.
	   A Cultural Bureau official who would only give his name as Mr.
Feng confirmed the troupe was barred from going to New York, but
would not give a reason.
	   A state-run newspaper last week criticized the production by
director Chen Shizheng, a Chinese-born American, as ``feudal,
superstitious and pornographic garbage.''
	   ``If one deliberately seeks to show the backwardness of the past
... and to cater to shallow curiosity about Oriental culture from
the angle of Westerners, that is unworthy,'' the Wen Hui Bao
newspaper said Saturday.
	   Chen complained last week that Chinese officials had pressured
him to make extensive changes.
	   Fueled by robust economic growth, Shanghai is trying to
recapture its pre-war status as the Chinese center for film, music
and the arts.
	   In the past three years, the city has refurbished its film
studio and opened a new library and the Shanghai Museum, the first
serious Chinese contender to become a world-class museum. Touring
foreign symphony orchestras and dance groups visit with increasing
frequency. A stylish new music hall is nearing completion in the
city center.
	   But the dispute over the ``Peony Pavilion'' highlights the fact
that control over culture still rests with communist officials who
may subject them to ideological tests.
	   U.S. diplomats have tried to mediate the dispute, but Washington
has taken no official position, said Anthony Sariti, the official
in charge of cultural affairs for the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai.
	   Sariti said he saw part of the opera during a three-night dress
rehearsal earlier this month. He said that although some of the
dialog was bawdy, there was no overt sexuality and nothing a U.S.
audience would find offensive.
	   ``By American standards, it had very high production standards
and very interesting staging,'' including a pond with real ducks
and fish, Sariti said.

Politicians and business give new package largely positive review

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Politicians, analysts and business leaders on
Tuesday generally praised the government's plan to boost the
recession-bound economy _ including freezing property sales _ but
agreed that Hong Kong faced more hardships.
	   The largest political party, the Democrats, said they supported
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's new policies, but added that
suspending land sales for nine months eventually could result in a
housing shortage.
	   ``If the property market bounces back, the government would be
tied up with no other measures to increase the supply of land and
fight property speculation,'' said Sin Chung-kai, the Democrats'
economic spokesman.
	   Sin called for three-month suspensions, allowing the government
greater flexibility.
	   The Democrats, who are broadly critical of the Beijing
government and Tung, hold 13 seats in the legislature that was
elected May 24. With smaller allies, they account for one-third of
Hong Kong's 60-seat legislature.
	   ``The consensus is that nine months would send a negative
message to the market,'' said Sin.
	   With property prices down 40 percent from their peak last July,
the property sector _ ordinarily one of Hong Kong's biggest earners
_ is struggling to keep afloat. Much of the attention on the
latest, 32 billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 4.1 billion) program was
focused on boosting the property sector.
	   The government also is returning about 4 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 517 million) in real estate taxes. Another 2 billion
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 208 million) will be made available to
small- and medium-size businesses to help them secure credit, and
more money also will be made available to help first-time home
buyers. Businesses will be able to exempt their profits from taxes
if they keep them in Hong Kong banks.
	   Hong Kong stocks were little changed at the market's close
Tuesday. The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed at 8,219.67, up 15.46
points in volatile trading.
	   Analysts believe that even if it looked like Tung was buckling
under pressure from big property developers, the decision to halt
government property auctions and tenders would stabilize prices.
	   ``The government, in many respects, is in the land business,''
said Michael Green, chief regional property analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``When you're in business, it doesn't make sense to
dump stuff into the market when there's no way it can be
absorbed.''
	   The pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong
Kong said Tung's latest package would have ``a very positive
effect,'' but said Hong Kong still faced tough times.
	   ``As a whole, we welcome the the package, but can it turn over
the situation?'' said Gary Cheng Kai-nam, a party leader. ``The tax
scheme is more than we asked for, but we are also worried about a
lack of flexibility in the land sale scheme.''
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and officials announced last week that unemployment was at a
15-year high of 4.2 percent. Economic contraction in the second
quarter, which is almost certain, would technically put Hong Kong
in recession.

Kerkorian pledges millions to Armenia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ American billionaire Kirk Kerkorian has
pledged dlrs 200 million to Armenia, the country's prime minister
said Tuesday.
	   Kerkorian, who was born in Armenia, established a dlrs 100
million fund to help small- and medium-sized businesses, Prime
Minister Robert Kocharian said at a news conference.
	   He also donated dlrs 85 million to construct two highways and
earmarked dlrs 15 million for northeastern Armenia, which is still
recovering from a magnitude-6.9 earthquake in 1988 that killed at
least 25,000 people.
	   Kerkorian was in Armenia on a three-day visit.
	   Kocharian also said at the news conference that Armenian would
amend its tax system to encourage the development of high-tech
industries. He did not elaborate.

Federal prosecutor reports another Turkish terrorist suspect arrested 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ For the second time in a week, the
German federal prosecutor on Tuesday reported the arrest of a
suspected Turkish terrorist for alleged blackmail, murder and
attempted murder.
	   A federal prosecutor's statement identified the suspect only as
32-year-old Ilhan Y., who it said was a leading member of the
Revolutionary People's Liberation Front, known as the Karatas wing
of the leftist extremist group Devrimci Sol that split into rival
groups in 1993.
	   The other group is known as the Yagan wing, the statement said.
	   Prosecutors say that leaders of the Karatas wing ordered members
to attack and sometimes kill members of the rival gang and Turks
unwilling to contribute money. They also blame the group for arson
attacks against Turkish businesses in Germany, home to some 2
million Turks.
	   The statement said that Ilhan Y., along with a Karatas
functionary identified only as Turan, were responsible for the
group's actions in the Hamburg region. He was arrested in the port
city on June 23 and remains in investigative custody.
	   Ilhan Y., along with other associates, allegedly beat up two
employees of a Turkish restaurant in Hamburg and demolished the
furnishings on April 25, 1997 because the owner refused to pay
money to the group.
	   When the owner returned with his car, Ilhan Y. used a pistol to
shoot and kill a passenger riding with him, the statement said.
	   Turan, who was arrested in Hamburg on Sept. 9, 1997, already
faces attempted murder charges in the Hamburg high state court for
allegedly shooting and seriously wounding a member of the rival
Yagan wing in the port city four days earlier.
	   Also charged in the attempted murder case are Serefettin G., who
heads the Karatas in Germany, and a Frankfurt area group leader
Erdogan C., the statement said.
	   A week ago the federal prosecutors office said an alleged
member, identified only as 26-year-old Ali U., was arrested on May
1 in Dortmund for the beating and attempted blackmail of a Turkish
restaurant owner in the Ruhr river valley area.
	   Devrimci Sol and its successor Karatas wing claimed
responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks and murders in
Turkey, with the aim of overthrowing the government to replace it
with a Marxist regime.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The estimated cost of cleaning up after a freak
weekend storm in Moscow rose 10 times on Tuesday to 1 billion
rubles (dlrs 166 million), city officials said.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry said 10 people died, eight in
Moscow and two in surrounding regions. It said 173 people were
injured.
	   Between 50,000 and 80,000 trees and 462 billboards were
destroyed in the storm Saturday night, according Boris Nikolsky, an
aide to Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. He also said 80 kilometers (50 miles)
of power lines were downed.
	   A thunderstorm, bearing near-hurricane force winds, raged for
about 30 minutes, uprooting trees, smashing windows and flattening
small shops. The Bolshoi Theater, Kremlin walls and Moskva Hotel
near Red Square were all damaged.
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), but
whirlwinds in some places gusted much higher, according to the
Moscow weather center.

Vietnamese officials try to stem AIDS spread among inmates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Prisons are trying to cut overcrowding and
improve education about AIDS because the deadly disease is
spreading so quickly among inmates, the newspaper Nhan Dan reported
Monday.
	   Authorities in Quang Ninh say 17.2 percent of blood-test samples
from inmates in the northern province last year were positive for
the AIDS-causing HIV virus, more than double the 8.2 percent rate
for high-risk groups like prostitutes and drug addicts.
	   The provincial AIDS committee has launched an AIDS education
campaign for all staff and prisoners. In the northern port city of
Hai Phong, crowding has been eased in detention camps and prisons
to stem the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
	   Vietnam has not been hit as hard by AIDS as some of its
neighbors, but the incidence of the disease has been increasing in
recent years.

U.N.: `AIDS gap' putting have-nots in danger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The continued lack of awareness of AIDS is fueling
alarming HIV infection rates in many developing countries, U.N.
experts said in a report Tuesday.
	   Lack of education about the virus is a major hurdle with an
effective cure ``at least 10 years'' away, UNAIDS Director-General
Peter Piot told a news conference.
	   Poor access to new therapies for AIDS-related infections such as
tuberculosis and diarrhea is the ``overwhelming issue'' for some 90
percent of those living with the AIDS virus, the World Health
Organization and UNAIDS report said.
	   Decreasing infection rates in some countries are ``eclipsed'' by
huge rates in countries like South Africa, Piot said.
	   ``Let's be very aware AIDS is with us to stay for a very long
time,'' Piot said.
	   Some 2.9 million South Africans were living with the virus at
the end of 1997, 700,000 of them infected last year alone, the
study said. Almost 13 percent of adults aged between 15 and 49 were
infected.
	   The United States figure was 0.76 percent _ 820,000 people in
total. It was under one percent across Western Europe.
	   Zimbabwe and Botswana, where UNAIDS estimates around one in four
adults carry HIV, had the highest infection rates.
	   Political courage to prevent the spread of AIDS is the key to
narrowing the ``AIDS gap,'' Piot said, praising efforts in Uganda,
Thailand and Senegal.
	   North Africa and the Middle East are ``the great unknown,'' with
cultural difficulties in talking about the epidemic hampering
collection of statistics, UNAIDS said.
	   The report provided country-by-country statistics to back a
study released last November, which said some 5.8 million people
were infected in 1997, up from 5.3 million people the year before.
	   A total of 30.6 million live with HIV or AIDS globally,
two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa, it said.
	   The report estimated that 2.3 million people died of AIDS in
1997, up 50 percent from 1996.
	   The latest study comes ahead of Sunday's opening of the 12th
World AIDS Conference, where 12,000 specialists and others will
discuss advances in HIV research.

Guinea-Bissau religious leaders seek end to deadlocked conflict 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau religious leaders
attempting to mediate an end to the two weeks of fighting in the
former Portuguese colony are meeting the leader of the breakaway
military faction, according to reports.
	   A delegation made up of local Roman Catholic, Muslim and
Evangelical leaders was to hold talks Tuesday with former army
chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane, the Portuguese ambassador in
the capital Bissau said. Mane, who staged a failed coup June 7, has
resisted previous efforts at mediation.
	   Francisco Henrique da Silva told Portuguese radio station
RDP-Africa that the talks were scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. (1100
GMT) but he did not know the venue for the meeting.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm whether the meeting
had begun. Phone lines to Bissau are cut.
	   The renegades occupy strong positions inside Bissau's Bra
military garrison, around the airport and on access routes into the
West African country's capital, according to the Portuguese news
agency Lusa.
	   Rebel spokesman Maj. Melciades Fernandes Gomes, who gave Lusa a
guided tour of the rebel positions in Bissau on Monday, claimed
that ``almost all'' of Guinea-Bissau's army had moved over to the
rebel side. No troop figures were provided.
	   Fernandes Gomes said the military situation in Bissau was
deadlocked. Rebels and Senegalese troops who are fighting on behalf
of President Joao Bernardo Vieira are entrenched in positions which
have changed little since the fighting started, according to Lusa.
	   Senegal has about 1,500 troops inside Guinea-Bissau.
	   ``There's hardly any fighting now, but if they fire at us we
fire back at them,'' Fernandes Gomes was quoted as saying.
	   Heavy fighting has left the capital scarred and battered from
rocket and artillery fire, its streets virtually deserted as most
of its citizens fled.
	   As many as 300,000 people have fled Bissau and have converged on
towns north of the city, where food, clean water and medical
supplies are in desperately short supply.
	   A Portuguese businessman contacted by telephone from Lisbon said
the conditions in the Gabu region, 200 kilometers (125 miles) east
of Bissau, were ``tragic.''
	   ``Food supplies are almost finished,'' Mario Roque said.
	   A Portuguese relief organization on Monday began distributing 20
tons of humanitarian aid in Gabu, where there are some 5,000
refugees.
	   ``The rainy season, which will last through August and
September, is terrible for the spread of diseases, particularly
malaria,'' Leonor Nobre of the Lisbon-based International Medical
Assistance group said in an interview.
	   Lusa reported growing hostility in Bissau against the Senegalese
forces.
	   Senegalese soldiers were press-ganging Bissau men into fighting
against the rebels and have set up artillery positions near houses
where people are still living, according to the report.
	   By contrast, Lusa reported, rebel soldiers manning roadblocks in
the city were friendly towards residents and were well-liked.

World Cup: German coach angry at withdrawal offer 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Berti Vogts expressed anger Tuesday that
German soccer federation officials offered to withdraw the team
from the World Cup because of violence by German hooligans.
	   ``We distance ourselves from what some German criminals did,''
German coach Vogts said. ``But that the German soccer federation
had thought of withdrawing the team, that's where words fail me.''
	   ``I am deeply hurt and angry,'' Vogts said.
	   German soccer federation president Egidius Braun denied Tuesday
that the idea of withdrawing the German team had come from him. But
Braun confirmed that he had asked FIFA president Sepp Blatter and
UEFA chief Lennart Johansson at breakfast Monday whether such a
move would be helpful.
	   Vogts said the team had always tried to leave a good impression
behind wherever it stayed abroad, adding that the German team is
involved in several long-term charity projects outside Germany.
	   Vogts said the team will do everything to help the family of the
French policeman who was critically injured in the attack by German
neo-Nazis on Sunday in Lens, where Germany fought from behind to
salvage a 2-2 draw against Yugoslavia.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, was in a deep coma in
a hospital in Lille and doctors showed little optimism about his
condition.
	   Blatter and Johansson both strongly rejected the idea, Braun
said, and it was never raised later at an emergency FIFA session to
deal with the violence later Monday.
	   Braun left open the possibility that the withdrawal had been
suggested by some other delegation members.
	   He said Vogts called him Monday morning to ask about the
withdrawal considerations. ``I told him it was crazy, it was out of
the question,'' Braun said.
	   Vogts said he was told about the idea at 2 a.m. Monday morning
by team spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach.
	   ``I felt angry and personally attacked,'' Vogts said.
	   ``What could the team do?'' Vogts said, adding that the violence
``had nothing to do with the team.''
	   ``I had a telephone conversation with Braun and I told him a few
things,'' Vogts said. ``After the World Cup, I'll tell the
federation my personal feelings about it.''
	   Vogts has always enjoyed a close relationship with Braun,
considered one of Vogts' biggest supporters.
	   The coach also called together some of his veteran players to
tell them of Braun's initial reaction.
	   ``We were stunned,'' said Thomas Helmer. ``But it seems this
thought was there only briefly.''
	   Niersbach said a withdrawal ``would make no sense.''
	   ``A minority of criminals would then achieve their goal of
disrupting the World Cup,'' he said.

Government backs railway through rural Australia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government said
Tuesday it supported a U.S. dlrs 3.3 billion (5.5 billion
Australian dollar) plan to build a high-speed railway between the
cities of Melbourne and Darwin, passing through much of Victoria,
New South Wales and Queensland states.
	   Prime Minister John Howard said the project, to be funded by
private investors, could open up new industries and jobs and signal
the rebirth of many rural communities.
	   The route of the rail line touches a range of governing
coalition electorates in New South Wales and Queensland, including
many at risk of falling to anti-Asian legislator Pauline Hanson's
One Nation Party at the next national election.
	   One Nation attracted about 23 percent of the vote in a June 13
election in Queensland and is polling in low-to-mid double figures
nationally. Most of its support is being drained from the
conservative coalition, opinion polls say.
	   Howard denied Tuesday's announcement of support had anything to
do with the surge in support for One Nation in rural Australia.
	   ``The timing of it quite simply is purely coincidental,'' he
said. ``This project has been conceived quite in isolation from
many political developments.''
	   The track will be completed by 2004, if it attracts enough
investors.
	   The federal government has already committed U.S. dlrs 61
million (100 million Australian dollars) to another
transcontinental railway, between Darwin and the southern city of
Adelaide.

Iraq admits dealing with VX, but denies using it in weapons 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi scientists experimented with the
deadly VX chemical agent, but were unable to turn it into a weapon,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors have pressed Iraq to fully account for
its past activities in producing VX, a step necessary before the
United Nations lifts sweeping sanctions.
	   Aziz, in a letter to the U.N. Security Council, said Iraq
produced 1.5 metric tons (1.7 tons) of the agent but it was not of
weapons grade. He did not elaborate.
	   Aziz's letter, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, said
Iraq had provided weapons inspectors with proof of its claim.
	   But inspectors are ``demanding more documents to prove that the
production of the ... agent was a failure,'' Aziz said.
	   His remarks came the same day The Washington Post reported that
U.N. inspectors found evidence that Iraq armed missile warheads
with VX nerve gas prior to the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The information was included in a confidential U.S. Army
laboratory analysis of warhead fragments taken from a pit at Taji,
Iraq, in March, the newspaper said. A few drops of the nerve gas
can kill a human in minutes.
	   Aziz, who is now on a visit to Spain, said Iraq has no more
documents to give U.N. inspectors.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler agreed with Aziz on
a two-month timetable to end disarmament activities in Iraq
following his latest visit to Baghdad. Despite the agreement, he
later reported to the Security Council that Iraq was still
withholding key information on its weapons programs.
	   Butler had also asked Iraq to prove it has scrapped its
biological weapons program. But Aziz said the program was destroyed
in 1991 and Iraq has no more documentation to offer.
	   The official agency, in a separate dispatch, quoted Aziz as
saying that another crisis over weapons inspections is bound to
occur in the Gulf if U.N. sanctions are not lifted.

Taiwanese party looks to set up Beijing office 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's opposition New Party, which
strongly advocates reunification with China, plans to set up a
branch office in Beijing, a party official said Tuesday.
	   The office would be a service center for Taiwanese investors in
China and other ``Taiwanese compatriots,'' Chen Kuei-miao, a party
legislator, told reporters before leaving for Beijing.
	   The party, which advocates closer political and economic links
leading to reunification with China, would be the first to
establish a presence in China.
	   Chen did not say whether the party would attempt to recruit
members in China.
	   The New Party draws its main support from first- and
second-generation Chinese who fled the Communist takeover of
mainland China with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists in 1949. It was
formed in 1993 by former Nationalists fed up with corruption in the
party and its perceived lack of commitment to reunifying with
China.
	   The party opposes President Lee Teng-hui's campaign to gain
Taiwan international recognition, which China's leaders call a
covert attempt to make Taiwan formally and permanently independent
of China.
	   But Lee's drive has broad popular support among native
Taiwanese, who make up about 80 percent of the population. Weakened
by infighting, the New Party has been unable to gain more than 15
percent of the vote in national elections.

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish man who hijacked a domestic
Iberia Air Lines flight with 131 people aboard and demanded to be
flown to Tel Aviv surrendered peacefully to police after speaking
to his psychiatrist, authorities said.
	   The hijacker, identified as Javier Gomez, said he had
``short-circuited,'' police chief Juan Cotino told reporters in the
aftermath of four-hour standoff.
	   After he surrendered police discovered Gomez was unarmed when he
forced Iberia's flight 1121 between Seville and Barcelona to land
in Valencia's Manises airport in eastern Spain at 8:40 a.m.
(0640GMT), Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Gomez was brandishing a remote control device and threatening to
explode a bomb, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Once Gomez had identified himself to police surrounding the
aircraft, it was discovered he was under psychiatric treatment. His
doctor, Ildefonso Mateo, persuaded him to give up in a cellular
call from Seville.
	   ``After talking to him for four minutes, he softened and the
situation was resolved,'' Mateo said on Spanish television.

Latvian lawmakers give final approvalto citizenship law changes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a move that it is hoped will improve
relations with Russia, Latvia's Parliament has given final approval
to amendments softening the country's controversial citizenship
law.
	   After eight hours of heated debate, lawmakers voted 49-26 late
Monday to accept a package of amendments making it easier for
Russian-speakers in the country to acquire citizenship, the Baltic
News Service BNS reported.
	   In a population of 2.5 million, some 700,000 people are
stateless, most of them Russian-speakers who emigrated to Latvia
during five decades of Soviet rule.
	   After its newly won independence in 1991, Latvia granted
automatic citizenship only to those who lived in the country before
World War II and their descendants. This left virtually all
Soviet-era immigrants and their children stateless.
	   The Kremlin has accused Latvia of using citizenship laws to
permanently disenfranchise Russian-speakers who cannot vote in
national elections or hold certain jobs without citizenship.
	   An estimated 25,000 children will now become immediately
eligible for Latvian citizenship because the new amendments grant
automatic citizenship to all children born in Latvia after
independence.
	   Adults, however, will still have to pass tough language tests
proving proficiency in Latvian which most non-citizens do not
speak. Moscow says it also wants the language requirement to be
waived.
	   The dispute between Latvia and Russia had intensified in recent
months with Moscow threatening trade sanctions. The European Union
and NATO had also urged Latvian legislators to adopt changes to the
law.
	   Many Latvians are still bitter about the influx of Russians
during Soviet rule and say softening of naturalization rules is a
threat to the ethnic Latvian majority.

Court convicts newspaper of contempt

Eds: UPDATES with journalists association criticizing paper, last
graf
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The High Court found a major Hong Kong
newspaper guilty of contempt Tuesday for ordering a paparazzi-style
surveillance of a senior judge and printing abusive attacks on the
judiciary.
	   Chief Judge Patrick Chan said the Chinese-language Oriental
Daily News, one of Hong Kong's largest and raciest newspapers, had
``embarked in a campaign against the court.''
	   He said the paper's campaign since last year undermined ``public
confidence in the due administration of justice.''
	   Early this year, Oriental Daily had reporters mount a
paparazzi-style round-the-clock watch on Justice Gerald Godfrey
after he ruled against the paper in a legal battle with a rival
newspaper.
	   The paper said it was dissatisfied that Godfrey had likened a
senior Oriental Daily reporter, who spotted and photographed a
pregnant Hong Kong pop star, to a paparazzo. It said it wanted to
teach the judge ``a lesson'' about how true paparazzi behave.
	   Chan said the paparazzi watch was meant to be revenge, ``to pay
(Godfrey) back'' for his ruling against the paper.
	   Oriental Daily, which has frequent brushes with the law over its
racy contents, had published a series of articles last year that
contained ``abusive and scurrilous attacks and racist slurs''
against judges, Chan added.
	   It had called judges and members of a tribunal policing
pornography ``swinish white-skinned pigs'' and ``yellow-skinned
dogs,'' and warned that it would ``wipe them all out.''
	   The paper also said that it would ``strip (the judges) of their
wigs and robes, and trample them underfoot.''
	   The newspaper's holding company, Oriental Daily Press, and its
then-editor, Wong Yeung-ng, were found guilty of contempt of court.
	   Chan also said Ma Ching-fat, chairman of Oriental Daily Press,
had ``actually instigated the campaign,'' but acquitted him because
of a lack of evidence.
	   Sentencing was deferred until Saturday.
	   The newspaper's behavior has been roundly criticized in Hong
Kong, even by groups that have campaigned for press freedoms.
	   The Hong Kong Journalists Association described the action of
the Oriental Daily as harmful, saying that it had damaged the
reputation of journalism.

Condition of policeman unimproved; second suspect identified 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with report of second suspect identified.
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The prospects of a French policeman whose
head was bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with
doctors calling his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   A second suspect, meanwhile, was identified in the attack
Sunday. French radio reports said the man was among the 15 Germans
already under investigation _ one step from being charged _ in the
melee.
	   The first suspect, a 27-year-old from Hanover, was to face a
judge later Tuesday.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, was in a deep coma in
a Lille hospital after suffering ``repeated violent blows from a
massive object'' _ actually an iron bar _ following Sunday's match
between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said.
	   They said Tuesday morning that it was impossible, for the time
being, to make an accurate forecast regarding his health.
	   Nivel was cornered by a group of neo-Nazis on a narrow street in
Lens, a nearby town in northern France. He collapsed unconscious in
a pool of blood on the sidewalk.
	   At the other end of the country in Toulouse, 1,800 police were
in force Monday outside the England-Romania game, to guard against
a repeat of the violence that plagued Marseille, site of England's
last contest.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars kept most
violence in check. About 10 people were arrested and three injured
in a couple of minor scuffles, police said.
	   A British reporter, Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association,
broke his collarbone when English fans, who accused him of giving
them a bad name, threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation. One German fan was sentenced to three
months in prison in connection with weekend mayhem.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But, he said, the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of

Eds: UPDATES with report of second suspect identified. Version
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The prospects of a French policeman whose
head was bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with
doctors calling his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   A second suspect, meanwhile, was identified in the attack
Sunday. French radio reports said the man was among the 15 Germans
already under investigation _ one step from being charged _ in the
melee.
	   The first suspect, a 27-year-old from Hanover, was to face a
judge later Tuesday.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, was in a deep coma in
a Lille hospital after suffering ``repeated violent blows from a
massive object'' _ actually an iron bar _ following Sunday's match
between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said.
	   They said Tuesday morning that it was impossible, for the time
being, to make an accurate forecast regarding his health.
	   Nivel was cornered by a group of neo-Nazis on a narrow street in
Lens, a nearby town in northern France. He collapsed unconscious in
a pool of blood on the sidewalk.
	   At the other end of the country in Toulouse, 1,800 police were
in force Monday outside the England-Romania game, to guard against
a repeat of the violence that plagued Marseille, site of England's
last contest.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars kept most
violence in check. About 10 people were arrested and three injured
in a couple of minor scuffles, police said.
	   A British reporter, Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association,
broke his collarbone when English fans, who accused him of giving
them a bad name, threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation. One German fan was sentenced to three
months in prison in connection with weekend mayhem.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But, he said, the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat headed for
Belgrade on Tuesday with what could be a final warning for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic before NATO takes steps to try to end
the fighting in Kosovo.
	   The visit by Richard Holbrooke, a troubleshooter for the region
and the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is seen as a
last diplomatic effort to get Milosevic to stop his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   ``Our goal is to prevent the fighting from escalating into
general war,'' Holbrooke said in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, before flying to Belgrade for talks with Milosevic.
	   ``This will not be easy to do, but we will continue the
efforts,'' he said after meeting Macedonia's Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov, and Ibrahim Rugova, the
leader of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   There are widespread fears the Kosovo conflict could spread to
Macedonia, which borders on Kosovo and also has a sizeable
community of restive ethnic Albanians.
	   Western nations, which sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in
a warning to Milosevic this month, have been deliberating on what
measures they will take if Milosevic continues to defy them.
	   NATO officials have acknowledged that bombing targets in Serbia,
excluding Kosovo, is under consideration as a last resort.
	   The Vienna daily Kurier quoted a high-ranking NATO military man
as saying it is up to Belgrade whether targets such as Serbia's
anti-aircraft defense are hit. ``One could say to them, switch off
your radar and relocate your air force, otherwise we'll hit you,''
the unidentified official was quoted as saying.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo while Rugova's influence wanes.
	   Clashes continued as Holbrooke arrived in the troubled region.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported Tuesday that 800 Serb civilians
have evacuated one of the remaining Serb enclaves, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of the capital Pristina near the town of Klina.
They said ethnic Albanians had driven them out, burning down houses
there.
	   Serb police said the KLA had seized control of the village of
Belacevac.
	   The Serbs' Media Center also said nine Serbs had been kidnapped
Monday.
	   Holbrooke is credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   Milosevic met in Russia last week with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to hold new talks with Rugova. But he has refused
demands to pull back and cease security forces' fire.
	   Russia, a fellow Slavic nation, opposes Western military
pressure on its long-time ally but is trying to use its influence
with Belgrade to gain a breakthrough in peace efforts.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky held talks
with Milosevic on Tuesday, before Holbrooke's arrival. It marked
the third straight day of Russian diplomatic talks on Kosovo,
involving officials from both sides.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office afterward claimed that
authorities have taken measures to alleviate the ``negative
consequences'' of recent fighting, including ensuring freedom of
movement and protecting all citizens, regardless of nationality.

Palestinians urge United States to publish peace initiative peace intiative, Netanyahu adviser saying decision on referendum expected soon; adds byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinians urging U.S. to publish
By KARIN LAUB

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the
Clinton administration to step up pressure on Israel and go public
with its plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the
chief Palestinian negotiator said Tuesday.
	   The appeal was contained in a letter by Arafat to U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, said Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat.
	   Arafat reminded Albright that in a phone call last month, she
assured him that her negotiations with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on a withdrawal would be completed within two weeks,
Erekat said.
	   ``He (Arafat) said that he went all the way with her ideas in
meetings here and there, and now it is time for the American
administration to introduce its ideas and proposals publicly and
officially, and it is time to tell Netanyahu that enough is
enough,'' Erekat said.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is just wasting time, just stalling,'' the
negotiator said.
	   Albright has urged Netanyahu to make a decision quickly on a
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback that was first introduced
in January. However, Netanyahu has ignored informal U.S. deadlines
and the United States has taken no action.
	   Arafat's appeal came at a time when Netanyahu was considering
holding a non-binding referendum, or nationwide public opinion
poll, on the U.S. proposal. Such a referendum would delay a
withdrawal for at least two months because parliament would have to
pass special legislation first.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the prime
minister has not yet made up his mind on a referendum, but that a
decision was expected soon.
	   The idea was dismissed as a waste of time by Netanyahu's
opponents, as well as some of his allies, including Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a moderate in the government who has
urged the prime minister to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   In another development Tuesday, Israel and the Palestinians
engaged in a sharp exchange over Jerusalem, accusing each other of
violating an agreement not to make changes in the disputed city
until its future has been decided in peace negotiations.
	   Earlier this week, Israel's Cabinet approved a plan to extend
Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish West Bank
settlements, a step that falls short of annexation but strengthens
ties between the settlements and the city.
	   In response, the Palestinians turned to the U.N. Security
Council, requesting an urgent meeting on the Israeli plan which
they said was aimed at cementing Israeli rule over all of the city.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as a capital. Israel captured east
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, and has said it
would never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday defended the expansion plan, saying it did
not violate peace agreements. He warned the Palestinians that if
they went ahead with plans to bring up the Jerusalem plan for
debate in the U.N. Security Council, this would have serious
repercussions for Mideast peacemaking.
	   ``This will cause serious harm to the peace process,'' Netanyahu
said. ``We will not accept this.'' He did not explain what Israel's
response would be, but said in another veiled reference to the
United States that ``those who want make progress in the peace
process should try to stop this.''
	   Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, accused Netanyahu of
doing his utmost to wreck the negotiations.
	   `The Palestinians are going to the Security Council to protect
the peace process from Netanyahu,'' he said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed 18 people and wounded
40 in an attack on a bus in western Rwanda, the Rwanda News Agency
said Tuesday.
	   The attack occurred Monday afternoon when assailants struck the
bus packed with nearly 100 passengers in Nyange in Kibuye
prefecture, 130 kilometers (70 miles) west of the capital Kigali,
the independent agency said. The bus was headed for Kigali.
	   State-run Radio Rwanda, citing a statement issued by a technical
school in Kibuye, said three children were among the dead and at
least four children were wounded.
	   RNA said the wounded were taken to Kibuye hospital.
	   The military spokesman and the supervising doctor at Kibuye
hospital could not be reached for comment.
	   In March 1997, Hutu rebels killed four students in Nyange and
wounded 17 when they refused orders to separate according to
whether they were Tutsi or Hutu.
	   The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government and military have been
fighting an insurgency by former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and
militiamen, many of whom were responsible for the 1994 genocide of
over half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The insurgency has spread in recent months from the northwest
corner of the country to western and central Kibuye and Gitarama
prefectures. There are attacks on civilians nearly every week.

Low turnout reported in Albanian local elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A low turnout in last Sunday's local
elections underscores a declining interest by Albanians in the
political process, Western monitors said Tuesday.
	   Only about half the eligible voters in nine regions and seven
municipalities turned out to vote for their local government
officials.
	   ``Voter turnout was considerably lower than in previous
elections, especially among young voters,'' said Dan Everts, head
of the Albania mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   The OSCE, which has maintained a presence in Albania since last
year, had its monitors present in most voting centers on Sunday.
	   ``The low turnout could also be related to the limited powers of
local governments in Albania,'' said Everts.
	   He pointed out the need for Albania to effectively decentralize,
as required by the Council of Europe's charter on local
self-government, signed recently by Albania.

Graf brought to tears by return to Wimbledon; rain holds up Tuesday
Eds: Updates 5th graf with play underway
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Just being back at Wimbledon was
enough to bring Steffi Graf to tears.
	   A year ago, the seven-time champion was in rehabilitation after
reconstructive knee surgery. Two months ago, her comeback
threatened by more injuries, she considered retirement.
	   So on Monday, after winning her first-round match in straight
sets on Centre Court, Graf was overcome by emotion. Twice during a
news conference, she broke down crying.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' said the German, playing her 13th Wimbledon. ``It's just
special to be here.''
	   After a rain-free opening day, the start of Tuesday's matches
was delayed by light showers until 2:40 p.m. (1340 GMT) when
women's defending champion Martina Hingis began play on Centre
Court against Lisa Raymond.
	   Graf's tears represented a remarkable display from a player who
has rarely expressed her emotions on or off the court.
	   Graf said, 6th graf

U.S. Jews pledge to continue contributions despite conversion controversy 
</HEADLINE>
By MASHA HERBST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Jews will keep donating money to Israel
despite misgivings about attempts by ultra-Orthodox rabbis to
restrict the influence of more liberal streams of Judaism, the head
of the United Jewish Appeal said Tuesday.
	   The UJA is the main fund-raising arm of American Jewry. The
Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism, which are trying to
gain a foothold in Israel against Orthodox objections, are
predominant among U.S. Jews.
	   Reform and Conservative rabbis have sought court recognition for
conversions performed by them in Israel. In response, Orthodox
rabbis have introduced legislation that would formalize the status
quo under which only Orthodox conversions are recognized. The
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to
mediate a compromise, to no avail.
	   Referring to the controversy, UJA chairwoman Carole Solomon told
parliament's Committee for Immigrant Absorption, said: ``The United
Jewish Appeal ... doesn't support any initiative that would make
any Jew feel disenfranchised or any less a part of the Jewish
state.''
	   However, American Jews ``are extremely committed and will remain
committed'' to giving to Israel, she said.
	   ``The commitment and purpose of what we have always been about
is not diminished one iota,'' Solomon said.

Iraq sends senior official to OPEC meeting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi delegation left for Austria to
attend a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, the official Iraqi News Agency said Tuesday.
	   The delegation was led by Sami Sharif, undersecretary at the Oil
Ministry, the agency said.
	   The OPEC meeting formally begins Wednesday in Vienna, where
ministers will seek more cuts in oil production to stabilize prices
that have slid to their lowest levels in years.
	   The lower prices make more difficult Iraq's efforts to earn the
dlrs 5.2 billion it is permitted during the current six-month
period of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
	   The program, which started in December 1996, originally
permitted Iraq exports of dlrs 2 billion. But the value was raised
up to dlrs 5.2 billion in February.

Russia postpones satellite launch satellites will be used to monitor earth's surface; UPDATES failure was in launching equipment. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS experts were cautious because of previous accidents,
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia postponed the planned launch of six
satellites on Tuesday after a minor equipment failure, a news
agency reported.
	   The launch was rescheduled for Wednesday, the Interfax news
agency said, citing Russia's strategic rocket forces.
	   The launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome in neighboring Kazakstan
was postponed after specialists spent time checking out a failure
in the rocket's launching equipment, Interfax said.
	   The failure was determined to be minor, but space officials
decided to postpone the launch to make sure that the satellites
would enter the right orbit.
	   Launch experts were cautious about the glitch because the
Zenit-2 type booster has been involved in a number of accidents,
ITAR-Tass reported. A faulty booster also put six ``spy mailbox''
satellites in the wrong orbit last week.
	   The Zenit-2 booster is to carry into orbit satellites from
Russia as well as Germany, Israel, Chile, Australia and Thailand.
	   The Russian Resurs-0 satellite will relay ecological and
meteorological information, while the others will take measurements
of the Earth's surface, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Russia has been pushing commercial satellite launches as a way
to help fund its space program, which is struggling after the loss
of Soviet-era subsidies. Russia launched 48 commercial satellites
last year.

Pacific-Rim trade ministers debate market liberalization detail on agreements 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comments from Japanese, more from U.S., further

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Trade talks among Pacific-Rim countries
ended Tuesday with Japan the lone holdout on an agreement to ease
barriers in nine key markets.
	   The United States was furious and suggested Japan didn't want to
join in a fast-track liberalization plan before next general
elections next month.
	   ``I think it is not unreasonable to assume that the fact there
will be a key election in July affected somewhat Japan's level of
participation,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said
after two days of talks among trade ministers of the 18 members of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``The message to Japan from APEC is: We're all ready. Where are
you?'' Barshefsky added.
	   With the backdrop of the yearlong Asian crisis ever present, the
ministers were debating a formidable plan to begin liberalizing
trade in nine industries by next year.
	   The pact, known as early voluntary sector liberalization, was
agreed to by heads of government at last November's APEC summit in
Vancouver. Officials had hoped to complete the plan for signing at
the next summit in Kuala Lumpur in November.
	   Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz, host of the trade
ministers' meeting on the Malaysian side of Borneo Island, told a
news conference that ``flexibility'' issues had not been ironed out
and APEC now hoped to complete the plan by September.
	   Rafidah said that accomplishments at the talks should not be
overshadowed by the delay in the final agreement.
	   The agreement would eliminate tariffs in all nine sectors by
2005, with tariffs on toys lifted as early as 2000. The developing
APEC nations would be given more time to ease tariffs to avoid
strains on their smaller economies.
	   The United States and New Zealand are at the forefront in
pushing the EVSL concept, insisting market liberalization is an
important means out of the Asian economic slump. They want specific
dates and tariff reductions set in the nine industries,
representing dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   ``You have a country that had been an engine of growth now
adrift, and whose economy is a drag on the rest of Asia,''
Barshefsky said. ``And yet, among the most articulate and vocal
spokesmen for the need to open up these nine sectors were countries
like Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, countries hardest hit by
the crisis.''
	   Most countries attending the meeting agreed that without Japan,
the world's second-largest economy, the free-trade pact would be
greatly watered down.
	   Senior delegates attending the closed-door talks said that 15 of
the 16 APEC countries that signed on to the EVSL concept last year
agreed all nine sectors had to be moved as a package, but that
Japan was trying to opt out of specific tariff reductions in the
fisheries and forestry sectors.
	   Shigeo Matsutomi, a trade official with the Japanese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, denied that Japan rejected tariff rates. But he
suggested Japan might not back the entire EVSL package.
	   ``Whether we can participate in all nine sectors or not, it
depends on further discussion,'' he told reporters late Tuesday.
``First we have to work out the details of flexibility.''
	   Matsutomi said Japan was not the only one dissatisfied with
EVSL, but the only country that spoke out.
	   ``Between the lines others were dissatisfied but they were
forced to be quiet,'' he said. ``Maybe given their current economic
situations, they did not want to disappoint.''
	   Since the last time the APEC trade ministers met, Asia has been
wracked further by plummeting currencies, shrinking economies and
the downfall of several leaders. The Asian powerhouse, Japan, is in
full-blown recession, its banking sector crumbling and the yen
taking a beating.
	   Japanese officials have repeatedly said that fast-track
liberalization must be voluntary and countries given flexibility in
setting free-market schedules.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   APEC hopes to launch the free-trade process by beginning to lift
tariffs and trade barriers on environmental products and services,
energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   ``Japan, I believe, will argue whatever it feels it needs to
argue so as to preserve its market as is,'' said Barshefsky.
``Well, the preservation of its market, as is, will drain Asia.''
	   Still, she believed in the end Japan would join EVSL.
	   Chile and Mexico opted months ago not to participate in EVSL,
both insisting that trade liberalization be broad based and not
sector specific.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

deadly VX chemical agent, but were unable to turn it into a weapon,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors have pressed Iraq to fully account for
its past activities involving VX, a step necessary before the
United Nations lifts sweeping sanctions.
	   Aziz, in a letter to the U.N. Security Council, said Iraq
produced 1.5 metric tons (1.7 tons) of the agent but it was not of
weapons grade. He did not elaborate.
	   Aziz's letter, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, said
Iraq had provided weapons inspectors with proof of its claim.
	   But inspectors are ``demanding more documents to prove that the
production of the ... agent was a failure,'' Aziz said.
	   His remarks came the same day The Washington Post reported that
U.N. inspectors found evidence that Iraq armed missile warheads
with VX nerve gas prior to the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The information was included in a confidential U.S. Army
laboratory analysis of warhead fragments taken from a pit at Taji,
Iraq, in March, the newspaper said. A few drops of the nerve gas
can kill a human in minutes.
	   Aziz, who is now on a visit to Spain, said Iraq has no more
documents to give U.N. inspectors.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler agreed with Aziz on
a two-month timetable to end disarmament activities in Iraq
following his latest visit to Baghdad. Despite the agreement, he
later reported to the Security Council that Iraq was still
withholding key information on its weapons programs.
	   Butler had also asked Iraq to prove it has scrapped its
biological weapons program. But Aziz said the program was destroyed
in 1991 and Iraq has no more documentation to offer.
	   The official agency, in a separate dispatch, quoted Aziz as
saying that another crisis over weapons inspections is bound to
occur in the Gulf if U.N. sanctions are not lifted.

Government confronts Internet privacy, and lack of it 
</HEADLINE>
By TED BRIDIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Warning U.S. companies that do business on the
Internet to better protect the privacy of consumers, Commerce
Secretary William Daley said Tuesday the federal government will
intervene unless industry changes its ways.
	   ``I don't want to hear any griping or moaning if that happens,''
Daley said, opening a two-day summit on Internet privacy.
	   Companies and the government want to encourage the growth of
fledgling Internet commerce while balancing the privacy rights of
consumers. Industry wants to develop its own rules and punishments.
Privacy advocates want the government to write tough new privacy
laws _ now.
	   So far, the Clinton administration, wary of stifling business on
the Internet with burdensome new laws, has indicated it will give
companies more time to come up with ways to regulate themselves.
	   Daley, who will issue a report on Internet privacy to Clinton
within weeks, said the president ``doesn't want to do anything that
would mess up this success.''
	   ``What happens if self-regulation fails?'' Daley asked. ``The
loser will be industry. They have the largest stake to lose.''
	   Critics said the government is giving businesses too much time.
	   ``They have their eyes closed and their fingers crossed that it
will all work out,'' complained Jeff Chester, executive director of
the Washington-based Center for Media Education. ``The
administration has been on its knees pleading with American
high-tech companies to come up with measures to protect online
privacy, and they've been met with a loud chorus of denials.''
	   The Internet can be a corporate candyland of personal consumer
information. Customers routinely respond to questionnaires on Web
sites, providing their names, e-mail and postal addresses and other
personal data.
	   Once a person is identified on a Web site, companies can easily
track which Web pages are read at that site.
	   Buy anything on the Internet _ or just fill out one of those
innocent-looking forms on a Web site _ and a company can learn a
lot about you: what you read, what you wear, how you vote, maybe
even information about your health.
	   Until a person identifies himself, only relatively innocuous
information can be collected behind the scenes, such as which kinds
of software the person uses.
	   ``Once an individual gives over information, that can be tied to
a whole bunch of data about what you've done at a Web site or at a
whole bunch of Web sites,'' said Deirdre Mulligan, a lawyer with
the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. ``That
might reveal your preferences, your taste in books, your taste in
politics or in clothes. It gives people the ability to create
dossiers unparalleled in the offline world.''
	   On the eve of the privacy summit, nearly 50 large companies that
sell products on the Internet formed a trade group Monday to
convince the federal government that industry can police itself
against abuse.

Germany's high court reviews Bavaria's abortion clinic ban 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court began
deliberations Tuesday on whether a state _ in this case, Bavaria _
has the right to introduce its own abortion laws.
	   Bavaria's ultra-conservative ruling party, the Christian Social
Union, has sought to ban abortion-only clinics with a law stating
that doctors may not derive more than 25 percent of their income
from abortions.
	   The law, passed in summer 1996, would have taken effect July 1,
1997. But the Federal Constitution Court, in Karlsruhe, temporarily
blocked the law in June 1997.
	   The court agreed with a petition filed by two Bavarian doctors
that the law impairs a woman's ability to obtain advice and care
near her home, and that women seeking abortions would be exposed to
greater health risks by being forced to travel outside of Bavaria.
	   Now, the court will rule on whether Bavaria's law violated the
constitution, and whether states must bow to federal law on
abortion.
	   Federal abortion law in Germany requires only that a woman prove
she has sought counseling. There is no law regulating which clinics
or doctors can perform abortions.

Latvian lawmakers give final approval to citizenship law changes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a move that officials hope will improve
relations with Russia, Latvia's Parliament has given final approval
to amendments softening the country's controversial citizenship
law.
	   After eight hours of heated debate, lawmakers voted 49-26 late
Monday to accept a package of amendments making it easier for
Russian-speakers in the country to acquire citizenship, the Baltic
News Service BNS reported.
	   In a population of 2.5 million, some 700,000 people are
stateless, most of them Russian-speakers who emigrated to Latvia
during five decades of Soviet rule.
	   After its newly won independence in 1991, Latvia granted
automatic citizenship only to those who lived in the country before
World War II and their descendants. This left virtually all
Soviet-era immigrants and their children stateless.
	   The Kremlin has accused Latvia of using citizenship laws to
permanently disenfranchise Russian-speakers who cannot vote in
national elections or hold certain jobs without citizenship.
	   An estimated 25,000 children will now become immediately
eligible for Latvian citizenship because the new amendments grant
automatic citizenship to all children born in Latvia after
independence.
	   Adults, however, will still have to pass tough language tests
proving proficiency in Latvian which most non-citizens do not
speak. Moscow says it also wants the language requirement to be
waived.
	   The dispute between Latvia and Russia had intensified in recent
months with Moscow threatening trade sanctions. The European Union
and NATO had also urged Latvian legislators to adopt changes to the
law.
	   Many Latvians are still bitter about the influx of Russians
during Soviet rule and say softening of naturalization rules is a
threat to the ethnic Latvian majority.

Turkey plans to import Iraqi crude by trucks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey plans to use trucks to import Iraqi
crude from a border crossing, an official said on Tuesday.
	   ``There are plans to import 60,000 tons (419,880 barrels) of
crude oil from Iraq by tankers a year,'' said Vedat Buyukersoy,
deputy governor of the southeastern Sirnak province on the Iraqi
border.
	   The trucks would ferry the crude oil from the border crossing of
Habur, Buyukersoy told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview. He refused to say when the trade would start.
	   But another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
three Turkish tanker firms were close to finalize a deal in Baghdad
for the transportation of the crude into Turkey.
	   Turkey already receives Iraqi crude through an oil pipeline
running from Iraq to a Turkish Mediterranean port under a United
Nations approved plan.
	   But the cross-border crude oil import would be outside the U.N.
approved deal. Turkey has long requested from the United Nations to
be granted a special status which would keep Turkey exempt from a
ban to make trade with Iraq under the U.N. imposed embargo on
Baghdad.
	   The United Nations has not accepted the Turkish request. But the
United Nations and Western countries turn a blind eye to a similar
diesel and fuel oil trade with Iraq because of Turkey's complaints
of losses incurred by the embargo.
	   Turkey says it has suffered dlrs 30 billion of financial losses
because of the trade sanction on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait which led to the Gulf War in 1991.
	   Zulal Sonmez, head of the customs department of Habur border
gate, said the Iraqi crude oil would be processed at a nearby
refinery in Batman province.

ETA claims responsibility for two murders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA
chalked up two more slayings in its violent campaign for an
independent homeland straddling the Spanish-French border.
	   ETA said it killed Tomas Caballero _ a town councilor from the
northern city of Pamplona _ on May 6 and retired Civil Guard
officer Alfonso Parada two days later some 80 kilometers (50 miles)
farther east in the town of Vitoria.
	   In a communique published in Tuesday's edition of the radical
Basque newspaper Elgin, ETA confirmed it was responsible for the
slayings and several other recent attacks.
	   Caballero and Parado were shot dead, the fourth and fifth
slayings attributed to ETA this year.
	   It is common for the separatists to wait several weeks before
taking responsibility for attacks via communiques sent to Egin.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed some 800 people in its 30-year campaign for
independence.

Coffee drops below dlrs 1 to 17-month low 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Coffee dropped below dlrs 1 a pound Tuesday for
the first time in more than 17 months, following renewed selling
pressure on U.S. and European markets.
	   The International Coffee Organization said its latest daily
market indicator price _ its measure of the average wholesale cost
-- was 99.2 cents a pound.
	   That compared with dlrs 1.011 previously and is the lowest level
since Jan. 17, 1997.
	   Since the start of this year, the indicator has fallen 23.5
percent
	   Traders said that recent heavy selling of coffee, some of it by
speculators and investment funds, was triggered by growing signs
that the Brazilian crop now being harvested will be the biggest in
over a decade.
	   The selling appeared to have been only slightly inhibited by the
fact that the Brazilian winter, and its perennial threat of frosts
in the coffee zone, was now beginning, they added.
	   Serious frost damage in mid-1994, which led to a sharp drop in
output from Brazil's 1995-harvest, helped push the index price to
dlrs 3.2598 in May 1997.
	   Brazil is the world's biggest supplier of coffee, accounting for
around a third of global production.

Report: Germany rail company knew of wheel danger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ German railway officials knew that
high-speed train wheels were at risk of breaking years before the
June 2 derailment and fatal crash caused by a fractured steel tire,
a television news program reported Tuesday.
	   According to the ZDF ``Frontal'' report, the rim that encircles
the wheel broke during tests of the high-speed InterCity Express
trains during the early 1980s.
	   The railway, Deutsche Bahn, had no comment on the report,
spokesman Hartmut Sommer said.
	   Rail officials are still investigating how a wheel rim on
InterCity Express 884 could have fractured and caused the train to
derail near the northern village of Eschede. The train smashed into
the concrete supports of an overpass, sending 200-300 tons of
concrete down onto the jackknifed train cars.
	   The crash killed 100 people and seriously injured more than 70.

Palestinians urge United States to publish peace initiative peace intiative, Netanyahu adviser saying decision on referendum expected soon; adds byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinians urging U.S. to publish
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the
Clinton administration to step up pressure on Israel and go public
with its plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the
chief Palestinian negotiator said Tuesday.
	   The appeal was contained in a letter by Arafat to U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, said Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat.
	   Arafat reminded Albright that in a phone call last month, she
assured him that her negotiations with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on a withdrawal would be completed within two weeks,
Erekat said.
	   ``He (Arafat) said that he went all the way with her ideas in
meetings here and there, and now it is time for the American
administration to introduce its ideas and proposals publicly and
officially, and it is time to tell Netanyahu that enough is
enough,'' Erekat said.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is just wasting time, just stalling,'' the
negotiator said.
	   Albright has urged Netanyahu to make a decision quickly on a
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback that was first introduced
in January. However, Netanyahu has ignored informal U.S. deadlines
and the United States has taken no action.
	   Arafat's appeal came at a time when Netanyahu was considering
holding a non-binding referendum, or nationwide public opinion
poll, on the U.S. proposal. Such a referendum would delay a
withdrawal for at least two months because parliament would have to
pass special legislation first.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the prime
minister has not yet made up his mind on a referendum, but that a
decision was expected soon.
	   The idea was dismissed as a waste of time by Netanyahu's
opponents, as well as some of his allies, including Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a moderate in the government who has
urged the prime minister to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   In another development Tuesday, Israel and the Palestinians
engaged in a sharp exchange over Jerusalem, accusing each other of
violating an agreement not to make changes in the disputed city
until its future has been decided in peace negotiations.
	   Earlier this week, Israel's Cabinet approved a plan to extend
Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish West Bank
settlements, a step that falls short of annexation but strengthens
ties between the settlements and the city.
	   In response, the Palestinians turned to the U.N. Security
Council, requesting an urgent meeting on the Israeli plan which
they said was aimed at cementing Israeli rule over all of the city.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as a capital. Israel captured east
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, and has said it
would never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday defended the expansion plan, saying it did
not violate peace agreements. He warned the Palestinians that if
they went ahead with plans to bring up the Jerusalem plan for
debate in the U.N. Security Council, it would have serious
repercussions for Mideast peacemaking.
	   ``This will cause serious harm to the peace process,'' Netanyahu
said. ``We will not accept this.'' He did not explain what Israel's
response would be, but said in another veiled reference to the
United States that ``those who want make progress in the peace

	   Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, accused Netanyahu of
doing his utmost to wreck the negotiations.
	   `The Palestinians are going to the Security Council to protect
the peace process from Netanyahu,'' he said.

Couple sues against national park order against combating bark beetles 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A German couple who operate a restaurant
and rooming house in a Bavarian national park are suing to force
the park to combat a bark beetle invasion destroying trees.
	   The couple fear that continued destruction of the trees will
harm tourism, and are fighting a park's order against fighting the
beetle as an infringement on their right to earn a living.
	   A forestry expert testified on opening day Tuesday that 70
percent of the Bavarian Forest, on the border with the Czech
Republic, will be destroyed in a few years if nothing is done to
fight the bark beetle.
	   Measures to fight the beetle are permitted in a 1-kilometer (0.6
mile) ring around the forest, however the expert said that the
measures aren't enough to protect trees on private property in the
region because the bugs can fly up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles).
	   The couple want the state court to declare the entire area a
nature park rather than a national park, which allows forestry
officials to fight the beetles with chemicals.
	   Environmentalists have fought any efforts to kill the beetles
with chemicals, saying it would harm creatures higher up the food
chain.

Eds: UPDATES with seven grafs on mediation attempt failed,
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An attempt by religious leaders to
mediate an end to the two weeks of fighting in Guinea-Bissau failed
Tuesday when Senegalese troops prevented them from meeting the
leader of the breakaway military faction, according to reports.
	   A delegation made up of local Roman Catholic, Muslim and
Evangelical leaders was due to hold talks with former army chief of
staff Brig. Ansumane Mane, the Portuguese ambassador in the capital
Bissau said.
	   However, the delegation's vehicle was turned back by a
Senegalese tank before it reached the meeting place, the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Bissau, Septimio Ferrazzetta, was quoted as
saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   The mediation effort was the third to fail since Mane staged a
coup in the former Portuguese colony in West Africa June 7.
	   Senegal has about 1,500 troops inside Guinea-Bissau to support
President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   The religious delegation established phone contact with both
sides, but has not met either, a spokeswoman for the Portuguese
Foreign Ministry said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``Apparently, the (Guinea-Bissau) government doesn't seem too
willing to meet the rebels,'' she said.
	   The renegades occupy strong positions inside Bissau's Bra
military garrison, around the airport and on access routes into the
West African country's capital, according to Lusa.
	   Rebel spokesman Maj. Melciades Fernandes Gomes, who gave Lusa a
guided tour of the rebel positions in Bissau on Monday, claimed
that ``almost all'' of Guinea-Bissau's army had moved over to the
rebel side. No troop figures were provided.
	   Fernandes Gomes said the military situation in Bissau was
deadlocked. Rebels and Senegalese troops are entrenched in
positions which have changed little since the fighting started,
according to Lusa.
	   ``There's hardly any fighting now, but if they fire at us we
fire back at them,'' Fernandes Gomes was quoted as saying.
	   Heavy fighting has left the capital scarred and battered from
rocket and artillery fire, its streets virtually deserted as most
of its citizens fled.
	   As many as 300,000 people have fled Bissau and have converged on
towns north of the city, where food, clean water and medical
supplies are in desperately short supply.
	   A Portuguese businessman contacted by telephone from Lisbon said
the conditions in the Gabu region, 200 kilometers (125 miles) east
of Bissau, were ``tragic.''
	   ``Food supplies are almost finished,'' Mario Roque said.
	   A Portuguese relief organization on Monday began distributing 20
tons of humanitarian aid in Gabu, where there are some 5,000
refugees.
	   ``The rainy season, which will last through August and
September, is terrible for the spread of diseases, particularly
malaria,'' Leonor Nobre of the Lisbon-based International Medical
Assistance group said in an interview.
	   A spokesman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
said hundreds of people were leaving the country of one million
inhabitants daily, walking for days to reach the borders with
Senegal and Guinea-Conakry.
	   There were ``tens of thousands'' of displaced people on the
Guinea-Bissau side of the border, Kris Janowski said in Geneva.
	   Lusa reported growing hostility in Bissau against the Senegalese
forces.
	   Senegalese soldiers were press-ganging Bissau men into fighting
against the rebels and have set up artillery positions near houses
where people are still living, according to the report.
	   By contrast, Lusa reported, rebel soldiers manning roadblocks in
the city were friendly towards residents and were well-liked.

In disputed Jerusalem, even archaeological tour is contentious

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With tensions over Jerusalem at a boiling
point, a tour of an archaeological dig at a disputed site
deteriorated Tuesday into finger-wagging shouting matches between
Jewish and Arab lawmakers.
	   ``Five thousand years there have been Jews here!'' shouted Rabbi
Benny Alon of the ultranationalist Moledet, or Homeland, party.
	   ``Arabs live here, why are you here?'' yelled back Salah Tarif,
an Arab legislator from Israel's opposition Labor Party.
	   Israeli police blocked representatives of the Orient House, the
PLO's unofficial headquarters in Jerusalem, from going on the tour.
	   Ateret Cohanim wants to build a new enclave at the site, which
is near Herod's Gate in the Muslim Quarter of the walled Old City,
surrounded by Palestinian neighborhoods. But Gideon Avni, Jerusalem
district archaeologist for Israel's Antiquities Authority, said
Tuesday that it would be ``many, many months'' before a survey dig
at the site is completed and officials can decide whether any
construction could take place.
	   Ateret Cohanim is waging a campaign to move Jews into
Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods, often buying property in secret
through Palestinian land dealers. Palestinians say the campaign has
the support of the Israeli government and is pre-empting their
claims to east Jerusalem as a future capital.
	   Clashes broke out several weeks ago when Ateret Cohanim set up
pre-fabricated tin sheds overnight at the Herod's Gate site, which
it owns. The sheds were removed, and exploratory excavations _
required by Israeli law before any construction can be authorized _
began two weeks ago. The results of the excavations will determine
whether any building can be carried out there.
	   On Tuesday, tractors cleared away debris at the site, stirring
up centuries of chalky dust.
	   Avni said preliminary digging had already turned up signs of
remains from the Ottoman, Crusader, Byzantine and Roman periods.
	   ``The implication is that the archaeological excavation of the
whole plot is going to be a very very long process,'' he said.
``We're speaking about many, many months of excavations.''
	   Avni said it was too early to predict prospects for building at
the site.
	   One possibility is that buildings could be erected above the
archaeological site, on stilts, as has been done in other parts of
the Old City. But any such buildings would still have to be lower
than the Old City walls, Avni said. The wall ranges in height from
five to 15 meters (16 to 50 feet). Ateret Cohanim hopes to build
high rises to house a Jewish seminary and dozens of families.
	   Taleb Elsana, a legislator from the Democratic Arab Party,
accused Ateret Cohanim of stealing Palestinian land, and said the
archaeological dig was giving legitimacy to the group's actions.
	   An uproar broke out when legislator another Arab lawmaker, Salah
Salim of the Hadash Party, said he was ``astounded that
Palestinians have stopped killing those who sell land to the
Jews.''
	   Israel Radio said police were investigating Salim's comments.

	   ------
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Schools have been closed across central
and northern Liberia as teachers who have not been paid in 18
months have gone on strike.
	   Reports reaching Monrovia on Monday said private school teachers
had joined the strike.
	   Liberia is slowly recovering after its bloody seven-year-war,
which ended
	   in 1996. Some 200,000 people were killed in the fighting,
millions were left
	   homeless, and most of the country's infrastructure was
destroyed. The government of warlord-turned-President Charles
Taylor has been struggling for
	   money to help rebuild the country. In the meantime, many
government workers go months without pay.
	   Students insisted their teachers needed pay.
	   ``Although the strike action affects our learning process, we
are in total support because it is just unrealistic for someone to
teach for 18 months without pay,'' said a student spokesman,
Gbalemie Kardiyea.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Businessmen from Mozambique, Botswana,
Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe signed 40 letters of intent for a
total investment of over 89 million US dollars.
	   The agreements were signed in Maputo at the weekend at the end
of a regional Forum on investment in Mozambique.
	   Mozambique's minister of industry, trade and tourism, Oldemiro
Baloi, described Southern Africa as an important and large market,
and said ``signing these letters of intent meant that this market
is increasingly based on sound competition.''
	   The forum gathered 75 businessmen from those five southern
African countries, who presented 112 investment projects.
Concerning the letters of intent, 12 are in respect of projects in
Lesotho, 11 in Zimbabwe, 10 in Mozambique, and seven in Botswana.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The government and a consortium of
Mauritian private companies are to set up a new sugar company on
the banks of the Zambezi, inheriting the assets of the defunct Sena
Sugar Estates, the Mozambique News Agency reported.
	   About 70 million dollars of fresh investment is required to
rehabilitate the two ruined SSE sugar refineries _ one at Luabo, on
the north bank of the Zambezi, and the other at Marromeu on the
south bank. Both were sabotaged by the apartheid-backed RENAMO
rebels in 1986.
	   The rehabilitation also involves restoring the irrigation,
electricity and telecommunications systems, and repairing road and
rail networks within the plantations.
	   ------
	   EAST LONDON, South Africa (AP) _ A 20-year-old student has lost
his left leg and is in a critical condition in an East London
hospital after being attacked by a shark.
	   Anton de Vos was attacked by the shark, suspected to be a great
white, while bodyboarding on Monday. He was bitten on both hands,
his right calf and left thigh, where an artery was severed.
	   Witness Foden Saunders said he saw De Vos splashing in the water
some 50 meters (yards) from shore.
	   ``The shark lifted him out of the water and we could see its
upper body as
	   Anton tried to punch it,'' Saunders said. ``The shark looked
like a torpedo. It was like something out of a movie.''
	   Medics had to revive De Vos after he suffered a heart attack on
the beach and then rushed him to St. Dominic's hospital in East
London, where he underwent a blood transfusion after an emergency
call on local radio stations for blood donations.
	   His left leg was amputated above the knee in the afternoon.
	   East London recreational services chief Henk Els ordered all
municipal beaches closed when he heard of the attack on De Vos.
	   He said the beaches would remain closed for a day or two until
the authorities felt confident there would be no further danger.
	   The attack on De Vos brings to six the number of people mauled
by sharks in the past five weeks in the Eastern Cape.

Greece and Macedonia oppose NATO strike in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>

By PATRICK QUINN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Calling on the West to listen to the
``voice of logic,'' Greece and Macedonia on Tuesday warned that
possible NATO strikes in Kosovo could lead to an all-out Balkan
war.
	   ``I would like to tell those in comfortable capitals in the West
and north who find pleasure in games of war that enough blood was
shed because of rashness and amateurishness in Bosnia,'' said Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
	   NATO, which last week sent warplanes over Albania and Macedonia
in a show of force against Yugoslavia, has described military
strikes against Serb forces as a measure of last resort.
	   Macedonia fears a spillover from neighboring Kosovo could ignite
a separatist movement among its own large and restive Albanian
minority. Macedonia clearly prefers that NATO protect its borders.
	   ``We saluted NATO's preparedness to prevent its spread to
Macedonia and Albania and the guarantees it gave for our integrity
and sovereignty,'' said Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj
Handzinski.
	   Both Pangalos and Handzinski made their statements shortly after
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke left Athens for the Macedonian
capital, Skopje, to hold meetings with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov and Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic also has agreed to talk to
Rugova. But Rugova has refused until Serb forces are pulled out of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the
population and rebels have waged an escalating fight for
independence.
	   Both Pangalos and Handzinski questioned whether Rugova had much
influence left in Kosovo.
	   Once the bitterest of neighbors, Greece and Macedonia have
united in the fear that a successful campaign by the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army could spell disaster for the Balkans. NATO
strikes could bolster the KLA's campaign.
	   ``Kosovo is a province of Serbia. Any change of borders will
mean all-out war'' in the Balkans, Handzinski said. ``We condemn
both the activities of the so-called KLA and Serb forces in
Kosovo.''
	   Pangalos added: ``It is not by chance that the countries of the
region represent the voice of logic. We have the most to win if
there is a peaceful solution and the most to lose if there is a
war.''
	   Greece and Macedonia stressed that peace plans must apply to
both the Serbs and rebels.
	   ``We can't imagine that security forces will be withdrawn and
that armed men will be allowed to carry out illegal acts of
violence, especially since Mr. Rugova and other political forces
themselves say they don't control the armed men,'' said Pangalos.

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria is to receive loans totaling dlrs
91.8 million from the Kuwaiti-based Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development, the government said Tuesday.
	   The first loan will be used to finance an electricity project,
the ministry of planning said. It is repayable over 20 years.
	   The second loan is to develop livestock breeding. It is
repayable over 22 years.
	   Both loans carry a 4.5 interest rate, the ministry's statement
said.
	   Established in 1968 by the Arab League's economic council, the
fund has lent Syria about dlrs 1.3 billion, including these two
loans. The fund lends money on easy terms to finance economic and
social projects in Arab states.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD _ Egyptian businessmen signed dlrs 400 million worth of
contracts during their just-ended trade fair in the Iraqi capital,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The contracts provide for Egypt to sell Iraq agricultural
machinery, electrical appliances, oil spare parts and foodstuffs,
Al-Ittihad said.
	   Some 120 Egyptian firms took part in the seven-day trade fair,
which started on June 16.
	   The newspaper did not say whether the new contracts will be
financed from the revenues of Iraq's oil-for-food program. But in
terms of the program, all imports to Iraq have to be approved by
the United Nations. The program enables Iraq to bypass the
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell
limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and humanitarian
goods.
	   Baghdad shops brim with Egyptian products imported by private
traders. No figures are available on the value of private trade,
but the total value of imports from Egypt since the program started
in December 1996 is about dlrs 175 million.

All Nippon Airways says restructuring will boost profits 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ All Nippon Airways Corp., Japan's financially
troubled second-largest airline, announced a series of cost-cutting
moves Tuesday as part of a three-year plan to boost profits.
	   ANA said it will reduce aircraft purchases, hold down new hiring
and trim senior executives' salaries by introducing a
performance-based wage system.
	   Monthly salaries of ANA board members will be cut by 10 to 20
percent and their bonuses will be eliminated, it said.
	   In addition, the air carrier said it would stop service on some
money-losing routes in Japan and consider transferring rights to
new international routes to American partner United Airlines.
	   In May, ANA forecast a net loss of 6 billion yen (dlrs 43.5
million) for the current fiscal year, ending in March 1999.
	   It reported a net loss of 2.68 billion yen (dlrs 19.4 million)
in the 12 months ended March 31 this year.
	   Pilots at ANA went on strike in early April after the airline
began implementing a new wage system that pilots said reduced their
pay. But the walkout ended later that month.
	   On Monday, the pilots called off a planned resumption of the
strike. No reason was given for the decision.

Six killed in Yemen unrest over fuel price hike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Six people were killed when police exchanged
gunfire with tribesmen blocking gas trucks in central Yemen Tuesday
in the fifth straight day of violence over a 40 percent hike in
fuel prices.
	   Tribesmen also blew up part of an oil pipeline, news reports
said.
	   The latest deaths raised to 12 the number of people killed in
rioting since Friday when the government announced it had raised
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas to meet the
International Monetary Fund's demands.
	   Tuesday's violence occurred in the city of Marib where members
of the al-Jidaan tribe, armed with guns, stopped trucks coming in
to load up on gas.
	   Four tribesmen were killed when police fired live ammunition at
the protesters, who returned fire, a source in the al-Jidaan tribe
said. Two truck drivers were killed in the cross-fire, he said,
adding that four policemen were injured.
	   The demonstrators also set alight three police jeeps, said the
tribesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The protests have continued despite a ban on demonstrations, and
are turning into the worst crisis in years for the government of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
	   ``The people want the government to fight corruption and
nepotism and eliminate all unnecessary government expenditures.
They don't want to feel they are alone in suffering the burden of
the price hikes,'' said Mohammad al-Magalih, a member of a
coalition of opposition parties.
	   Three demonstrators were killed on Monday in similar violence in
Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital, San`a.
One person was killed in the southern city of Taiz on Monday and
two were shot to death in the San`a suburb of Arhab on Sunday.
	   The al-Wahdawi weekly newspaper reported Tuesday that tribesmen
used dynamite to blow up Monday parts of a 360-kilometer (223-mile)
gas pipeline between Marib and the Red Sea port city of Rass Eissa.
	   The weekly did not give details.
	   Officials at U.S. company Hunt Oil, which operates the pipeline,
would not comment.
	   On Tuesday, police in the southern port city of Aden arrested
Abdul-Wahid al-Muradi, a leader of the opposition Socialist Party,
on charges of attempting to organize citywide protests, a party
spokesman said.
	   Riot police in jeeps and on foot have been deployed in the
cities of San`a and Taiz to quell protests by demonstrators calling
for removing the price hikes and the resignation of Prime Minister
Abdul Karim al-Iryani.
	   The hikes were supposed to be implemented in January but were
delayed because of difference of opinion between President Saleh,
the real power in Yemen, and then prime minister, Faraj Bin Ghanem.
	   Bin Ghanem was replaced by al-Iryani, a Saleh loyalist, last
month.
	   Increasing fuel rates are in line with IMF's requirements to
remove subsidies on petroleum products and other commodities by the
end of 1998 in Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.

Securitate control media and are in parliament and government 
</HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Communist secret police members and
informers still control the Romanian media and government as well
as hold seats in parliament, a former ant-Communist dissident said
Tuesday.
	   The influence of the oppressive secret police, known as the
Securitate, will not end until Romania faces up to its Communist
past, and excludes former Securitate collaborators from holding
office, said Silviu Brucan.
	   Former Securitate agents and informers _ said to have included
one in four of Romania's adult population under Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu _ ``are very good at disinformation,'' said
Brucan, an 82-year-old former Ambassador to the United States and
Ceausescu opponent in the late 1980s.
	   Brucan said Securitate agents in key positions in media and
other branches of Romanian life were responsible for the now
commonly held Romanian view that the 1989 revolution, in which
Ceausescu was executed, was a coup orchestrated by foreign agents
with the help of the Romanian army.
	   Brucan's statements about the Securitate is unusual in Romania,
where people still fear the secret police and prefer to pretend
that no one worked for it. Anyone who is forced to admit to being
an agent or informer always insists they harmed no one.
	   Billions of Securitate files remain closed to the public, almost
nine years after Ceausescu was killed, meaning the exact identity
of agents and informers is unknown.
	   Romania has been rocked this month by leaks which have exposed
at least one government minister and several prominent politicians
as Securitate collaborators. All of them belong to parties which
claim to oppose the influence of Romania's former secret police.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile has demanded his ministers state
whether or not they collaborated, and said he will fire any who
did.
	   Brucan, a leader of the 1989 anti-communist revolution, still
carries influence with a closely watched weekly television show
called ``Prophets from the past,'' which analyses current affairs.

Slovene president welcomes welcomes joining European Union 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Joining the European Union will be
the ``moment of truth'' for this young nation, the Slovene
president said on Tuesday.
	   In an address to mark the country's seventh National Day,
President Milan Kucan said Slovenia is in a new position since
entering negotiations for EU membership in March.
	   ``These negotiations will evaluate the maturity of Slovenia,''
Kucan told journalists. He added that joining the EU would testify
to how far the young nation has come. ``This will be a moment of
truth for Slovenia.''
	   Slovenia broke away from the former Yugoslavia on June 26, 1991,
triggering the first war of secession, and held its first free
elections the following year.
	   While much has improved in the small, mountainous country, Kucan
said changes still had to be made in the country's foreign policy
and internal structure, especially in taxation and pensions.
	   ``The time of improvisation is over,'' he said.
	   Kucan also mentioned the crisis in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, warning that it was no longer an internal Yugoslav problem,
because it risked destabilizing the whole of Europe.
	   ``It is impossible to solve the Kosovo crisis without the active
role of the international community and without international
guarantees for Kosovo's autonomy,'' Kucan said.

Condition of policeman unimproved; second suspect identified prison; TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with English supporter sentenced to four months in
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The prospects of a French policeman whose
head was bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with
doctors calling his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   A second suspect, meanwhile, was identified in the attack
Sunday. French radio reports said the man was among the 15 Germans
already detained for suspected involvement in the melee.
	   The first suspect, a 27-year-old from Hanover, was to face a
judge later Tuesday, as were about 12 other Germans.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan was
sentenced to four months in prison for soccer violence in Marseille
during the England-Tunisia game last week. Maurice Woodward, 26,
was also banned from returning to France for two years after his
jail term.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old policeman and father of two, was in
a deep coma in a Lille hospital after suffering ``repeated violent
blows from a massive object'' _ actually an iron bar _ following
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said.
	   They said Tuesday morning that it was impossible, for the time
being, to make an accurate forecast regarding his health.
	   Nivel was cornered by a group of neo-Nazis on a narrow street in
Lens, a nearby town in northern France. He collapsed unconscious in
a pool of blood on the sidewalk.
	   At the other end of the country in Toulouse, 1,800 police were
in force Monday outside the England-Romania game, to guard against
a repeat of the violence that plagued Marseille, site of England's
last contest.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars kept most
violence in check. About 10 people were arrested and three injured
in a couple of minor scuffles, police said.
	   A British reporter, Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association,
broke his collarbone when English fans, who accused him of giving
them a bad name, threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But, he said, the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.

Turkey to sign deal with IMF in coming days 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey is to sign an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund which would allow the financial
organization to closely survey its economy, Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said Tuesday.
	   Yilmaz said the agreement would be signed within the coming
days. The agreement would not involve any IMF loans, he added.
	   ``We do not need any kind of material help from the IMF,''
Yilmaz said. ``What we want is for the IMF to give a green light in
favor of Turkey in world markets.''
	   Turkey's soaring inflation, with prices doubling annually, has
worried the financial institution, which has been pressing the
government to undertake bold reforms to fight it.
	   Among the reforms is a long-awaited social security reform,
which the government has promised to introduce.
	   Turkey hopes that the IMF deal will increase Turkey's credit
worthiness and increase its prestige in international markets.
	   Gunes Taner, the state minister in charge of the economy is
currently in Washington to finalize the deal.

World Cup: Tunisia third team to fire coach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Tunisian soccer federation has fired its
national team coach Henry Kasperczak, the French organizing
committee reported Tuesday.
	   The move comes one day after the team's 1-0 loss to Colombia in
Montpellier. Polish-born Kasperczak will be replaced by his
assistant coach, Ali Selmi, a statement said.
	   The Tunisians earlier were beaten 2-0 by England and were
eliminated from the World Cup after Romania's 2-1 win over England.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Tunisian federation.
	   Kasperczak is the third coach to be fired in this World Cup
after their teams failed to qualify for the second round.
	   Saudi coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was sacked on Saturday after
his team failed to qualify for the second round, following a 4-0
defeat by France on Thursday.
	   South Korean coach Cha Bum-kun was fired Sunday after a crushing
5-0 loss to the Netherlands.

Palestinians complain to Security Council about house demolitions Bank 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new house demolitions in West
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The PLO has complained to the U.N. Security
Council about Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes, a
Palestinian lawmaker said Tuesday, even as Israel destroyed a house
and four Bedouin shacks in the West Bank.
	   Israel routinely demolishes Palestinian homes built without
license in Jerusalem and areas of the West Bank still under Israeli
control. The Palestinians say Israel rarely grants construction
permits to Palestinians, forcing expanding families to build
without permission.
	   The home of Mustafa Daoud, under construction in the village of
Yatta, near Hebron, was demolished Tuesday because it was being
built without a permit. The Bedouin were told their shacks were
torn down because they were too close to an Israeli army training
base.
	   ``They want us to leave our land, but we will remain,'' said
Nasser Kaabneh, whose home was one of those destroyed.
	   The Palestinians charge that the demolitions are part of a
deliberate campaign by Israel to restrict Palestinian expansion in
the West Bank in advance of a final settlement on borders. The
United States has urged Israel to refrain from demolitions as a
confidence-building measure to help re-start the stalled peace
talks.
	   On Monday, Israeli bulldozers razed the home of 37-year-old
Mustafa Dadean on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, leaving
eight people homeless.
	   ``I will start to rebuild the house again because this is the
way we have of confronting the Israeli authorities,'' Dadean said.
	   Palestinian legislator Salah Taamari said the PLO has asked the
U.N. Security Council to discuss the house demolitions as part of a
debate on Israel's plan to expand Jerusalem. Under that plan,
Israel would extend Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
	   ``Netanyahu is pushing the area towards an explosion. We have
done everything possible to stop these house demolitions. We have
objected both in the international community and in the streets,''
Taamari said.
	   ``All we can do is to protest once more to the international
community.''

FDA approves first new TB drug in 25 years 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
approved the first new tuberculosis drug in 25 years.
	   The FDA said Tuesday that it has approved rifapentine, which is
marketed under the name Priftin by Marion Merrell Dow of Kansas
City, Missouri. The United States is the first country to approve
the drug.
	   An advisory panel voted 10-1 to recommended approval earlier
this month for the drug that can cut significantly the number of
pills a patient has to take to cure the pulmonary TB.
	   FDA officials say this is important because it makes patients
more likely to complete their therapy. Failure to complete therapy
can lead to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.
	   The World Health Organization estimated there will be 90 million
new cases of tuberculosis and 30 million deaths worldwide in the
decade of the 1990s.
	   According to the Centers for Disease Control about 19,000 cases
were diagnosed in the United States in 1997.
	   Tuberculosis is extremely hard to treat, requiring patients to
take four drugs two times a week for two months then two drugs once
a week for four more months.
	   Failure to complete that course can lead to deadly
multidrug-resistant TB, so many areas require patients to take the
pills in front of a health-care worker.
	   In tests in South Africa, using rifapentine allowed patients to
take their drugs just once a week during the last four months of
therapy.
	   In studies, rifapentine was used in combination with other TB
drugs, isoniazid, pyrazinamid and ethambutol.
	   Rifapentine did have a higher relapse rate _ 10 percent compared
to 5 percent using other therapy _ but none of the relapsed
patients who used rifapentine developed drug-resistant TB.

Chinese nationalists depart for disputed island chain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Thirty activists left Taiwan Tuesday night
aboard three fishing boats in a new bid to land on a group of
uninhabited East China Sea islands administered by Japan but
claimed by China and Taiwan.
	   They were scheduled to meet and sail to the islands together
with 25 protesters from Hong Kong who left that Chinese territory
aboard their own boat on Sunday.
	   Activists briefly attacked four Japanese reporters on the scene
while port authorities inspected the boats, but no serious injuries
were reported. Police escorted the reporters away.
	   The Taiwan contingent is led by Kin Chieh-shou, a local council
member from the tiny New Party, which strongly advocates Taiwan's
reunification with China.
	   New Party lawmaker Lee Ching-hau, a son of former Premier Lee
Huan, was among the crowd at Keelung fishing port on Taiwan's north
coast seeing the group off with marching music and chants of ``Long
live the Republic of China,'' the Taiwanese government's formal
name.
	   Funding problems restricted the size of the protest to three
boats, the TVBS television network reported. Previous armadas have
boasted up to 31 boats.
	   The protesters expected to arrive at the Diaoyu islands at
around 4:30 a.m. (2030 GMT).
	   Taiwan and China claim the islands have been theirs for
centuries. Japan first claimed the group in 1895 and has
administered them since 1972.
	   Kin led a series of expeditions to the islands in 1996 and 1997,
and briefly raised a Taiwanese flag during one landing. Equipped
with wet suits and inflatable rafts, his group staged a rehearsal
landing last week at an island just off Taiwan's north coast.
	   A Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned in 1996 when
Japanese coast guard vessels prevented an expedition he was leading
from landing on he islands.
	   The disputed islands, called the Senkakus in Japanese, lie amid
rich fishing grounds and possible oil and gas deposits midway
between Taiwan and Japan's Okinawa Island.
	   In Okinawa, Akira Suzuki, a spokesman of Japan's coast guard,
said, ``We are prepared to respond appropriately to any illegal
entry.''
	   Suzuki said the coast guard maintains air and sea patrols around
the disputed islands.

Latvian lawmakers give final approval to citizenship law changes reaction

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a move that officials hope will improve
relations with Russia, Latvia's Parliament has given final approval
to amendments softening the country's controversial citizenship
law.
	   After eight hours of heated debate, lawmakers voted 49-26 late
Monday to accept a package of amendments making it easier for
Russian-speakers in the country to acquire citizenship, the Baltic
News Service BNS reported.
	   In a population of 2.5 million, some 700,000 people are
stateless, most of them Russian-speakers who emigrated to Latvia
during five decades of Soviet rule.
	   After its newly won independence in 1991, Latvia granted
automatic citizenship only to those who lived in the country before
World War II and their descendants. This left virtually all
Soviet-era immigrants and their children stateless.
	   The Kremlin has accused Latvia of using citizenship laws to
permanently disenfranchise Russian-speakers who cannot vote in
national elections or hold certain jobs without citizenship.
	   An estimated 25,000 children will now become immediately
eligible for Latvian citizenship because the new amendments grant
automatic citizenship to all children born in Latvia after
independence.
	   Adults, however, will still have to pass tough language tests
proving proficiency in Latvian which most non-citizens do not
speak. Moscow says it also wants the language requirement to be
waived.
	   The dispute between Latvia and Russia had intensified in recent
months with Moscow threatening trade sanctions. The European Union
and NATO had also urged Latvian legislators to adopt changes to the
law.
	   Max van der Stoel, the commissioner for national minorities of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he
was encouraged by the amendments.
	   ``Once the law has come into force ... the key elements of my
recommendations regarding citizenship and naturalization will have
been fulfilled,'' he said in a press statement.
	   ``Together with the implementation of (a national program
teaching Latvian to Russian-speakers), these steps can serve to
promote the process of integration which is presently under
discussion in Latvia,'' van der Stoel said.
	   Many Latvians are still bitter about the influx of Russians
during Soviet rule and say softening of naturalization rules is a
threat to the ethnic Latvian majority.

ETA claims responsibility for two murders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA
chalked up two more slayings in its violent campaign for an
independent homeland straddling the Spanish-French border.
	   ETA said it killed Tomas Caballero _ a town councilor from the
northern city of Pamplona _ on May 6 and retired Civil Guard
officer Alfonso Parada two days later some 80 kilometers (50 miles)
farther east in the town of Vitoria.
	   In a communique published in Tuesday's edition of the radical
Basque newspaper Elgin, ETA confirmed it was responsible for the
slayings and several other recent attacks.
	   Caballero and Parado were shot dead, the fourth and fifth
slayings attributed to ETA this year.
	   It is common for the separatists to wait several weeks before
taking responsibility for attacks via communiques sent to Elgin.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed some 800 people in its 30-year campaign for
independence.

World community commits to ending exploitation of children in war 
</HEADLINE>
By JENNY E. HELLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Representatives of worldwide organizations and
government ministers resolved Tuesday to pressure all countries to
stop the abuse of children as ``instruments of warfare.''
	   A two-day symposium organized by Britain and several U.N.
agencies considered the plight of children in war-torn countries,
who are often forced into military service at the age of 12 or 13,
sexually abused by soldiers and attacked in their homes and
schools.
	   ``In Rwanda, during the genocide of 1994, some children were
even forced to kill members of their own families,'' said Clare
Short, Britain's secretary of state for international development.
	   Olara A. Otunnu, the U.N.'s special representative for children
and armed conflict, said he advocates raising the international
recruitment age for military service to 18.
	   Participants in the conference, including ministers from the 15
European Union countries and representatives of other nations,
agreed to take steps toward enforcing the international law that
makes recruiting children under 15 to fight a war crime.
	   They expressed their support for the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child, which dictates a set of protective standards
for children almost universally endorsed by governments.
	   ``The nature of war has been transformed,'' Ms. Short said in a
speech at the symposium. ``One consequence of the historical shift
is that vulnerable people, particularly women and children, are now
among the principal victims of war.''
	   Otunnu demanded that all countries recognize the value of human
life and take adequate steps to protect all people. He said
countries must ensure that ``in trying to punish a state with
sanctions or military intervention, one does not end up punishing
innocent children.''
	   On recent trips to areas of conflict, such as Sri Lanka and the
Sudan, Ottunu said he has extracted promises from rebel and
government leaders to protect children.
	   At his urging, the U.N. Security Council is currently discussing
measures to prevent the exploitation of children in war.

Up to 30 million English watch Romania game on television 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More people watched England's World Cup loss to
Romania than any other soccer match telecast on a single channel in
the last two decades.
	   The Broadcast Audience Research Board said Tuesday that as many
as 30 million people had watched ITV's telecast of the game,
including 21.6 million people who tuned-in at home.
	   Monday's match in Toulouse attracted 71 percent of all home
viewers who were tuning in at that time.
	   England's 1990 World Cup semi-final against Germany was seen by
25.2 million viewers on two channels.
	   The 1996 European Championship semi-final between the same two
sides gained a combined audience of 23.8 million.
	   Initial research puts the average home audience at 19.5 million
for the match - but that figure was two million higher in the final
quarter of an hour when Romania kicked the winning goal.
	   The viewing audience figure was increased by estimates of the
number of people watching in pubs and clubs.
	   The game proved more popular than Britain's top soaps, which
pull in anywhere between 12 and 18 million viewers.

Condition of policeman unimproved; second suspect identified prison; TRIMS  
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with English supporter sentenced to four months in
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The prospects of a French policeman whose
head was bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with
doctors calling his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   A second suspect, meanwhile, was identified in the attack
Sunday. French radio reports said the man was among the 15 Germans
already detained for suspected involvement in the melee.
	   The first suspect, a 27-year-old from Hanover, was to face a
judge later Tuesday, as were about 12 other Germans.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan was
sentenced to four months in prison for soccer violence in Marseille
during the England-Tunisia game last week. Maurice Woodward, 26,
was also banned from returning to France for two years after his
jail term.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old policeman and father of two, was in
a deep coma in a Lille hospital after suffering ``repeated violent
blows from a massive object'' _ actually an iron bar _ following
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said.
	   They said Tuesday morning that it was impossible, for the time
being, to make an accurate forecast regarding his health.
	   Nivel was cornered by a group of neo-Nazis on a narrow street in
Lens, a nearby town in northern France. He collapsed unconscious in
a pool of blood on the sidewalk.
	   At the other end of the country in Toulouse, 1,800 police were
in force Monday outside the England-Romania game, to guard against
a repeat of the violence that plagued Marseille, site of England's
last contest.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars kept most
violence in check. About 10 people were arrested and three injured
in a couple of minor scuffles, police said.
	   A British reporter, Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association,
broke his collarbone when English fans, who accused him of giving
them a bad name, threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But, he said, the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.

World Cup: Substitute's job isn't that hopeless on French team 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Substitutes often are the
unluckiest participants of the World Cup. So close, yet so far from
the action, it can leave them frustrated, bitter and wishing they
were somewhere else.
	   Not so with France.
	   Going into Wednesday's third match after two victories, coach
Aime Jacquet has said he will tap that vast well of substitutes. In
the first round, he is expected to have used at least 20 of his 22
players.
	   For a team still in contention for the cup, the strategy has
inherent dangers. If France loses Wednesday's game, its road to the
next stages of the tournament will be strewn with Nigeria and
probably Brazil.
	   But if France clinches a draw or victory and gets an easier
passage, it will be another coup of Jacquet over his critics and he
will enter the second round with rested men. On top of that, four
players under the threat of suspension because of yellow cards will
have a clean sheet again.
	   ``You have to know how to manage the group,'' Jacquet said
Tuesday after his squad set up camp in the rolling sun-splashed
Beaujolais vineyards north of Lyon, where Wednesday's match will be
played.
	   Then again, not every coach has such star substitutes at his
disposal.
	   Midfielder Christian Karembeu has won the European Champions Cup
with Real Madrid, but is still waiting for his first minute of
action. So is Franck Leboeuf, who captured the European Cupwinners
Cup with Chelsea last month.
	   Patrick Vieira, who clinched a league-cup double with Arsenal,
is another of France's high-profile substitutes.
	   So despite Jacquet's wholesale changes to the team, his
predictions that France will be just as bold and spectacular as
during the first two victories do not sound farfetched.
	   Keeping stars on the bench is also a tough job, trying to keep
them match-ready yet offering little or no hope they will be able
to play.
	   ``We are frustrated on the bench, we are living every moment
with those on the pitch and often feel just as tired afterwards,''
said Christian Karembeu.
	   ``You just want to get up and hit that ball,'' he said. On
Wednesday, he will.
	   And so will AS Roma's Vincent Candela. ``You're always a bit
bitter when you don't play. The World Cup is for 22, so it's good
that everyone takes part.''
	   Still, even if those substitutes help France beat Denmark, they
may disappear quickly into the shadows of the dugout yet again.
	   ``I will prove I'm a great professional and I will go back to
the bench with a smile on my face,'' said Leboeuf. ``It will be
frustrating but I wish them well.''
	   So does Vieira, whatever happens.
	   ``If you tell me 'France wins the World Cup but you don't play a
second,' I would sign immediately,'' he said.

Duncan homers twice as Giants beat Carp 9-4 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mariano Duncan went 4-for-5 and drove in three runs
with two homers as the Yomiuri Giants beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp
9-4 Tuesday at Hiroshima.
	   Duncan, formerly with the Toronto Blue Jays, has 10 homers this
season.
	   The Carp suffered their sixth straight defeat.
	   The Giants remained one game behind the Yokohama BayStars, who
gained sole possession of the Central League lead even though their
game with the Yakult Swallows at Hiratsuka was rained out.
	   The Chunichi Dragons lost their share of the lead, falling
one-half game behind, when they fell 7-5 to the Hanshin Tigers at
Nagoya Dome.
	   Hiroshia Yagi singled home two runs and Osamu Hoshino hit a
one-run single in the three-run ninth inning for the Tigers.
	   Lee Jong Beom of the Dragons was hit by Tatsuro Kawajiri's pitch
in the fourth. Kyodo News agency reported that Lee, formerly with
the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's professional baseball league,
suffered a fracture of the right elbow.
	   In the Pacific League, Yukio Tanaka hit a home run in the third
inning and singled home the winning run in the ninth as the Nippon
Ham Fighters edged the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 7-6 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Tanaka has 17 homers and leads the league.
	   The Fighters are 1 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Kintetsu
Buffaloes, who beat the Orix BlueWave 3-2 at Osaka Dome.
	   The Buffaloes scored two runs in the fourth on Takahisa Suzuki's
single and added a run in the fifth on Masao Kida's wild pitch
following a triple by Eiji Mizuguchi.
	   Kida (3-3), who gave up 10 hits, took the loss.
	   At Toyama, Fumiya Nishiguchi pitched a four-hitter, leading the
Seibu Lions to a 4-0 victory over the Chiba Lotte Marines.
Nishiguchi is 3-7.

World Cup: Chile leads Cameroon 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Jose Sierra curled a 30-meter free kick
into the top right corner of the net in the 31st minute, giving
Chile a 1-0 halftime lead over Cameroon in one of two Group B
finales Tuesday.
	   A victory would advance Chile to the second round of the
tournament. A draw, which would be its third in three games, could
also advance Chile pending the outcome of the Italy-Austria game
being played at the same time.
	   Cameroon needed to win the game and hope that Italy would defeat
or tie Austria. Italy and Austria were tied 0-0 at halftime.
	   Before a colorful and overwhelmingly Chilean crowd at the Stade
de la Beaujoire, Chile controlled possession for most of the half
and only the heroics of Cameroon goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o and
defender Rigobert Song kept the South Americans from scoring more
than once.
	   In the 12th minute, Songo'o fell back on his heels to stop Pedro
Reyes' close-range header, and Song cleared away Ivan Zamorano's
follow-up shot off the goal line. In the 33rd, Marcelo Salas was
denied when midfielder Joseph Ndo kicked the Chilean striker's shot
off the post.
	   Cameroon came to life late in the half with two scoring chances
from Francois Omam Biyick. Biyick's 20-meter blast was disallowed
for offsides in the 35th, and goalkeeper Nelson Tapia stopped
another Biyick drive with a right-handed punch save a minute later.
	   Chile was seeking its first-ever World Cup win in a foreign
country. Its only victories came when it played host to the event
and finished third in 1962.

In disputed Jerusalem, even archaeological tour is contentious 
</HEADLINE>

By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With tensions over Jerusalem at a boiling
point, a tour of an archaeological dig at a disputed site
deteriorated Tuesday into finger-wagging shouting matches between
Jewish and Arab lawmakers.
	   ``Five thousand years there have been Jews here!'' shouted Rabbi
Benny Alon of the ultranationalist Moledet, or Homeland, party.
	   ``Arabs live here, why are you here?'' yelled back Salah Tarif,
an Arab legislator from Israel's opposition Labor Party.
	   Israeli police blocked representatives of the Orient House, the
PLO's unofficial headquarters in Jerusalem, from going on the tour.
	   Ateret Cohanim wants to build a new enclave at the site, which
is near Herod's Gate in the Muslim Quarter of the walled Old City,
surrounded by Palestinian neighborhoods. But Gideon Avni, Jerusalem
district archaeologist for Israel's Antiquities Authority, said
Tuesday that it would be ``many, many months'' before a survey dig
at the site is completed and officials can decide whether any
construction could take place.
	   Ateret Cohanim is waging a campaign to move Jews into
Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods, often buying property in secret
through Palestinian land dealers. Palestinians say the campaign has
the support of the Israeli government and is pre-empting their
claims to east Jerusalem as a future capital.
	   Clashes broke out several weeks ago when Ateret Cohanim set up
pre-fabricated tin sheds overnight at the Herod's Gate site, which
it owns. The sheds were removed, and exploratory excavations _
required by Israeli law before any construction can be authorized _
began two weeks ago. The results of the excavations will determine
whether any building can be carried out there.
	   On Tuesday, tractors cleared away debris at the site, stirring
up centuries of chalky dust.
	   Avni said preliminary digging had already turned up signs of
remains from the Ottoman, Crusader, Byzantine and Roman periods.
	   ``The implication is that the archaeological excavation of the
whole plot is going to be a very very long process,'' he said.
``We're speaking about many, many months of excavations.''
	   Avni said it was too early to predict prospects for building at
the site.
	   One possibility is that buildings could be erected above the
archaeological site, on stilts, as has been done in other parts of
the Old City. But any such buildings would still have to be lower
than the Old City walls, Avni said. The wall ranges in height from
five to 15 meters (16 to 50 feet). Ateret Cohanim hopes to build
high rises to house a Jewish seminary and dozens of families.
	   Taleb Elsana, a legislator from the Democratic Arab Party,
accused Ateret Cohanim of stealing Palestinian land, and said the
archaeological dig was giving legitimacy to the group's actions.

World Cup: Bereaved Jonk to stay with Dutch squad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LA TURBIE, Monaco (AP) _ Dutch midfielder Wim Jonk, whose best
friend was killed in a car crash Monday, trained as usual with the
squad Tuesday and coach Guus Hiddink said Jonk had no immediate
plans to return home.
	   ``As it stands at the moment, he is not going back,'' Hiddink
told reporters at the Dutch training ground in this village in the
mountains above Monte Carlo.
	   Although Jonk, 31, took part in all the training drills, he
generally stood slightly apart from the rest of the team, his head
bowed, when he was resting.
	   The Netherlands' final Group E match is Thursday in
Saint-Etienne against Mexico and Jonk is expected to start. A win
will secure top spot in the group for the Dutch.
	   Phillip Cocu, who slightly injured his ankle in Saturday's 5-0
drubbing of South Korea, was fit again and returned to full
training.
	   Ronald de Boer sat out morning training and had a leg massage on
the sidelines, but Hiddink said he would train as normal at a
closed session Tuesday afternoon.
	   After Monday's relaxed workout and soccer-volleyball tournament
interrupted by a brief visit from Monaco's Prince Albert, the Dutch
were hard at work again Tuesday, going through sprint training and
then playing half-pitch, six-a-side soccer to practice their
passing in tight spaces.
	   Both South Korea and Belgium tried to stifle the fluent Dutch
passing game by quickly closing down players with the ball and
trying to force an early pass. It worked for Belgium who fought out
a 0-0 draw, but the South Koreans could not contain the Dutch and
were badly beaten.
	   Hiddink would not say if he had any specific plans to play
Mexico, but praised them as ``an experienced side full of character
with a lot of talented individuals.''

World Cup: English media hold Hoddle responsible 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English newspapers were quick to pounce on Glenn
Hoddle after his side's 2-1 World Cup loss to Romania, jeopardizing
England's place in the second round.
	   The Independent used the headline ``Outplayed, outwitted,
outclassed'' to describe England's performance and added the team
was ``outplayed to a degree that was embarrassing.''
	   The Sun said Hoddle was ``walking a World Cup tightrope.''
	   While Hoddle blamed poor defense, others were blaming his
tactics.
	   British bookmakers, Ladbrokes, meanwhile lengthened England's
odds on winning the World Cup from 8-1 to 20-1 and started taking
bets on who would succeed him _ despite the fact he's only halfway
through a four-year contract.
	   Even television commentator and former Newcastle manager Kevin
Keegan, tipped by bookmakers as one of Hoddle's possible
replacements, came in for some blame for the loss.
	   Keegan angered many fans, who said he put a jinx on England by
predicting a victory.
	   ``Only one team is going to win it now _ and that's England,''
Keegan boldly proclaimed after England had equalized 1-1 late in
the second half.
	   Minutes later, Romania's Dan Petrescu scored the winning goal.
	   The only stars to emerge in the English press were 18-year-old
Liverpool striker Michael Owen and Manchester United's midfielder
David Beckham.
	   Hoddle's decision to omit both players from England's starting
lineup _ against Romania and Tunisia _ angered many fans. Both
excelled as substitutes in the Monday loss with Owens scoring
England's only goal.
	   The Sun's front-page headline was: ``Becks to the Wall _ Beckham
and Owen shine as England go down fighting.''
	   The Sun said Beckham ``fought like a lion in midfield'', while
``Wonder kid Michael Owen _ another substitute _ got the goal.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped in to defend Hoddle.
	   His official spokesman said team selection was up to Hoddle and
``it is our job to get behind him.''

World Cup: Italy and Austria deadlocked 0-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Italy and Austria were tied 0-0 after
a cagey first half at the Stade de France on Tuesday, in a vital
Group B match.
	   Chances were few and far between in the first 45 minutes, played
in front of 80,000 spectators at the Stade de France.
	   Francesco Moriero came closest for Italy in the first half.
	   In the 29th minute, Gianluca Pessotto crossed from the left and
Moriero hit a spectacular right-footed volley from 15 yards that
went wide of the post.
	   Italy got an early blow within the first three minutes when
Lazio defender Alessandro Nesta went off injured after a clash with
Austrian midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Nesta was replaced by 34-year-old Inter Milan sweeper Guiseppe
Bergomi.
	   Italy began the game knowing that a draw would almost certainly
give it top spot in Group B. With a high-scoring draw, Austria had
a slim chance of qualification, but realistically needed a win to
progress.
	   Italy surprisingly left out Milan midfielder Demetrio Albertini,
with coach Cesare Maldini prefering the more defensive Pessotto.
	   Austria started with Ivica Vastic, the 18-year-old midfielder
who, as substitute, kept Austria in the tournament with a fine
injury-time goal against Chile.
	   It was Vastic who came closest for Austria in the early
exchanges with a right-footed drive from 15 yards that went over
the bar.
	   With Chile leading against Cameroon in the other Group B game,
Austria began to push forward.
	   In the 26th minute, Anton Polster hit a shot from 20 yards that
was well blocked by Fabio Cannavaro.
	   Austria was in aggressive mood with a series of crunching
tackles that left three of its players booked in the first 45
minutes.
	   Alessandro Del Piero was the main target, and in the 31st minute
the Juventus star was flattened as he was ready to shoot from just
outside the penalty area.
	   Christian Vieri was tightly marked and had no chances to add to
his three World Cup goals.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Italy: Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta (Guiseppe Bergomi,
3rd), Paolo Maldini, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta,
Francesco Moriero, Dino Baggio, Luigi Di Biagio, Gianluca Pessotto,
Christian Vieri, Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Austria: Michael Konsel; Anton Pfeffer, Wolfgang Feiersinger,
Peter Schoettel, Dietmar Kuehbauer, Roman Maehlich, Heimo
Pfeifenberger, Arnold Wetl, Ivica Vastic, Hannes Reinmayr, Anton
Polster.

Chinese dissident's wife invites Clinton to her home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The wife of an ailing Chinese dissident has
invited U.S. President Bill CIinton to her home and asked him to
press Chinese leaders for her husband's release, a human rights
group said Tuesday.
	   Chu Hailan said that by visiting her Beijing home during his
trip to China starting Thursday, Clinton could ``see how ordinary
Chinese people live,'' Human Rights in China said.
	   Chu enclosed her telephone number and address in a letter to
Clinton, the New York-based group said. It said it had received a
number of letters from dissidents and their families ahead of
Clinton's visit that it would translate and pass on to the White
House.
	   Clinton has said that during his visit, he will push for
improved human rights. But he does not plan to visit dissidents for
fear that Chinese authorities might harass them after he leaves.
	   Chu's husband, veteran labor activist Liu Nianchun, is China's
most prominent jailed dissident. Human Rights in China said Liu's
name topped a list of political prisoners that Clinton would
present to Chinese leaders.
	   It also said that during his meetings with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, Clinton would ask for the release on medical grounds
of a group of political prisoners, including Liu.
	   Liu suffers stomach problems, high blood pressure and other
ailments, according to his wife. She said Liu's 82-year-old mother,
who had not seen her son since he was taken away by police three
years ago, had trouble recognizing him during a visit last month
because he had lost so much weight and aged while in detention.
	   Liu has been held in labor camps and prisons without charge or
trial for the past three years. He is due for release in about a
year. Police in China can send detainees to labor camps without
trial.
	   Meanwhile, in another letter to Clinton, labor activist Wang
Hongxue urged the U.S. president to pressure Chinese leaders into
allowing the establishment of free trade unions, Human Rights in
China said.
	   Wang, based in eastern Anhui province, said Chinese workers at
present have no way of protecting their interests, the group added.

U.S. lifts some travel restrictions on Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Bill Clinton has lifted some
restrictions on air travel to Lebanon that had been in effect since
the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner to Beirut, a U.S. Embassy
statement said Tuesday.
	   But Clinton's decision kept in place a ban on direct flights
involving U.S. carriers and flights between American airports and
Beirut.
	   The embassy statement said U.S. airlines can now link up with
other airlines that fly to Lebanon to provide travelers from
America smooth connections from the United States.
	   In the past, U.S. travel agents were not allowed to sell tickets
with Beirut as the destination, and travelers were forced to fly to
Lebanon only on a ticket purchased outside America. Now American
residents can buy one ticket, good for travel between the United
States and Lebanon, the embassy statement said.
	   The announcement came despite explosions near the U.S. Embassy
in Beirut on Sunday and a few days after a visit by Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri to Washington.
	   The explosions, which caused no casualties and little damage,
posed the first threat to Americans in Lebanon in several years.
	   The airline restrictions were imposed in July 1985 after Muslim
gunmen hijacked a TWA jetliner to Lebanon, where 37 American
hostages were held for 17 days. An American passenger was killed by
the hijackers.
	   The memorandum changing the rules was signed by Clinton on
Friday and announced by the White House Monday, the statement said.
	   In July 1997, the Clinton administration lifted a decade-old ban
on the use of U.S. passports for travel to Lebanon. The State
Department replaced the ban with an advisory.

REPEATING with computer codings Guerrilla group refuses to deliver scalp of dead Israeli soldier 
</HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Lebanese group threatened Tuesday to
thwart an expected swap of prisoners and body parts with Israel by
reiterating it would not release an Israeli soldier's scalp.
	   A spokesman for the Shiite Muslim party, Amal, whose guerrillas
retrieved the scalp after an Israeli raid last year, said his group
would not participate in the exchange, slated for later this week.
	   ``The movement considers itself uninvolved in the exchange that
will take place unless its demands are addressed,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on on condition of anonymity.
	   The pro-Syrian group is insisting on freedom for 27 prisoners
held by Israel, which has been fighting a running war with
guerrillas in and around a strip of land it occupies in southern
Lebanon.
	   Ilya was killed during a botched Israeli commando raid in
southern Lebanon on Sept. 5. While the retreating Israelis managed
to take 11 of their dead comrades with them, they did not retrieve
Ilya's body, which had been blown to pieces in an explosion.
	   Most of his remains are in the hands of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, the main guerrilla group fighting Israeli troops in
southern Lebanon and Amal's arch rival.
	   In recent days press reports in Lebanon and Israel have said
Israel would release up to 60 Lebanese prisoners and hand over the
bodies of up to 60 guerrillas killed in the fighting. In return,
Lebanon was to hand over Ilya's body parts.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday that some
details remained to be worked out before the swap took place.
	   Amal's spokesman said another swap between Amal and Israel could
take place at a later date.
	   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli army declined to
respond to Amal's position on Ilya, but it was thought highly
unlikely that the government would accept anything less than the
entire remains of the commando.
	   Danny Grisarou, a spokesman for the families of Israeli
Missing-In-Action troops, told The Associated Press his group would
not accept a swap that returned only part of Ilya.
	   Israel has maintained the zone in southern Lebanon since 1985 in
a bid to protect its northern territory from guerrilla attack.

Graf makes tearful return; rain disrupts Tuesday's play
Eds: Updates with play stopped by rain; minor editing to conform
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Just being back at Wimbledon was
enough to bring Steffi Graf to tears.
	   A year ago, the seven-time champion was recovering from major
knee surgery. Two months ago, her comeback threatened by more
injuries, she considered retirement.
	   So on Monday, after winning her first-round match in straight
sets on Centre Court, Graf was overcome by emotion. Twice during a
news conference, she broke down crying.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' said Graf, playing her 13th Wimbledon. ``It's just special
to be here.''
	   After a rain-free opening day, the start of Tuesday's matches
was delayed because of light showers when women's defending
champion Martina Hingis began play against Lisa Raymond.
	   Hingis won a tight first set, 7-5, and was tied 1-1 with Raymond
in the second set when play was halted by drizzle in mid-afternoon
after an hour's play.
	   In other early matches, No. 3 Jana Novotna was leading Sandra
Kleinova 6-2, 3-2, and No. 6 Venus Williams was up 6-3, 2-1 against
Jana Nejedly.
	   In featured men's matches Tuesday, No. 2 Marcelo Rios was due to
play Francisco Clavet. No. 4 Greg Rusedski, No. 5 Carlos Moya, No.
6 Patrick Rafter and No. 9 Richard Krajicek were also to play.
	   Graf's tears represented a remarkable display from a player who
has rarely expressed her emotions on or off the court.
	   She said she was surprised to be on Centre Court, the scene of
her greatest triumphs, for the opening match against Spain's Gala
Leon Garcia.
	   ``It is not common to play the first match on Centre Court
unless you win the year before, so I didn't take it as normal at
all,'' she said. ``I got really excited, and it definitely pumped
me up to be playing out there.''
	   After some initial nerves, the German star settled down and beat
Garcia 6-4, 6-1, a solid start to her first Grand Slam tournament
since the French Open in 1997.
	   After undergoing surgery after the French, Graf didn't return to
tournament play until March. But she was sidelined again with calf
and hamstring injuries.
	   That's when she started wondering whether her career was over.
	   ``There have been a couple of occasions where it has been really
difficult, seven or eight weeks ago was the last time,'' she said.
``I had so many little injuries and every week something else came
around.''
	   But Graf, who said she now feels ``100 percent,'' must be
considered a title contender.
	   ``There is no question it is my favorite tournament and I do
feel the grass suits my game and experience does help,'' she said.
``But winning is a long way. That is not as far as I am looking
now.''
	   Monday was also an emotional day for Monica Seles, the No. 6
seed, who beat Maria Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo 6-3, 6-4.
	   Seles, who made an inspiring run to the French Open final three
weeks ago, said she has been able to concentrate fully on her game
since the death last month of her father Karolj from stomach
cancer.
	   ``It's the first time in a long time, I've had time to focus
really on tennis, and I'm really glad for it,'' she said.
	   While her career was disrupted by her stabbing in 1993 and her
father's long illness, Seles said she has never thought of
quitting.
	   ``I just love the game way too much, and I wouldn't be thinking
of stopping at all at this point,'' she said. ``For the rest of my
career, I just want to win the most Grand Slams that I can.''
	   One player Graf and Seles won't have to worry about at Wimbledon
is 17-year-old Russian star Anna Kournikova.
	   On Monday, she withdrew because of torn and sprained ligaments
in her right thumb. She hurt herself during a fall in the third set
of a victory against Graf at Eastbourne last Thursday.
	   Two men's seeds were eliminated on opening day. No. 7 Yevgeny
Kafelnikov lost to Australia's Mark Philippoussis 6-7 (7-5), 7-6
(7-1), 6-4, 6-2, while No. 10 Alex Corretja was ousted in straight
sets by Justin Gimelstob.
	   Top-seeded defending champion Pete Sampras eased through his
first match with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Slovakia's Dominik
Hrbaty, while 1992 champ Andre Agassi was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 winner
over Spain's Alex Calatrava.

Securitate control media and are in parliament and government 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING
By ALISON MUTLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Members of and informers for the
Communist secret police, the Securitate, still control media and
are in parliament and government too, a former ant-Communist
dissident said Tuesday.
	   The influence of the oppressive secret police will not end until
Romania faces up to its Communist past, and excludes former
Securitate collaborators from holding office, said Silviu Brucan.
	   Former Securitate agents and informers _ said to have included
one in four of Romania's adult population under Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu _ ``are very good at disinformation,'' said
Brucan, an 82-year-old former Ambassador to the United States and
Ceausescu opponent in the late 1980s.
	   Brucan said Securitate agents in key positions in media and
other branches of Romanian life were responsible for the now
commonly held Romanian view that the 1989 revolution, in which
Ceausescu was executed, was a coup orchestrated by foreign agents
with the help of the Romanian army.
	   Securitate agents and informers ``still control the media and
are members of parliament and government as well,'' Brucan said.
	   His clear statement about the involvement of the Securitate is
unusual in Romania, where people still fear the secret police and
prefer to pretend that no one worked for it. Anyone who is forced
to admit to being an agent or informer always insists they harmed
no one.
	   Billions of Securitate files remain closed to the public, almost
nine years after Ceausescu was killed, meaning the exact identity
of agents and informers is unknown.
	   Romania has been rocked this month by leaks which have exposed
at least one government minister and several prominent politicians
as Securitate collaborators.
	   More shocking is that all of them belong to parties which claim
to oppose the influence of Romania's former secret police.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile has demanded his ministers state
whether or not they collaborated, and said he will fire any who
did.
	   Brucan, a leader of the 1989 anti-communist revolution, still
carries influence with a closely watched weekly television show
called ``Prophets from the past,'' which analyses current affairs.
	   He was harassed and put under virtual house arrest by the
Securitate in the 1980s after he criticized Ceausescu. He was one
of the leaders of the revolution.
	   Brucan's biography ``From Capitalism to Socialism and back
Again,'' is a fascinating inside look at the machinations of
Romania's Communist period, the anti-communist uprising, the
Securitate and his life as ambassador to Washington in the 1950s.
	   The book marks Brucan as an outsider _ his Jewishness meant he
was denied a proper education in pre-World War II Romania, and his
father's profitable wool business went bust in the 1929 worldwide
economic crash.
	   Brucan turned to communism, and still defines himself as a man
of the left. But he says Romania now needs a center-right
government to push through market reforms and become prosperous.
	   He is angry at his two-month exile to a small village and
several Securitate examinations in the late 1980s _ and bitter that
newspapers highlight his Communist past, remembering him as editor
of the party newspaper, Scinteia.
	   ``The intelligentsia does not like the fact that there were
dissidents under Ceausescu _ but they weren't among them,'' Brucan
said in his study, surrounded by photos of him greeting the current
Pope and seated at the United Nations.
	   Why not re-enter politics or play a greater role in Romania?
``One, I do not want power,'' said Brucan. Secondly, ``the question
is how, not why.''

Belarus clears itself of human rights violations, lambastes West 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The first parliamentary hearings on human
rights in Belarus quickly turned into an anti-West rally on
Tuesday, with the United States taking most of the criticism.
	   Washington is ``creating difficulties for the Belarusian people
and state'' with its frequent complaints that President Alexander
Lukashenko's government violates human rights, the head of the
presidential administration, Mikhail Myasnikovich, said during the
hearings.
	   Belarus has ``no fundamental problems with the observation of
human rights,'' Myasnikovich said.
	   Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West since
dissolving parliament and adopting sweeping powers in the former
Soviet republic more than a year ago. He has maintained strong
government controls over the economy, curbed press freedoms and
kept a tight rein on the opposition.
	   Foreign diplomats are currently claiming that Lukashenko has
violated the Vienna Convention by demanding they leave their homes
in Minsk so that repairs can be carried out.
	   Myasnikovich said that for the majority of Belarusians, social
stability and safety are the most important human rights. He said
that only three percent of Belarusians think the right to gather
and hold demonstrations is the most valuable right. He gave no
indication how that figure was arrived at.
	   ``And it's understood that the three percent _ those are people
for whom political ambition is more important than peace and well
being in one's own home,'' he said.
	   In a reference to the United States, Myasnikovich called for a
``decisive rebuff to those who impose their views and notions of
democracy, taking advantage of strength and international
influence.''

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The IAAF has declined to ratify a
women's indoor 800-meter time as a world record after reviewing
video evidence.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation council announced
Tuesday it would not ratify Maria Mutola's 800-meter time of
1:56.36 set in Lievin, France, on Feb. 22, after taking advice from
its technical committee.
	   An IAAF council spokesman said television images showed Mutola
had run outside her lane during the final bend of the race.
	   The indoor world record for women's 800 meters remains 1:56.40
set by Germany's Christine Wachtel in Vienna in February 1988.

Palestinians complain to Security Council about house demolitions Bank 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new house demolitions in West
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The PLO has complained to the U.N. Security
Council about Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes, a
Palestinian lawmaker said Tuesday, even as Israel destroyed a house
and four Bedouin shacks in the West Bank.
	   Israel routinely demolishes Palestinian homes built without a
license in Jerusalem and areas of the West Bank still under Israeli
control. The Palestinians say Israel rarely grants construction
permits to Palestinians, forcing expanding families to build
without permission.
	   The home of Mustafa Daoud, under construction in the village of
Yatta, near Hebron, was demolished Tuesday because it was being
built without a permit. The Bedouin were told their shacks were
torn down because they were too close to an Israeli army training
base.
	   ``They want us to leave our land, but we will remain,'' said
Nasser Kaabneh, whose home was one of those destroyed.
	   The Palestinians charge that the demolitions are part of a
deliberate campaign by Israel to restrict Palestinian expansion in
the West Bank in advance of a final settlement on borders. The
United States has urged Israel to refrain from demolitions as a
confidence-building measure to help restart the stalled peace
talks.
	   On Monday, Israeli bulldozers razed the home of 37-year-old
Mustafa Dadean on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, leaving
eight people homeless.
	   ``I will start to rebuild the house again because this is the
way we have of confronting the Israeli authorities,'' Dadean said.
	   Palestinian legislator Salah Taamari said the PLO has asked the
U.N. Security Council to discuss the house demolitions as part of a
debate on Israel's plan to expand Jerusalem. Under that plan,
Israel would extend Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
	   ``Netanyahu is pushing the area towards an explosion. We have
done everything possible to stop these house demolitions. We have
objected both in the international community and in the streets,''
Taamari said.
	   ``All we can do is to protest once more to the international
community.''

Garzelli stays ahead, Switzerland's Aebersold scores solo win 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HUTTWIL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss rider Niki Aebersold won the
eighth stage of the Tour de Suisse Tuesday after launching his
second successful attack of the day.
	   Stefano Garzelli finished 44th, in a group 16 seconds behind
Aebersold. He retained his overall lead of 1 minute 23 seconds over
fellow Italian Leonardo Piepoli.
	   Aebersold broke away 23 kilometers (14.3 miles) into the
182.1-kilometer (113.2-mile) stage from Brunnen to Huttwil.
	   He left the rest of the field behind with another attack on a
climb 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the end, finishing in a time
of 4 hours 1 minute 40 seconds.
	   Australian rider Robbie McEwen won a mass sprint to take second
place, 16 seconds behind Aebersold. German sprint specialist Erik
Zabel was third.
	   Some 90 winners finished in the group led by McEwen, leaving the
overall standings virtually unchanged.
	   The race moves to Ittigen Wednesday for a time trial over 29.4
kilometers (18.27 miles) and finishes in the capital, Bern, on
Thursday.
	   France's Laurent Jalabert, now 25th overall, won the first time
trial last week.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the
Clinton administration to step up pressure on Israel and go public
with its plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the
chief Palestinian negotiator said Tuesday.
	   The appeal was contained in a letter by Arafat to U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, said Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat.
	   Arafat reminded Albright that in a phone call last month, she
assured him that her negotiations with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on a withdrawal would be completed within two weeks,
Erekat said.
	   ``He (Arafat) said that he went all the way with her ideas in
meetings here and there, and now it is time for the American
administration to introduce its ideas and proposals publicly and
officially, and it is time to tell Netanyahu that enough is
enough,'' Erekat said.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is just wasting time, just stalling,'' the
negotiator said.
	   Albright has urged Netanyahu to make a decision quickly on a
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback that was first introduced
in January. However, Netanyahu has ignored informal U.S. deadlines
and the United States has taken no action.
	   Arafat's appeal came at a time when Netanyahu was considering
holding a non-binding referendum, or nationwide public opinion
poll, on the U.S. proposal. Such a referendum would delay a
withdrawal for at least two months because parliament would have to
pass special legislation first.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the prime
minister has not yet made up his mind on a referendum, but that a
decision was expected soon.
	   The idea was dismissed as a waste of time by Netanyahu's
opponents, as well as some of his allies, including Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a moderate in the government who has
urged the prime minister to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu defended the referendum idea Tuesday and hinted he
might go ahead with the plan.''I think the issue of reaching a
broad public consensus is not a joke,'' Netanyahu said. ``It is a
very important and essential matter. I always said I wanted the
broadest possible consensus on the agreements that I deliver, as
opposed to what the previous government did.''

Legislators to grant Arafat more time on Cabinet reshuffle 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian lawmakers will extend
their original mid-week deadline and give Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat another two weeks to reshuffle his Cabinet, a legislator
said Tuesday.
	   The Palestinian legislature had initially set Thursday as a
deadline for Arafat to name a new Cabinet or face a first-ever vote
of no confidence over allegations of government corruption.
	   Ziad Abu Amr, a lawmaker from Gaza, said council members
expected to receive a formal request from Arafat on Thursday for a
two-week extension of the deadline.
	   Abu Amr said he and his colleagues would grant the request
because they felt the Palestinian leader was making a serious
effort to come up with a new Cabinet.
	   Arafat has been consulting with opposition factions in hopes of
bringing them into the government. Arafat adviser Nabil Amr, who is
also a lawmaker, said Arafat needed more time so various opposition
groups could respond to his request in writing.
	   The groups, lead by Arafat's biggest political rival, the
Islamic militant group Hamas, have already told the Palestinian
leader they would not join the Cabinet.
	   On Tuesday evening, Arafat met with legislators of his Fatah
movement who in the past blocked no-confidence votes in parliament.
	   Fatah lawmakers told Arafat they expected more than a cosmetic
change in the makeup of the Cabinet. ``We told him Fatah will be
able to defeat the motion only if there is real change. If not, we
will exercise our parliamentary right on the no-confidence,'' Amr
said.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled in any event.
Two ministers died this year, four resigned, and the appointment of
one minister was never approved by the legislature.
	   Last year, all but two ministers submitted their resignations to
Arafat after an audit reported revealed widespread corruption.
Arafat did not accepted the resignations.

Parliament condemns Israeli plan to extend Jerusalem authority With Israel-Palestinians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's Parliament Tuesday warned that
efforts to achieve Middle East peace will be torpedoed if Israel
extends the Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish
settlement on the West Bank.
	   In a harshly-worded statement, the 80-member Chamber of Deputies
said it ``categorically rejects and strongly condemns all Israeli
efforts which target the Arab identity of Jerusalem.''
	   It said the Israeli plan marks an ``aggression'' on Arabs and
Muslims and offer a ``clear proof of Israeli intentions to rout all
efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive regional
settlement.''
	   The Israeli Cabinet decision announced earlier this week is
aimed at strengthening ties between Jewish settlements and
Jerusalem.
	   But it has infuriated Palestinians who want to set up the
capital of their would-be state in east Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
	   Tuesday's statement underlines the frustration of Jordan's
pro-government legislators who dominate the Parliament and are
proponents of the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace treaty.

Pakistani soldier killed, another wounded on disputed Kashmir border With India-Pakistan-Summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani soldier was killed and
another was seriously injured in a fierce artillery duel Tuesday
along the disputed Kashmir border, defense officials and
eyewitnesses said.
	   Nadeem Akhtar was hit by shrapnel from a shell that slammed into
a yard near his bunker, officials said. He died immediately. A
second soldier was seriously wounded in the shelling by Indian
soldiers, they said.
	   The two armies routinely fire at each other's positions along
the disputed border -- the flash point of two previous wars between
the uneasy neighbors, who last month tested nuclear devices and
declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   Two Pakistani civilians were killed on Monday by Indian shells
in the same area, they said.
	   In the past month six people, including two soldiers, have been
killed on Pakistan territory in the relentless cross-border firing,
officials here said.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Indian government.

World Cup: Matthaeus to start against Iran 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Lothar Matthaeus, the veteran who holds the
record of most World Cup appearances, will start Germany's key
match against Iran, coach Berti Vogts said Tuesday.
	   Vogts, in an ugly mood after his team poor performance in a 2-2
draw with Yugoslavia on Sunday, hinted at a major shakeup in his
lineup by announcing early that Matthaeus will start Germany's
final group game.
	   ``Lothar will play in Montpellier from the beginning,'' said
Vogts, who almost never gives lineup news until shortly before the
match.
	   The coach declined to reveal in which position Matthaeus would
play. But conventional wisdom would have him play as libero, with
Olaf Thon moving into the midfield.
	   Iran has three points in group F after beating the United States
2-1 and losing 1-0 to Yugoslavia and could cause a stunning upset
if by eliminating Germany, a three-time World Cup winner and
European champion.
	   Germany, a 2-0 winner over the United States, has four points
after drawing Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia also has four points and plays
the United States Thursday in Nantes. The Americans have been
eliminated.
	   Matthaeus, 37, came into Sunday's match in Lens in the second
half to become only the second player to have played in five World
Cups. By contesting 22 World Cup matches, he now holds the record.
He also leads Germany with 126 internationals.
	   Vogts credits Matthaeus with a role in Germany's comeback in the
last 16 minutes against Yugoslavia, when it scored two quick goals
to clinch a draw many felt was undeserved.
	   Matthaeus captained Germany to the title in 1990, when he was
also voted Player of the Year.
	   But he was dropped from the national team 3 1/2 years ago, after
disputes with Vogts and Juergen Klinsmann, his successor as
national team captain.
	   But the injuries that ruled out Matthias Sammer and delayed Thon
made Vogts swallow his pride and recall Matthaeus.
	   He got his chance against Yugoslavia and used it. German
tabloids have been clamoring for Vogts to build a new starting
lineup built around Matthaeus.
	   ``I don't want to be a leader,'' Matthaeus said. ``I want to be
an important part of the team. It doesn't depend on one single
player.''
	   But it is clear that Vogts will be looking to Matthaeus to
provide leadership on the field, something his team has been
lacking so far.
	   Vogts also looks likely to drop wing back Christian Ziege and
defensive midfielder Dietmar Hamann, with more changes not
excluded.
	   Thomas Helmer, a 33-year-old midfield veteran, is likely to be
in the starting lineup after recovering from a muscle strain.
	   ``Iran has a compact team that plays very defensively but has
very fast players for counterattacks,'' Helmer said. ``It's a very
dangerous team and we have to be very cautious.''

Up to 30 million English watch Romania game on television 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS water, electricity surges in 2nd graf and at bottom.
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More people watched England's 2-1 World Cup loss
to Romania than any other soccer match telecast on a single channel
in the last two decades.
	   The result of almost 30 million people concentrating on one
event flowed on to water and power providers as well.
	   Water firms recorded a huge increases in the amount of water
used as viewers filled kettles and flushed lavatories in the
breaks.
	   And the National Grid said it had not recorded such large swings
in the demand for electricity since the funeral of Diana, Princess
of Wales.
	   The Broadcast Audience Research Board said Tuesday that as many
as 30 million people had watched ITV's telecast of the game,
including 21.6 million people who tuned-in at home.
	   Monday's match in Toulouse attracted 71 percent of all home
viewers who were tuning in at that time.
	   England's 1990 World Cup semi-final against Germany was seen by
25.2 million viewers on two channels.
	   The 1996 European Championship semi-final between the same two
sides gained a combined audience of 23.8 million.
	   Initial research puts the average home audience at 19.5 million
for the match - but that figure was two million higher in the final
quarter of an hour when Romania kicked the winning goal.
	   The viewing audience figure was increased by estimates of the
number of people watching in pubs and clubs.
	   The game proved more popular than Britain's top soaps, which
pull in anywhere between 12 and 18 million viewers.
	   There were huge surges in demand for power and water at
half-time and full-time during England's World Cup defeat at the
hands of Romania, it emerged today.
	   Water UK chief executive Pamela Taylor said English water
compaies had to cope with a ``demand roller-coaster''.
	   ``There were huge increases just before the game as people
settled down to watch, at half-time and at full-time. During the
match itself demand dropped below normal,'' she said.
	   Water demand rose between and 20 and 30 percent at half-time,
and surged by 50 percent at the end of the match.
	   The National Grid said demand for electricity dropped 1,000
megawatts once the match started, but rose 1,400 megawatts at
half-time and 1,500 megawatts at full-time.
	   Each of those surges is the equivalent of enough electricity to
power Manchester, or make two million cups of tea.
	   ``The last time we saw something like that was during Princess
Diana's funeral,'' a national grid spokesman said.
	   Monday's power surge was 50 percent higher than it was the
Tunisia game the previous week but the National Grid is predicting
greater demand during England's must-win match against Columbia on
Friday.

Canadian official tours refugee camps, says peace is solution 
</HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Canadian official toured Palestinian
refugee camps in northern Lebanon Tuesday and stressed that a
solution for the problem of refugees lies in a permanent
Arab-Israeli peace.
	   But Andrew Robinson, special coordinator for the Middle East
peace process at Canada's Foreign Affairs Department, said efforts
should continue to focus on improving living conditions for the
refugees.
	   Canada chairs the Refugee Working Group for the multilateral
talks, an outgrowth of the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace
process. Lebanon has boycotted these talks because of the lack of
progress on its negotiating track with Israel.
	   Canada last year launched an international mission to help the
350,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon that raised dlrs 15
million.
	   ``Canada will pursue its efforts with the international
community to mobilize more humanitarian efforts in favor of
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,'' he told a news conference in
Beirut.
	   ``Knowing that the refugees problem cannot be solved except
through an overall peace ... we will keep trying to help the
refugees and alleviate hardships and sufferings in the camps,'' he
said.
	   Robinson said the dlrs 15 million were donated by the European
Commission, Sweden, the United States, Norway, Japan, the
Netherlands, Canada, Belgium, Italy, Australia and Spain.
	   Of the sum, dlrs 7 million will be allotted to health care and
dlr 6 million will go to building new schools and fund education
and scholarships, he said. The rest is pledged to upgrade
vocational training and improving living and shelter conditions,
and other projects in various areas.
	   The Canadian official said his trip to Lebanon was to
``highlight the tangible results'' of the campaign and to
``encourage more countries to join in the effort.''
	   Earlier in the day, Robinson traveled to northern Lebanon, where
50,000 refugees live in the camps of Beddawi and Nahr el-Bared on
the outskirts of the port city of Tripoli, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
north of Beirut.
	   He inspected a Canadian-funded housing project to build 73
apartments. He also heard complaints from refugees about poor
services in the camp and their treatment in this country.
	   Lebanon has rejected any settlement of Palestinians in the
country, fearing the mostly Muslim refugees would upset the
delicate Christian-Muslim sectarian makeup.
	   The Lebanese also refuse to grant Palestinians work permits and
other civil rights.
	   On Wednesday, Robinson visits refugee camps in southern Lebanon.

Condition of policeman unimproved; second suspect identified 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with stabbed English fan in hospital.
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The prospects of a French policeman whose
head was bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with
doctors calling his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   A second suspect, meanwhile, was identified in the attack
Sunday. French radio reports said the man was among the 15 Germans
already detained for suspected involvement in the melee.
	   The first suspect, a 27-year-old from Hanover, was to face a
judge later Tuesday, as were about 12 other Germans.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old policeman and father of two, was in
a deep coma in a Lille hospital after suffering ``repeated violent
blows from a massive object'' _ actually an iron bar _ following
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said.
	   They said Tuesday morning that it was impossible, for the time
being, to make an accurate forecast regarding his health.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan was
also in a hospital, badly hurt after being stabbed in scuffles
following Monday night's England-Romania game.
	   Police identified the fan as Stephen Clark. Hospital officials
would not give information on his condition, but his life was not
believed in danger.
	   Also in Toulouse, another English fan was sentenced to four
months in prison for soccer violence in Marseille during the
England-Tunisia game a week ago. Maurice Woodward, 26, was also
banned from returning to France for two years after his jail term.

Guerrilla group refuses to deliver scalp of dead Israeli soldier 
</HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Lebanese group threatened Tuesday to
thwart an expected swap of prisoners and body parts with Israel by
reiterating it would not release an Israeli soldier's scalp.
	   A spokesman for the Shiite Muslim party, Amal, whose guerrillas
retrieved the scalp after an Israeli raid last year, said his group
would not participate in the exchange, slated for later this week.
	   ``The movement considers itself uninvolved in the exchange that
will take place unless its demands are addressed,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The pro-Syrian group is insisting on freedom for 27 prisoners
held by Israel, which has been fighting a running war with
guerrillas in and around a strip of land it occupies in southern
Lebanon.
	   Ilya was killed during a botched Israeli commando raid in
southern Lebanon on Sept. 5. While the retreating Israelis managed
to take 11 of their dead comrades with them, they did not retrieve
Ilya's body, which had been blown to pieces in an explosion.
	   Most of his remains are in the hands of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, the main guerrilla group fighting Israeli troops in
southern Lebanon and Amal's arch rival.
	   In recent days press reports in Lebanon and Israel have said
Israel would release up to 60 Lebanese prisoners and hand over the
bodies of up to 60 guerrillas killed in the fighting. In return,
Lebanon was to hand over Ilya's body parts.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday that some
details remained to be worked out before the swap took place.
	   Amal's spokesman said another swap between Amal and Israel could
take place at a later date.
	   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli army declined to
respond to Amal's position on Ilya, but it was thought highly
unlikely that the government would accept anything less than the
entire remains of the commando.
	   Danny Grisarou, a spokesman for the families of Israeli
Missing-In-Action troops, told The Associated Press his group would
not accept a swap that returned only part of Ilya.
	   Israel has maintained the zone in southern Lebanon since 1985 in
a bid to protect its northern territory from guerrilla attack.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The prospects of a French policeman whose
head was bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with
doctors calling his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   A second suspect, meanwhile, was identified in the attack
Sunday. French radio reports said the man was among the 15 Germans
already detained for suspected involvement in the melee.
	   The first suspect, a 27-year-old from Hanover, was to face a
judge later Tuesday, as were about 12 other Germans.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old policeman and father of two, was in
a deep coma in a Lille hospital after suffering ``repeated violent
blows from a massive object'' _ actually an iron bar _ following
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said.
	   They said Tuesday morning that it was impossible, for the time
being, to make an accurate forecast regarding his health.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan was
also in a hospital, badly hurt after being stabbed in scuffles
following Monday night's England-Romania game.
	   Police identified the fan as Stephen Clark. Hospital officials
would not give information on his condition, but his life was not
believed in danger.
	   Also in Toulouse, another English fan was sentenced to four
months in prison for soccer violence in Marseille during the
England-Tunisia game a week ago. Maurice Woodward, 26, was also
banned from returning to France for two years after his jail term.

Legislators to grant Arafat more time on Cabinet reshuffle 
</HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian lawmakers will extend
their original mid-week deadline and give Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat another two weeks to reshuffle his Cabinet, a legislator
said Tuesday.
	   The Palestinian legislature had initially set Thursday as a
deadline for Arafat to name a new Cabinet or face a first-ever vote
of no confidence over allegations of government corruption.
	   Ziad Abu Amr, a lawmaker from Gaza, said council members
expected to receive a formal request from Arafat on Thursday for a
two-week extension of the deadline.
	   Abu Amr said he and his colleagues would grant the request
because they felt the Palestinian leader was making a serious
effort to come up with a new Cabinet.
	   Arafat has been consulting with opposition factions in hopes of
bringing them into the government. Arafat adviser Nabil Amr, who is
also a lawmaker, said Arafat needed more time so various opposition
groups could respond to his request in writing.
	   The groups, lead by Arafat's biggest political rival, the
Islamic militant group Hamas, have already told the Palestinian
leader they would not join the Cabinet.
	   On Tuesday evening, Arafat met with legislators of his Fatah
movement who in the past blocked no-confidence votes in parliament.
	   Fatah lawmakers told Arafat they expected more than a cosmetic
change in the makeup of the Cabinet. ``We told him Fatah will be
able to defeat the motion only if there is real change. If not, we
will exercise our parliamentary right on the no-confidence,'' Amr
said.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled in any event.
Two ministers died this year, four resigned, and the appointment of
one minister was never approved by the legislature.
	   Last year, all but two ministers submitted their resignations to
Arafat after an audit reported revealed widespread corruption.
Arafat did not accepted the resignations.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Heavy rain in Colombo forced the
umpires to call off play in the 3-nation triagular series match
between India and New Zealand on Tuesday.
	   Needing 220 for victory, India was 131 for 2 in 24.2 overs when
rain inundated the ground.
	   According to tournament rules, a minimum of 25 overs must be
bowled for a result.
	   The two teams share the two match points.
	   Sachin Tendulkar earlier gave India a rousing start with 53 in
36 balls, which had three fours and an equal number of sixes.
	   New Zealand at one stage appeared to look set for a big total,
but a remarkable second spell of bowling from 20-year-old paceman
Ajit Agarkar put the lid on the tourists, who were restricted to
219 for 8 in the allotted 50 overs.
	   Agarkar trapped Adam Parore leg-before for one and in his
following over sent back Chris Cairns for 20 and Chris Harris for
3.
	   Cairns was caught behind by Nayan Mongia and Harris fell to a
return catch as New Zeland slumped from 204 for 5.
	   Agarkar finished with 3 for 52 after his first five-over spell
gave away 33 runs without a wicket.
	   The New Zealanders got off to a sound start, picking up 65 runs
in the first 15 overs, but with the introduction of the spinners,
the side lost wickets at regular intervals until middle order
batsman Mathew Horne teamed up with Nathan Astle.
	   The pair shared in a 63-run stand for the fourth wicket and
parted company when paceman Venkatesh Prasad struck in his second
spell to trap Horne leg-before for 44.
	   Astle was later picked up at long-on by Hrishikesh Kanitkar off
spinner Harbhajan Singh for 81 made with the help of six fours and
one six.

Turkish president presses for a major constitutional reform 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel is pressing for
major constitutional reforms to lead Turkey toward a more stable
presidential system, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Speaking before the Young Businessmen's Association of Ankara
Monday, Demirel said Turkey needed to move from its current
parliamentary system to a presidential system.
	   ``The people must elect a president for five years in a two-
turn election,'' Demirel was quoted as saying by daily Yeni Yuzyil.
	   No single party has gathered enough votes to hold a majority in
parliament since 1991, and three coalition governments have
collapsed since 1995.
	   Demirel proposed to increase the powers of the president,
currently a figurehead role, to include powe to dissolve parliament
and call for referendums.
	   Supporters of the parliamentary system accuse Demirel of backing
the presidential system to extend his 35-year-old political career.
The 74-year-old president, who is due for retirement in 2000, says
he is promoting the idea for the sake of democracy.
	   Demirel also stressed that Turkey needed greater freedom of
expression, the English-language Turkish Daily News reported.
	   ``Having an opinion does not mean that it will violate the
public order and peace in a country,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   There are 29 journalists in prison in Turkey, according to the
New York based Committee to Protect Journalists, and Turkey is
often criticized for its tough laws curbing freedom of expression.

Captured North Korean submarine sinks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with details, new quotes

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ Navy salvage teams worked through
the night Tuesday in an attempt to raise a captured North Korean
submarine that sank while being towed into this South Korean naval
base.
	   With the sub's crew given up for dead _ or possibly back home in
the North _ the South's government appeared ready to write off its
incursion and get on with the business of seeking peace with its
northern rival.
	   In sharp contrast to similar events in the past, there were no
calls from Seoul for apologies from the North or threats of
retribution. Instead, President Kim Dae-jung urged a calm
assessment of the incident.
	   The Defense Ministry called the sub's incursion ``a clear armed
provocation,'' but there was no echo from the newly installed
civilian government.
	   ``The submarine incident will not shake our sunshine policy,'' a
presidential aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
government will try even harder to embrace the North to prevent the
repetition of similar incidents. ... We will deal with the North
with patience.''
	   ``Today, we realized again how difficult it is to deal with
North Korean threats and seek economic cooperation at the same
time,'' said the mass-circulation Joong Ang daily. ``How Kim
handles the case will be a litmus test of his North Korea policy.''
	   Highlighting the government's dilemma was the return from North
Korea on Tuesday of Chung Ju-yung, chairman of South Korea's giant
Hyundai Group, with word that the North had agreed to lift a
decades-old ban on South Korean visits.
	   Chung, the South's richest man, said North Korea had agreed to
allow Hyundai to run tourist excursions to a scenic mountain region
on its east coast, not far from where the doomed submarine
departed.
	   North Korea's official news agency broke a daylong silence
Tuesday and reported that one of the country's submarines was
missing on a training mission after experiencing mechanical
problems.
	   It apparently was referring to the small submarine that South
Korean navy Capt. Bang Kuk-joon said sank in 33 meters (yards) of
water a mile (1.6 kilometers) off Donghae when it broke loose from
a warship's tow line.
	   Defense Ministry officials speculated that the crew either died
in the sub before or after it sank, or managed to escape before
their vessel was seized Monday after becoming entangled in a
fishing net.
	   ``It will take quite a while to bring it back to the surface.
... Then things will become clearer,'' Bang said.
	   As night fell, the waters off this naval port, 180 kilometers
(112 miles) east of Seoul, were illuminated with searchlights from
helicopters and warships.
	   The submarine, already mostly submerged and listing badly, was
being towed to the harbor Tuesday by a South Korean warship when it
broke away from one of the two tow ropes and went nose down to the
bottom.
	   South Korean officials said the submarine got caught in a
mackerel fishing net about 18 kilometers (10 miles) east of the
town of Sokcho, just south of the North Korean border.
	   They described the craft as a ``midget submersible'' used
primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct coastal surveillance,
carrying up to six crewmen.
	   South Korean fishermen who first spotted the craft reported
seeing three crewmen struggling to set their craft free. But navy
frogmen pounded on the sub's hull with a hammer and used sonar
scans without detecting any signs of life.
	   ``I believe the North Koreans have already killed themselves,''
said Li Gwang Su, 32, the only sailor captured alive from another,
larger North Korean sub that ran aground off the east coast in
1996.
	   North Korean agents are reportedly instructed to commit suicide
to avoid capture. In the 1996 incursion, 11 of the 26 North Koreans
were said to have been shot to death by one of their commanders,
who then killed himself.
	   That incursion triggered a 53-day manhunt that left 24 North
Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead and relations between
the two Koreas at their worst in years. One North Korean was
believed to have escaped.
	   North Korea was quest dialogue to build confidence, prevent
misunderstanding and reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula.''
	   The command said the meeting was a ``good first step in
establishing a crisis management mechanism to help prevent or deal
with any military incidents'' _ a need it said was underscored by
the seizure of the North Korean sub.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Russia announces `anti-crisis' economic program background, reaction. 
</HEADLINE>

By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government announced its plan Tuesday
to take the bitter medicine prescribed by the International
Monetary Fund: sharp budget cuts combined with improved tax
collection.
	   ``Carrying out this program will be difficult, but we have no
other way,'' President Boris Yeltsin told his Cabinet at a special
session prompted by the country's economic crisis and urgent
negotiations with the IMF.
	   The plan was announced by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who
called for 42 billion rubles (dlrs 6.8 billion) in spending cuts
and 20 billion rubles (dlrs 3.2 billion) in increased tax
collection this year.
	   Kiriyenko said the plan would be sent to parliament for its
approval Wednesday. Parts of the program _ big cuts in the
government workforce, a revamped tax code _ are certain to run into
strong resistance in the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house
of parliament.
	   ``Our view of this course is expressed in the proposal by 220
parliamentary deputies to impeach the president and send him into
retirement,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told reporters
after the Cabinet meeting.
	   Yeltsin nevertheless urged parliament to act quickly, and said
if it failed to act, he would push through the reforms by decree.
	   ``I don't believe in dramatizing the situation, but the extreme
tension in Russian society is obvious,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Russia's economy, which had seemed on the road to recovery at
the end of last year, has sharply declined through the first half
of this year. Economists blame a variety of factors, including the
Asian financial crisis and a slump in world oil prices.
	   But Yeltsin acknowledged that ``a significant share of the blame
lies with ourselves.'' He said Russia's financial situation
``remains alarming'' and ``radical measures'' are needed to restore
order.
	   ``The price of foot-dragging and delays, squabbling and discord,
is too high,'' Yeltsin said in a firm and steady voice as he opened
the special session.
	   The meeting came three months to the day since Yeltsin
jettisoned the government of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for
failing to improve Russia's economy and living conditions.
	   Kiriyenko, a young banker who seemingly came out of nowhere to
become prime minister after Chernomyrdin was sacked, was hard on
the former government.
	   He said the root of the current crisis could be traced to 1995,
when ``we didn't risk taking radical measures to create a healthy
budget. Instead of collecting taxes and cutting expenses, we
allowed a significant growth of the state debt.''
	   He noted that 34 percent of the nation's budget has gone to pay
debt interest so far this year.
	   Besides the spending cuts and tax collection improvements,
Kiriyenko's plan envisions tighter customs controls, government
support for exports and creating a state company to oversee
production and tax collection from the liquor industry _ which
traditionally provides a significant portion of government
revenues.
	   ``It's very realistic,'' observed Peter Boone, joint head of
research for Brunswick Warburg, a Moscow brokerage. ``I think
generally the package of measures are things we've seen before, but
what was important was that Yeltsin showed himself to be behind it
... and Kiriyenko showed himself to be in charge.''
	   The measures are largely what the IMF is believed to be seeking.
An IMF team arrived in Moscow on Monday to negotiate terms for the
release of the long-delayed, dlrs 670 million installment of an
existing loan to Russia, and conditions for a dlrs 10 billion to
dlrs 15 billion bailout Russia is seeking.

Encouraged by refugee plan, Kinkel offers Croatia aid support 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Tuesday
praised Croatia for encouraging Serb refugees to return home,
saying he would now support a conference on war reconstruction for
the country.
	   Kinkel, after meeting with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate
Granic, also said he would recommend that Croatia be eligible for
EU funds earmarked for former communist countries trying to prepare
for European Union membership.
	   Granic's plan, outlined Tuesday during his Bonn visit, will
offer incentives for Serb refugees living in the Serb-controlled
sector of Bosnia to return home to Croatia's Krajina region.
	   That would make room in Bosnia's Serb sector for the return of
war refugees in Germany.
	   Dietmar Schlee, Germany's high official overseeing Bosnian
refugees here, cautioned Kinkel not to take any decisive action
until he sees some concrete results.
	   ``The Germany government should only discuss aid for Croatia if
today's promises are followed up with actions,'' Schlee said. He
specified that that would mean a significant number of refugees
returning from Serb-controlled Bosnia in the coming days.

World Cup: Dutch midfielder enjoying striker's role 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA TURBIE, Monaco (AP) _ He might not have expected it, but now
that Phillip Cocu has been pushed forward to partner Dennis
Bergkamp in the Dutch strike force he's making the most of it.
	   ``I was certainly a bit surprised to be playing there,'' Cocu
said of his forward role against South Korea last Saturday which he
is expected to repeat Thursday against Mexico.
	   ``It is nice playing there. You can take risks that are not
acceptable if you are at the back,'' the 27-year-old added.
	   Cocu, normally a defensive left-sided midfielder, was shunted
forward by Dutch coach Guus Hiddink after Bergkamp's usual striking
partner, Patrick Kluivert, was suspended for two games for throwing
an elbow at Belgium's Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' opening
match.
	   The ex-PSV Eindhoven player, who will play for Louis van Gaal's
Barcelona next season, said Tuesday he took a little time to adjust
to his new role against Korea, but not too long.
	   He latched on to a through ball in the 38th minute and fired a
low, hard shot into the bottom right corner of Kim Byung-ji's net
to give the Netherlands a 1-0 lead. The goal liberated the Dutch
and they went on to thrash Korea 5-0.
	   It was Cocu's third goal in his 22 appearance for the
Netherlands.
	   Hiddink had no doubts Cocu would perform well in his new role.
	   ``He can play in several positions,'' Hiddink said. ``The
position he played, he played well. He is very intelligent in
searching for the space behind the midfield and defense.''
	   Cocu conceded Tuesday that his promotion could, paradoxically,
cost him a place in the Dutch starting lineup if the Netherlands
beats or draws with Mexico to progress from Group E to the round of
16.
	   If so, Kluivert will almost certainly return to take the second
striker's place and Cocu's replacement, Edgar Davids of Juventus,
also is playing well and could hold down the midfield spot
previously filled by Cocu.
	   A former star of Dutch league teams Vitesse Arnhem and AZ
Alkmaar, Cocu says the experience of fighting hard for a starting
spot will come in handy for his move to the star-studded Barcelona
team.
	   ``You have to play so well that the trainer cannot leave you
out. I'm trying to do that,'' he said.
	   ``Van Gaal already knows that I can play in more than one
position. I do not yet know where I will play there, it depends on
the squad.''
	   Dutch World Cup squad members Michael Reiziger, Ruud Hesp and
Winston Bogarde all play for the Catalan powerhouse and left winger
Boudewijn Zenden is also making the move from PSV to Barcelona _ as
is assistant Dutch trainer Ronald Koeman.
	   And then there's the charismatic trainer Van Gaal, who tried
unsuccessfully to sign Cocu for Ajax Amsterdam five years ago.
	   ``Barcelona is a fantastic club ... and having Van Gaal there is
an extra plus point,'' Cocu said.

Prince's estate posts health increase in profit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles benefited from a handsome increase
in profits last year from the Duchy of Cornwall, the historic
estates which support the heir to the throne.
	   The Duchy reported Tuesday that it turned a profit of 5.955
million pounds (about dlrs 9.9 million) in the year ending March
31, up 9 percent from the previous year.
	   That wasn't quite as good as the 9.8 percent increase in the
previous year.
	   The Duchy of Cornwall, created in 1337, supports Charles and his
two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.
	   The financial report, placed in the libraries of the House of
Commons and the House of Lords, dealt only with Duchy of Cornwall
business _ the estate owns 128,000 acres (51,270 hectares) of land
and property in 22 counties _ and says nothing about how the prince
uses the income.
	   Previous estimates have suggested that his annual income from
the Duchy after tax is likely to be more than 4 million pounds
(dlrs 6.7 million) of which around 2.5 million pounds (dlrs 4.2
million) is thought to go on official expenses.
	   The Duchy of Cornwall is tax-exempt, but Charles voluntarily
pays income tax _ currently at 40 percent _ on his income.
	   Tax is calculated after deducting official expenditure, the
biggest element of which is his staff of around 70, from private
secretaries to valets, working in his office at St. James's Palace
and at Highgrove, his home in Gloucestershire.

Richardson says VX traces may set back Iraq's efforts to lift sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A report that traces of the deadly nerve
gas agent VX were found on Iraqi warheads would _ if true _ deal a
severe setback to Iraq's efforts to lift crippling economic
sanctions, U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Tuesday.
	   U.S. and diplomatic sources confirmed Tuesday that chemical
analysis of Iraqi warheads handed over to the U.N. Special
Commission revealed traces of VX despite Baghdad's claims that it
never successfully manufactured weapons from the nerve gas agent.
	   The head of the commission, Richard Butler, is expected to
discuss the finding when he briefs the Security Council on
Wednesday.
	   ``If this allegation is correct ... that will set back Iraq's
efforts to try to lift sanctions,'' Richardson told reporters
Tuesday. ``It shows that they've been concealing, they've been
lying, and it calls into question their commitment to
disarmament.''
	   The Security Council has said it will not lift sanctions on Iraq
until Baghdad satisfies Butler's team that it has destroyed all
weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions were imposed on Iraq in
1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the
1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that the information on
VX is included in a confidential U.S. Army laboratory analysis of
warhead fragments taken from a pit at Taji, Iraq, in March.
	   Analyzed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, the samples
from the warhead fragments revealed ``significant amounts'' of VX
disulfide and stabilizer, the Post reported. VX is a colorless,
odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it comes into contact
with oxygen. A few drops of the nerve gas can kill in minutes.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the Post report. They said Butler presented the Iraqis
with the findings during a meeting in Baghdad this month but that
the Iraqis rejected them.
	   In a report to the council June 16, Butler said he presented
Iraq with ``preliminary analysis of certain excavated remnants of
special missiles warheads'' but Iraq ``rejected the findings.''
	   The report did not specify VX, but diplomatic sources said that
was what Butler was referring to.
	   Both sides agreed to further technical meetings in Baghdad to
review the findings after the United Nations agreed to Iraq's
demands that the session include scientists from France, Russia and
China.
	   Those countries are the members of the Security Council most
sympathetic to Baghdad's position.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who has been spearheading a
campaign to ease U.N. pressure on Iraq, declined to comment in
detail on the allegation pending Butler's briefing.
	   ``I cannot speak for UNSCOM and those who undertake to speak on
behalf of UNSCOM,'' he said, referring to the inspection team by
its acroynm.
	   British Ambassador John Weston said that if the report is
correct, ``that demonstrates precisely how far we have to go before
getting to the bottom of some of these problems'' with Iraqi
weapons.
	   ``It is therefore not a surprise to me that detailed
investigations should have thrown up a finding of this kind,''
Weston said. ``I think we are reminded by this kind of thing that
there can be no quarter given on this subject.''

Six killed in Yemen unrest over fuel price hike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Six people were killed when police exchanged
gunfire with tribesmen blocking gas trucks in central Yemen Tuesday
in the fifth straight day of violence over a 40 percent hike in
fuel prices.
	   Tribesmen also blew up part of a gas pipeline, news reports
said.
	   The latest deaths raised to 12 the number of people killed in
rioting since Friday when the government announced it had raised
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas to meet the
International Monetary Fund's demands.
	   Tuesday's violence occurred in the city of Marib where members
of the al-Jidaan tribe, armed with guns, stopped trucks coming in
to load up on gas.
	   Four tribesmen were killed when police fired live ammunition at
the protesters, who returned fire, a source in the al-Jidaan tribe
said. Two truck drivers were killed in the cross-fire, he said,
adding that four policemen were injured.
	   The demonstrators also set alight three police jeeps, said the
tribesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The protests have continued despite a ban on demonstrations, and
are turning into the worst crisis in years for the government of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
	   ``The people want the government to fight corruption and
nepotism and eliminate all unnecessary government expenditures.
They don't want to feel they are alone in suffering the burden of
the price hikes,'' said Mohammad al-Magalih, a member of a
coalition of opposition parties.
	   Three demonstrators were killed on Monday in similar violence in
Marib, 170 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of the capital, San`a.
One person was killed in the southern city of Taiz on Monday and
two were shot to death in the San`a suburb of Arhab on Sunday.
	   The al-Wahdawi weekly newspaper reported Tuesday that tribesmen
used dynamite Monday to blow up parts of a 360-kilometer (223-mile)
gas pipeline between Marib and the Red Sea port city of Rass Eissa.
	   The weekly did not give details.
	   Officials at U.S. company Hunt Oil, which operates the pipeline,
would not comment.
	   On Tuesday, police in the southern port city of Aden arrested
Abdul-Wahid al-Muradi, a leader of the opposition Socialist Party,
on charges of attempting to organize citywide protests, a party
spokesman said.
	   Riot police in jeeps and on foot have been deployed in the
cities of San`a and Taiz to quell protests by demonstrators calling
for removing the price hikes and the resignation of Prime Minister
Abdul Karim al-Iryani.
	   The hikes were supposed to be implemented in January but were
delayed because of difference of opinion between President Saleh,
the real power in Yemen, and then prime minister, Faraj Bin Ghanem.
	   Bin Ghanem was replaced by al-Iryani, a Saleh loyalist, last
month.
	   Increasing fuel rates are in line with IMF's requirements to
remove subsidies on petroleum products and other commodities by the
end of 1998 in Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.

Membership in former communist party shrinks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism has
shrunk to fewer than 100,000 members nationwide, mostly due to
deaths, according to registration tallies released Tuesday.
	   Still, the successor to the former Socialist Unity Party remains
the strongest party in former East Germany and has more members
than either Free Democrats, the junior party in Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition, or the environmental Greens.
	   After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, East Germans fled the
Socialist Unity Party, which under communism claimed 2 million
members.
	   However, a core group, many of them older, remained loyal to the
ideals and membership in the successor party peaked at 180,000.
Officials said the drop in membership from 105,000 last year was
due mostly to deaths of older members.
	   The party has recently been trying to gain a following among
younger voters and women. Last year, 1,500 new members joined the
party _ the most in any year since the wall came down.

Reports: Ransom paid for Swiss engineer's release 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with employer, lawyer in three final grafs.
<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss engineer held for 7 1/2
months after being kidnapped near Chechnya was released after a
large ransom was paid, reports Tuesday said.
	   Peter Zollinger, 36, arrived in Zurich Sunday. The clan chief of
the kidnappers had Zollinger taken Saturday to the airport of
Nazran in the Ingushetia region that borders Chechnya, said the
family lawyer. There he was handed over to a contact person for the
family.
	   Neither the lawyer nor Swiss officials would comment on how the
release occurred.
	   Zollinger, working for the Seibert-Stinnes AG construction
company, was kidnapped by an armed commando from a building site at
the airport last November.
	   Speaking on Swiss television Monday night, building site manager
Robert Heel claimed that Zollinger's family paid a ransom of
between dlrs 200,000 and 500,000, leading to his quick release.
	   Zollinger declined to confirm the figure. Speaking on the same
program, he said his kidnappers had kept him handcuffed and chained
to a heating pipe.
	   He said he had been fed three times a day, mostly with tea and
bread or potatoes.
	   Citing ``Chechen sources,'' the Moscow daily Izvestiya reported
Tuesday that dlrs 1 million was paid in ransom for Zollinger.
	   Zurich's Tages-Anzeiger daily reported that the kidnappers'
ransom demand had fluctuated between dlrs 300,000 and 700,000.
	   Zollinger's Swiss employer, F. Trachsel AG of Frauenfeld, said
it contributed 100,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 69,000) to the effort to
have him released.
	   Meanwhile, Zollinger's lawyer, Manuel Liatowitsch, said the
engineer is considering suing the firm for damages.
	   Liatowitsch said the company failed to fulfil its obligations to
Zollinger and provided no insurance against kidnapping.

World Cup: Yugoslavia prepares to trounce U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Yugoslavia wants to beat the relegated
United States at the World Cup Thursday, and score enough goals to
edge favored Germany for the first place in their group.
	   ``I think we can score more goals against the United States than
Germany can against Iran,'' Yugoslav midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic
said Tuesday. ``A simple victory may not be enough for the first
place.''
	   Germany and Yugoslavia lead Group F standings with four points
each. Iran has three, and a victory against Germany Thursday still
would allow it to clinch one of the first two places in the group
and continue on into the elimination rounds.
	   Having lost both its matches at the World Cup, 0-2 against
Germany and 1-2 against Iran, the United States already is out of
the competition.
	   Both Germany and Yugoslavia will try to place first in the group
in order to evade the Netherlands in the next round. The mighty
Dutch are the likely winners of the Group E.
	   So far, Germany scored one more goal than Yugoslavia and the
goal difference may decide the group winner.
	   ``We shouldn't downplay the Americans,'' said assistant Yugoslav
coach Vujadin Boskov. ``Their running and high morale even when
they are losing are impressive. But they don't have a team
leader.''
	   ``It won't be easy, but our main aim is to beat them by as many
goals as possible,'' Boskov said.
	   The injuries of several key Yugoslav players have hampered
preparations ahead of the match against the United States. Central
defender Miroslav Djukic, left back Zoran Mirkovic and striker
Darko Kovacevic will not play in Nantes on Thursday.
	   But star midfielder Dejan Savicevic, who missed both opening
Yugoslav matches against Iran (1-0) and Germany (2-2), said Tuesday
he feels much better after a knee ligament injury he suffered while
playing for AC Milan in Italy.
	   ``I don't know if I'll be in the team against the Americans, it
depends on coaches. But certainly I'll be back on the pitch in the
following round,'' Savicevic said.

	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ The German and Dutch railways announced
plans Tuesday to merge their freight subsidiaries.
	   Both boards of directors have signed a document of intent to
merge. The new company will be called Rail Cargo Europe, based in
Mainz.
	   ``As an international freight company, Rail Cargo Europe will be
open to additional partners,'' said Deutsche Bahn director Johannes
Ludewig.
	   Officials said that the new company would seek working
agreements with other rail companies, as well as delivery and
transport firms to meet customers' demands.

World Cup: Chile qualifies for second round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Chile, withstanding a furious second-half
challenge from 10-man Cameroon, qualified for the second round of
the World Cup on Tuesday with a 1-1 draw.
	   The tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria, left
Italy atop Group B and Chile in second place. Chile, which
qualified with three consecutive draws, will face defending
champion Brazil in the second round Saturday in Paris.
	   Before a colorful and overwhelmingly Chilean crowd at the Stade
de la Beaujoire, Jose Sierra's 30-meter curling free kick into the
top right corner of the net gave Chile the lead in the 31st minute
of a first half dominated by the South Americans.
	   And the second half appeared headed the same way when Cameroon's
defender, Rigobert Song, given a red card in the 52nd minute for
elbowing Marcelo Salas. Four years ago, Song became the youngest
player ever ejected from a World Cup game when he was sent off at
the age of 17 years, 358 days against Brazil.
	   But Patrick Mboma out-leaped Pedro Reyes to put home an 8-meter
header in the 56th to tie the game, and Francois Omam Biyick
appeared to give the Indomitable Lions the lead two minutes later
before his goal was disallowed by a apparent pushing foul near the
penalty area.
	   It was the second disallowed goal of the game for Biyick, who
was offsides when he drilled a 20-meter shot home in the 35th
minute.
	   Cameroon, needing to win the game to advance, tried to keep up
the attack but Biyick's drive into the side of the net was closest
thing to a goal in the final 20 minutes.
	   Cameroon was reduced to nine men in the 88th minute when
Lavariano Etame was given a red card, with Salas again the victim
of the foul.
	   In the first half, only the heroics of Cameroon goalkeeper
Jacques Songo'o and Song kept the South Americans from scoring more
than once.
	   In the 12th minute, Songo'o fell back on his heels to stop Pedro
Reyes' close-range header, and Song cleared away Ivan Zamorano's
follow-up shot off the goal line. In the 33rd, Marcelo Salas was
denied when midfielder Joseph Ndo kicked the Chilean striker's shot
off the post.
	   Cameroon came to life late in the half with two scoring chances
from Biyick. After Biyick's disallowed goal, Chilean goalkeeper
Nelson Tapia stopped another Biyick drive with a right-handed punch
save a minute later.
	   Chile still hasn't won a World Cup game in a foreign country.
Its only victories came when it played host to the event and
finished third in 1962.

Watchdog group says human rights deteriorating in Egypt 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The state of human rights in Egypt is
deteriorating, a local watchdog group said Tuesday, citing an
increase in political violence and imprisonment of journalists.
	   ``Human rights conditions will get worse in this country if
(violations) continue in this way,'' Mohamed Moneib Genedy,
secretary-general of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights,
told reporters.
	   Presenting the EOHR's report for 1997, Genedy said 191 people
died in political violence in 1997, up from 174 in 1996. Among
those killed were policemen, Islamic insurgents, Coptic Christians,
bystanders and tourists.
	   The Associated Press counted 184 people killed in political
violence in 1997.
	   The most bloody carnage occurred on November 17 when six Islamic
extremists shot dead 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians at a
Pharaonic temple in the southern city of Luxor.
	   More than 1,200 people have died since the militants began their
insurrection to overthrow the secular government and install
Islamic rule in 1992.
	   Genedy said the EOHR had recorded four deaths caused by torture
in police custody in 1997. The report cited the case of Bekhit
Salem, 38, who was detained in 1993 and charged with attacking a
police station. He was acquitted but repeatedly re-detained until
he died on March 26, 1997.
	   Salem suffered partial paralysis because of his torture and
fainted when an EOHR representative visited him two weeks before
his death, the report said.
	   Genedy said the EOHR could not update its 1996 figure of 17,000
political detainees because the Interior Ministry would not release
the figures. The ministry has accused rights groups of seeking to
harm Egypt's reputation as a democratic country.
	   Turning to 1998, Genedy said he expected an increase in rights
violations and pointed to the following cases as evidence:
	   _ The authorities have continued to reject the formation of any
new political party, claiming that the applicants did not offer
programs different to those of the existing 14 parties.
	   _ Four journalists have been imprisoned this year for libeling
pro-government politicians, including the editor and a reporter of
the biweekly newspaper Al-Shaab, which had accused an interior
minister of corruption.
	   _ A police officer implicated in the beating to death of a
detainee, Waheed el-Sayed Ahmed, has not been prosecuted.
	   El-Sayed's death provoked a riot in his hometown of Belqas in
the Nile Delta on April 9.

Officials from six nations discuss Black Sea security in Ukraine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Delegations from six countries gathered in
Ukraine's capital on Tuesday for the first round of talks to
discuss ways to improve security in the Black Sea region.
	   The meeting in Kiev was attended by naval chiefs and other
officials from Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey and
Ukraine.
	   Ukrainian Foreign Ministry officials noted that naval forces
operating in the Black Sea region so far have not been covered by
existing international treaties, particularly those regarding
conventional weapons.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma sent a message to the forum
saying that regional security and stability were the key to
successful cooperation.
	   Kuchma said he was certain that ``the representatives of the six
Black Sea coast states will do everything possible to create a
reliable barrier against conflicts in the region, to avoid any
reasons for suspicions and mistrust.''
	   In the Black Sea port of Odessa, meanwhile, military officials
from Russia, the United States, Britain, Italy and other nations
met to plan this fall's NATO-related Sea Breeze-98 exercises.
	   The three-day session is devoted to fine-tuning the plan of the
maneuvers. It envisions an international relief and peacekeeping
operation to help a populace hit by an imaginary earthquake.
	   Last summer, Ukraine hosted U.S. and other nations' ships in
Crimea for Sea Breeze-97. That exercise angered Moscow and many
among the Crimean Peninsula's ethnic Russian majority.
	   Russia pulled out of Sea Breeze-97 but accepted Ukraine's
invitation to participate in this year's Sea Breeze. Ukraine plans
to send 16 ships, 12 airplanes, 4 helicopters and 100 marines to
the maneuvers, its Navy officials said.

Doctor says Gucci's ex-wife recovered from surgery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Did surgery to remove a brain tumor the size
of a tennis ball leave fashion heir Maurizio Gucci's ex-wife
incapable of plotting his murder? That's what the defense contends.
	   In a bid to refute that claim, the prosecution put the surgeon
on the stand Tuesday. Dr. Lodovico Infuso testified that Patrizia
Reggiani Martinelli made a full recovery.
	   But then, on cross-examination, Infuso gave her defense team a
surprise boost.
	   He said the surgery could have affected her behavior and
testified that her relatives had told him her personality had
changed.
	   Her lawyers have stopped short of an insanity plea, but say
surgery stripped Reggiani Martinelli of her capacity for rational
judgment and left her unable to conceive and carry out a murder
plot.
	   They don't deny that she made openly hated Gucci, whom she never
forgave for leaving her in 1985, or that she said many times that
only his death would end her suffering.
	   Both sides are expected to introduce psychiatric testimony.
	   Reggiani Martinelli has been on trial since May along with four
other defendants on charges of plotting the 1995 murder in order to
gain control of Gucci's multimillion-dollar estate.
	   Gucci was gunned down on the steps to his Milan office.
	   The defense also claims Reggiani Martinelli was the victim of an
extortion plot by the other defendants, who blackmailed her for
dlrs 350,000.
	   Three of the four have confessed to blackmail but said they
didn't mean to kill Gucci. They claimed Reggiani Martinelli pushed
them into going through with it.
	   Wednesday's hearing should offer up even more intrigue. Psychics
who worked for the warring ex-spouses will testify. One, dubbed the
``black witch,'' is said to have put spells on Gucci, while the
other, the ``white witch,'' tried to ward off the supernatural
attacks.

Kournikova gone but not forgotten; `blokes' mourn loss AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Anna Kournikova is gone from
Wimbledon, but not forgotten.
	   British newspapers _ and not just the tabloids _ plastered her
photo on their pages Tuesday, a day after the 17-year-old Russian
withdrew with a thumb injury.
	   ``Notice to all Men: Wimbledon is over,'' said The Mirror.
	   ``If you're a man, Wimbledon is history. But if you're a woman,
it has only begun,'' the paper said.
	   ``Sexy Anna out of Wimbledon,'' said The Sun, which treated her
injury as a news story.
	   ``British blokes were broken-hearted yesterday as tennis smasher
Anna Kournikova pulled out of Wimbledon,'' The Sun said.
	   ``And that means no more sexy smiles and skimpy outfits... to
keep legions of lads glued to their tellies.''
	   The Daily Telegraph, Britain's most conservative broadsheet,
carried the story of her withdrawl on the front page _ bumping
inside a BBC interview with au pair Louise Woodward, convicted of
manslaughter in the death of an American baby.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOT ITEM: &LR;  That's how to describe the state of women's tennis,
with a host of teen-agers challenging the old guard.
	   ``Without question, I think women's tennis is in the best shape
in its 100-year history,'' said six-time Wimbledon singles champion
Bille Jean King. ``Davenport, Seles, Martinez, Sanchez Vicario and
the youngsters, Hingis, the Williams sisters, Kournikova, they are
all so good. It's just incredible.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UN-FASHION TIP: &LR;  On a scale of 1 to 10, Andre Agassi scored
about a 2 for the outfit he wore in Monday's first-round victory
over Alex Calatrava.
	   ``Agassi was wearing a sort of long-sleeved pregnancy smock,
shorts that reached all the way down to this calves, and a baseball
cap _ daringly worn the right way around,'' Simon Barnes wrote in
The Times.
	   ``No player has exposed less naked flesh to the Wimbledon crowd
since Anne White turned out in a skin-tight catsuit in 1985.''
	   In other fashion news, Monica Seles wore what the Daily Mail
described as a see-through dress _ with a white bodysuit underneath
_ in her first-round win.
	   ``It looks pretty sensational _ the sort of dress girls are
wearing to go out nightclubbing at the moment,'' Nike spokesman
Debbie Cox was quoted as saying.
	   Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus _ who appeared for her
first-round match in a white skirt with blue stripes _ was ordered
off the court and told to change into something whiter, causing a
15-minute delay.
	   ``I think the dress code at Wimbledon is a bit rigid,'' she said
after losing her first-round match to Alexia Dechaume-Balleret of
France.
	   Meanwhile, the pharmacy at the All England Club is stocking nail
polish in frosted purple and green _ the Wimbledon colors.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   THEIR FINEST HOUR: &LR;  British women had their finest hour in the
first round. Three made the second round _ Sam Smith, Karen Cross
and Louis Latimer. Smith, who has reached No. 94 in the world _ the
top British woman _ beat world No. 53 Anne-Gaelle Sidot 6-3, 4-6,
6-2.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ODDS AND ENDS: &LR;  Monday's first-day crowd was the largest in
almost 10 years, apparently unaffected by the World Cup in France.
The 33,823 was 316 short of the first-day record set in 1989... All
England Club chief executive Chris Gorringe is well known to
Wimbledon fans as the man who announces rain delays over the public
address system. The Guardian newspaper described his dulcet tones
this way: ``Chris Gorringe... would no doubt remain impeccably
restrained if he were to announce to the first-day crowds that
bubonic plague had broken out.''

World Cup: Italy qualifies for last 16, eliminates Austria with 2-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri fired his fourth goal
of the World Cup Tuesday, and Roberto Baggio his second, as Italy
qualified for the second round with a 2-1 against Austria.
	   The defeat puts Austria out of the World Cup.
	   Vieri's strike came in the 48th minute.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, who had just been fouled, took a delicate
free kick from the left of the penalty area, and Vieri climbed high
above the Austrian defense to head powerfully past goalkeeper

	   Baggio tied the game up in the 89th minute when he tapped in a

an equalizer.

minute after Hannes Reinmayr had been pulled down, but the goal was
not enough to save Austria from first round elimination.

Chechen leader declares state of emergency 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of Chechnya declared a state of
emergency on Tuesday and imposed a curfew in the breakaway region
of southern Russia, the Interfax news agency said.
	   No reason for the action was given. Interfax said the measures
were approved by parliament during a long, closed-door hearing at
which President Aslan Maskhadov spoke.
	   Chechnya has become a center of violent crime, including rampant
kidnappings and shootings, since the end of its independence war
against Russia two years ago. Its government has not been able to
restore order or rebuild the economy.
	   The state of emergency goes into effect at midnight Tuesday
(2000 GMT) and will last until July 15, said government press
spokesman Lomali Musurbuyev. A curfew will be in effect daily from
10 p.m. to 6 a.m., he said.
	   Chechnya still considers itself independent of Russia, although
Russia still views it as a renegade Russian republic.

World Cup: Italy qualifies for last 16, eliminating Austria with 2-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri fired his fourth goal
of the World Cup Tuesday, and Roberto Baggio his first, as Italy
qualified for the second round with a 2-1 against Austria.
	   The defeat puts Austria out of the World Cup.
	   Vieri's strike came in the 48th minute.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, who had just been fouled, took a delicate
free kick from the left of the penalty area, and Vieri climbed high
above the Austrian defense to head powerfully past goalkeeper
Michael Konsel.
	   Baggio made the game safe in the 89th minute when he tapped in a
cross from Filippo Inzaghi as Austria surged forward in search of
an equalizer.
	   Andres Herzog scored for Austria with a penalty in the 92nd
minute after Hannes Reinmayr had been pulled down, but the goal was
not enough to save Austria from first round elimination.

Israel still undecided whether to allow Hamas leader to return 
</HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of Sheik Ahmed Yassin's planned
return to the Gaza Strip, Israel's defense minister said
unexpectedly Tuesday that he hadn't decided yet whether to allow
the Hamas spiritual leader to come back.
	   Yassin has been on a four-month fundraising tour of the Arab
world during which he raised millions of dollars for the Islamic
militant group Hamas and repeatedly called for armed struggle
against Israel.
	   Hamas officials said Yassin planned to cross from Egypt into
Gaza on Wednesday afternoon, citing earlier assurances by Israel,
relayed via the Palestinian Authority, that the Hamas leader would
be permitted to return.
	   Israeli officials have said in the past Yassin would pose more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his activities could be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   However, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai announced Tuesday
that he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not yet decided
whether to allow Yassin to return, according to Mordechai's aide,
Avi Beniahu.
	   ``There is no final decision,'' Beniahu said. ``The Israeli
Cabinet voted to leave the decision in the hands of the prime
minister and defense minister so when Yassin decides to return,
they will decide then.''
	   Hamas officials in Gaza were surprised by the comments.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority informed us a few days ago that
Israel had approved the return of Yassin and told the same thing to
the Egyptians and if this is true, it is a kind if child's play,''
said Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar in Gaza.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israeli liaison commitee with
the Palestinians, said no entry permit had been issued.
	   ``The current situation is that when he really arrives at the
border ... then we will make our decision,'' Dror said, adding that
Israel ``never talked with the Palestinains about his return.''
	   Egypt reportedly waited until Israel officially announced it
would let Yassin return to Gaza. Egypt had feared that if Yassin
got stuck at its border with Gaza, he would be an embarrassment to
the government, which has close ties with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.

Watchdog group says human rights deteriorating in Egypt 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Increased political violence and
imprisonment of journalists marks a deterioration of human rights
in Egypt is deteriorating, a local watchdog group said Tuesday.
	   ``Human rights conditions will get worse in this country if
(violations) continue in this way,'' Mohamed Moneib Genedy,
secretary-general of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights,
told reporters.
	   Presenting the EOHR's report for 1997, Genedy said 191 people
died in political violence in 1997, up from 174 in 1996. Among
those killed were policemen, Islamic insurgents, Coptic Christians,
bystanders and tourists.
	   The Associated Press counted 184 people killed in political
violence in 1997.
	   The most bloody carnage occurred on November 17 when six Islamic
extremists killed 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians at a
Pharaonic temple in the southern city of Luxor.
	   More than 1,200 people have died since the militants began their
insurrection against the secular government in 1992. The militants
want to establish Islamic rule.
	   Genedy said the EOHR had recorded four deaths caused by torture
in police custody in 1997. The report cited the case of Bekhit
Salem, 38, who was detained in 1993 and charged with attacking a
police station. He was acquitted but was repeatedly detained until
he died on March 26, 1997.
	   Salem suffered partial paralysis as a result of torture and
fainted when an EOHR representative visited him two weeks before
his death, the report said.
	   Genedy said the EOHR could not update its 1996 figure of 17,000
political detainees because the Interior Ministry would not release
the figures. The ministry has accused rights groups of seeking to
harm Egypt's reputation as a democratic country.
	   Turning to 1998, Genedy said he expected an increase in rights
violations and pointed to the following cases as evidence:
	   _ The authorities have continued to reject the formation of any
new political party, claiming that the applicants did not offer
programs different to those of the existing 14 parties.
	   _ Four journalists have been imprisoned this year for libeling
pro-government politicians, including the editor and a reporter of
the biweekly newspaper Al-Shaab, which had accused an interior
minister of corruption.
	   _ A police officer implicated in the beating to death of a
detainee, Waheed el-Sayed Ahmed, has not been prosecuted.
	   El-Sayed's death provoked a riot in his hometown of Belqas in
the Nile Delta on April 9.

Belarus clears itself of human rights violations, lambastes West dissolved parliament, installed new one.

Eds: ADDS protest outside govt building, CLARIFIES Lukashenko
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The first parliamentary hearings on human
rights in Belarus quickly turned into an anti-West rally on
Tuesday, with the United States taking most of the criticism.
	   Washington is ``creating difficulties for the Belarusian people
and state'' with its frequent complaints that President Alexander
Lukashenko's government violates human rights, the head of the
presidential administration, Mikhail Myasnikovich, said during the
hearings.
	   Belarus has ``no fundamental problems with the observation of
human rights,'' Myasnikovich said.
	   Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West since
dissolving parliament and installing a more loyal one, and adopting
sweeping powers in the former Soviet republic more than a year ago.
He has maintained strong government controls over the economy,
curbed press freedoms and kept a tight rein on the opposition.
	   Foreign diplomats are currently claiming that Lukashenko has
violated the Vienna Convention by demanding they leave their homes
in Minsk so that repairs can be carried out.
	   Myasnikovich said that for the majority of Belarusians, social
stability and safety are the most important human rights. He said
that only three percent of Belarusians think the right to gather
and hold demonstrations is the most valuable right. He gave no
indication how that figure was arrived at.
	   ``And it's understood that the three percent _ those are people
for whom political ambition is more important than peace and well
being in one's own home,'' he said.
	   In a reference to the United States, Myasnikovich called for a
``decisive rebuff to those who impose their views and notions of
democracy, taking advantage of strength and international
influence.''
	   While the hearings were taking place, members of the parliament
that Lukashenko disbanded in 1996 gathered outside the government
building.
	   Waving banners and demanding the release of several former
deputies who were charged with various crimes, the protesters
marched across Independence Square.
	   Several of the demonstrators were told to report to local police
for staging an unauthorized event. Lukashenko has banned
unauthorized rallies with more than 10 participants.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ask and you shall be given, this goes for cards
too.
	   Players that ask referees for a card for their opponent when
they've been fouled might be served with a card all of their own.
	   The problem of fouled players ``asking'' for cards with hand
gestures was put to the attention of the referees, FIFA spokesman
Keith Cooper said Tuesday.
	   ``The problem was discussed in the refereeing community and it
has been brought to their attention that if they feel it's
necessary they could take more action,'' Cooper said. ``It's an act
of dissent and bad sportsmanship.''
	   The teams have not been specifically warned about the heighten
vigilance for the card asking.
	   ``There's no need to tell players they shouldn't do something
they shouldn't be doing anyway,'' Cooper said.
	   The informal discussion between refereeing officials and
referees was not the same as the ``edict'' issued by FIFA president
Sepp Blatter on the sanctions for the tackle from behind, FIFA
said. It's more of a preventative measure.
	   ``The more players that start to do it the more it's going to
escalate,'' Cooper said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Net surfers are beginning to discover the World
Cup.
	   Since the June 10th kick off of the 1998 World Cup it's official
Internet site registered over 450 million hits.
	   The 15th of June proved the most popular day for the site. It
got 59 million hits, beating the previous record of 56 million hits
in one day, held by the official web site for the Winter Olympics
in Nagano.
	   The site, www.france.98.com, has been visited by a total of 10
million net surfers from 170 countries that together made the 450
million hits.
	   The site offers match results in real time and all other soccer
news and statistics and team information.
	   Specialist reporters and volunteers from the French Organizing
committee keep the site up to date. Aside from the soccer
information, it has World Cup screen savers and an on-line boutique
where users can buy official World Cup 98 products and souvenirs.

	   Paris (AP) _ The French organizing committee has stopped giving
out attendance figures after World Cup matches, spokesman Bruno
Traverde said Tuesday.
	   ``If we decided now not to give out the number of spectators
it's because everyone can see the stadiums are full,'' Travade
said.
	   The organizing committee stressed that there was a difference
between the theoretical capacity of each stadium and the actual
capacity on the day of match. Travade referred to changes in the
seating capacity due to security measures, visibility concerns and
media allocation.
	   Travade also said the committee still has not received a list of
ticket numbers and names of clients of Prime Sports International.
The company is claiming that 15,000 tickets where stolen from their
Paris office in the night of Wednesday.
	   The spokesman pointed out that in all matches so far the places
for which the tickets where reportedly stolen were filled with
``peaceful supporters'' with tickets in the name of PSI.

on Tuesday asked his country to forgive him for ignoring rules that
led to his expulsion from the World Cup team in France.
	   Speaking to reporters on his arrival back in South Africa,
Mokoena said: ``It's my fault. I strongly regret my action, but I
did not think it was going to cost my place in the squad.''
	   Mokoena, 23, and Brendan Augustine, 27, were suspended by the
South African Football Association for violating a team curfew and
going out Saturday night, SAFA officials said.
	   Augustine refused to talk to reporters, and said he just wanted

	   LONDON (AP) _ World Cup fever has struck the personnel manning
three isolated British Antarctic Survey stations on the remote
ice-capped continent.
	   Unable to get terrestrial or satellite television, the teams are
dependent on the BBC World Service for news but the signal is often
too weak to reach them.
	   To counter this, staff at the survey's Cambridge headquarters
said they are sending regular e-mails and page after page of
football news to the 37 engineers and scientists hungry for details
about how Scotland and England are faring.
	   The research teams are enduring 24-hours-a-day darkness and have
just celebrated midwinter in Antarctica. They will not leave the
continent until October.
	   Two of the bases are on the ice-cap itself while the third, Bird

World Cup: Italy qualifies for last 16, eliminates Austria with 2-1 win information 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes, corrects scoring times, adds more

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri fired his fourth goal
of the World Cup Tuesday, and Roberto Baggio his second, as Italy
qualified for the second round with a 2-1 against Austria.
	   The defeat puts Austria out of the World Cup.
	   Vieri's vital strike came in the 49th minute.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, who had just been fouled, took a delicate
free kick from the left of the penalty area, and Vieri climbed high
above the Austrian defense to head powerfully past goalkeeper
Michael Konsel.
	   Substitute Baggio made the game safe in the 90th minute when he
tapped in a cross from Filippo Inzaghi, another second half
substitute, as Austria surged forward in search of an equalizer.
	   Andres Herzog scored for Austria with a penalty in the 92nd
minute after Hannes Reinmayr had been pulled down, but the goal was
not enough to save Austria from first round elimination.
	   ``It is good to have two great strikers on the substitutes'
bench,'' said Italian coach Cesare Maldini. ``I am happy to have
avoided Brazil in the next round, but I want to enjoy our victory
and not think too much about the next match.''
	   Vieri's goal puts him joint top of the goalscoring standings,
equal with Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Earlier, Italy needed a fine save from goalkeeper Gianluca
Pagliuca to stay in front.
	   In the 66th minute, Arnold Wetl, left unmarked five yards from
goal, neatly controlled a cross on his chest and flicked the ball
over his shoulder, only to see the Inter Milan goalkeeper make a
quick reaction to keep the ball out.
	   Chances were few and far between during a match played in front
of 80,000 spectators at the Stade de France.
	   Francesco Moriero came closest for Italy in the first half.
	   In the 29th minute, Gianluca Pessotto crossed from the left and
Moriero hit a spectacular right-footed volley from 15 yards that
went wide of the post.
	   Italy got an early blow within the first three minutes when
Lazio defender Alessandro Nesta went off with ligament injuries
after a clash with Austrian midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Nesta was replaced by 34-year-old Inter Milan sweeper Guiseppe
Bergomi.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Italy: Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta (Guiseppe Bergomi,
3rd), Paolo Maldini, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta,
Francesco Moriero, Dino Baggio, Luigi Di Biagio, Gianluca Pessotto,
Christian Vieri (Filippo Inzaghi, 59th), Alessandro Del Piero
(Roberto Baggio, 72nd).
	   Austria: Michael Konsel; Anton Pfeffer, Wolfgang Feiersinger,
Peter Schoettel, Dietmar Kuehbauer (Peter Stoger, 74th), Roman
Maehlich, Heimo Pfeifenberger (Andreas Herzog, 83), Arnold Wetl,
Ivica Vastic, Hannes Reinmayr, Anton Polster (Mario Haas, 61st).
	   Referee: Paul Durkin, England.

India, Pakistan meet at July South Asian summit

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpaypee looks to an upcoming regional summit as a chance to
improve relations with neighbor and rival Pakistan after weeks of
nuclear tension, an official said Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in host Sri Lanka on Tuesday
announced a three-day meeting of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation will begin in the Sri Lankan capital July 29.
	   The group comprises India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Nepal and the Maldives.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub has said the summit would
provide an opportunity for Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to meet.
	   Indian foreign office spokesman K.C. Singh said Tuesday that
Vajpayee had sent a letter June 14 to Sharif expressing the need to
improve ties. The longtime rivals have fought three wars since both
gained independence from Britain in 1947, and their series of
tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month raised fears of regional
nuclear war.
	   Vajpayee said the Colombo meeting would enable India and
Pakistan ``to hold bilateral dialogue on all issues of mutual
interest and also decide on how to proceed further with dialogue,''
Singh told reporters. The letter had not been public until Sharif
mentioned it to reporters in Pakistan Monday.
	   Discussions between Vajpayee and Sharif are likely to focus on
the troubled northern state of Kashmir, two-thirds of which is
controlled by New Delhi and the rest by Islamabad. Both countries
have for years staked claim to the whole province, over which they
have fought two of their three wars.
	   Lal Krishna Advani, India's internal security minister, said
Tuesday his country would consider fencing off its share of
disputed Kashmir to prevent attacks on Hindus by Muslims it charges
are trained and armed by neighboring Pakistan. In the past,
repeated attempts by India to fence a 210-kilometer (140-mile)
stretch were abandoned when they were met with firing from
Pakistani soldiers across the border.
	   Predominately Hindu India repeatedly accuses officially Islamic
Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri Muslim separatists.
Pakistan denies the charges. Indian Kashmir is its only
Muslim-majority state.
	   India's currency closed at a new low of 42.94 rupees to the
dollar Tuesday, reflecting business concerns about anti-nuclear
sanctions and the country's poor credit rating.
	   In Islamabad Tuesday, newspapers reported that Sharif reiterated
his call for international mediation in the Kashmir dispute, and
officials and witnesses reported Indian soldiers shelled Pakistani
territory the day before, killing two people and injuring two
others.
	   Foreign office spokesman Tariq Altaf said Pakistan sees
international mediation as the only way to find a solution to the
Kashmir dispute. India resists anything seen as outside pressure.
	   Pakistan wants residents of both sides of Kashmir to be allowed
to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan, but such a
plebiscite, as outlined in decades-old U.N. resolutions, is opposed
by India.

FDA approves first new TB drug in 25 years 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS graf 2 to CORRECT name of manufacturer to Hoechst 
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
approved the first new tuberculosis drug in 25 years.
	   The FDA said Tuesday that it has approved rifapentine, which is
marketed under the name Priftin by Hoechst Marion Roussell Inc. of
Kansas City, Missouri. The United States is the first country to
approve the drug.
	   An advisory panel voted 10-1 to recommend approval earlier this
month for the drug that can cut significantly the number of pills a
patient has to take to cure the pulmonary TB.
	   FDA officials say this is important because it makes patients
more likely to complete their therapy. Failure to complete therapy
can lead to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.
	   The World Health Organization estimated there will be 90 million
new cases of tuberculosis and 30 million deaths worldwide in the
decade of the 1990s.
	   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
about 19,000 cases were diagnosed in the United States in 1997.
	   TB has re-emerged as a significant health problem in recent
years, in part because people with AIDS are especially susceptible
to the disease.
	   Also, strains of tuberculosis that are resistant to front-line
antibiotics are emerging around the world and are especially common
in parts of the former Soviet Union.
	   Tuberculosis is extremely hard to treat, requiring patients to
take four drugs two times a week for two months then two drugs once
a week for four more months.
	   Failure to complete that course can lead to deadly
multidrug-resistant TB, so many areas require patients to take the
pills in front of a health-care worker.
	   In tests in South Africa, using rifapentine allowed patients to
take their drugs just once a week during the last four months of
therapy.
	   In studies, rifapentine was used in combination with other TB
drugs, isoniazid, pyrazinamid and ethambutol.
	   Rifapentine did have a higher relapse rate _ 10 percent compared
to 5 percent using other therapy _ but none of the relapsed
patients who used rifapentine developed drug-resistant TB.

With France-World Cup-Violence German politicians call for tighter controls on soccer hooligans 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German politicians called for tighter
controls on soccer hooligans Tuesday, two days after a German thug
beat a French policeman comatose outside a World Cup match.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told a radio station that he
supports a proposal by Manfred von Richthofen, president of the
German Sports Federation, to set up a data bank on known soccer
hooligans.
	   ``What has happened shows that we must now do everything, and I
mean everything, to prevent something like that happening in the
future ... They are troublemakers and their activity must be
stopped,'' Kinkel told the Berlin station 100.6.
	   Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover, has been arrested in France for
attacking the police officer Sunday while Germany played Yugoslavia
to a 2-2 draw.
	   The suspect owns a tattoo and body-piercing parlor in a Hanover
neighborhood. In an apparent sign of disgust, someone shattered the
parlor window with a rock late Monday.
	   Police and prosecutors described Warnecke as a high-school
graduate from a well-off family. He sometimes worked as a bouncer
in a red-light district club.
	   He has a history of fights _ he allegedly punched a club
customer in the face _ and has been convicted of forging a
document. Neighbors say he owns a pit bull.
	   Kinkel told the radio station that pulling Germany out of World
Cup competition was the wrong answer to hooliganism. ``It would
really be awful if such rash thugs would succeed in ruining this
soccer festival,'' he said.
	   Richthofen, also a guest on the radio show, said a data base on
hooligans was the only way to ``control this sickness.'' He also
recommended that police be allowed to prevent violence by arresting
soccer game spectators known for hooliganism.
	   Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig recommended that the
violence in France be prosecuted quickly to send a message to other
hooligans.
	   ``If one is already convicted a day after the crime and sits in
prison, it would also have an effect on other members of his
group,'' he was quoted as saying in an advance copy of Wednesday's
Berliner Morgenpost newspaper.

Court adjourns controversial lawsuit over censorship 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A lawsuit against authors of a documentary
on the American company Amway, which sparked a debate on limits of
newly won media freedom in post-communist Poland, was adjourned
Tuesday because of the plaintiff's absence.
	   Direct sales company Amway took action against authors of a
documentary ``Welcome to Life'' depicting the firm's ideology and
methods of enlisting and training distributors, claiming it builds
a false image of its operations and shakes customers' confidence.
	   The director Henryk Dederko and producer Jacek Gizdala, accused
by Amway of slander and dishonest competition, said their film
depicts the state of mind of people working for Amway.
	   A court order sought by the company in early March to stop the
film from being shown on television, was protested by more than 50
Polish editors and journalists from across the political spectrum,
who said it resembled Communist-era censorship.
	   The film's soundtrack, which was published by Poland's biggest
daily Gazeta Wyborcza, says much of Amway business involves
training its distributors into thinking in terms of profit and
hierarchy.
	   Using get rich fast promises during difficult economic reforms
in Poland, Amway claims to have enlisted about 80,000 people as
distributors.
	   The local court in Lodz adjourned the trial till Sept. 22
because an Amway representative and witnesses were absent.
	   The defendants refused a settlement proposed by Amway. They face
up to 2 years of in prison if convicted of slander.
	   ``Welcome to Life'' was awarded the top prize at a media
festival in Poland's central city of Lodz in November.
	   The business practices of Amway, founded in 1959 in Michigan,
were also the subject of court cases in the U.S. and Canada in the
past.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The prospects of a French policeman whose
head was bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with
doctors calling his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   A second suspect, meanwhile, was identified in the attack
Sunday. Judicial officials said the man was among 15 Germans
already detained for suspected involvement in the melee, and among
six who were going to be deported.
	   Like the first suspect, the second is a 27-year-old from
Hanover. Both were to face a judge later Tuesday, and were expected
to be placed under formal investigation _ a step short of being
charged _ for attempted murder, the officials said on customary
anonymity.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old policeman and father of two, was in
a deep coma in a Lille hospital after suffering ``repeated violent
blows from a massive object'' _ actually an iron bar _ following
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said.
	   They said Tuesday morning that it was impossible, for the time
being, to make an accurate forecast regarding his health.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan was
also in a hospital, badly hurt after being stabbed in scuffles
following Monday night's England-Romania game.
	   Police identified the fan as Steven Clarke. Hospital officials
wouldn't give information on his condition, but his life was not
believed in danger.

Encouraged by refugee plan, Kinkel offers Croatia aid support 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with separate agreement signed in Banja Luka
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Tuesday
praised Croatia for encouraging Serb refugees to return home,
saying he would now support a conference on war reconstruction for
the country.
	   Kinkel, after meeting with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate
Granic, also said he would recommend that Croatia be eligible for
EU funds earmarked for former communist countries trying to prepare
for European Union membership.
	   Granic's plan, outlined Tuesday during his Bonn visit, will
offer incentives for Serb refugees living in the Serb-controlled
sector of Bosnia to return home to Croatia's Krajina region.
	   That would make room in Bosnia's Serb sector for the return of
war refugees in Germany.
	   Dietmar Schlee, Germany's high official overseeing Bosnian
refugees here, cautioned Kinkel not to take any decisive action
until he sees some concrete results.
	   ``The Germany government should only discuss aid for Croatia if
today's promises are followed up with actions,'' Schlee said. He
specified that that would mean a significant number of refugees
returning from Serb-controlled Bosnia in the coming days.
	   Meanwhile in Banja Luka, the capital of the Serb-controlled half
of Bosnia, Croatian and Bosnian Serb officials signed a separate
agreement defining practical steps refugees must take to return
home.
	   It is estimated that about 50,000 Serb refugees from Croatia are
currently in Serb-held Bosnia, while some 70,000 Bosnian Croat
refugees live now in Croatia.

Turkish police detain five Kurdish politicians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AYDIN, Turkey (AP) _ Police on Tuesday detained five members of
a pro-Kurdish party for questioning about their alleged ties with
autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels, a report said.
	   Anti-terrorism police stopped a van carrying the local leader of
the People's Democracy Party (HADEP) and his four companions in
this western Aegean city, the Anatolia news agency said. They were
carrying banned documents belonging to the rebel group, it added.
	   The detentions of the HADEP members were the latest in a series,
following raids at party headquarters.
	   Turkey frequently comes under criticism for its human rights
record, marred by its treatment of Kurds and Kurdish political
groups.
	   The rebels have been fighting for autonomy in the southeast
since 1984. The war has claimed some 37,000 lives.

Israel still undecided whether to allow Hamas leader to return 
</HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of Sheik Ahmed Yassin's planned
return to the Gaza Strip, Israel's defense minister said
unexpectedly Tuesday that he hadn't decided yet whether to allow
the Hamas spiritual leader to come back.
	   Yassin has been on a four-month fundraising tour of the Arab
world during which he raised millions of dollars for the Islamic
militant group Hamas and repeatedly called for armed struggle
against Israel.
	   Hamas officials said Yassin planned to cross from Egypt into
Gaza on Wednesday afternoon, citing earlier assurances by Israel,
relayed via the Palestinian Authority, that the Hamas leader would
be permitted to return.
	   Israeli officials have said in the past Yassin would pose more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his activities could be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   However, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai announced Tuesday
that he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not yet decided
whether to allow Yassin to return, according to Mordechai's aide,
Avi Beniahu.
	   ``There is no final decision,'' Beniahu said. ``The Israeli
Cabinet voted to leave the decision in the hands of the prime
minister and defense minister so when Yassin decides to return,
they will decide then.''
	   Hamas officials in Gaza were surprised by the comments.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority informed us a few days ago that
Israel had approved the return of Yassin and told the same thing to
the Egyptians and if this is true, it is a kind of child's play,''
said Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar in Gaza.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israeli liaison commitee with
the Palestinians, said no entry permit had been issued.
	   ``The current situation is that when he really arrives at the
border ... then we will make our decision,'' Dror said, adding that
Israel ``never talked with the Palestinains about his return.''
	   Egypt reportedly waited until Israel officially announced it
would let Yassin return to Gaza. Egypt had feared that if Yassin
got stuck at its border with Gaza, he would be an embarrassment to
the government, which has close ties with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.

Top Serb hardliner to run in next elections, his party says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Serb member of Bosnian's
three-man presidency and close aide to the No. 1 war crimes suspect
will run in the upcoming elections, his party announced Tuesday.
	   Momcilo Krajisnik will be running for re-election to the post of
Serb member in the country's tripartite presidency in the September
general elections, the Bosnian Serb news agency Srna reported.
	   The announcement came in contradiction to Krajisnik's statement
last May that he intended to abandon politics and not run in the
next elections.
	   According to Srna, Krajisnik's Serbian Democratic Party convened
late Monday and decided on his candidacy.
	   Krajisnik, the right-hand man to top Bosnian war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic, helped lead the Bosnian Serbs' 1992 rebellion
against the country's Muslims and Croats.
	   But unlike the latter, Krajisnik has not been indicted by the
international war crimes tribunal based in the The Hague,
Netherlands.
	   Since being elected as the Bosnian Serb member of the country's
presidency in 1996, Krajisnik has repeatedly butted heads with
international peace officials for insisting the Serb-ruled half of
the country separate from the Muslim-Croat half.
	   Earlier this month the Serbian Democratic Party joined with the
ultranationalist Radical Party, in hopes of providing a challenge
to Plavsic's three-party coalition ``Harmony,'' which seeks to
unseat both Krajisnik and the hard-line co-chairman of Bosnia's
joint government.

Scarcity of components halts production at GM de Mexico's Silao plant 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) _ With a U.S. strike causing a parts
shortage, General Motors Corp.'s Mexican unit said it was
suspending production Tuesday at its Silao light truck assembly
plant.
	   Production was halted Saturday at the plant in the central
Mexican state of Guanajuato for an inventory check, General Motors
de Mexico SA said in a press release. Activity resumed Monday but
the plant ran out of parts after the first shift.
	   Strikes against two GM parts plants in Flint, Michigan, by the
United Auto Workers have idled most of the company's North American
vehicle productions.
	   GM de Mexico said half of the 2,455 employees at the Silao plant
will continue working full-time on maintenance or to receive
training.
	   Normal production is expected to continue through much of the
week at the Ramos Arizpe complex in the northern state of Coahuila,
which has 2,091 workers at a motor plant and 2,828 at a car
assembly facility.
	   Production will be suspended at Ramos Arizpe on Thursday to
``conserve inventory and extend the production calendar for as long
as possible,'' the company said.
	   GM de Mexico said production is continuing normally at its
Toluca complex, in the state of Mexico, where the company employs
2,215 workers.
	   Delphi Automotive, a unit of GM, said Monday that the strike in
the United States has idled 22,902 workers at 25 of its 53 plants
in Mexico. Company spokesman Michael Hissam said operations were
normal at the other 28 plants in the country.

Murphy out as Maple Leafs coach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Mike Murphy is out as head coach of the Toronto
Maple Leafs, The Canadian Press learned Tuesday.
	   The Leafs called a news conference for 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) at
which time the announcement was to be made by president-general
manager Ken Dryden, who had been evaluating Murphy's performance.
	   Pat Quinn was regarded as the prime candidate to succeed Murphy.
Quinn, a two-time NHL coach of the year and president-general
manager of the Vancouver Canucks until his firing last winter, was
interviewed by Dryden during the weekend.
	   Murphy didn't get the Maple Leafs into the playoffs in either of
his two seasons as coach. Toronto was 30-43-9 last season and
30-44-8 in 1996-97. He has a year left on his contract.
	   Quinn was still at his Vancouver home Tuesday. When reached by a
Toronto radio station, he was noncommittal about joining the Leafs.

OPEC ministers may cut 1 million barrels from weak oil market AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: ADDS new comments from ministers, fresh oil prices
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ As OPEC struggles to raise the depressed
price of oil, some key players said Tuesday they want to remove
more than 1 million barrels a day from the glutted market.
	   That would almost double the amount of new production cuts that
six OPEC nations have already promised while watching crude prices
tumble to 12-year lows. Futures traders responded by pushing prices
higher in New York and London.
	   ``We're all discussing further cuts,'' Kuwaiti oil minister
Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah said after talking privately with Saudi
oil minister Ali Naimi.
	   The Saudis have indicated they would consider slashing their
massive output by more than the 225,000 barrels per day that Naimi
has already pledged, according to a Persian Gulf source who spoke
to reporters only on condition of anonymity.
	   But nobody has suggested _ at least not publicly _ how many
extra barrels any particular producer should take off the market.
	   Although the Saudis are cutting by far the most barrels, they
have by far the biggest production and their initial pledge to
restrain output was proportionately smaller than promises from some
of the other OPEC states.
	   Iran has proposed across-the-board cuts of 10 percent, starting
from February production levels, and the United Arab Emirates oil
minister, Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri, said Tuesday he had no
problems with that proposal.
	   OPEC got itself into trouble in the winter by agreeing to raise
production, flooding the market with crude just as the Asian
economic crisis began choking off demand.
	   Sheik Saud said he would like to see OPEC agree this week to cut
more than 1.245 million barrels a day, citing the same figure that
OPEC promised to slash in an emergency session called in March to
address the collapsing market.
	   OPEC actually delivered less than 1 million barrels a day of its
first round of cuts, and prices plunged further. OPEC's average
price fell below dlrs 11 per barrel last week, though it is
slightly higher now.
	   The cheap oil is a bargain for consumers but awful news for OPEC
and other producers who think they should be getting somewhere
between dlrs 17 and dlrs 20 per barrel.
	   Heading into a meeting that formally opens on Wednesday, most of
the OPEC members have promised new cuts that would equal 620,000
barrels a day, beginning July 1.
	   Non-OPEC members including Mexico, Russia and Oman have chipped
in with more pledges to remove oil from the market, bringing the
total to 823,000 barrels.
	   But OPEC and the other producers know they're in trouble, and
many are talking about more severe cuts.
	   ``Personally, I think we need 1.3 million barrels a day,'' said
Luis Giusti, the president of Venezuela's state oil monopoly,
Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Giusti was referring to cuts from OPEC
and non-OPEC.
	   Traders seemed cautiously optimistic.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August was up 42 cents at
dlrs 13.66 per barrel in early evening dealings on London's
International Petroleum Exchange, adding to gains of 39 cents from
Monday's session.
	   Light sweet crude oil for August was up 53 cents at dlrs 14.18
per barrel around midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, also
adding to gains from Monday.
	   But it remains to be seen whether OPEC can pull off big new
cuts, and if so, just how much everybody will cut. OPEC
secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria wouldn't even address
the question.
	   ``You're jumping the gun,'' Lukman told reporters Tuesday as
ministers trickled into Vienna. ``They haven't even had time to
discuss the matter.''
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Mexican foreign secretary meets with Castro on first visit to Cuba 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ On her first official visit to Cuba, Mexican
Foreign Secretary Rosario Green met with Fidel Castro in a six-hour
session that ended early Tuesday.
	   Mexico's government news agency Notimex, which reported the
meeting, gave no details on the conversation.
	   Green, who was appointed foreign secretary in January, is making
a two-day visit to the communist island to discuss the two nations'
cultural and education programs, economics, immigration and
tourism, Cuba's Prensa Latina agency reported.
	   Mexico is one of the few countries in the Americas to have
always maintained relations with Cuba despite pressure from the
United States. Noting this history, Green on Monday discarded any
suggestions that her visit could provoke conflict with Washington.
	   Welcoming Green at the Havana airport Monday, Cuban Foreign
Secretary Roberto Robaina praised Mexico for having carried out its
foreign relations with ``honor,'' Notimex said.
	   Notimex reported Tuesday that Cuba and Mexico have agreed to
increase tourism in the Caribbean by increasing flights between
Havana and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
	   It said officials from the two countries would discuss their
efforts to fight drug trafficking and would sign an agreement to
promote and protect commercial investments.

Big names will dance to raise money for Diana cause 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An all-star September dance performance honoring
Princess Diana will benefit one of the causes closest to her heart.
	   Stars from the Royal Ballet, the hit Irish step-dancing show
Riverdance, the recent West End revival of ``Sweet Charity'' and
others will raise money for the campaign against land mines,
organizers announced Tuesday.
	   The proceeds, expected to reach at least 100,000 pounds (dlrs
167,000), will go to the British Red Cross for a prosthetic
workshop in Afghanistan, creating false limbs for land-mine
victims, and five new health facilities in Angola _ one of the
countries where Diana took her campaign to ban land mines before
her Aug. 31 death.
	   The Sept. 15 performance will be called Explosive Dance,
referring to the effects of land mines. The artists' services and
Royal Albert Hall, where the event will take place, are being
provided at no charge.
	   ``It's probably the best selection, and collection, of dancers
that ever performed together on stage,'' said Harvey Goldsmith, who
is promoting the event in conjunction with the Red Cross.
	   Organizers said they were negotiating to broadcast the
performance around the world.

	   The appeals court decision applies to the first, narrow
antitrust move that government lawyers made against Microsoft last
year.
	   The Justice Department contended the software company tied sale
of Windows 95 to its Internet Explorer browser in violation of a
1995 agreement with the government.
	   The Justice Department filed a broader monopoly case against the
company this year that is not directly affected by the appeals
court ruling.
	   The judges noted, however, that the second, broader case may
supersede the first one.
	   Given the appeals court ruling, the Justice Department ``may
well regard further pursuit of this case as unpromising, especially
given the alternative avenues developing in its recently launched
separate attacks on Microsoft's practices,'' the judges wrote.
	   Justice Department lawyers were reviewing the ruling and had no
immediate comment.

Ukrainian president raises minimum wage, oil taxes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma raised
the minimum wage and increased oil excise taxes Tuesday, part of a
program to stabilize Ukraine's shaky financial and social
situation.
	   Kuchma began issuing economic decrees last week, saying Ukraine
could face a full-blown economic crisis while parliament was
preoccupied with infighting and could not adopt the necessary
measures.
	   ``This is not a temporary campaign but planned work,'' Kuchma
said of his decrees Tuesday, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The president raised the minimum monthly wage in Ukraine by 10
hryvna (dlrs 5) to 55 hryvna (dlrs 27.5). Although few people are
paid so little, the figure is used to calculate various payments
across the economy.
	   The government said the increase would cost it nearly 1 billion
hryvna (dlrs 500 million), which would be taken into account when
budget figures for the second half of 1998 are revised, Interfax
said.
	   The government recently approved a cut in the budget deficit to
fulfill a demand from the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine is
currently talking to the IMF about a dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
	   The measure has yet to be approved by the new, largely leftist
parliament. Kuchma said he might introduce it by decree, but voiced
hope that parliament _ which has been unable to elect a speaker
since early May _ would finally start acting.
	   ``Joint work and results would be welcome in Ukraine instead of
arguments, at which we were so successful over the past two
years,'' said the president, whose attempts at reforms have been
stalled by the legislature.
	   A separate decree Tuesday raised excise taxes for gas and diesel
fuel by as much as five times.
	   Also Tuesday, an aide to Kuchma said a decision last week to set
up a single agricultural production tax and restructure
agricultural debts would ease the tax pressure on Ukrainian farmers
and boost investments.
	   The measures canceled a 143 million hryvna (dlrs 71.5 million)
debt in fines accumulated by agricultural enterprises and
restructured a 3.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.65 billion) debt in tax
and other budgetary payments.
	   That means 90 percent of debtors' frozen bank accounts will be
freed, said Kuchma's deputy administration chief, Pavlo Gaidutsky.
	   The single tax rate of about 40 hryvna (dlrs 20) a year per
hectare (2.47 acres) of farm land would reduce farmers' tax burden
by about 28 percent a year. That should make agriculture more
attractive for investors, Gaidutsky said, according to Interfax.
	   Gaidutsky indicated, however, that the measures would not yield
immediate results. He said the gross agricultural product this year
is expected to remain at the 1997 level.
	   Nearly 90 percent of Ukraine's agriculture enterprises lost
money last year, he said.

Up to 30 million English watch Romania game on television 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS water, electricity surges in 2nd graf and at bottom.
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More people watched England's 2-1 World Cup loss
to Romania than any other soccer match telecast on a single channel
in the last two decades.
	   The result of almost 30 million people concentrating on one
event flowed on to water and power providers as well.
	   Water firms recorded a huge increases in the amount of water
used as viewers filled kettles and flushed lavatories in the
breaks.
	   And the National Grid said it had not recorded such large swings
in the demand for electricity since the funeral of Diana, Princess
of Wales.
	   The Broadcast Audience Research Board said Tuesday that as many
as 30 million people had watched ITV's telecast of the game,
including 21.6 million people who tuned-in at home.
	   Monday's match in Toulouse attracted 71 percent of all home
viewers who were tuning in at that time.
	   England's 1990 World Cup semi-final against Germany was seen by
25.2 million viewers on two channels.
	   The 1996 European Championship semi-final between the same two
sides gained a combined audience of 23.8 million.
	   Initial research puts the average home audience at 19.5 million
for the match - but that figure was two million higher in the final
quarter of an hour when Romania kicked the winning goal.
	   The viewing audience figure was increased by estimates of the
number of people watching in pubs and clubs.
	   The game proved more popular than Britain's top soaps, which
pull in anywhere between 12 and 18 million viewers.
	   There were huge surges in demand for power and water at
half-time and full-time during England's World Cup defeat at the
hands of Romania, it emerged today.
	   Water UK chief executive Pamela Taylor said English water
compaies had to cope with a ``demand roller-coaster''.
	   ``There were huge increases just before the game as people
settled down to watch, at half-time and at full-time. During the
match itself demand dropped below normal,'' she said.
	   Water demand rose between and 20 and 30 percent at half-time,
and surged by 50 percent at the end of the match.
	   The National Grid said demand for electricity dropped 1,000
megawatts once the match started, but rose 1,400 megawatts at
half-time and 1,500 megawatts at full-time.
	   Each of those surges is the equivalent of enough electricity to
power Manchester, or make two million cups of tea.
	   ``The last time we saw something like that was during Princess
Diana's funeral,'' a national grid spokesman said.
	   Monday's power surge was 50 percent higher than it was the
Tunisia game the previous week but the National Grid is predicting
greater demand during England's must-win match against Columbia on
Friday.

Jospin: French-American relations improving 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Just back from Washington, French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin says relations between France and the United States
have improved over the past few months.
	   Speaking before the National Assembly about his recent visit,
Jospin said there was ``greater serenity in Franco-American
relations.
	   ``The serenity can be felt in the straightforward way we
approach problems _ without passion, without preconceived
notions,'' he said.
	   Relations between the two allies have often been prickly. The
past few years have seen the partnership strained by squabbles over
changes in the NATO alliance, peacemaking in the Middle East and
Africa, and competition in aviation, to name a few areas.
	   Jospin said U.S. officials were ``impressed and reassured'' by
the fact that when it comes to foreign policy, France speaks in a
``single voice'' _ despite the fact that the president and the
prime minister come from opposite ends of the political spectrum.
President Jacques Chirac is a conservative, and Jospin is a
Socialist.

World Cup: Italy qualifies for last 16, eliminates Austria with 2-1 win official times of substitutes, corrects spelling of Andreas Herzog 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Austria quotes, details of injury to Nesta,
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri fired his fourth goal
of the World Cup Tuesday, and Roberto Baggio his second, as Italy
qualified for the second round with a 2-1 against Austria.
	   The result means that Italy wins Group B and Austria is
eliminated.
	   Vieri's vital strike came in the 49th minute.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, who had just been fouled, took a delicate
free kick from the left of the penalty area, and Vieri climbed high
above the Austrian defense to head powerfully past goalkeeper
Michael Konsel.
	   In the frantic closing minutes, substitute Baggio made the score
2-0 before Austria pulled a goal back with a penalty in the dying
seconds.
	   Baggio's goal came in the 90th minute.
	   Filippo Inzaghi, another second-half substitute, broke through
on the right as Austria surged forward in search of an equalizer,
and crossed to Baggio who tapped into an open net.
	   Andreas Herzog scored for Austria with a penalty in the 92nd
minute after Hannes Reinmayr had been pulled down, but the goal was
not enough to save Austria from first round elimination.
	   ``It is good to have two great strikers on the substitutes'
bench,'' said Italian coach Cesare Maldini. ``I am happy to have
avoided Brazil in the next round, but I want to enjoy our victory
and not think too much about the next match.''
	   Italy's qualification came at a heavy price. Defender Alessandro
Nesta injured knee ligaments in a fourth minute clash with Austrian
midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger and is considered unlikely to play
again in the World Cup.
	   Despite his team's elimination, Austria coach Herbert Prohaska
said his team competed well throughout the first round.
	   ``We've showed that we had a rightful place in this
tournament,'' Prohaska said. ``Italy showed that it has a very
clever squad, and could wait for counter-attacks.''
	   ``We were lacking a bit of luck. But the Italian defense stood
its ground well,'' Prohaska said.
	   Vieri's goal puts him joint top of the World Cup goalscoring
standings, equal with Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta, with four
goals.
	   Earlier, Italy needed a fine 66th minute save from goalkeeper
Gianluca Pagliuca to stay in front.
	   Arnold Wetl, left unmarked five yards from goal, neatly
controlled a cross on his chest and flicked the ball over his
shoulder, only to see the Inter Milan goalkeeper react quickly to
keep the ball out.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Italy: Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta (Guiseppe Bergomi,
4th), Paolo Maldini, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta,
Francesco Moriero, Dino Baggio, Luigi Di Biagio, Gianluca Pessotto,
Christian Vieri (Filippo Inzaghi, 60th), Alessandro Del Piero
(Roberto Baggio, 73rd).
	   Austria: Michael Konsel; Anton Pfeffer, Wolfgang Feiersinger,
Peter Schoettel, Dietmar Kuehbauer (Peter Stoger, 74th), Roman
Maehlich, Heimo Pfeifenberger (Andreas Herzog, 79th), Arnold Wetl,

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 20 teachers in the Ural Mountains have
been on a hunger strike for seven days demanding unpaid wages, a
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   ``On June 17 we entered the town education department, unrolled
mattresses ... and said we would not leave until the administration
clears the wage arrears starting from February,'' history teacher
Maria Baranova told ITAR-Tass.
	   The administration in the town of Polevskoi says it has no money
to pay the wages.
	   Wage arrears are a chronic problem in Russia.

By COMBIETE COMBEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Supporters of President Gnassigbe Eyadema and
self-exiled opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio have claimed
victory for their candidates in presidential elections.
	   But the national election commission, which was supposed to have
released the results of the Sunday voting at a Tuesday morning
press conference, canceled the briefing at the last minute.
	   Interior Minister Gen. Seyi Memene said in a statement read
Tuesday on state radio that there was a clear indication from
ballot papers that Eyadema would win the vote outright.
	   Later, Eyadema's campaign manager, Fambare Natchaba, also
insisted that the president had won. He conceded Olympio had done
well in Lome, the capital, but said ``serious fraud had been
committed'' there that hurt the ruling party.
	   But Bob Akitani, vice president of Olympio's party, said Olympio
had won 70 percent of the vote in southern Togo and 55 percent in
the north, putting him in a position to win.
	   In addition, one of the five opposition candidates, Leopold
Gnininvi, conceded defeat and said Olympio had won.
	   None of the officials, though, released specific details that
could back up their assertions.
	   Sunday's vote was the first round in presidential elections. If
a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, he automatically
becomes president. If not, the two top vote-getters face off in the
second round.
	   Eyadema was widely expected to make it to the second round.
	   Olympio, while the best known of Eyadema's five challengers, had
not been expected to reach the second round.
	   The son of Togo's first president _ who was killed in 1963 by a
military junta led by Eyadema _ Olympio fled to Ghana last year
after a series of attempts on his life, including a failed
assassination attempt in 1992 that seriously wounded him. It was
not clear whether he returned to Togo for the election.
	   Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support in the country's south,
and Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support among Togo's
intellectual class, were considered the two candidates with the
best chances of reaching the second round.
	   Gnininvi conceded defeat Tuesday.

Trade focus of Argentine-Russian talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will raise it concerns about a drop in
exports to Argentina when President Carlos Menem visits this week,
a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Trade between the two countries doubled to dlrs 224 million
between 1994 and 1997, but the balance is in Argentina's favor,
Interfax said.
	   Russian goods make up only 0.84 percent of Argentina's imports,
and Argentine goods account for 0.47 percent of Russia's imports,
the news agency said.
	   ``These figures look strange, to say the least, compared to the
potential of the two countries,'' said Ivan Gorbachev, first deputy
industry and trade minister.
	   Trade between Argentina and the Soviet Union was dlrs 3 billion
a year in the 1970s, Gorbachev said.
	   After Russia, Menem travels to Ukraine on Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA
chalked up two more slayings in its violent campaign for an
independent homeland straddling the Spanish-French border.
	   ETA said it killed Tomas Caballero _ a town councilor from the
northern city of Pamplona _ on May 6 and retired Civil Guard
officer Alfonso Parada two days later some 80 kilometers (50 miles)
farther east in the town of Vitoria.
	   In a communique published in Tuesday's edition of the radical
Basque newspaper Egin, ETA confirmed it was responsible for the
slayings and several other recent attacks.
	   Caballero and Parado were shot dead, the fourth and fifth
slayings attributed to ETA this year.
	   It is common for the separatists to wait several weeks before
taking responsibility for attacks via communiques sent to Egin.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed some 800 people in its 30-year campaign for
independence.

World Cup: Chile qualifies for second round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes, suspensions, TRIMS; optional upcoming
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Chile, withstanding a furious second-half
challenge and a disallowed goal by 10-man Cameroon, qualified for
the second round of the World Cup on Tuesday with a 1-1 draw.
	   The tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria, left
Italy atop Group B and Chile in second place. Chile, which
qualified with three consecutive draws, will face defending
champion Brazil in the second round Saturday in Paris.
	   ``I think it's going to be the most difficult challenge that we
could have faced,'' Chilean coach Nelson Acosta said. ``I can swear
to you that it will be a great game. We will play our hardest and
Brazil is going to have a tough time beating us.''
	   Chile last qualified for the second round when it played host to
the tournament in 1962, the only time it's ever won a World Cup
game. Chile was banned from qualifying in 1994 after a cheating
scandal during qualifying for the 1990 tournament.
	   ``Chile has qualified after many years of sacrifice,'' striker
Marcelo Salas said. ``You have to go through hardships. It really
is a dream for us.''
	   Before a colorful and overwhelmingly Chilean crowd at the Stade
de la Beaujoire, Jose Sierra's 30-meter curling free kick into the
top right corner of the net gave Chile the lead in the 31st minute
of a first half dominated by the South Americans.
	   And the second half appeared headed the same way when Cameroon's
best defender, Rigobert Song, given a red card in the 52nd minute
for elbowing Salas. Four years ago, Song became the youngest player
ever ejected from a World Cup game when he was sent off at the age
of 17 years, 358 days against Brazil.
	   But Patrick Mboma out-leaped Pedro Reyes to put home an 8-meter
header in the 56th minute to tie the game. Francois Omam Biyick
appeared to give the Indomitable Lions the lead two minutes later,
but his goal was disallowed when Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner
whistled Mboma for pushing Ronaldo Fuentes near the penalty area.
	   ``They said I commit the foul, but I didn't commit a foul,''
Mboma said. ``I can't believe it. It was an unjust decision. It was
very unjust.''
	   Cameroon's French coach, Claude Leroy, was even more blunt.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope (FIFA president
Sepp) Blatter was watching,'' Leroy said. ``There wasn't a shove or
a foul.
	   ``Perhaps the Figaro newspaper in France will complain I'm a
sore loser. I hope FIFA will discuss the issue of what happened
today. Perhaps he should listen to (local organizing head Michel)
Platini more often. Mr. Platini is the one who knows about
football. Perhaps (Blatter) should stick to administrative tasks.
	   ``I can accept a lot of things, but I can't accept that one. I'm
sorry we were eliminated, but especially on a decision that was an
incompetent one.''
	   It was the second disallowed goal of the game for Biyick, who
was offsides when he drilled a 20-meter shot home in the 35th
minute.
	   The finish made for heart-throbbing moments on the bench for
Chile, which blew late leads in both its previous games against
Italy and Austria.
	   ``We were afraid in the last few minutes that things would turn
against us as they did in the other two matches,'' Acosta said.
	   Cameroon, needing a win to advance, tried to keep up the attack
but Biyick's drive into the side of the net was closest thing to a
goal in the final 20 minutes.
	   Cameroon was reduced to nine men in the 88th minute when
Lavariano Etame was given a red card, with Salas again the victim
of the foul.
	   Chile will have three players suspended for the Brazil game.
Francisco Rojas, Nelson Parraguez and Moises Villarroel all
received their second yellow cards of the tournament.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bomb on a passenger train exploded
minutes after it left Jammu-Kashmir's winter capital on Tuesday,
derailing eight cars, a local news agency reported.
	   It was not immediately clear if any one was injured after the
bomb exploded near Bari Brahmana, 10 kilometers (six miles) south
of Jammu, Press Trust of India news agency reported.
	   The Shalimar Express was bound for New Delhi from Jammu, it
said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion.
	   Militants have been fighting Indian security forces since 1989
demanding freedom for Kashmir, where Muslims are in a majority.
Hindus account for 82 percent of India's nearly 1 billion
population.
	   In the past, police have blamed Muslim guerrillas for setting
off bombs in trains and buses in Kashmir as part of their violent
campaign.

Richardson says VX traces may set back Iraq's efforts to lift sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with UN comment
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A report that traces of the deadly nerve
gas agent VX were found on Iraqi warheads would _ if true _ deal a
severe setback to Iraq's efforts to lift crippling economic
sanctions, U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Tuesday.
	   U.S. and diplomatic sources confirmed Tuesday that chemical
analysis of Iraqi warheads handed over to the U.N. Special
Commission revealed traces of VX despite Baghdad's claims that it
never successfully manufactured weapons from the nerve gas agent.
	   The head of the commission, Richard Butler, is expected to
discuss the finding when he briefs the Security Council on
Wednesday.
	   ``If this allegation is correct ... that will set back Iraq's
efforts to try to lift sanctions,'' Richardson told reporters
Tuesday. ``It shows that they've been concealing, they've been
lying, and it calls into question their commitment to
disarmament.''
	   The Security Council has said it will not lift sanctions on Iraq
until Baghdad satisfies Butler's team that it has destroyed all
weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions were imposed on Iraq in
1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the
1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that the information on
VX is included in a confidential U.S. Army laboratory analysis of
warhead fragments taken from a pit at Taji, Iraq, in March.
	   Analyzed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, the samples
from the warhead fragments revealed ``significant amounts'' of VX
disulfide and stabilizer, the Post reported.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops of the nerve gas can
kill in minutes.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the Post report. They said Butler presented the Iraqis
with the findings during a meeting in Baghdad this month but that
the Iraqis rejected them.
	   In a report to the council June 16, Butler said he presented
Iraq with ``preliminary analysis of certain excavated remnants of
special missiles warheads'' but that Iraq ``rejected the
findings.''
	   The report did not specify VX, but diplomatic sources said that
was what Butler was referring to.
	   Both sides agreed to further technical meetings in Baghdad to
review the findings after the United Nations agreed to Iraq's
demands that the session include scientists from France, Russia and
China.
	   Those countries are the members of the Security Council most
sympathetic to Baghdad's position. Positions within the council are
so entrenched that several diplomats expressed doubt whether the
report would change any opinions, especially among the French,
Russians and Chinese.
	   U.N. officials, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they feared that instead of reacting negatively toward Iraq,
Baghdad's supporters on the Security Council would instead cite the
report as an example of political leaks by the special commission,
which is supposed to report only to the council.
	   The commission claims U-2 aircraft and other surveillance
provided by the United States are used by the United Nations
exclusively and the information is not passed directly to
Washington.
	   Iraq has demanded the United Nations stop using American U-2s on
the grounds Washington is exploiting the planes for
intelligence-gathering purposes.
	   ``I don't know how it leaked but clearly it was an evaluation
being done by a technical laboratory. The assumption is that those
people would have kept that information confidential until it could
have been released by Mr. Butler to the council,'' U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   He refused to say whether the report was accurate.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who has been spearheading a
campaign to ease U.N. pressure on Iraq, declined to comment in
detail on the allegation pending Butler's briefing.
	   British Ambassador John Weston said that if the report is
correct, ``that demonstrates precisely how far we have to go before
getting to the bottom of some of these problems'' with Iraqi
weapons.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
testified in the Supreme Court Tuesday that he had nothing to do
with the kidnapping of a French businessman in 1983 by the
notorious GAL death squad.
	   Twelve people, mostly former security officials and police, are
on trial accused of kidnapping Segundo Marey in the first violent
action blamed on the GAL, the Spanish initials for Anti-terrorist
Liberation Groups.
	   The prosecution contends the GAL was organized by Gonzalez's
government to combat the armed ETA Basque separatists.
	   The interior minister at the time, Jose Barrionuevo and his
deputy, Rafael Vera, are the only defendants who have denied all
charges of being involved with the kidnapping or GAL.
	   The other defendants in the trial that began on May 25 have
admitted to participating in the kidnapping and said it was
authorized by Barrionuevo and Vera. Some have testified that
Gonzalez knew what was going on.
	   The case is being tried in Supreme Court because it involves a
government minister.
	   Marey's kidnapping was the first violent action by the GAL,
which killed 27 people in its pursuit of ETA in southern France
between 1983 and 1987. Eight of those killed turned out to have no
ties to ETA, the Basque initials for Basque Homeland and Liberty.
	   During his three hours in the witness chair, Gonzalez said the
trial was part of a plot to bring up old issues to discredit his
Socialist party.
	   The 56-year-old politician said under oath he did not authorize,
order or have prior knowledge of the kidnapping. Prior witnesses,
including current Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos,
have testified Gonzalez was consulted before the kidnapping.
	   Gonzalez's seemingly invincible 13-year Socialist government
lost the 1995 elections to the conservative Popular party led by
current Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, partially because of the
GAL killings and government corruption scandals.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera are charged with kidnapping, belonging to
an armed group and misusing public funds. They face up to 23 years
in jail if convicted.
	   Gonzalez could be called again to testify in other GAL-related
cases currently under pretrial investigation in National Court.
	   Prosecutors are seeking dlrs 240,000 compensation for Marey, who
had been mistaken for an ETA hitman and was released unharmed after
being held for 10 days.

Russia can't meet 10-year deadline to destroy chemical weapons 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia cannot afford to meet its commitment to
destroy all its chemical weapons within the next 10 years, the
officer in charge of the project said Tuesday.
	   Russia has an estimated 44,000 tons of deteriorating chemical
weapons that it promised to destroy when it ratified the
international Chemical Weapons Convention last year.
	   ``We will need at least an additional five years to meet our
obligations under the convention,'' said Col. Gen. Stanislav
Petrov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry's radiation, chemical
and biological safety division.
	   ``Because of the absence of funds, Russia has not so far started
widescale destruction of its chemical arsenal,'' he told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Petrov said the United States and Germany are giving Russia
considerable help in destroying its stockpile of chemical weapons,
the largest in the world. Finland and Sweden have offered to help
monitoring the safe storage of the weapons.
	   ``However, we should harbor no illusions,'' Petrov said.
``...Foreign assistance may total no more than five percent of the
required amount.''
	   He said the program's total cost is 32.7 billion rubles (dlrs
5.36 billion).
	   Russia says it stopped producing chemical weapons in 1987.

Russian electrician paid in `tasteless artwork' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A paycheck isn't a museum piece in Russia yet. But
don't tell that to the electrician in Novomoskovsk.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, an electrician at a children's
recreation center in the central Russian city was paid his overdue
wages in what the news agency described Tuesday as ``a tasteless
artwork from the Soviet era.''
	   Worse, he apparently liked it.
	   According to the news agency, Gennady Gorbachev was given a
``worn-out'' gypsum statue called ``Pioneer'' in lieu of 300
rubles' (dlrs 50) wages that he earned while working part time at
the children's center last year.
	   Gorbachev _ apparently no relation to the former Soviet leader _
was later offered cash for the statue, but preferred to keep it,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Many Russians workers go months without pay, and many wind up
accepting goods instead of money.

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela takes first-class flight into trouble 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A flight from London to
Johannesburg has landed Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in trouble.
	   It began at the British Airways first-class check-in counter at
Heathrow Airport last week, when the former wife of President
Nelson Mandela prepared to board a flight with excess baggage.
	   When she was told she had to pay 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,666) for
the overweight, she responded that she had only one-third of the
money. Other passengers wound up chipping in the difference,
according to news reports.
	   After arriving in South Africa, she fired off a letter to the
airline, saying she had been travelling first-class on a diplomatic
passport and had expected ``treatment as this status befits.''
	   Opposition politicians began wondering why Madikizela-Mandela
had a diplomatic passport _ normally reserved for Cabinet
ministers, foreign ministry officials and senior government staff _
and threatened to raise the issue in Parliament.
	   On Tuesday, the foreign ministry said Madikizela-Mandela was no
longer entitled to use the passport, which had been issued to her
when she became Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology _ a post she was fired from three years ago.
	   ``We are in the process of writing her a letter, asking her to
return the passport,'' a ministry spokesman said.
	   In her letter to British Airways, Madikizela-Mandela demanded
her excess baggage costs be reimbursed so she could repay her
fellow passengers. An airline spokesman declined to comment pending
completion of an investigation into the whole affair.

Hingis, Novotna win first-round matches conform and trim AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: TOPS with Hingis, Novotna, Venus Williams victories; edits to
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Martina Hingis overcame the rain and a
tricky first-round test Tuesday to open defense of her Wimbledon
title with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Lisa Raymond.
	   The player Hingis beat in last year's final, No. 3 Jana Novotna,
advanced with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Sandra Kleinkova. And No. 6 Venus
Williams, a first-round loser in her Wimbledon debut last year,
downed Jana Nejedly, 6-3, 6-3, to join her sister Serena in round
two.
	   On a drizzly afternoon, the top-seeded Hingis survived a stiff
challenge from the 19th-ranked Raymond, one of only five players to
defeat the Swiss teen-ager last year.
	   Hingis said she was relieved just to get through.
	   ``I expected it to be tough,'' she said. ``She beat me last time
and I'm sure she had confidence. In the first couple of games, I
really didn't know what to do. ... I hope now it's going to be
easier for the next two our three rounds.''
	   Raymond and Hingis played a sparkling first set featuring
furious rallies and spectacular shots.
	   The American, who beat Hingis in three sets in their last
meeting in Zurich, kept Hingis at bay with a low-bouncing slice
backhand and a powerful forehand.
	   Raymond also took her chances to chip and charge to the net for
putaway volleys, often leaving Hingis shaking her head in
frustration.
	   ``Having beaten her before, I knew I had it in me,'' Raymond
said. ``I just didn't play the big points well. ... She comes up
with the big shots when she needs them.''
	   After Hingis broke for a 5-3 lead, Raymond responded by breaking
back for 5-4 and saving two set points in the next game to draw
even at 5-5.
	   Raymond could have taken control of the set when she earned a
break point in the next game. But Hingis held for 6-5 and broke in
the next game to finish the set in 52 minutes.
	   Drizzle then stopped play with Hingis leading 2-1 in the second
set. When play resumed 90 minutes later, Hingis ran off three
straight games for 5-1.
	   Though Raymond saved three match points in the seventh game and
held serve for 5-3, Hingis closed out the match in the next game.
	   After a rain-free opening day, showers and drizzle disrupted
play Tuesday. Play started more than three hours late on some
courts, and all doubles matches were canceled.
	   In men's play, No. 2 Marcelo Rios was due to play Francisco
Clavet. No. 4 Greg Rusedski, No. 5 Carlos Moya, No. 6 Patrick
Rafter and No. 9 Richard Krajicek were also to play.
	   Just being back at Wimbledon was enough to bring Steffi Graf to
tears.
	   A year ago, the seven-time champion was recovering from major
knee surgery. Two months ago, her comeback threatened by more
injuries, she considered retirement.
	   So on Monday, after winning her first-round match in straight
sets on Centre Court, Graf was overcome by emotion. Twice during a
news conference, she broke down crying.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' said Graf, playing her 13th Wimbledon. ``It's just special
to be here.''
	   Graf's tears represented a remarkable display from a player who
has rarely expressed her emotions on or off the court.
	   She said she was surprised to be on Centre Court, the scene of
her greatest triumphs, for the opening match against Spain's Gala
Leon Garcia.
	   ``It is not common to play the first match on Centre Court
unless you win the year before, so I didn't take it as normal at
all,'' she said. ``I got really excited, and it definitely pumped
me up to be playing out there.''
	   After some initial nerves, the German star settled down and beat
Garcia 6-4, 6-1, a solid start to her first Grand Slam tournament
since the French Open in 1997.
	   After undergoing surgery after the French, Graf didn't return to
tournament play until March. But she was sidelined again with calf
and hamstring injuries.
	   That's when she started wondering whether her career was over.
	   ``There have been a couple of occasions where it has been really
difficult, seven or eight weeks ago was the last time,'' she said.
``I had so many little injuries and every week something else came
around.''
	   But Graf, who said she now feels ``100 percent,'' must be
considered a title contender.
	   ``There is no question it is my favorite tournament and I do
feel the grass suits my game and experience does help,'' she said.
``But winning is a long way. That is not as far as I am looking
now.''

Ukrainian president raises minimum wage, oil taxes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT figure to nearly 400 million hryvna.
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma raised
the minimum wage and increased oil excise taxes Tuesday, part of a
program to stabilize Ukraine's shaky financial and social
situation.
	   Kuchma began issuing economic decrees last week, saying Ukraine
could face a full-blown economic crisis while parliament was
preoccupied with infighting and could not adopt the necessary
measures.
	   ``This is not a temporary campaign but planned work,'' Kuchma
said of his decrees Tuesday, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The president raised the minimum monthly wage in Ukraine by 10
hryvna (dlrs 5) to 55 hryvna (dlrs 27.5). Although few people are
paid so little, the figure is used to calculate various payments
across the economy.
	   The government said the increase would cost it nearly 400
million hryvna (dlrs 200 million), which would be taken into
account when budget figures for the second half of 1998 are
revised, Interfax said.
	   The government recently approved a cut in the budget deficit to
fulfill a demand from the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine is
currently talking to the IMF about a dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
	   The measure has yet to be approved by the new, largely leftist
parliament. Kuchma said he might introduce it by decree, but voiced
hope that parliament _ which has been unable to elect a speaker
since early May _ would finally start acting.
	   ``Joint work and results would be welcome in Ukraine instead of
arguments, at which we were so successful over the past two
years,'' said the president, whose attempts at reforms have been
stalled by the legislature.
	   A separate decree Tuesday raised excise taxes for gas and diesel
fuel by as much as five times.
	   Also Tuesday, an aide to Kuchma said a decision last week to set
up a single agricultural production tax and restructure
agricultural debts would ease the tax pressure on Ukrainian farmers
and boost investments.
	   The measures canceled a 143 million hryvna (dlrs 71.5 million)
debt in fines accumulated by agricultural enterprises and
restructured a 3.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.65 billion) debt in tax
and other budgetary payments.
	   That means 90 percent of debtors' frozen bank accounts will be
freed, said Kuchma's deputy administration chief, Pavlo Gaidutsky.
	   The single tax rate of about 40 hryvna (dlrs 20) a year per
hectare (2.47 acres) of farm land would reduce farmers' tax burden
by about 28 percent a year. That should make agriculture more
attractive for investors, Gaidutsky said, according to Interfax.
	   Gaidutsky indicated, however, that the measures would not yield
immediate results. He said the gross agricultural product this year
is expected to remain at the 1997 level.
	   Nearly 90 percent of Ukraine's agriculture enterprises lost
money last year, he said.

Italian chamber debates NATO expansion; vote is touch-and-go could meet with Prodi, Berlusconi saying position unchanged, centrists saying they'd vote yes; EDITS to conform and tighten, ADDS byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UDPATES with debate resuming hour later so Berlusconi's group
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi called on lawmakers Tuesday to
put aside partisan differences and endorse NATO's eastward
expansion, but the conservative opposition was unbudging, insisting
on the premier's resignation as the price of their votes.
	   ``We're sticking to our position,'' said Giuseppe Pisanu, the
Chamber of Deputies whip for ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza
Italia party, after the opposition had a last-minute meeting with
Prodi.
	   However, centrists who had been waffling about their vote
indicated after meeting with Prodi that they would vote ``yes.''
Their votes could prove to be decisive if the conservatives refuse
to back the NATO vote.
	   Italy, like the other 15 NATO members and the three new members,
must approve enlargement for expansion to take place, but the NATO
treaty can be put up for another vote in six months should the
Chamber fail to approve it.
	   No time was set for the vote, but it was expected for sometime
Tuesday night.
	   Debate was broken off for several hours as Italy watched their
soccer team beat Austria in Paris in the World Cup.
	   Resumption of the session was then delayed an hour to give
politicians, after consulting with Italy's head of state, President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, to meet with Prodi, as well.
	   Prodi, returning to the Chamber after the break, renewed his
appeal to all political forces to approve NATO's inclusion of the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland ``so that Italy can meet its
international commitments.''
	   In the morning, Prodi told the chamber: ``We cannot reply with a
refusal to this request from eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he
said, asking the entire Chamber of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the
name of the Italian people.''
	   The upper chamber, the Senate, where Prodi's center-left Olive
Tree coalition has a majority, has already approved NATO's
enlargement.
	   Prodi's center-left government was forced to reach out to the
opposition in the Chamber because its usual ally, the Communists,
oppose NATO's expansion.
	   The government appeared to secure the support it needed Monday
night when the center-right opposition decided to vote for NATO
enlargement.
	   But Berlusconi also called for Prodi to resign, saying a
government that needs opposition help on such a crucial foreign
policy issue lacks the backing to continue governing.
	   In his address to the Chamber of Deputies Tuesday, Prodi
rejected Berlusconi's call. ``The NATO vote doesn't put the
majority at stake; the government will go on with its program,'' he
said.
	   The reaction was swift and harsh.
	   Opposition whip Pisanu blasted Prodi for his ``arrogant
challenge'' and said the center-right might now vote against
ratification.
	   Despite the parliamentary fireworks, the NATO spat did not
appear to be a serious threat to the government since the
Communists have said they'll support Prodi if it boils down to a
confidence vote.

Former Spanish prime minister says he knew nothing about GAL kidnapping 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez testified before the Supreme Court Tuesday that he had
nothing to do with the kidnapping of a French businessman in 1983
by the GAL death squad.
	   Twelve people, mostly former security officials and police, are
on trial accused of kidnapping Segundo Marey in the first violent
action blamed on the GAL, the Spanish initials for Anti-terrorist
Liberation Groups.
	   The prosecution contends that the illegal group was organized by
Gonzalez's government to combat the armed ETA Basque separatists.
	   The interior minister at the time, Jose Barrionuevo and his
deputy, Rafael Vera, are the only defendants who have denied all
charges of being involved with the kidnapping or GAL.
	   The other defendants in the trial that began on May 25 have
admitted to participating in the kidnapping and said it was
authorized by Barrionuevo and Vera. Some have testified that
Gonzalez knew what was going on.
	   The case is being tried in Supreme Court because it involves a
government minister.
	   Marey's kidnapping was the first violent action by the GAL,
which killed 27 people in its pursuit of ETA members in southern
France between 1983 and 1987. Eight of those killed turned out to
have no ties to the ETA, the Basque initials for Basque Homeland
and Liberty.
	   During his three hours in the witness chair, Gonzalez said the
trial was part of a plot to bring up old issues to discredit his
Socialist party.
	   The 56-year-old politician said he did not authorize, order or
have prior knowledge of the kidnapping. Prior witnesses, including
current Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos, have
testified Gonzalez was consulted before the kidnapping.
	   Gonzalez's seemingly invincible 13-year Socialist government
lost the 1995 elections to the conservative Popular party led by
current Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, partially because of the
GAL killings and government corruption scandals.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera are charged with kidnapping, belonging to
an armed group and misusing public funds. They face up to 23 years
in jail if convicted.
	   Gonzalez could be called again to testify in other GAL-related
cases currently under pretrial investigation in National Court.
	   Prosecutors are seeking dlrs 240,000 compensation for Marey, who
had been mistaken for an ETA hitman and was released unharmed after
being held for 10 days.

Edwards departs Bradford Bulls 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRADFORD, England (AP) _ Former British Lions rugby league
scrum-half Shaun Edwards has played his last game for reigning
Super League champions Bradford Bulls.
	   Bulls officials revealed Tuesday the club was dropping Edwards,
who is eight months into his two-year contract.
	   The test veteran joined Bradford last October after a brief
stint with London Broncos but has been plagued by injuries since
his move north.
	   Bulls media manager Stuart Duffy confirmed Edwards would be
leaving the club.
	   He said the Bulls would release details of his departure after a
board meeting Tuesday night.
	   ``It just hasn't worked out, no matter how hard (Edwards) tried.
It is best for both the club and the player.''
	   Edwards rose to fame during a 14-season stint with Wigan.
	   He was the only player to figure in all 42 of Wigan's record run
of unbeaten Challenge Cup games and was recently installed in the
Wigan Hall of Fame.
	   In 1985 he became the youngest player ever to represent Britain
in a test when he won the first of his 36 caps.

Wife defends Banana on sexual assault charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Former President Canaan Banana,
testifying Tuesday in his trial on sexual assault charges, denied
she knew of his alleged homosexuality and said their 37-year
marriage was a happy one.
	   The state alleges Banana lured soldiers, aides and security men
to his room for sex and had them punished if they rejected his
advances. He is on trial on 11 charges of sodomy and homosexual
assault. Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe, where President
Robert Mugabe has waged a campaign against gay rights.
	   Banana, a 62-year-old Methodist minister, theology professor and
former diplomat, says he's innocent.
	   Janet Banana, testifying in her husband's defense, denied
allegations by state witnesses that she intervened after Banana
scuffled with male staffers at their official presidential
residence.
	   The couple married in 1961 and have four adult children.
	   ``Our marriage has been a happy one,'' she told Judge Godfrey
Chidyausiku.
	   She denied testimony that a police aide, Jefta Dube, dined with
the couple at their official residence. Allegations of Banana's
predatory homosexuality emerged last year when Dube was sentenced
to 10 years imprisonment for shooting to death a colleague who had
taunted him about his homosexual relationship with Banana.
	   Banana served as titular president after independence in 1980
until 1987, when Mugabe became executive president.

India wants to buy used Russian weapons 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ India wants to buy second-hand Russian air defense
weapons for training purposes, the Interfax news agency reported
Tuesday.
	   ``We are currently considering several offers from India to
acquire for training purposes air defense equipment that is at
storehouses, in arsenals and in some cases that have already been
used,'' said Nikolai Mikhailov, the first deputy defense minister.
	   Any such weapons would be brought up to ``absolutely serviceable
condition,'' but their price would be lower than new weapons,
Mikhailov said. He said profits from such sales would go toward
reforms in Russia's armed forces.
	   India is one of Russia's biggest arms customers.

Italian centrists agree to give what could be key vote on NATO could give Prodi majority 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS to reflect centrists' announcement of favorable vote
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After Premier Romano Prodi called on lawmakers twice
Tuesday to put aside partisan differences and endorse NATO's
eastward expansion, centrists agreed to vote yes, apparently
allowing him to muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   The centrist votes appeared to be the swing ones after the
conservative opposition led by ex-Premier Romano Prodi insisted
after meeting privately with Prodi that they would only vote yes if
Prodi agreed to resign.
	   And Prodi gave no indication he would give into the
conservatives' demands.
	   However, centrists who had been waffling about their vote told
the Chamber after meeting with Prodi that they would vote ``yes.''

Chile rises from disgrace to second round in nine years WILL be UPDATED with late games. 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: NEW throughout with Tuesday's early games, other developments;
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ From disgrace to the second round.
	   Barred from the 1990 and 1994 championships and shamed because
of a cheating scandal during qualifying for Italy '90, Chile joined
the world's elite 16 on Tuesday, drawing 1-1 with Cameroon and
slipping into the second round of the World Cup without a victory.
	   It qualified as the second-placed team in Group B and earned a
meeting with Brazil on Saturday in Paris.
	   As expected, Italy won the group, beating Austria 2-1 in
Saint-Denis at the same time Chile was celebrating its advancement.
Italy was to find out its second-round opponent later Tuesday when
all four Group A teams played.
	   Brazil took on Norway in Marseille and Scotland played Morocco
in Saint-Etienne.
	   Chile's berth in the second round, earned with draws against
Italy (2-2) and Austria (1-1) bought the number of teams to clinch
places to eight. And with the possible exception of the
celebrations that surrounded debutante Croatia's qualification,
none has been appreciated more.
	   ``Chile has qualified after many years of sacrifice,'' striker
Marcelo Salas said. ``You have to go through hardships. It really
is a dream for us.''
	   Chile was soccer's pariah in 1989, humiliated when its
goalkeeper Roberto Rojas cut himself when a flare was thrown near
him during a Sept. 3 match in Rio de Janeiro. Losing 1-0, Chile
walked off the field in protest in the 65th minute, carring Rojas
on a stretcher.
	   A subsequent investigation found Rojas faked the injury and FIFA
barred him from playing at the national level for life. It barred
Chile from the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, banned coach Orlando
Aravena and issued lesser sanctions to several other officials and
players.
	   Qualifying for the World Cup finals was greeted with celebration
in Santiago last year, but the second round was even more glorious.
	   In Nantes, Jose Sierra's 30-meter curling free kick in the 31st
minute was all Chile needed for the draw, but despite having a man
advantage for the final 38 minutes and a two-man advantage after
the 89th, it had to hang on for the point.
	   Patrick Mboma tied it for Cameroon on a header four minutes
after Rigobert Song was ejected for elbowing Salas. Cameroon, the
darlings of the 1990 World Cup who failed miserably four years
later, continued to push and had a game-winning goal by Francois
Omam Biyick disallowed in the 58th because of a pushing foul.
	   Losing gracefully apparently was not a trait of Cameroon's
French coach, Claude Leroy.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope (FIFA president
Sepp) Blatter was watching,'' Leroy said. ``There wasn't a shove or
a foul.
	   ``Perhaps the Figaro newspaper in France will complain I'm a
sore loser. I hope FIFA will discuss the issue of what happened
today. Perhaps he should listen to (local organizing head Michel)
Platini more often. Mr. Platini is the one who knows about
football. Perhaps (Blatter) should stick to administrative tasks.
	   ``I can accept a lot of things, but I can't accept that one. I'm
sorry we were eliminated, but especially on a decision that was an
incompetent one.''
	   Chile's victory came with a price. Yellow cards to Nelson
Parraguez, Francisco Rojas and Moises Villarroel _ all in a
16-minute span during the second half _ will mean Chile will have
to do without them against Brazil.
	   ``I think it's going to be the most difficult challenge that we
could have faced,'' Chilean coach Nelson Acosta said. ``I can swear
to you that it will be a great game. We will play our hardest and
Brazil is going to have a tough time beating us.''
	   In Saint-Denis, Italy used its deep well of strikers to advance,
getting a fourth goal from Christian Vieri and a second from
Roberto Baggio to eliminate Austria.
	   After being fouled, Alessandro Del Piero bent a free kick from
the left side of the penalty area into the goal box, where Vieri
ran through to knock it in in the 49th minute.
	   Baggio, who replaced Del Piero in the 73rd minute, secured the
match in the 90th, latching onto a cross from Filippo Inzaghi, who
replaced Vieri in the 60th, and tapping it into the net.
	   ``It is good to have two great strikers on the substitutes'
bench,'' said Italian coach Cesare Maldini. ``I am happy to have
avoided Brazil in the next round, but I want to enjoy our victory
and not think too much about the next match.''
	   Andreas Herzog gave Austria its only goal on a penalty, the
third time in as many games the central Europeans had scored in
injury time.
	   Elsewhere at the World Cup, a police officer beaten Sunday by
German fans remained in a coma and his recovery prospects looked no
better.
	   A second suspect was identified and judicial officials said the
man was among 15 Germans already detained for suspected involvement
in the melee.

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Chile, withstanding a furious second-half
challenge and a disallowed goal by 10-man Cameroon, qualified for
the second round of the World Cup on Tuesday with a 1-1 draw.
	   The tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria, left
Italy atop Group B and Chile in second place. Chile, which
qualified with three consecutive draws, will face defending
champion Brazil in the second round Saturday in Paris.
	   ``I think it's going to be the most difficult challenge that we
could have faced,'' Chilean coach Nelson Acosta said. ``I can swear
to you that it will be a great game. We will play our hardest and
Brazil is going to have a tough time beating us.''
	   Chile last qualified for the second round when it played host to
the tournament in 1962, the only time it's ever won a World Cup
game. Chile was banned from qualifying in 1994 after a cheating
scandal during qualifying for the 1990 tournament.
	   ``Chile has qualified after many years of sacrifice,'' striker
Marcelo Salas said. ``You have to go through hardships. It really
is a dream for us.''
	   Before a colorful and overwhelmingly Chilean crowd at the Stade
de la Beaujoire, Jose Sierra's 30-meter curling free kick into the
top right corner of the net gave Chile the lead in the 21st minute
of a first half dominated by the South Americans.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ On her first official visit to Cuba, Mexican
Foreign Secretary Rosario Green met with Fidel Castro in a six-hour
session covering several topics, including the communist island's
chances to eventually rejoin the Organization of American States.
	   Green told reporters that during the meeting, which ended early
Tuesday, she and the Cuban president also spoke of their two
countries' relations, Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency reported.
	   In 1962, OAS members voted to expel Cuba, saying its adherence
to communism was ``incompatible with the inter-American system.''
Mexico and five other nations abstained.
	   Green told Castro that Mexico would suggest OAS
Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria of Colombia organize a group to
examine the matter, the Mexican government news agency Notimex
said.
	   However, she said, the question is not one of great concern to
Castro and any effort by Mexico to promote Cuba's inclusion would
come only after consulting with the Cubans, Notimex said. The
United States has said it would oppose Cuba's readmission to the
OAS.
	   Green said that the meeting at the Palace of the Revolution
showed Castro to be a ``man of great personal stature,'' Notimex
said.
	   Castro ``is a universal man, with knowledge of everything. But I
discovered that he has a mathematical mind,'' Green said, noting
that he made frequent statistical references.
	   Cuba's Vice President Carlos Lage and Foreign Secretary Roberto
Robaina also attended the session, along with Mexican Ambassador
Pedro Joaquin Coldwell and Mexican Deputy Foreign Secretary Carlos
de Icaza.
	   Mexico is one of the few countries in the Americas that
maintained relations with Cuba despite pressure from the United
States. Noting this history, Green on Monday discarded any
suggestions that her visit could provoke conflict with Washington.
	   Green, who was appointed foreign secretary in January, is making
a two-day visit to discuss the two nations' cultural and
educational programs, economics, immigration and tourism, Prensa
Latina said.
	   Notimex reported Tuesday that Cuba and Mexico have agreed to
increase tourism in the Caribbean by increasing flights between
Havana and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
	   It said officials from the two countries also would discuss
their efforts to fight drug trafficking and would sign an agreement
to promote and protect commercial investments.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German politicians called for tighter
controls on soccer hooligans Tuesday, two days after a German thug
beat a French policeman comatose outside a World Cup match.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told a radio station that he
supports a proposal by Manfred von Richthofen, president of the
German Sports Federation, to set up a data bank on known soccer
hooligans.
	   ``What has happened shows that we must now do everything, and I
mean everything, to prevent something like that happening in the
future ... They are troublemakers and their activity must be
stopped,'' Kinkel told the Berlin station 100.6.
	   Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover, has been arrested in France for
attacking the police officer Sunday while Germany played Yugoslavia
to a 2-2 draw.
	   A second German arrested in the case was later identified by
prosecutors as Karl-Heinz Elschner, 27, who also resides in
Hanover. He is said to have been banned from the soccer stadium in
Duesseldorf for past violence there.
	   Warnecke owns a tattoo and body-piercing parlor in a Hanover
neighborhood. In an apparent sign of disgust, someone shattered the
parlor window with a rock late Monday.

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela takes first-class flight into trouble 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The foreign ministry said
Tuesday it will tell Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to surrender her
diplomatic passport following a troublesome airline flight from
London to Johannesburg.
	   That she regularly used the passport, even though she no longer
was supposed to have it, wasn't an issue until she fired off a
letter to British Airways, complaining that she had been forced to
pay 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,666) in excess baggage costs for last
week's flight.
	   The former wife of President Nelson Mandela told the airline she
had been travelling first-class on a diplomatic passport and had
expected ``treatment as this status befits.''
	   Opposition politicians heard of the dispute, and wondered why
Madikizela-Mandela had a diplomatic passport _ normally reserved
for Cabinet ministers, foreign ministry officials and senior
government staff.
	   On Tuesday, the foreign ministry said the passport had been
issued to Madikizela-Mandela when she became Deputy Minister of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology _ a post she was fired from
three years ago. The ministry said she was no longer entitled to
use the passport.
	   ``We are in the process of writing her a letter, asking her to
return the passport,'' a ministry spokesman said.
	   In her letter to British Airways, Madikizela-Mandela demanded
her excess baggage costs be reimbursed. Apparently, she only had
enough money at Heathrow Airport to pay one-third of the costs and
other passengers chipped in the rest.
	   Madikizela-Mandela said she wanted the money back so she could
repay her fellow travellers.
	   An British Airways spokesman declined to comment pending
completion of an investigation into the whole affair.

NATO expected to step up planning for Kosovo with Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies are expected Wednesday
to task their military to intensify planning for possible armed
intervention to stop the violence in Kosovo.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization met at NATO headquarters Tuesday to review the state
of military planning and will continue their talks Wednesday.
	   The planners are focusing on the possible use of NATO air power
to deter the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from
continuing a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist
Serbian province.
	   Plans include possible strikes against Serbian air defenses and
other targets both inside Kosovo and in the rest of Yugoslavia.
	   Ahead of Wednesday's meeting of ambassadors, NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana was scheduled to hold talks at alliance
headquarters with the Ibrahim Rugova, a leader of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo.
	   Earlier this month, NATO defense ministers ordered their
planners to start preparing a range of military options to end the
conflict in Kosovo which has killed more than 300 people.
	   The ambassadors are expected to ask the military to move to the
next, more detailed phase of planning, NATO officials said.
	   The planners are looking at three categories of possible action:
intensification of NATO maneuvers and advisory missions to Kosovo's
neighbors, Macedonia and Albania; deployment of NATO troops to
those nations to prevent the violence spreading; armed
intervention, including air strike or, as a last resort, ground
troops.
	   NATO officials stressed the threat of intervention was aimed to
stop fighting both by Serbian troops and the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.

World Cup: Chile qualifies for second round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: optional
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Chile was shouting in joy. Cameroon was
just plain screaming.
	   Chile, withstanding a furious second-half challenge, qualified
for the World Cup's second round for the first time in 38 years by
tying Cameroon 1-1 Tuesday. But the only reason the Chileans
advanced to a second-round matchup with Brazil was a botched call
by the referee, who disallowed a goal because of a foul that didn't
appear to happen.
	   ``I can accept a lot of things, but I can't accept that one,''
Cameroon coach Claude Le Roy said. ``I'm sorry we were eliminated,
especially on a decision that was an incompetent one.''
	   Before a colorful and overwhelmingly Chilean crowd at the Stade
de la Beaujoire, Jose Sierra put Chile ahead with an outstanding
30-meter free kick in the 21st minute that went over a five-man
defensive wall and curled into the top right corner of the net.
	   Cameroon, needing a victory to advance, played a man short after
Rigobert Song was ejected carded in the 52nd minute for a flagrant
elbow on star forward Marcelo Salas, then came back to tie the
score four minutes later when Patrick Mboma outleaped Pedro Reyes
and beat goalkeeper Nelson Tapia on a header from 8 meters out.
	   Francois Omam Biyick appeared to give the Indomitable Lions the
lead two minutes later after Mboma beat Ronaldo Fuentes on a header
and flicked the ball ahead. But Omam Biyick's apparent goal was
disallowed when Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner whistled Mboma,
claiming he pushed Fuentes on the header.
	   ``They said I committed the foul, but I didn't commit a foul,''
Mboma said. ``I can't believe it. It was an unjust decision. It was
very unjust.''
	   Cameroon officials screamed at Vagner as he walked off the
field, and Le Roy launched into repeated verbal attacks on FIFA
president Sepp Blatter _ who was at the game. Last week, FIFA told
referees to clamp down and call more red cards, telling them to
eject players for any tackle from behind.
	   Le Roy criticized Blatter for his lack of football knowledge,
saying Blatter should turn over decisions about playing the game to
Michel Platini, a Blatter supporter who heads the French World Cup
organizers.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope Mr. Blatter was
watching,'' Le Roy said. ``There wasn't a shove or a foul.
	   ``Perhaps the Figaro newspaper in France will complain I'm a
sore loser. I hope FIFA will discuss the issue of what happened
today. Perhaps he should listen to Mr. Platini more often. Mr.
Platini is the one who knows about football. Perhaps he should
stick to administrative tasks.''
	   It was the second disallowed goal of the game for Biyick, who
was offsides when he connected on a 20-meter shot in the 35th
minute. He also sent a drive into the side of the net in the 74th
minute, the closest the Indomitable Lions came to a goal after the
controversial call.
	   The finish made for heart-throbbing moments on the bench for
Chile, which blew late leads in both its previous games against
Italy and Austria. The Chileans last advanced out of the first
round in 1962, when they were host of the tournament and finished
third.
	   ``We were afraid in the last few minutes that things would turn
against us as they did in the other two matches,'' Chile coach
Nelson Acosta said.
	   The tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria, left
Italy atop Group B and Chile in second place. Chile, which
qualified with three consecutive draws, was banned from the last
World Cup after goalkeeper Roberto Rojas faked an injury during a
1989 qualifier against Brazil, and the world champions are an
overwhelming favorite to win Saturday's game in Paris.
	   ``I think it's going to be the most difficult challenge that we
could have faced,'' Acosta said. ``I can swear to you that it will
be a great game. We will play our hardest and Brazil is going to
have a tough time beating us.''
	   Chile will be missing three players suspended for the Brazil
game because Francisco Rojas, Nelson Parraguez and Moises
Villarroel all received their second yellow cards of the
tournament.
	   Song, who four years ago became the youngest player ever ejected
from a World Cup game when he was sent off at the age of 17 years,
358 days against Brazil, wasn't the only Cameroonian ejected.
Lavriano Etame got a red card in the 88th for stomping on Salas.
	   While Cameroon complained, joyous Chileans sang outside the
stadium. Even though it was a tie, Chile considered it a win.
	   ``Chile has qualified after many years of sacrifice,'' Salas
said. ``You have to go through hardships. It really is a dream for
us.''

Russian companies seeking business under oil-for-food plan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian companies have signed contracts with
Iraq's national oil company for 94 million barrels of oil under the
oil-for-food deal, the Interfax news agency said Tuesday.
	   The program, an exception to United Nations sanctions imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait, allows Iraq to sell dlrs 5.25 billion
worth of oil every six months to buy food and humanitarian
supplies.
	   Zarubezhneft, the Russian company coordinating purchases of
Iraqi oil, said it and Lukoil each signed contracts for 18 million
barrels. Several other companies agreed to purchase smaller
amounts.

Armenian president tries to calm storm over Nagorno-Karabakh 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Armenian president tried Tuesday to settle a
storm over remarks by his foreign minister that were interpreted as
threatening the annexation of the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Speaking in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, President Robert
Kocharian said he still believed there were legal grounds for
annexation, but that he was prepared to negotiate the territory's
future with Azerbaijan.
	   ``Armenia does not reject a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh
problem, and hopes that the negotiating process will lead to a
solution acceptable to all parties in the conflict,'' he said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated
largely by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in early 1988
and drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   Azerbaijan still claims the territory as its own, although
Nagorno-Karabakh largely conducts its affairs as if it were
independent.
	   Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian said Thursday that if
Azerbaijan refuses to change its stance in the next few years,
Armenia may decide to support Nagorno-Karabakh's requests for union
with Armenia.
	   Some reports interpreted that as a threat to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh if Azerbaijan refuses to budge. Oskanian denied
that was his intent.
	   ``I do not think that what Oskanian had to say ... was a
provocation,'' Kocharian said Tuesday, according to Interfax. ``He
was just speaking of possible developments.''

High-speed rail link to Heathrow airport opens Underground cost 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to include price of Heathrow Express ticket vs.
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ High-speed trains began carrying passengers
between central London and Heathrow airport Tuesday, offering an
alternative to congested highways and slow-moving Underground
trains.
	   ``It's a stunning service,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said as
he officially opened the 17-mile (27-kms), 450-million-pound (dlrs
750 million) Heathrow Express service.
	   It offers trains every 15 minutes between Heathrow and
Paddington station, with top speeds of 160 kph (100 mph) during the
15-minute journey.
	   A one-way ticket costs 10 pounds (dlrs 16.70), as opposed to a
one-way Underground ticket from central London, which costs 3.30
pounds (dlrs 5.50) for a journey that takes about 45 minutes.
	   BAA PLC, the company which operates Heathrow, says it hopes that
the service will attract 7 million passengers per year within three
years.
	   Heathrow was the last of London's major airports to get rail
service to London, although it is connected to the London
Underground system. Gatwick airport is served by two rail lines
from south London, and the new Stansted airport also has frequent
train service from Liverpool St. station.
	   ``The Heathrow Express will transform people's first impressions
of London. We don't want their first experience to be the worst
aspects of Tube travel,'' Blair said, referring to the Underground
service.

Newspaper: George Orwell provided government with list of Soviet sympathizers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ George Orwell, the author who warned the world
about Big Brother and the Thought Police, provided a list of
``crypto-communists'' to a Foreign Office anti-communist propaganda
unit in his role as a government informant, a newspaper says.
	   The list will be published next week for the first time as part
of a new 20-volume edition of Orwell's work and includes well-known
literary and political figures such as the poet Stephen Spender,
Charlie Chaplin and George Bernard Shaw, the Daily Telegraph
reported.
	   Orwell was revealed as a government informant two years ago when
government archives released documents from the period to the
Public Record Office in Kew, bringing them into the public domain.
The documents showed that the man regarded by many as a socialist
icon had provided the government with the names of potential Soviet
sympathizers to help it counter Soviet propaganda.
	   What is new is the list. Arranged alphabetically in a small blue
notebook, it contains more than 130 names of famous and obscure
people and includes Orwell's notes judging the weakness of
individual characters, the Daily Telegraph reported Monday. The
names of three dozen people who are still alive have been witheld,
it added.
	   The list was one of the last things Orwell wrote before he died
from tuberculosis in 1950. The previous year, he handed another
list containing 35 of the names to his friend Celia Kirwan, who
worked for an anti-communist propaganda unit attached to the
Foreign Office, the Daily Telegraph said. Those names also remain
unclear.
	   Despite being a socialist, Orwell made clear in his novels
``1984'' _ where the oppressed masses of a future society are kept
in check by Big Brother and the Thought Police _ and ``Animal
Farm'' that he was opposed to totalitarianism in any form. He was
known to disagree with those on the Left who supported the Soviet
Union.
	   The list will appear in a collection of Orwell's work edited by
Prof. Peter Davison, a senior research fellow at De Montfort
University.
	   Orwell is frank _ and sometimes scathing _ in his appraisal of
those on the list. Wealthy bohemian Nancy Cunard is dismissed as
``probably only sentimental sympathizer. Silly. Has money,'' while
Labor lawmaker and Cabinet minister Richard Crossman earns the
description, ``Too dishonest to be outright F.T. (fellow
traveler).''
	   Shaw, he says, is untrustworthy because he is ``reliably
pro-Russian on all major issues.'' The writer J.B. Priestley is
``very anti-USA'' and ``makes huge sums of money in USSR.''
	   Celia Kirwan, now Celia Goodman, told the Daily Telegraph she
supported Orwell's actions.
	   ``I think George was quite right to do it,'' the newspaper
quoted her as saying. ``If George said these people were what he
said they were, I bet he knew. He wouldn't have said it otherwise.
So I think people should attach significance to this list.''

Couple unites Norway and Brazil before match between national sides AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Oivind Ekeland, a tall handsome
Norwegian, was playing football on the beach in Rio de Janeiro when
he caught the eye of Rosangela de Souza, a breathtaking girl from
Ipanema, straight out of the song. Something flashed.
	   Eight years later, on Tuesday night, Oivind and Rosangela were
married in the Stade Velodrome, moments before Brazil and Norway
played a World Cup match with an audience of millions of people.
	   ``The second I saw that woman I knew I wasn't leaving Rio
without her,'' Oivind remembers.
	   ``I knew immediately this was my Prince Charming, who had come
to take me away,'' Rosangela recalls.
	   He was 20, and she was 21. They stayed together for a few weeks
in Brazil, and then she went home to Stavanger, Norway, with him
for a few months. They went back to Rio together. She quit her job
as a dentist's receptionist. They've been together ever since.
	   Now they run the Beverly, a sports bar and restaurant in
Stavanger, with a 5-year-old daughter, Kristine. Last year, they
decided to tie the knot formally.
	   ``I love football,'' Oivind explained, ``and when we saw the
draw, that Brazil and Norway were playing in the World Cup, we knew
that was a sign.''
	   Besides, he added, June 23 is the Norwegians' beloved Midsummer
Night, when there is only an hour of darkness. It is the happiest
day of the year. Marseille, on the French coast, was a holiday
town. Everything was perfect.
	   Oivind wanted to ask FIFA, the World Cup organizer, for
permission to be married at the game.
	   ``We waited until May because we were nervous that they might
say no,'' he said. ``But when I called to explain, the woman
laughed and talked to the right people. A week later, we got a
letter saying it was okay.''
	   A pastor friend, Tore Thomassen, flew down from Stavanger with
30 of Oivind's pals, and his parents, to perform the marriage.
Rosangela's mother has died, and her father is sick, but her sister
came from Rio.
	   The wedding party started at the Sofitel Hotel, overlooking the
white yachts and ancient stone walls of the Old Port. A white
Cadillac convertible took them through the streets to the stadium.
	   Champagne and a fancy canapes were laid out in the VIP compound.
This would be a World Cup wedding to remember.
	   Rosangela wore a white dress with a train. Until he changed to a
tuxedo, Oivind was barefoot in Norwegian soccer shorts, a yellow
Brazil number 9 jersey with ``Ronaldo''' across the back, and a
black top hat.
	   ``The attraction was so strong on that beach in Rio that you
could feel it, like a bolt of magic'' said Geir Ekeland, Oivind's
cousin and best man. ``Everything suddenly stopped when they looked
at each other. It was unbelievable.''
	   Rosangela's reaction was clearly the same, he added. ``Just
watching her, I knew they'd be together the rest of their lives.''
	   The cousins had gone with their club team to play a friendly
game with Brazilians. Oivind at the time was studying economics,
but he played soccer every chance he got.
	   ``She now likes football as much as he does,'' Geir said.
``They'll probably eat and sleep football.''
	   But not before the honeymoon. Their wedding trip will be to
Paris for the World Cup final on July 12.

World Cup: FIFA changes scoring on two goals AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After further review, FIFA has changed the scoring
on a couple of goals in Germany's 2-2 tie with Yugoslavia.
	   Following what it called ``extensive studies of the video'' of
Sunday's game, FIFA's technical study group Tuesday decided that
Predrag Mijatovic _ not Dejan Stankovic _ will be given credit for
Yugoslavia's first goal in the 13th minute.
	   Also, Germany's first goal, originally credited to Michael
Tarnat on a deflected free kick in the 74th minute, was changed to
an own goal by Yugoslavia's Sinisa Mihajlovic.
	   Mihajlovic's own goal is the fourth of the tournament, tying the
World Cup record set in Switzerland in 1954.

NATO expected to step up planning for Kosovo With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies are expected this week
to ask their military to intensify planning for possible armed
intervention to stop the violence in Kosovo.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization met at NATO headquarters Tuesday to review the state
of military planning and will continue their talks Wednesday.
	   The planners are focusing on the possible use of NATO air power
to deter the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from
continuing a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist
Serbian province.
	   Plans include possible strikes against Serbian air defenses and
other targets both inside Kosovo and in the rest of Yugoslavia.
	   Ahead of Wednesday's meeting of ambassadors, NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana was scheduled to hold talks at alliance
headquarters with the Ibrahim Rugova, a leader of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo.
	   Earlier this month, NATO defense ministers ordered their
planners to start preparing a range of military options to end the
conflict in Kosovo which has killed more than 300 people.
	   The ambassadors are expected on Wednesday to ask the military to
move to the next, more detailed phase of planning, NATO officials
said.
	   The planners are looking at three categories of possible action:
intensification of NATO maneuvers and advisory missions to Kosovo's
neighbors, Macedonia and Albania; deployment of NATO troops to
those nations to prevent the violence spreading; armed
intervention, including air strike or _ as a last resort _ ground
troops.
	   NATO officials stressed the threat of intervention was aimed to
stop fighting both by Serbian troops and the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.

Russia calls changes to Latvian citizenship law minimal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Amendments to a controversial citizenship law
adopted by the Latvian parliament are only minimal changes, the
Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Latvian lawmakers approved an amendment Monday saying that all
children born in the country since it became independent in 1991
will be granted automatic citizenship, regardless of whether their
parents are citizens.
	   Latvia had granted citizenship only to those who lived there
before Latvia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and
to their descendants.
	   That left 700,000 people _ about one-third of the country _ as
stateless people. Most were ethnic Russians who were moved there
under Josef Stalin's Russification drive, and their descendants.
	   The citizenship law allowed the stateless people to apply for
naturalization, but only under a complicated system by which
younger people could apply first and the people who had lived in
Latvia the longest would have to wait the longest.
	   The policy caused friction between Latvia and Russia, which
threatened trade sanctions.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Makarov praised the abolition

were not a ``breakthrough.''
	   ``This was just some correction of undemocratic laws,'' he told
the Interfax news agency.

	   At the last minute waffling centrists decided to vote yes after
meeting with Prodi. A similar meeting with the bloc led by by
ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi failed to sway the conservatives from
their insistence that they would only vote yes if Prodi agreed to
resign.
	   The Senate, where Prodi has a majority, has already approved
ratification, which was required from all 16 NATO members and the
three new countries, for enlargement to take effect.
	   Debate was broken off for several hours as Italy watched their
soccer team beat Austria in Paris in the World Cup.
	   Prodi, returning to the Chamber after the break, renewed his
appeal to all political forces to approve NATO's inclusion of the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland ``so that Italy can meet its
international commitments.''
	   In the morning, Prodi told the chamber: ``We cannot reply with a
refusal to this request from eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he
said, asking the entire Chamber of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the
name of the Italian people.''
	   Prodi's center-left government was forced to reach out to the
opposition in the Chamber because its usual ally, the Communists,
oppose NATO's expansion.
	   The government appeared to secure the support it needed Monday
night when the center-right opposition decided to vote for NATO
enlargement.
	   But Berlusconi also called for Prodi to resign, saying a
government that needs opposition help on such a crucial foreign
policy issue lacks the backing to continue governing.
	   In his address to the Chamber of Deputies Tuesday, Prodi
rejected Berlusconi's call. ``The NATO vote doesn't put the
majority at stake; the government will go on with its program,'' he
said.
	   Despite the parliamentary fireworks, the NATO spat did not
appear to be a serious threat to the government since the
Communists have said they'll support Prodi if it boils down to a
confidence vote.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With tensions over Jerusalem at a boiling
point, a tour by Israeli lawmakers deteriorated into shouting
matches Tuesday, and an Israeli Arab legislator said Arabs who sell
land to Jews should be killed.
	   Israeli police opened an investigation of Salah Salim, a member
of Knesset from the Hadash Party, who said he was ``astounded that
Palestinians have stopped killing those who sell land to the
Jews.''
	   ``They should terminate them,'' he said.
	   Several Palestinians accused of selling land to Israelis were
murdered last year after the Palestinian justice minister said any
Arab who sold land to Israelis deserved the death penalty.
	   The legislators were touring an archaeological dig near Herod's
Gate in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's walled Old City. The
Jewish settler group Ateret Cohanim wants to build a new enclave at
the site, which is surrounded by Palestinian neighborhoods.
	   Ateret Cohanim is waging a campaign to move Jews into
Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods, often buying property in secret
through Palestinian land dealers. Palestinians say the campaign has
the support of the Israeli government and is pre-empting their
claims to east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967, as a
future capital.
	   Clashes broke out several weeks ago when Ateret Cohanim set up
pre-fabricated tin sheds overnight at the Herod's Gate site, which
it owns. The sheds were removed, and exploratory excavations _
required by Israeli law before any construction can be authorized _
began two weeks ago. The results of the excavations will determine
whether any building can be carried out there.
	   Gideon Avni, Jerusalem district archaeologist for Israel's
Antiquities Authority, said Tuesday that it would be ``many, many
months'' before the survey dig is completed and officials can
decide whether any construction could take place.
	   On Tuesday, tractors cleared away debris at the site, stirring
up centuries of chalky dust, and Jewish and Arab Israeli lawmakers
argued over competing claims to the ancient city.
	   ``Five thousand years there have been Jews here!'' shouted Rabbi
Benny Alon of the ultranationalist Moledet, or Homeland, party,
waving his finger in his colleagues' faces.
	   ``Arabs live here, why are you here?'' yelled back Salah Tarif,
an Arab legislator from Israel's opposition Labor Party.
	   Avni said preliminary digging had already turned up signs of
remains from the Ottoman, Crusader, Byzantine and Roman periods.
	   ``The implication is that the archaeological excavation of the
whole plot is going to be a very very long process,'' he said.
``We're speaking about many, many months of excavations.''
	   Avni said it was too early to predict prospects for building at
the site.
	   One possibility is that buildings could be erected above the
archaeological site, on stilts, as has been done in other parts of
the Old City. But Avni said any such buildings would still have to
be lower than the Old City walls, which range in height from five
to 15 meters (16 to 50 feet). Ateret Cohanim wants to build
high-rises there to house a Jewish seminary and dozens of families.
	   Taleb Elsana, a legislator from the Democratic Arab Party,
accused Ateret
	   Cohanim of stealing Palestinian land, and said the
archaeological dig was giving legitimacy to the group's actions.
	   Israeli police blocked representatives of the Orient House, the
PLO's unofficial headquarters in Jerusalem, from joining the
legislators on the tour.

Zhirinovksy proposes five-year ban on elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovksy
proposed Tuesday a five-year suspension of elections so that Russia
can concentrate on improving its economy.
	   ``We do not need the presidential or parliamentary elections
planned for 2000 and 1999 respectively,'' Zhirinovksy said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``It is necessary to make decisions, postpone elections, create
a single team, freeze all election campaigns for five years and
direct every effort toward the economy,'' said Zhirinovsky, who
placed fifth in the 1996 presidential election.
	   Zhirinovsky also called for the abolition of the upper house of
the Russian parliament, the Federation Council, which is made up
mostly of regional leaders.

By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Edging closer to calling a national referendum
on an Israeli West Bank troop withdrawal, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday he considered broad public consensus as
essential for any deal.
	   Palestinians however hinted that their patience was wearing
thin. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the Clinton
administration to step up pressure on Israel and go public with its
plan for a withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the appeal was contained
in a letter by Arafat to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
	   Arafat reminded Albright that in a phone call last month, she
assured him that her negotiations with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on a withdrawal would be completed within two weeks,
Erekat said.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is just wasting time, just stalling,'' the
Erekat said.
	   Albright has urged Netanyahu to make a decision quickly on a
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback that was first introduced
in January. However, Netanyahu has ignored informal U.S. deadlines
and the United States has taken no action.
	   Arafat's appeal came at a time when Netanyahu was considering
holding a non-binding referendum, or nationwide public opinion
poll, on the U.S. proposal. Such a referendum would delay a
withdrawal for at least two months because parliament would have to
pass special legislation first.
	   ``I think that the issue of reaching a broad public consensus is
not a joke, it is a very important and essential matter. I always
said I wanted the broadest consensus possible for the agreements
that I deliver,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Netanyahu met Tuesday with members of a committee he appointed
to research options for a referendum. Israel's Channel 2 TV said
Netanyahu could announce such a referendum as early as Wednesday.
	   Channel 2 said the voting would likely take place at Israeli
postal offices with every citizen receiving in the mail a copy of
an withdrawal agreement that Netanyahu supports and an electronic
voting card.
	   The idea was dismissed as a waste of time by Netanyahu's
opponents, as well as some of his allies, including Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   Jewish settlers who oppose any troop withdrawal from West Bank
land which they believe was promised to the Jews by God, began a
protest campaign outside Netanyahu's office against any deal.
	   Families pitched tents adorned with Israeli flags, hauled in
portable bathrooms and brought provisions to stay for at least one
month. Settlers said about 40 families would participate in the
sleep-over protest camp.
	   ``What we're saying here is, Bibi don't cross the line,'' said
settler leader Ahron Domb who referred to the prime minister by his
nickname.
	   In another development Tuesday, Israel and the Palestinians
engaged in a sharp exchange over Jerusalem, accusing each other of
violating an agreement not to make changes in the disputed city
until its future has been decided in peace negotiations.
	   Earlier this week, Israel's Cabinet approved a plan to extend
Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish West Bank
settlements, a step that falls short of annexation but strengthens
ties between the settlements and the city.
	   In response, the Palestinians turned to the U.N. Security
Council, requesting an urgent meeting on the Israeli plan which
they said was aimed at cementing Israeli rule over all of the city.
	   They also complained to the Security Council about the Israeli
demolition of five Arab homes outside the West Bank city of Hebron
it claimed were built illegally.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as a capital. Israel captured east
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, and has said it
would never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday defended the expansion plan, saying it did
not violate peace agreements and said a debate over the issue at
the United Nations would ``cause serious harm to the peace
process,'' Netanyahu said.

Hingis, Novotna win first-round matches AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with Williams quotes
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ On a drizzly afternoon, Martina Hingis
opened her Wimbledon title defense with a difficult victory over
Lisa Raymond, one of only five players to beat her last year.
	   Hingis, the top seed, defeated her 19th-ranked opponent 7-5, 6-3
in a match delayed because of rain.
	   ``I expected it to be tough,'' Hingis said. ``She beat me last
time and I'm sure she had confidence. In the first couple of games,
I really didn't know what to do. ... I hope now it's going to be
easier for the next two our three rounds.''
	   The player Hingis beat in last year's final, No. 3 Jana Novotna,
advanced with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Sandra Kleinova. And No. 6 Venus
Williams, a first-round loser in her Wimbledon debut last year,
downed Jana Nejedly 6-3, 6-3, to join her sister Serena in round
two.
	   Williams came within five minutes of being defaulted when she
turned up 10 minutes late. She thought the match was on Court 18
when, in fact, it was scheduled on Court 13.
	   ``I could never figure out where Court 13 was,'' she said.
	   Williams had more trouble finding the court than beating her
opponent. She was able to win by playing exclusively from the
baseline, shunning any attempt to serve and volley.
	   ``I wasn't really trying too many new things,'' she said. ``My
plan was more or less, make my shots and get off the court before
it rains.''

Illuminated 13th century prayer book fetches high price at auction 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An unidentified private collector paid 2.7 million
pounds (dlrs 4.3 million) on Tuesday for a 13th century prayer book
illuminated for a Crusader and carried by him when the Holy Land
fell to the Muslims _ the highest price paid for any French
manuscript, auctioneers Sotheby's said.
	   ``This is the first time that this book has appeared on the open
market since the 1280s and today's price is a triumph for the
Crusaders,'' said Dr. Christopher de Hamel, the manuscript
specialist who was in charge of the sale.
	   The Burdett Psalter is believed to have been commissioned by
Jean de Villiers, Grand Master of the Order of the Knights of St.
John. His portrait appears five times in the manuscript.
	   De Villiers led the siege of Acre in 1291 and, after it fell to
the Muslims, he escaped, badly wounded, to Cyprus, where he later
died. The manuscript is known to have reached eastern England by
about 1300 and probably belonged to the Muchensey, a baronial
family. It was passed on to the Hutton family and in 1634 was given
to Jane Burdett, from whom it takes its name.
	   The manuscript remained in her family, entirely unknown to
scholars and art historians, until 1990, when a private collector
bought it.

World Cup: Italy qualifies for last 16, eliminates Austria with 2-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with detail, Maldini and players quotes
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Italy sailed into the second round of
the World Cup on Tuesday with goals by its youngest and eldest
strikers, after surviving Austria's physical play and now
conventional injury-time goal.
	   A 2-1 win at the Stade de France - the site of the July 12 final
_ gave the Italian team first place in Group B, so avoiding a clash
with Group A winner Brazil in the last 16.
	   Italy completes the first round with seven points from three
games, with two wins and one draw.
	   The Austrians, with two draws and one loss, return home after
losing a qualifying second place to Chile.
	   Christian Vieri fired his fourth goal of the World Cup against
Austria, and Roberto Baggio his second, to lift Italy to a
hard-fought victory.
	   Vieri's vital strike came in the 49th minute.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, who had just been fouled, took a delicate
free kick from the left of the penalty area, and 23-year-old Vieri
climbed high above the Austrian defense to head powerfully past
goalkeeper Michael Konsel.
	   Del Piero, starting in his first World Cup match after
recovering from a right thigh strain, was especially targeted by
Austrian defenders, aware that the young forward is the main
inspiration in Italy's play.
	   Fouls on Del Piero cost Peter Schoettl and Ivica Vastica yellow
cards _ and the free kick that led to Italy's first goal.
	   In the frantic closing minutes, substitute Baggio made the score
2-0 before Austria pulled a goal back with a penalty in the dying
seconds.
	   Austria had scored injury-time equalizers in the previous
matches against Cameroon and Chile.
	   Baggio's goal came in the 90th minute. The 31-year-old striker
had tallied another late goal, on a penalty, in Italy's 2-2 against
Chile.
	   Filippo Inzaghi, another second-half substitute, broke through
on the right as Austria surged forward in search of an equalizer,
and crossed to Baggio who tapped into an open net.
	   Baggio, playing his third World Cup, entered the field as a
substitute for Del Piero, who was fading after a brilliant start.
	   Andreas Herzog scored for Austria with a penalty in the 92nd
minute after Hannes Reinmayr had been pulled down, but the goal was
not enough to save Austria from first round elimination.
	   ``I replaced Del Piero and Vieri in the second half because both
looked extremely tired. It's good to have two great strikers on the
substitutes' bench and have the chance to rotate them,'' said
Italian coach Cesare Maldini. ``I am happy to have avoided Brazil
in the next round, but I want to enjoy our victory and not think
too much about the next match.''
	   His son Paolo, the team captain, agreed it was important to
qualify as group winner and avoid a confrontation with Brazil, the
defending champion.
	   ``I believe that the Brazilians too are satisfied not to meet
Italy too early,'' Paolo Maldini said.
	   Italy's qualification came at a heavy price. Defender Alessandro
Nesta injured knee ligaments in a fourth minute clash with Austrian
midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger and is considered unlikely to play
again in the World Cup.
	   ``It's very sad news. Alessandro (Nesta) will probably not play
in the rest of the tournament. A final decision will be taken after
the player undergoes a magnetic resonance scan in the next 24
hours.''
	   Despite his team's elimination, Austria coach Herbert Prohaska
said his players competed well throughout the first round.
	   ``We've showed that we had a rightful place in this
tournament,'' Prohaska said. ``Italy showed that it has a very
clever squad, and could wait for counter-attacks.''
	   ``We were lacking a bit of luck. But the Italian defense stood
its ground well,'' Prohaska said.
	   Goalkeeper Michael Konsel said Austria played its best game in
the World Cup against Italy.
	   ``We would have qualified is we played like this in the first
two games,'' Konsel said.
	   Vieri's goal puts him joint top of the World Cup goalscoring
standings, equal with Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta, with four
goals.
	   Defensive midfielder Gianluca Pessotto, a surprise starter as
replacement for Demetrio Albertini, said he knew shortly before
kick off that he was going to play.
	   ``I had no time to get emotional about that,'' he explained.
 &UR; Lineups:

4th), Paolo Maldini, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta,

up centuries of chalky dust, and Jewish and Arab Israeli lawmakers
argued over competing claims to the ancient city.
	   ``Five thousand years there have been Jews here!'' shouted Rabbi
Benny Alon of the ultranationalist Moledet, or Homeland, party,
waving his finger in his colleagues' faces.
	   ``Arabs live here, why are you here?'' yelled back Salah Tarif,
an Arab legislator from Israel's opposition Labor Party.
	   Avni said preliminary digging had already turned up signs of
remains from the Ottoman, Crusader, Byzantine and Roman periods.
	   ``The implication is that the archaeological excavation of the
whole plot is going to be a very long process,'' he said. ``We're
speaking about many, many months of excavations.''
	   Avni said it was too early to predict prospects for building at
the site.
	   One possibility is that buildings could be erected above the
archaeological site, on stilts, as has been done in other parts of
the Old City. But Avni said any such buildings would still have to
be lower than the Old City walls, which range in height from five
to 15 meters (16 to 50 feet). Ateret Cohanim wants to build
high-rises there to house a Jewish seminary and dozens of families.
	   Taleb Elsana, a legislator from the Democratic Arab Party,
accused Ateret Cohanim of stealing Palestinian land, and said the
archaeological dig was giving legitimacy to the group's actions.
	   Israeli police blocked representatives of the Orient House, the
PLO's unofficial headquarters in Jerusalem, from joining the
legislators on the tour.

Three Germans sentenced; condition of policeman unimproved 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with three Germans sentenced to 1 year in prison
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced
three Germans to one year in prison for violence after a World Cup
match, while two other Germans were investigated for the attack
that left a policeman in a coma.
	   The court convicted the three Germans of attacking French police
in the World Cup's worst outburst of violence, following Sunday's
game between Germany and Yugoslavia in the northern city of Lens.
	   Ranging in age from 22 to 30, they were also barred from France
for two years after serving their terms. They were among 15 Germans
detained, including six who were to be deported.
	   Two 27-year-olds from Hanover were to face a judge later Tuesday
and were expected to be placed under formal investigation _ a step
short of being charged _ for attempted murder, the officials said
on customary anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, the prospects of a French policeman whose head was
bashed in by German fans looked no better Tuesday, with doctors
calling his condition ``still very worrying.''

Italy's lower chamber approves articles for NATO reaftification 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: WRITESTHRU to COMBINE urgent series
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Heeding Premier Romano Prodi's last-minute pleas,
lawmakers Tuesday gave first approval of NATO's eastward expansion,
sparing the government an embarrassing defeat in the Chamber of
Deputies.
	   After all three articles of the ratification bill passed by a
wide margin, thanks to the abstention by the conservative
opposition led by media mogul Silvio Berlusocni, the final vote on
the entire package was expected to pass by the same margins.
	   At the last-minute waffling centrists decided to vote yes after
meeting with Prodi. A similar meeting with the bloc led by
ex-Premier Berlusconi had failed to sway the conservatives from
their insistence that they would only vote yes if Prodi agreed to
resign.
	   The Senate, where Prodi has a majority, has already approved
ratification, which was required from all 16 NATO members and the
three new countries, for enlargement to take effect.
	   Debate was broken off for several hours as Italy watched their
soccer team beat Austria in Paris in the World Cup.
	   Prodi, returning to the Chamber after the break, renewed his
appeal to all political forces to approve NATO's inclusion of the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland ``so that Italy can meet its
international commitments.''
	   In the morning, Prodi told the chamber: ``We cannot reply with a
refusal to this request from eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he
said, asking the entire Chamber of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the
name of the Italian people.''
	   Prodi's center-left government was forced to reach out to the
opposition in the Chamber because its usual ally, the Communists,
oppose NATO's expansion.
	   The government appeared to secure the support it needed Monday
night when the center-right opposition decided to vote for NATO
enlargement.
	   But Berlusconi insisted Prodi resign, saying a government that
needs opposition help on such a crucial foreign policy issue lacks
the backing to continue governing.
	   In his address to the Chamber of Deputies Tuesday, Prodi
rejected Berlusconi's call. ``The NATO vote doesn't put the
majority at stake; the government will go on with its program,'' he
said.
	   Despite the parliamentary fireworks, the NATO spat did not
appear to be a serious threat to the government since the
Communists have said they'll support Prodi if it boils down to a
confidence vote.

Andrea Jaeger _ 15 years after Wimbledon final _ helping kids 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Andrea Jaeger strolls Wimbledon
unrecognized now, just 15 years after she lost to Martina
Navratilova in the Wimbledon final.
	   Now, instead of being surrounded by fans, 33-year-old Jaeger
surrounds herself with sick kids.
	   The woman who fell just short of being the world No. 1 _ she
reached No. 2 in 1981 _ now runs the Kid's Stuff Foundation in
Aspen, Colorado, and each year at Wimbledon takes children behind
the scenes.
	   This year the children _ fighting cancer and other
life-threatening diseases _ traveled from all over England to see
tennis' most famous courts.
	   ``Andre Agassi called me at 11:30 on Monday night and invited me
to bring the kids to watch him practice,'' Jaeger said Tuesday.
``Then, when it was raining and he couldn't practice, he invited
everyone back to his house. We spent 40 minutes there and the kids
were so thrilled.''
	   Wimbledon officials, often considered stuffy and aloof, have
played their part. All England Club Chief Executive Chris Gorringe
arranged for a van, decked out with balloons, so they could make
the trip.
	   Pam Shriver, Michael Chang and Monica Seles chatted with the
children on Tuesday, a few of tennis' top players who are only too
pleased to lend support to Jaeger's mission of mercy.
	   On Wednesday's agenda for the nine kids was a visit to a private
zoo owned by millionaire John Aspinall.
	   ``They'll be helping to feed the gorillas,'' Jaeger said.
	   And in August they'll fly to the United States to stay with
Jaeger, where they'll go white-water rafting in defiance of their
crippling illnesses.
	   And they'll see Jaeger's most ambitious project yet, the
soon-to-be completed Silver Lining Ranch, custom-built for kids to
enjoy what might be their final days.
	   Jaeger, who turned pro at the age of 14, became the second
youngest player ever to win a professional tournament when she won
in Las Vegas in 1980 at the age of 14.
	   In 1980, she was the youngest player ever seeded at Wimbledon at
15 and the youngest U.S. Open semifinalist the same year. She won
14 singles titles before injuries ended her career and had surgery
seven times on her right shoulder.

<SLUG> Clinton to veto Iran sanctions bill </SLUG>
<HEADLINE>

</HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton has decided to veto
legislation on Iranian sanctions, saying Congress did not write in
enough flexibility for him to negotiate as he pursues a new
relationship with that country.
	   Clinton planned to quietly veto the Iran Missile Proliferation
Act, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Tuesday. The
legislation would automatically impose sanctions on any foreign
government or business that supplies ballistic missile technology
to Iran.
	   Currently, under the 1996 Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, the
president may impose sanctions on foreign companies that invest at
least dlrs 20 million annually in Iran's oil and gas sectors.
	   The veto comes less than a week after Clinton expressed hope for
``a genuine reconciliation with Iran'' if it complies with
international standards of conduct and moves away from its support
of terrorism and distribution of dangerous weapons. The Clinton
administration already has eased travel to the United States for
Iranians and is supporting cultural and academic exchanges.
	   Some members of Congress said they would push to override the
veto, citing concern over moves by Russia and China to supply Iran
with missile technology.
	   ``This proliferation cannot and must not be ignored. It is a
direct threat to peace in the Middle East,'' said Rep. Nancy
Pelosi. ``This carefully crafted legislation will strengthen the
president's hand in dealing with proliferators.''
	   McCurry said Clinton feels Congress is trying to ``micromanage''
U.S. foreign policy and put ``hopeless shackles on the presidency''
with the legislation. He said the president also considers the
threshold for issuing sanctions too low.
	   ``Essentially, there is no flexibility in the act passed by
Congress that allows the president to work through problems,''
McCurry said. ``You could conceivably have situations in the future
in which the United States government might improperly or
incorrectly impose sanctions, which then would cast out on the
credibility of all the sanctions regimes that we maintain.''
	   McCurry said Clinton would continue to work with Russia on U.S.
concerns about the proliferation of missile technology.

Villager confesses to funding arson attack on refugee home 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a case that illuminated
anti-foreigner sentiment in Germany, a man admitted in court
Tuesday to paying a teen-ager to set fire to a newly built refugee
home in his village.
	   Thomas Oste, who lived next door to the planned refugee home
with his wife and two young children, repeated an earlier
confession that he paid Jaskowski a total of about 11,000 marks
(dlrs 6,000) to set the blaze and to keep quiet about it.
	   The house, in the eastern lakeside resort of Dolgenbrodt, burned
to the ground on Nov. 1, 1992, the day before 86 Africans would
have moved in.
	   Oste testified that he feared for his children and his property,
and that the number of refugees were ``way too many'' for a village
of 250 people.
	   Residents tried to stop the project by protesting at town
meetings and by sending a letter to district and state officials.
Those efforts failed, Oste said, so he resorted to arson.
	   Soon after the crime, authorities caught and convicted Silvio
Jaskowski, 18 at the time and a neo-Nazi.
	   Based on information from Jaskowski, prosecutors uncovered what
they say was a conspiracy involving not only disaffected youths but
also otherwise upstanding citizens who wanted to keep the
asylum-seekers out.
	   Karl Pfannenschwarz, the village mayor, has denied that people
in Dolgenbrodt are racist. He says everyone has condemned the
house-burning.
	   But prosecutor Petra Marx says she believes most of the
residents share the blame.
	   In the current trial, in Brandenburg state court in the city of
Frankfurt an der Oder, four men are charged with complicity in the
crime and a fifth with being an accessory.
	   All five had denied any involvement during the original trial.
They, and two others, are also charged with perjury.
	   Oste, a 41-year-old florist, confessed last year to paying the
teen-ager, prosecutors had said.
	   A friend of Jaskowski's, Renato Paschke, 27, allegedly helped
him set the fire.
	   Prosecutors say part of the money came from a neighbor,
electrician Gerd Graefen, who had land he wanted to sell and was
afraid the refugees' presence would lower property values.
	   Hans-Juergen Schmidt, 49, allegedly supplied heating oil for the
Molotov cocktails. His stepson, Marco Schmidt, 25, allegedly drove
Jaskowski to pick up his money.
	   In other testimony Tuesday, Schmidt, withdrew a confession that
he helped build a fire bomb. He said he confessed only because he
feared prison and a prosecutor had promised him probation.
	   The trial continues Friday.

World Cup: Substitute's job isn't that hopeless on French team 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout with lineup for Wednesday
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Substitutes often are the
unluckiest participants of the World Cup. So close, yet so far from
the action, it can leave them frustrated, bitter and wishing they
were somewhere else.
	   Not so with France.
	   Going into Wednesday's third match after two victories, coach
Aime Jacquet has said he will tap that vast well of substitutes. In
the first round, he is expected to have used at least 20 of his 22
players.
	   Wednesday's starting lineup against Denmark will be different in
seven spots, with wholesale changes in every section. Even
20-year-old Thierry Henry, who scored three goals so far, will be
rested.
	   For a team still in contention for the cup, the strategy has
inherent dangers. If France loses Wednesday's game, its road to the
next stages of the tournament will be strewn with Nigeria and
probably Brazil.
	   But if France clinches a draw or victory and gets an easier
passage, it will be another coup of Jacquet over his critics and he
will enter the second round with rested men. On top of that, four
players under the threat of suspension because of yellow cards will
have a clean sheet again.
	   ``You have to know how to manage the group,'' Jacquet said
Tuesday after his squad set up camp in the rolling sun-splashed
Beaujolais vineyards north of Lyon, where Wednesday's match will be
played.
	   Then again, not every coach has such star substitutes at his
disposal.
	   Midfielder Christian Karembeu has won the European Champions Cup
with Real Madrid, but is still waiting for his first minute of
action. He will start as right back instead of Lilian Thuram. So is
Frank Leboeuf, who captured the European Cupwinners Cup with
Chelsea last month. He replaces Laurent Blanc.
	   Patrick Vieira, who clinched a league-Cup double with Arsenal,
is another of France's high-profile substitutes. He comes in place
of captain Didier Deschamps, who was facing a one-match suspension
if he earned another yellow Wednesday.
	   So despite Jacquet's drastic changes to the team, his
predictions that France will be just as bold and spectacular as
during the first two victories do not sound that farfetched.
	   Keeping stars on the bench is also a tough job, trying to keep
them match-ready yet offering little to no hope they will be able
to play.
	   ``We are frustrated on the bench, we are living every moment
with those on the pitch and often feel just as tired afterwards,''
said Karembeu.
	   ``You just want to get up and hit that ball,'' he said. On
Wednesday, he will.
	   And so will AS Roma's Vincent Candela, who replaces
suspension-threatened Bixente Lizarazu at left back. ``You're
always a bit bitter when you don't play. The World Cup is for 22,
so it's good that everyone takes part.''
	   And even if those substitutes have their hour of glory for
France and beat Denmark, they might disappear quickly into the
shadows of the dugout yet again.
	   ``I will prove I'm a great professional and I will go back to
the bench with a smile on my face,'' said Leboeuf. ``It will be
frustrating but I wish them well.''
	   So does Vieira, whatever happens.
	   ``If you tell me 'France wins the World Cup but you don't play a
second,' I would sign immediately,'' he said.

Polish court denies confirming ownership claims to Auschwitz memorial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The head of the local court denied
confirming an ownership claim by an Israeli woman to the grounds
near the Auschwitz death camp where the Nazis built a factory using
slave labor, PAP news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Jadwiga Lelito, the head of civil actions in the local court in
Chrzanow, 18 kilometers (11 miles) northeast of Auschwitz, said a
report carried by the Tuesday edition of Britain's Daily Mail that
63-year-old widow, Tzipora Frank, of Israel has documents from the
court, is inaccurate.
	   PAP quoted Lelito as saying there were many lawsuits on
restoration of property to Jews but there was no case brought by
Frank.
	   In May Frank told an Israeli newspaper that her grandfather
owned a tar factory, torn down by the Nazis in 1941. She also said
she had recently traveled to Poland to confirm the authenticity of
the papers.
	   But according to PAP, neither the local court in Oswiecim, where
the Auschwitz memorial is located, nor the provincial court in
Bielsko Biala, the provincial capital, has issued such documents.
	   The land was confiscated from the Frank family following the
1939 Nazi invasion of Poland. Using inmates as slave labor, the
Krupp concern built a munitions factory on the site.
	   Frank said she will hold on to the ownership documents in an
effort to prevent further building on the site.
	   Before building the camp, the Nazis forcibly resettled the local
population into the Sudeten mountains. About 200 survivors, mostly
Poles, have not received any compensation.
	   Like all private property in Poland, the area was confiscated by
the communists after the war and belongs to the state.
	   Poland, which is restoring Jewish religious property to the
communities, also is planning to restore private property, but the
law is still being drafted.

Hingis, Novotna win first-round matches AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with Rafter victory, play suspended for the day
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ On a drizzly afternoon, Martina Hingis
opened her Wimbledon title defense with a difficult victory over
Lisa Raymond, one of only five players to beat her last year.
	   Hingis, the top seed, defeated her 19th-ranked opponent 7-5, 6-3
in a match delayed because of rain.
	   ``I expected it to be tough,'' Hingis said. ``She beat me last
time and I'm sure she had confidence. In the first couple of games,
I really didn't know what to do. ... I hope now it's going to be
easier for the next two our three rounds.''
	   The player Hingis beat in last year's final, No. 3 Jana Novotna,
advanced with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Sandra Kleinova. And No. 6 Venus
Williams, a first-round loser in her Wimbledon debut last year,
downed Jana Nejedly 6-3, 6-3, to join her sister Serena in round
two.
	   Williams came within five minutes of being defaulted when she
turned up 10 minutes late. She thought the match was on Court 18
when it was scheduled on Court 13.
	   ``I could never figure out where Court 13 was,'' she said.
	   Williams had less trouble with her opponent. She played
exclusively from the baseline, with no need for forays to the net.
	   ``I wasn't really trying too many new things,'' Williams said.
``My plan was more or less, make my shots and get off the court
before it rains.''
	   After a rain-free opening day, showers and drizzle disrupted
play. Play started more than three hours late on some courts, and
all doubles matches were canceled. After more rain late in the
afternoon, play was called off for the day at 7:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).
	   The only men's seed to complete a match was No. 6 Patrick
Rafter, who beat Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuberger 6-1, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.
	   No. 4 Greg Rusedski, limping with a sprained left ankle, won the
first set against Mark Draper 6-4, but lost the second 6-2 and was
trailing 5-4 in the third when the match was suspended.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, was leading
Brett Steven 6-3, 7-6 (9-7).
	   Raymond and Hingis played a sparkling first set. The American,
who beat Hingis in three sets in their last meeting in Switzerland,
kept Hingis at bay with a low-bouncing slice backhand and powerful
forehand.
	   Raymond also took her chances to chip and charge the net for
putaway volleys, often leaving the Swiss teen-ager shaking her head
in frustration.
	   ``Having beaten her before, I knew I had it in me,'' Raymond
said. ``I just didn't play the big points well. ... She comes up
with the big shots when she needs them.''
	   After Hingis broke for a 5-3 lead, Raymond responded by breaking
back for 5-4 and saving two set points in the next game to draw
even at 5-5.
	   Raymond could have taken control of the set when she earned a
break point in the next game. But Hingis held for 6-5 and broke in
the next game to finish the set in 52 minutes.
	   Drizzle then stopped play with Hingis leading 2-1 in the second
set. When play resumed 90 minutes later, Hingis ran off three
straight games for 5-1.
	   Though Raymond saved three match points in the seventh game and
held serve for 5-3, Hingis closed the match in the next game.
	   On Monday, Steffi Graf made a triumphant and tearful return to
Wimbledon.
	   A year ago, the seven-time champion was recovering from major
knee surgery. Two months ago, her comeback threatened by more
injuries, she considered retirement.
	   So after winning her first-round match in straight sets on
Centre Court, Graf was overcome by emotion. Twice during a news
conference, she broke down crying.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' said Graf, playing her 13th Wimbledon. ``It's just special
to be here.''
	   Graf, who rarely expresses her emotions on or off the court,
said she was surprised to be on Centre Court, the scene of her
greatest triumphs, for the opening match against Spain's Gala Leon
Garcia.
	   ``It is not common to play the first match on Centre Court
unless you win the year before, so I didn't take it as normal at
all,'' she said. ``I got really excited, and it definitely pumped
me up to be playing out there.''
	   After some initial nerves, the German star settled down and beat
Garcia 6-4, 6-1, a solid start to her first Grand Slam tournament
since the French Open in 1997.
	   After surgery following the French, Graf didn't return to
tournament play until March. But she was sidelined again with calf
and hamstring injuries. That's when she started wondering whether
her career was over.
	   ``There have been a couple of occasions where it has been really
difficult, seven or eight weeks ago was the last time,'' she said.
``I had so many little injuries and every week something else came
around.''
	   But Graf, who said she now feels ``100 percent,'' must be
considered a title contender.
	   ``There is no question it is my favorite tournament and I do
feel the grass suits my game and experience does help,'' she said.
``But winning is a long way. That is not as far as I am looking
now.''

Opposition leader arrested in Azerbaijan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Police arrested the deputy chairman of
the Azerbaijani Popular Front in his office on Tuesday, the
opposition group said.
	   It said the arrest was linked to the Popular Front's refusal to
take part in presidential elections in Azerbaijan scheduled for
October.
	   Police confirmed the arrest of Fazil Mustafayev, but refused to
say why he was detained.
	   Former President Abulfaz Elcibey said at a news conference the
arrest _ and others last week _ were ``carried out on the orders of
President Geidar Aliev and are politically motivated.''
	   Last week police arrested two aides of Elcibey and two workers
at the independent newspaper Shag (Time).

FDA approves first new TB drug in 25 years 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reaction, details of how drug works
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The long course of treatment for tuberculosis
could get a little easier with approval of the first new anti-TB in
25 years, a boon for patients and for efforts to stop the disease
from building drug resistance around the world.
	   The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has approved
rifapentine for treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a highly
contagious and potentially deadly lung infection.
	   ``It's a great thing,'' said Dr. Lee Reichman, director of the
New Jersey Medical School National Tuberculosis Center in Newark.
``It's really excellent.''
	   A major benefit of the drug is that it reduces the number of
treatments needed to cure TB, making it more likely the patient
will complete the therapy.
	   ``Better compliance not only improves patient outcomes but
should deter drug resistance,'' the FDA said in announcing the
approval.
	   Strains of tuberculosis that are resistant to front-line
antibiotics have been emerging around the world and are especially
common in parts of the former Soviet Union, according to the World
Health Organization.
	   That group estimated there will be 90 million new cases of
tuberculosis and 30 million deaths worldwide in the decade of the
1990s. According to the Centers for Disease Control about 19,000
cases were diagnosed in the United States in 1997.
	   Using drugs improperly to treat TB can quickly promote the
evolution of bacteria that are impervious to these medicines. The
problem gained attention in the early 1990s in New York City, where
about 7 percent of new TB cases were found to be resistant to more
than one drug.
	   Currently, the standard course of therapy is six months on
multiple drugs. If the patient doesn't take all the medicine they
will spread the disease, perhaps a version that has become drug
resistant, Reichman said.
	   ``So, tuberculosis cases that aren't treated don't go away,'' he
said.
	   For this reason, many patients are required to take their drugs
in the presence of health care professionals. In some instances
field workers seek out the TB victims and bring them their
medication, a costly process.
	   Reichman said his center was also involved in tests of the new
drug. ``The patients love it, the field workers love it ... and
every patient you cure is somebody who is not going to be spreading
the disease.''
	   Current therapy calls for two months of daily treatment followed
by four months of twice-weekly treatment, the FDA explained.
	   With rifapentine (rif-a-PEN-tine), patients would continue to
receive three other drugs daily, and rifapentine twice weekly, in
the first two months. Then the dosing schedule would be reduced to
once a week in the final four months, half the current regime.

World Cup: Battle for 1st place Group C; Winner avoids Nigeria-Brazil 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with France's starting lineup
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A goalless draw would suit both just fine.
France would win its group and avoid Nigeria and Brazil in the
upcoming rounds. Denmark would keep South Africa at bay and qualify
for the second round.
	   So both say: no way _ even though Denmark is expected to start
in a defensive posture and France will sideline a slew of regular
starters to avoid suspensions in the next rounds.
	   And Jacquet also sidelined three-goal dynamo Thierry Henry,
letting his friend David Trezeguet, also 20, start instead.
	   ``If we are in such a positive mood, we have to keep winning,''
France's coach Aime Jacquet insisted.
	   France has its reputation as World Cup favorite to uphold and
does not want to upset that giddy momentum that have made Les Bleus
the idols of the host nation.
	   And against France's formidable attack, a Danish wait-and-see
policy would just be too risky.
	   ``We will not go for a 0-0 draw. That cannot be our goal,'' aid
Danish coach Bo Johansson said.
	   France currently leads Group C with six points from two games
and is assured of advancing. Denmark has four points, South Africa
has one and Saudi Arabia, already eliminated before Thursday's last
first-round game, has none.
	   A Danish loss combined with a big South African victory could
still see the Africans through. A Danish victory over France would
give the Scandinavians first place.
	   The second finisher in the group will have to play Nigeria in
Saint-Denis on Sunday, a task any reasonable coach would want to
avoid at this stage. Brazil looms farther in the quarterfinal.
	   The group winner will face either Spain, Bulgaria or Paraguay,
which is considered a far easier task.
	   Denmark's hopes to go through look brighter since French
midfielder Zinedine Zidane is suspended for the match for kicking
an opponent last week. Furthermore, Jacquet will sideline several
key players who already received a yellow card and could miss the
round of 16 if they received a second warning.
	   ``The yellow cards worry me the most,'' Jacquet said. But he
warned that even with the quartet of starting defenders: Laurent
Blanc and Bixente Lizarazu and midfielders Didier Deschamps and
Emmanuel Petit, the French should hardly be underestimated.
	   Real Madrid's Christian Karembeu, AS Roma's Vincent Candela and
Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf will start and get their first taste of
World Cup action.
	   ``The World Cup is for the whole group of 22, so it's good
everyone takes part,'' Candela said. ``Our team will be competitive
and we will field the best players for the occasion.''
	   Johansson needn't be warned. He is expected to reinforce the
wings to stifle France effective rushes from the sidelines.
	   ``It's the defense that needs to be strengthened against the
strong French play on the wings,'' said Jacob Laursen, who could
make a return to the team for the decisive game.
	   And Johansson could add a third forward for more thrust through
the center. With only one goal against outsiders Saudi Arabia and
South Africa, Denmark's offense has looked far from impressive.
	   If Johansson considers changes to his team, so does Jacquet _ by
force.
	   Speculation is rife on how he will replace Zidane, who will also
miss the round-of-16 game because of suspension.
	   Jacquet will introduce Robert Pires of Metz to fill in the gap
and put Inter Milan's Youri Djorkaeff alongside him.
	   ``Pires, Djorkaeff, they will have the obligation to take the
weight of the game upon them,'' Jacquet said.
	   In front of goal, Jacquet has decided to give Stephane
Guivarc'h's knee addtional rest, and allow Trezeguet his first
start for France.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Announced starting lineup for France:
	   Fabien Barthez; Christian Karembeu, Marcel Desailly, Frank
Leboeuf, Vincent Candela; Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Emmanuel
Petit; Youri Djorkaeff, David Trezeguet, Bernard Diomede.

Russia planning to build nuclear power plant in India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia hopes to sign a dlrs 2.6 billion contract
within six months to build a nuclear power plant in India, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said Tuesday.
	   Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov said the plant
would not violate any international treaties since it would be used
for peaceful purposes and would be monitored by the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
	   India and neighboring Pakistan recently became nuclear powers,
fueling fears their long-standing rivalry could lead to nuclear
war.
	   India signed an agreement with the former Soviet Union for a
nuclear power plant in 1988, but had to scrap the project because
of lack of money.

World Cup: Chileans take to streets in celebration 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Thousands took to the streets Tuesday in
joyful celebrations after Chile qualified for the World Cup's
second round for the first time in 36 years.
	   Authorities, which had warned that no celebrations blocking
traffic would be allowed, simply gave up. In fact, some police cars
joined the revelry and the noisy concert of horns from thousands of
vehicles.
	   Chile gained the round of 16 with a 1-1 tie against Cameroon in
Nantes, France. Santiago and other cities were idle during the
match, which was broadcast live. Even some schools tuned in the
action.
	   At the final whistle, an explosion of joy spread throughout the
country. Paper fell from high-rise office buildings and many
employees took to the streets to celebrate.
	   Motorcades quickly jammed streets and avenues, with fans waiving
Chilean flags, many wearing the red jersey of the soccer team with
the numbers of the most popular players: Ivan Zamorano's No. 9 and
Marcelo Salas' No. 11.
	   President Eduardo Frei, a well known soccer fan, said ``we
suffered until the last minute but at least we did not make the
mistakes of the two previous matches,'' when Chile blew late leads
against both Italy and Austria.
	   Chile had not advanced past the first round in a World Cup since
1962, when it hosted the tournament.

Iran proposes meeting of Muslim organization to discuss Jerusalem king, crown prince

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Iran has proposed a meeting of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference for developing a strategy
against Israel's plan to extend Jerusalem's borders, a Saudi
official said Tuesday.
	   In a letter to Saudi King Fahd, Iran's President Mohammad
Khatami said foreign ministers of the 55-member OIC can meet in
Tehran to discuss the issue, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   He said the letter was handed over by visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi. He arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and
also met with Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   Khatami did not propose a date, said the official. The OIC's
summit was held in Tehran in December.
	   Saudi Arabia expressed willingness to attend the meeting,
provided it helps contain Israel effectively and forces it to abide
by its peace agreements with the Palestinians, an Iranian official
said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Israeli Cabinet approved a plan Sunday for the expansion of
Jerusalem. Under Israeli-Palestinian agreements, the status of
Jerusalem is to be determined in negotiations, and both sides have
pledged not to make changes on the ground in the meantime.
	   Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a state.
Jerusalem, which is holy to Christians, Jews, and Muslims, is home
to Al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's most revered shrines.
	   The Saudi official said Khatami also mentioned the need for
Saudi Arabia and Iran to coordinate oil policies in an effort to
stop the slide in oil prices ahead of a meeting of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna on Wednesday.
	   Khatami had discussed the issue with Abdullah also on telephone
Sunday, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Saudi Arabia and Iran, OPEC's largest producers, have pledged
cuts of 325,000 barrels per day starting July 1.
	   Once bitter rivals, relations between the two Gulf countries
have improved dramatically since the election last May of Khatami,
a moderate cleric.

Weighing war's costs, Israel and Lebanon battle over body swaps 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Note contents, graf 8

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GADOT, Israel (AP) _ By a bend in the Jordan River, the
gravediggers lounged in the shade of a eucalyptus tree, awaiting
orders to begin their grisly task: unearthing the bodies of Shiite
Muslim guerrillas buried just up the hill in graves marked only
with numbered signposts.
	   The Red Cross is trying to broker the latest body-and-prisoner
swap by Israel and Lebanese militias, in which Israel is reportedly
ready to free up to 60 prisoners and hand over up to 60 bodies in
exchange for the remains of a single Israeli commando.
	   The lopsided numbers show the lengths to which Israel is willing
to go to bring home its war dead, a reflection of a battlefield
ethic that is deeply ingrained in the national character.
	   But the extraordinarily painful circumstances surrounding the
prospective swap _ whose timetable was still unclear on Tuesday _
could fuel Israeli efforts to find a way out of the long conflict.
	   The events playing themselves out this week were set in motion
Sept. 5, when an elite Israeli commando unit on a nighttime raid in
southern Lebanon stumbled into an ambush.
	   Twelve Israelis, including 21-year-old Sgt. 1st Class Itamar
Ilya, were killed by gunfire and bomb blasts. The retreating
Israelis managed to take most of their dead with them _ but not
all.
	   The casualties were Israel's worst single combat loss in more
than a decade, but the aftermath was just as shocking.
	   Hours later, guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrilla group triumphantly displayed grisly trophies from the
clash: body parts including legs and hands _ and a human head. A
news photo showed a militiaman holding it up and smiling.
	   Ever since, Israel has been seeking the return of Ilya's
remains, negotiating with Hezbollah through the International
Committee of the Red Cross. In recent days, Israeli and Lebanese
media reports had suggested a swap was imminent, but on Tuesday,
things took a grim new turn.
	   The Shiite Muslim group Amal _ a bitter rival of Hezbollah,
which was also involved in the September clash and claims to hold
Ilya's scalp _ said it would not participate in the swap.
	   The Israeli army declined to comment, but it was thought highly
unlikely that the government would accept anything less than the
entire set of remains that had been recovered.
	   The Red Cross, citing confidentiality and the sensitive stage of
the negotiations, declined comment. Earlier, Red Cross
representative Jean-Jacques Fresard had called on the parties to
``deal with this issue with dignity.''
	   The Ilya family has also refused public comment. ``We can't
speak about this now,'' said the soldier's uncle, Shlomo Ilya, a
retired army general.
	   For Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the swap also
has a personal dimension. The remains to be returned by Israel
include those of his 18-year-old son, Hadi, killed in separate
fighting last September.
	   If the swap goes through, it would be the largest in nearly two
years. In July 1996, Israel freed 45 Hezbollah prisoners and
returned the bodies of 123 guerrillas in exchange for the remains
of two Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
	   Because of their value in such swaps, war dead have become
bargaining chips. When a fatal clash breaks out, both sides try to
secure their own dead and sometimes the other side's as well.
	   As Israeli casualties have grown in south Lebanon, so has public
pressure for a pullout.
	   The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this
year launched a diplomatic campaign for an Israeli withdrawal from
the security zone it set up in south Lebanon in 1985, in exchange
for Lebanese guarantees that northern Israel would be safe from
guerrilla attack.
	   But Lebanon and Syria, the effective power broker in Lebanon,
have rejected the plan and insisted that Israel must withdraw
unconditionally.
	   In northern Israel, guerrillas killed in south Lebanon are
buried in two makeshift cemeteries near military installations in
the shadow of the Golan Heights. In the weedy, overgrown plots,
dozens of graves are marked by rusted signposts bearing numbers,
not names.
	   The military for the past week has had contractors standing by
with earthmoving equipment, ready to begin the exhumations as soon
as orders come through.
	   Some of the waiting workers have dug up bodies for previous
swaps. They described swaddling their faces with cloths to try to
block the smell, and their horror when earthmoving equipment
occasionally broke open coffins and body bags.
	   All said they simply wanted to get the job over with.
	   ``Handling them ... it's not easy work,'' said one. ``I try to
look calm and be a good worker, but my heart just dies.''

World Cup: Key Saudi defender to miss match against South Africa 
</HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Saudi Arabia suffered another World Cup
blow Tuesday when defender Ahmed Jamil was ruled out of its final
match because of a thigh injury.
	   ``Unfortunately Ahmed Jamil is not fit to play the match against
South Africa,'' Saudi coach Mohammed al-Kharashi told The
Associated Press.
	   The 28-year-old defender strained his right thigh muscle,
``which could take some days to heal,'' al-Kharashi said.
	   Jamil was hurt during Monday's training session in Melun-Senart,
south of Paris. There were no other injuries for the Saudis, but
they also will be without defender Mohammed al-Khilaiwi, who
received a red card in last week's loss to France and is suspended.
	   Wednesday's match is for pride for Saudi Arabia, which has no
chance to advance in the World Cup after losing 1-0 to Denmark and
4-0 to France in its first two matches.
	   South Africa, however, can advance with a victory over the
Saudis and some help from France, which would have to defeat
Denmark in the other Group C match.
	   ``We are not under any pressure as we have been eliminated,''
al-Kharashi said of Wednesday's match.
	   ``We hope to win this last match to show the true quality of
Saudi football and reassure our supporters,'' said al-Kharashi, who
took over as coach this week after Brazilian Carlos Alberto
Parreira was fired due to the team's early exit from the
tournament.
	   Saudi Arabia qualified for the second round of the 1994 World
Cup, its first trip to the global soccer showcase.

Greece and Macedonia oppose NATO strike in Kosovo some points 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-6 with background on Greece in Nato; NEW to
AP Photos ATH101-2
By PATRICK QUINN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Calling on the West to listen to the
``voice of logic,'' Greece and Macedonia on Tuesday warned that
possible NATO strikes in Kosovo could lead to an all-out Balkan
war.
	   ``I would like to tell those in comfortable capitals in the West
and north who find pleasure in games of war that enough blood was
shed because of rashness and amateurishness in Bosnia,'' said Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
	   NATO, which last week sent warplanes over Albania and Macedonia
in a show of force against Yugoslavia, has described military
strikes against Serb forces as a measure of last resort.
	   As a member of NATO, Greece has the power to veto any strikes
against Kosovo _ all actions by the defense alliance are taken by
consensus _ but in the past, the Greeks have buckled under U.S.
pressure when Washington feels there is no other alternative.
	   Macedonia fears a spillover from neighboring Kosovo could ignite
a separatist movement among its own large and restive Albanian
minority. Macedonia, not a member of the alliance, clearly prefers
the NATO does not expand its capacities beyond protect its borders
from the fighting.
	   ``We saluted NATO's preparedness to prevent (the fighting's)
spread to Macedonia and Albania and the guarantees it gave for our
integrity and sovereignty,'' said Macedonian Foreign Minister
Blagoj Handzinski.
	   Both Pangalos and Handzinski made their statements shortly after
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke left Athens for the Macedonian
capital, Skopje, to hold meetings with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov and Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic also has agreed to talk to
Rugova. But Rugova has refused until Serb forces are pulled out of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the
population and rebels have waged an escalating fight for
independence.
	   Both Pangalos and Handzinski questioned whether Rugova had much
influence left in Kosovo.
	   Once the bitterest of neighbors, Greece and Macedonia have
united in the fear that a successful campaign by the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army could spell disaster for the Balkans. NATO
strikes could bolster the KLA's campaign.
	   ``Kosovo is a province of Serbia. Any change of borders will
mean all-out war'' in the Balkans, Handzinski said. ``We condemn
both the activities of the so-called KLA and Serb forces in
Kosovo.''
	   Pangalos added: ``It is not by chance that the countries of the
region represent the voice of logic. We have the most to win if
there is a peaceful solution and the most to lose if there is a
war.''
	   Greece and Macedonia stressed that peace plans must apply to
both the Serbs and rebels.
	   ``We can't imagine that security forces will be withdrawn and
that armed men will be allowed to carry out illegal acts of
violence, especially since Mr. Rugova and other political forces
themselves say they don't control the armed men,'' said Pangalos.

	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ A bomb exploded on the tracks Tuesday
minutes after the Shalimar Express left Jammu-Kashmir's winter
capital, derailing eight train cars and injuring 13 people,
officials said.
	   The blast occurred as New Delhi-bound passenger train passed
Bari Brahmana station, six miles (10 kilometers) south of the state
capital, Dr. Jasbir Singh said.
	   Singh, who works at a city government hospital, said an injured
passenger told him rescue operations were hampered because there
were no lights in the thickly forested area. The doctor would not
disclose the passenger's name.
	   The passenger said eight cars derailed, a count confirmed by
police and rail officials.
	   Police officer Ghulam Mohammad said the bomb had been planted on
the tracks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
	   Militants have been fighting Indian security forces since 1989
demanding freedom for Kashmir, where Muslims are in a majority.
Hindus account for 82 percent of India's nearly 1 billion
population.
	   In the past, police have blamed Muslim guerrillas for setting
off bombs in trains and buses in Kashmir as part of their violent
campaign.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Mike Murphy was fired Tuesday as coach of the
Toronto Maple Leafs, unable to get the team to the playoffs in his
two seasons.
	   President and general manager Ken Dryden announced the move _
which took two months to make _ at a Maple Leaf Gardens news
conference.
	   ``I met with Mike Murphy this morning and told him of my
decision,'' said Dryden. ``This was not an easy one to make.
	   ``We did some good things, but in the end we didn't make it (to
the playoffs.) We have to get better.''
	   Under Murphy, Toronto finished 30-43-9 this season and 30-44-8
in 1997. He has one year remaining on his contract.
	   Pat Quinn, a possible replacement, met with Dryden over the
weekend.
	   ``I don't think I can verify anything for you,'' Quinn said from
his home in Vancouver, British Columbia.
	   Dryden said nothing had been decided about a successor to
Murphy.
	   Murphy was an assistant coach with Toronto from 1991-94 and with
the New York Rangers the next two seasons. He took over as Maple
Leafs coach July 3, 1996.

Turkey plans to introduce new currency 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey plans to introduce a new currency
that would eliminate five zeros from its inflation-plagued lira, a
top official said Tuesday.
	   Central Bank Chief Gazi Ercel said a draft bill had already been
prepared for a ``new lira'' that would be on equal parity with
Europe's new single currency, the Euro.
	   Ercel said however, the Central Bank opposed introducing the
currency until the government managed to rein in inflation,
currently running at around 100 percent.
	   ``Otherwise, there will be no point,'' Ercel told a meeting of
businessmen. ``I hope we are successful in reducing inflation.''
	   The Turkish lira is now worth some 263,000 to the dollar. A
simple shopping trip often involves the exchange of millions of
liras.
	   Turkey's lowest denomination is the 5,000 lira coin, the highest
is the 5-million lira note.

Eds: AMs; UPDATES with English fan in ``very serious'' condition;
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced
three more Germans to prison as France grappled with World Cup
violence that has left a policeman in a coma and an English fan in
critical condition.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
that has erupted in several French cities hosting the soccer
championship that began June 10. More than 200 people have been
arrested.
	   Two German fans armed with baseball bats outside a stadium in
Nantes were briefly detained Tuesday afternoon and placed under
investigation, police said in a statement.
	   Authorities determined the two were not among neo-Nazis blamed
for earlier World Cup violence.
	   A court in the northern city of Bethune on Tuesday convicted the
three Germans to a year in prison for attacking French police in
some of the World Cup's worst violence. It followed Sunday's game
between Germany and Yugoslavia in nearby Lens.
	   Ranging in age from 22 to 30, they were also barred from France
for two years after serving their terms. They were among 15 Germans
detained, including six who were to be deported.
	   Two 27-year-olds from Hanover were to face a judge later Tuesday
and were expected to be placed under formal investigation _ a step
short of being charged _ for attempted murder, the officials said
on customary anonymity.
	   The two are accused of bashing in the head of a French
policeman, who remained in a coma Tuesday. Doctors called his
condition ``still very worrying.''
	   In Toulouse, an English fan hospitalized in ``very serious
condition'' and on life support after being stabbed in the stomach
and lungs, hospital officials said.
	   Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West Midlands,
underwent three hours of surgery after the attack that occurred
around Monday night's match between England and Romania.
	   Circumstances of the attack were unclear, police said, but
Clarke was with two other English fans who were attacked while
walking in the working-class Embalot neighborhood near the stadium.
	   The week before, violence in Marseille between English fans and
French North African youths around the England-Tunisia match left
about 50 people injured. Police arrested more than 100 people.
	   Another English fan in Toulouse was sentenced to four months in
prison for violence after Monday's match. Maurice Woodward, 26, was
also banned from returning to France for two years after his jail
term.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars kept most
violence in check. About 10 people were arrested and three injured
in a couple of minor scuffles, police said.
	   A British reporter, Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association,
broke his collarbone when English fans, who accused him of giving
them a bad name, threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling around
World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns. ... We are standing up to them.''
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches. But, he said, the show
that runs until July 10 would go on.

World Cup: South Korea now playing to save face 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout with Tuesday's practice
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-QUENTIN, France (AP) _ South Korea came to the World Cup
hoping to advance to the second round. Now the team is simply
playing to save face.
	   ``We have to keep on playing for our honor,'' said the team's
leading scorer, Choi Yong-soo, after training Tuesday. ``It has
been very hard to cope with the disappointment of our losses and
not making it to the second round.''
	   This is South Korea's fifth World Cup appearance _ including its
fourth in a row _ yet it has never won a game, much less come close
to advancing beyond the first round.
	   Following a bitter 3-1 loss to Mexico and a brutal 5-0 defeat to
the Netherlands that led to the dismissal of coach Cha Bum-kun,
South Korea will have one final chance to redeem itself against
Belgium on Thursday at Paris' showcase stadium Parc des Princes.
	   But that won't be easy.
	   Having drawn with both the Netherlands and Mexico, Belgium is
even more desperate than South Korea as it must win the game in
order to advance from Group E.
	   If it can't win, the Koreans at least hope to lose respectably.
	   ``Win or lose, it doesn't really matter to us as long as we show
our public we deserve our place among the top 32 countries in the
world,'' said Choi.
	   But the 24-year-old striker was uncertain about how the team's
performance will be regarded back in the homeland.
	   ``I don't know what type of reception we'll get when we go
home,'' said Choi. ``I guess it all depends on how we perform
against Belgium. But we cannot change things at this point, so it
gives us even a greater reason to try for a top result.''
	   The team had arrived in France hoping to improve on its
promising performances in the 1994 World Cup in the United States,
where the Koreans drew 2-2 with Spain and 0-0 with Bolivia before a
rallying late to lose just 3-2 to then-reigning champion Germany.
	   Despite the nation's high hopes, the Koreans don't feel that
pressure was the source of its troubles.
	   ``We can't attribute our lackluster performance to the pressure
imposed by our people and their high expectations,'' said Kim
Pyung-seok, standing in for Cha as coach. ``What damaged our
efforts was mostly (striker) Hwang Sun-hong's injury which put him
out of the tournament and (midfielder) Ha Seok-ju's red card during
the match against Mexico.
	   ``We had many little things go wrong, and added together they
minimized our performance here.''

World Cup: Japan must score to beat Jamaica 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout with Tuesday afternoon practice, recasts
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Still goalless at the World Cup,
Japan is counting on a strike, and maybe even win, at its final
match when Miracle Nippon meets the Reggae Boyz.
	   The Japanese blame their lack of experience as the main reason
behind their 1-0 losses to Argentina and Croatia. So they hope to
finish the tournament Friday by chalking up a win against Jamaica,
another World Cup novice.
	   ``We have to win. The other teams are looking down upon Asia,''
18-year-old midfielder Shinji Ono said after practice behind closed
doors Tuesday.
	   Although Jamaica lost by bigger margins in Group H play _ 3-1 to
Croatia and 5-0 to Argentina _ Japan has yet to score a goal at the
World Cup.
	   ``We have no wins. We have no goals. We can't end this way,''
said forward Masashi Nakayama. ``I'd like to show the offense of
Japan, even in a little way.''
	   Nakayama, who almost scored against Croatia Saturday, said Japan
is playing better with each game.
	   But he urged caution against the Jamaicans, noting that his
teammates may be under pressure, because they may want to win too
much.
	   ``It will not be an easy game,'' Nakayama said. ``They have
outstanding physical abilities.''
	   Defender Naoki Soma said the trick was to stop Jamaica from
controlling the game.
	   ``If they get the game into their rhythm, they can be very
dangerous,'' Soma said. ``We have to be aggressive, or else we're
left with nothing. All we have to do is go for the win.''
	   ``We'll be OK this time. We'll score early, and we'll win,''
said Brazilian-born forward Wagner Lopes.
	   The team travels to nearby Lyon from this southeastern resort
town Thursday for their final first-round match.

World Cup: big crowd for Italy's crucial match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ The biggest crowd of Italian
supporters in the World Cup so far showed up at the Saint-Denis
stadium Tuesday to cheer Italy's qualification for the second
round.
	   Several thousands chanted and waved Italian flags as Italy
downed Austria 2-1 in a crucial Group B match.
	   Many had their faces painted with the Italian colors. Groups of
teenagers displayed wide stripes supporting team star Alessandro
Del Piero.
	   ``Alex I love you, I'm here for you,'' one poster read.
	   The big crowd of Italians was an apparent response to
lamentations by some players who had stressed the lack of fans
support in the opening match against Chile.
	   In the World Cup game Italy tied 2-2 against the Latin American
team at Bordeaux, the few hundreds of Italians had been outnumbered
by Chilean supporters.
	   ``Italians by now are used to televised soccer,'' midfielder
Francesco Moeriero had said last week. ``They prefer to watch
matches on television, with a plate of spaghetti (pasta) and a
glass of wine on the table. We really needed their support while
trailing Chile in the second half.''
	   Alberto Barravecchia, one of the Italian supporters at
Saint-Denis Tuesday, said ``the farther the team goes in the
competition, more fans will be attending Italy's matches. We really
love this squad.''
	   He said he was going to celebrate victory with other Italian
friends in downtown Paris.
	   ``But first I want to have a pizza,'' he said.

Holbrooke arrives to make `last-chance' demands on Kosovo in Kosovo. Changes byline.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat met with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade late Tuesday to
issue what could be the final warning before NATO tries to end the
fighting in Kosovo by force.
	   The visit by Richard Holbrooke, a troubleshooter for the region
and the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is seen as the
last diplomatic effort to get Milosevic to stop his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   ``Our goal is to prevent the fighting from escalating into
general war,'' Holbrooke said in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, before flying to Belgrade.
	   In Skopje, Holbrooke met with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov, as well as the leader of
the Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   There are widespread fears that the fighting between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could spread to Macedonia, which borders
on Kosovo and also has a sizable community of restive ethnic
Albanians.
	   Western nations, which sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in
a warning to Milosevic this month, have been deliberating on what
measures they will take if he continues to defy them.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO member countries met in Brussels
Tuesday to discuss military planning in the region. They said plans
included possibly bombing targets against Serbian air defenses and
other targets both inside Kosovo and in other parts of Serbia.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo while Rugova's influence wanes.
	   Clashes continued Tuesday across the troubled province.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported that 800 Serb civilians have
evacuated one of the remaining Serb enclaves, 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of the capital Pristina near the town of Klina. They
said ethnic Albanians had driven them out, burning down 12 Serb
homes.
	   Serb police said the KLA had seized control of the village of
Belacevac.
	   Reports from Serb and ethnic Albanian sources say the KLA also
now control the town's surface coal mine Belacevac, nearby where
Serb sources nine Serbs were reportedly kidnapped Monday.
	   The pit supplies is crucial to the region, as it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of the province.
	   The Kosovo Information Center close to Rugova's party, said
Tuesday Serb forces were shelling seven villages in the Klina area.
According to the center, 12 people were wounded in the attacks, two
of them children.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   Holbrooke is credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   Milosevic met in Russia last week with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to hold new talks with Rugova. But he has refused
demands to pull back and cease security forces' fire.
	   Russia, a fellow Slavic nation, opposes Western military
pressure on its long-time ally but is trying to use its influence
with Belgrade to gain a breakthrough in peace efforts.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky held talks
with Milosevic on Tuesday, before Holbrooke's arrival. It marked
the third straight day of Russian diplomatic talks on Kosovo,
involving officials from both sides.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office afterward claimed that
authorities have taken measures to alleviate the ``negative
consequences'' of recent fighting, including ensuring freedom of
movement and protecting all citizens, regardless of nationality.

World Cup: Celebrations, bank robbery accompany Chilean victory 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with bank robbed during match
<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Thousands took to the streets Tuesday in
joyful celebrations after Chile qualified for the World Cup's
second round for the first time in 36 years.
	   During the match, however, four men took advance of a state of
national idleness to rob a downtown bank.
	   According to police, the men were wearing the national squad's
red jerseys as they walked into the bank, threatened a teller with
a handgun and quickly made off with 2 million pesos (dlrs 4,400).
	   Santiago and other cities at a standstill during the match,
which was broadcast live. Even some offices and schools tuned in
the action.
	   At the final whistle of the 1-1 tie against Cameroon, an
explosion of joy spread throughout the country. Paper fell from
high-rise office buildings and many employees took to the streets
to celebrate.
	   Authorities, which had warned that no celebrations blocking
traffic would be allowed, simply gave up. In fact, some police cars
joined the revelry and the noisy concert of horns from thousands of
vehicles.
	   Motorcades quickly jammed streets and avenues, with fans waiving
Chilean flags, many wearing the red jerseys with the numbers of the
most popular players: Ivan Zamorano's No. 9 and Marcelo Salas' No.
11.
	   President Eduardo Frei, a well known soccer fan, said ``we
suffered until the last minute but at least we did not make the
mistakes of the two previous matches,'' when Chile blew late leads
against both Italy and Austria.
	   Chile had not advanced past the first round in a World Cup since
1962, when it hosted the tournament.

Grains, soybeans soar on hot weather 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices soared Tuesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as hot, dry Midwestern weather
threatened to reduce yields for crops already hurt by cool, wet
weather this spring.
	   Temperatures were expected to rise into the 90s over the next
few days in major corn, soybean and spring wheat growing areas.
Some private forecasters are predicting that weather pattern could
remain through July.
	   The weather so far has refused to cooperate with farmer, with
drought in parts of Texas, the Delta and Florida and wet, cool
weather in California and some southeastern states endangering
corn, soybean, cotton and other crops.
	   The U.S. Agriculture Department, meanwhile, reported late Monday
that crop conditions deteriorated for a second week because of
excessive rainfall in recent weeks and cooler-than-normal
temperatures.
	   Soybeans in good to excellent condition fell 5 percent to 62
percent. Some 66 percent of the corn crop was in good to excellent
condition, down from 70 percent a week earlier mostly on problems
in the key growing states of Illinois, Iowa and Indiana.
	   The rally again prompted heavy farmer selling of stored crops,
but investors remained focused on weather prospects.
	   Wheat for December delivery, reflecting prices after the
harvest, rose 5 cents to dlrs 3.16 1-4 a bushel; December corn rose
7 1-4 cents to dlrs 2.67 3-4 a bushel; December oats rose 2 cents
to dlrs 1.39 a bushel; November soybeans rose 18 cents to dlrs 6.40
3-4 a bushel.

World Cup: Norway goalless in critical match for second-round chances 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Ronaldo put a header wide of the post
from five meters in the fourth minute, but neither side looked
particularly dangerous after that as Brazil and Norway were
goalless at halftime Tuesday night in a game critical to the
Scandinavians' chances of reaching the second round at the World
Cup.
	   Ronaldo ran onto a high cross and flicked it just wide of the
right post, missing Brazil's best chance to score in the mostly
lifeless first 45 minutes.
	   Brazil already has qualified for the second round, assured of
winning Group A and a round-of-16 meeting with Chile on Saturday in
Paris.
	   Norway entered Tuesday night's game in second place with two
points, but there place in the second round was in danger with
Morocco leading Scotland 1-0 at halftime of their final match in
Saint-Etienne. A pair of draws would send Norway through, but a
draw by Norway and a victory by either Morocco or Scotland would
send the winner of the Saint-Etienne match into the next round.
	   Brazil had the majority of possession, but its buildups usually
were diffused as they neared the top of the penalty area or headed
away as crosses entered the box.
	   Roberto Carlos blasted a 35-meter kick that Norwegian goalkeeper
Frode Grodas had to punch away in the 11th minute, but neither side
seemed particularly inspired.
	   Oyvind Leonhardsen had Norway's best chance in the 27th minute,
getting the ball in the penalty area unmarked, pivoting but firing
wide right across the face of the goal.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat met with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade late Tuesday to
issue what could be the final warning before NATO tries to end the
fighting in Kosovo by force.
	   ``Our goal is to prevent the fighting from escalating into
general war,'' Holbrooke said in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, before flying to Belgrade.
	   In Skopje, Holbrooke met with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov, as well as the leader of
the Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   There are widespread fears that the fighting between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could spread to Macedonia, which borders
on Kosovo and also has a sizable community of restive ethnic
Albanians.
	   Western nations, which sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in
a warning to Milosevic this month, have been deliberating on what
measures they will take if he continues to defy them.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO member countries met in Brussels
Tuesday to discuss military planning in the region. They said plans
included possibly bombing targets against Serbian air defenses and
other targets both inside Kosovo and in other parts of Serbia.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo while Rugova's influence wanes.
	   Clashes continued Tuesday across the troubled province.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported that 800 Serb civilians have
evacuated one of the remaining Serb enclaves, 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of the capital Pristina near the town of Klina. They
said ethnic Albanians had driven them out, burning down 12 Serb
homes.
	   Serb police said the KLA had seized control of the village of
Belacevac.
	   Reports from Serb and ethnic Albanian sources say the KLA also
now control the town's surface coal mine Belacevac, nearby where
Serb sources nine Serbs were reportedly kidnapped Monday.
	   The pit supplies is crucial to the region, as it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of the province.
	   The Kosovo Information Center close to Rugova's party, said
Tuesday Serb forces were shelling seven villages in the Klina area.
According to the center, 12 people were wounded in the attacks, two
of them children.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   Holbrooke is credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   Milosevic met in Russia last week with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to hold new talks with Rugova. But he has refused
demands to pull back and cease security forces' fire.
	   Russia, a fellow Slavic nation, opposes Western military
pressure on its long-time ally but is trying to use its influence
with Belgrade to gain a breakthrough in peace efforts.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky held talks
with Milosevic on Tuesday, before Holbrooke's arrival. It marked
the third straight day of Russian diplomatic talks on Kosovo,
involving officials from both sides.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office afterward claimed that
authorities have taken measures to alleviate the ``negative
consequences'' of recent fighting, including ensuring freedom of
movement and protecting all citizens, regardless of nationality.

Italy's lower chamber approves NATO ratification CONFORM; ADDS quotes from opposition

EDS: AMs. UPDATES with final approval of overall bill; EDITS to
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Heeding Premier Romano Prodi's last-hour appeals,
lawmakers Tuesday night gave final approval to NATO's eastward
expansion, sparing the government an embarrassing defeat in the
Chamber of Deputies.
	   After much touch-and-go, ratification of the inclusion of the
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary into NATO came thanks to the
last-minute decision of a centrist opposition party to vote yes.
	   The final vote was 310 in favor, 79 opposed and 169 abstaining.
	   Approval by a wide margin was also assured after another
last-minute decision. The conservative Freedom Alliance opposition
led by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi decided to abstain to allow
the NATO vote to pass without actually voting for a bill presented
by Prodi's center-left Olive Tree coalition.
	   The Senate, where Prodi has a majority, has already approved
ratification, which was required from all 16 NATO members and the
new members.
	   Italy's quirky politics and not any widespread opposition to
backing NATO expansion caused the cliffhanger.
	   The centrists waffled until the last minute because of
irritation over recent criticism by a Prodi ally of their leader,
former President Francesco Cossiga.

World Cup: Morocco leads 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Salaheddine Bassir punished a
sleeping Scottish defense to fire Morocco into a 1-0 halftime lead
in their decisive World Cup confrontation Tuesday.
	   With the winner hopeful of making it into the second round,
Bassir got clear of the Scottish rearguard to power home a
left-foot shot in the 22nd minute and, although Scotland created
two openings before the break, the Moroccans held on until half
time.
	   Scotland went close in the 14th minute when Monaco midfielder
John Collins floated a free kick towards Gordon Durie who beat
advancing 'keeper Driss Benzekri and a defender in the air but
glanced his header wide.
	   It was the only real chance of the first 20 minutes but then
Morocco put together a simple move to take the lead in the 22nd.
	   Tahar El-Khalej aimed a high through ball over the top of the
slow-moving Scottish defense and Bassir got clear of Colin Hendry
to fire a powerful, angled left-footed shot between 'keeper Jim
Leighton and his near post.
	   Benzekri made his first save in the 31st minute, moving to his
right to hold a well struck, close-range shot from Kevin Gallacher.
	   In the 32nd minute, the Moroccan keeper lost the ball in a
scramble in front of his goal and El Khalej did well to clear the
danger with Gallacher about to prod the ball into an empty net.
	   Six minutes before half time, Craig Burley, who scored
Scotland's equalizer in the 1-1 tie with Norway from a breakaway,
got into a similar position but his shot was blocked by the
'keeper.
	   Lineups:
	   Scotland _ Jim Leighton; Jackie McNamara, Colin Hendry, David
Weir, Tommy Boyd; Craig Burley, Paul Lambert, John Collins,
Christian Dailly; Gordon Durie, Kevin Gallacher.
	   Morocco _ Driss Benzekri; Abdelilah Saber, Lahcen Abrami,
Noureddine Naybet; El Moustafa Hadji, Smahi Triki, Gharib Amzine,
Youssef Chippo, Tahar El Khalej; Abdeljilil Hadda, Salaheddine
Bassir

ROME: Francesco Cossiga 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Cossiga's Union for Democratic Reform (UDR) made clear they were
still irked with the government.
	   ``Our yes vote is not for the government but for the
international dignity of our country,'' said Clemente Mastella, a
UDR leader.
	   And Berlusconi's bloc refused to vote yes, despite their staunch
support for the Western alliance, because they had vowed not to
bail Prodi out again on a major issue involving military matters.
	   As happened last year when Parliament debated the sending of
Italian troops into Albania, Prodi's center-left government was
forced to reach out to the center-right opposition in the Chamber
because its usual ally, the Communists, oppose NATO's expansion.
	   In the morning, Prodi told the Chamber: ``We cannot reply with a
refusal to this request from eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he
said, asking the entire Chamber of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the
name of the Italian people.''
	   After debate was broken off for several hours while Italy
watched their soccer team beat Austria in Paris in the World Cup,
Prodi returned and renewed his appeal for approval, ``so that ``so
that Italy can meet its international commitments.''
	   The government appeared to secure the support it needed Monday
night when Berlusconi's bloc decided to vote for NATO enlargement.
	   But Berlusconi insisted Prodi resign as a condition for their
vote, saying a coalition that needs opposition help on such a
crucial foreign policy issue lacks the backing to continue
governing.
	   In his address to the Chamber of Deputies Tuesday, Prodi
rejected Berlusconi's call. ``The NATO vote doesn't put the
majority at stake; the government will go on with its program,'' he
said.
	   However, immediately after the vote, several leaders of Prodi's
coalition called for meetings to verify that the coalition was
still sound.
	   The Communists had promised Prodi they would back his coalition
if the NATO spat led to a confidence vote.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Oivind Ekeland, a tall handsome
Norwegian, was playing football on the beach in Rio de Janeiro when
he caught the eye of Rosangela de Souza, a breathtaking girl from
Ipanema, straight out of the song. Something flashed.
	   Eight years later, on Tuesday night, Oivind and Rosangela were
married in the Stade Velodrome, moments before Brazil and Norway
played a World Cup match with an audience of millions of people.
	   ``The second I saw that woman I knew I wasn't leaving Rio
without her,'' Oivind remembers.
	   ``I knew immediately this was my Prince Charming, who had come
to take me away,'' Rosangela recalls.
	   He was 20, and she was 21. They stayed together for a few weeks
in Brazil, and then she went home to Stavanger, Norway, with him
for a few months. They went back to Rio together. She quit her job
as a dentist's receptionist. They've been together ever since.
	   Now they run the Beverly, a sports bar and restaurant in
Stavanger, with a 5-year-old daughter, Kristine. Last year, they
decided to tie the knot formally.
	   ``I love football,'' Oivind explained, ``and when we saw the
draw, that Brazil and Norway were playing in the World Cup, we knew
that was a sign.''
	   Besides, he added, June 23 is the Norwegians' beloved Midsummer
Night, when there is only an hour of darkness. It is the happiest
day of the year. Marseille, on the French coast, was a holiday
town. Everything was perfect.
	   Oivind wanted to ask FIFA, the World Cup organizer, for
permission to be married at the game.
	   ``We waited until May because we were nervous that they might
say no,'' he said. ``But when I called to explain, the woman
laughed and talked to the right people. A week later, we got a
letter saying it was okay.''
	   A pastor friend, Tore Thomassen, flew down from Stavanger with
30 of Oivind's pals, and his parents, to perform the marriage.
Rosangela's mother has died, and her father is sick, but her sister
came from Rio.
	   The wedding party started at the Sofitel Hotel, overlooking the
white yachts and ancient stone walls of the Old Port. A white
Cadillac convertible took them through the streets to the stadium.
	   Champagne and a fancy canapes were laid out in the VIP compound.
This would be a World Cup wedding to remember.
	   Rosangela wore a white dress with a train. Until he changed to a
tuxedo, Oivind was barefoot in Norwegian soccer shorts, a yellow
Brazil number 9 jersey with ``Ronaldo''' across the back, and a
black top hat.
	   ``The attraction was so strong on that beach in Rio that you
could feel it, like a bolt of magic'' said Geir Ekeland, Oivind's
cousin and best man. ``Everything suddenly stopped when they looked
at each other. It was unbelievable.''
	   Rosangela's reaction was clearly the same, he added. ``Just
watching her, I knew they'd be together the rest of their lives.''
	   The cousins had gone with their club team to play a friendly
game with Brazilians. Oivind at the time was studying economics,
but he played soccer every chance he got.
	   ``She now likes football as much as he does,'' Geir said.
``They'll probably eat and sleep football.''
	   But not before the honeymoon. Their wedding trip will be to
Paris for the World Cup final on July 12.

Six killed in Yemen unrest over fuel price hike blamed for violence, opposition statement 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with government to stick to its decision, saboteurs
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Six people were killed when police exchanged
gunfire with tribesmen blocking gas trucks in central Yemen Tuesday
in the fifth straight day of violence over a 40 percent hike in
fuel prices.
	   On Monday, tribesmen blew up parts of a gas pipeline, news
reports said.
	   The latest deaths raised to 12 the number of people killed in
the rioting, the worst crisis in years for the government of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
	   The trouble began on Friday when the government raised prices of
gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas to meet the International
Monetary Fund conditions for dlrs 80 million loans to Yemen, the
poorest country in the Arabian Peninsula.
	   Called to explain the situation, Prime Minister Abdul Karim
al-Iryani told Parliament Tuesday that the government will not
reverse its decision and blamed the protests, which have been
banned, on saboteurs and opposition parties. He did not name them.
	   Tuesday's shootings occurred in the city of Marib where members
of the al-Jidaan tribe stopped trucks coming in to load up on gas.
	   Four tribesmen were killed when police fired live ammunition at
the protesters, who returned fire, a tribal leader said when
contacted by telephone from San`a. Two truck drivers were killed in
the cross-fire, he said, speaking on condition he was not
identified further.
	   The demonstrators also set alight three police jeeps, said the
tribesman.
	   ``The people want the government to fight corruption and
nepotism and eliminate all unnecessary government expenditures.
They don't want to feel they are alone in suffering the burden of
the price hikes,'' said Mohammad al-Magalih, a member of a
coalition of opposition parties.
	   Three demonstrators were killed on Monday in similar violence in
Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital, San`a.
One person was killed in the southern city of Taiz on Monday and
two were shot to death in the San`a suburb of Arhab on Sunday.
	   The al-Wahdawi weekly newspaper reported Tuesday that tribesmen
used dynamite to blow up parts of a 360-kilometer (223-mile) gas
pipeline between Marib and the Red Sea port city of Rass Eissa.
	   The weekly did not give details.
	   Officials at U.S. company Hunt Oil, which operates the pipeline,
would not comment.
	   On Tuesday, police in the southern port city of Aden arrested
Abdul-Wahid al-Muradi, a leader of the opposition Socialist Party,
on charges of attempting to organize citywide protests, a party
spokesman said.
	   Increasing fuel rates are in line with IMF's requirements to
remove subsidies on petroleum products and other commodities by the
end of 1998 in Yemen.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.

Study: Feathered fossils are evidence for dinosaur origin of birds AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos WX108, WX109
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Two Chinese fossils of feathered dinosaurs _
turkey-sized animals with strong legs, stubby arms and down-covered
bodies _ are believed by an international team of scientists to be
the strongest evidence yet that birds evolved from dinosaurs.
	   The fossils are thought to be of dinosaurs that were capable of
running swiftly, flapping feathered wings and fanning out
impressive tail feathers but unable to actually fly, Phil Currie,
curator of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada said
Tuesday.
	   Currie said the fossils, dated at 120 million to 136 million
years ago, are absolute proof that birds evolved from dinosaurs, a
theory that has been hotly contested for more than 20 years.
	   ``It is a historic moment when a controversy is resolved,''
Currie said at a news conference. ``This shows that dinosaurs are
not extinct, but are well-represented by 10,000 species of birds.''
	   Fossils from the earliest known bird, called Archaeopteryx, have
been dated at 140 million to 150 million years old.
	   The new fossils closely resemble Archaeopteryx in some ways, but
the new discoveries lack the precise form of true birds,
particularly the length of wing and design of individual feathers.
For this reason, the researchers believe the fossils represent true
dinosaurs that are the immediate ancestors of the first birds.
	   Currie, Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History
and Ji Qiang and Ji Shu-An of the National Geological Museum of
China describe the fossils in studies published this week in the
journal Nature and in a National Geographic cover story.
	   Both fossils were removed by Ji Qiang and his Chinese colleagues
from a dry lakebed formation in the Liaoning Province in northeast
China. The area has gained fame in recent years for containing rich
deposits of dinosaur remains.
	   Alan Feduccia, an evolutionary biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said the Chinese discoveries ``are
very interesting,'' but he said they do not provide immediate and
final proof that birds evolved from dinosaurs. He said that the new
fossils are dated after those of the first bird. This suggests, he
said, that the fossils could be either feathered dinosaurs or
primitive birds that just happened to resemble dinosaurs.
	   ``The age dates for these things are still unresolved,'' said
Feduccia. He said if the new fossils represent ancestors of early
birds, why are they younger than the early birds.
	   ``We need to back up and take a closer look at these things
before drawing any final conclusions,'' he said.
	   Qiang, speaking through an interpreter, said that while he
believes the fossils strongly support the theory that birds evolved
from dinosaurs, it is no longer clear where the division line is
between the two animal groups.

Masters victory haunts Woods AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Perhaps the worst thing that could have happened
to Tiger Woods was winning the Masters by 12 strokes. Maybe if he
had won by only one or two shots expectations wouldn't have been so
high.
	   For the truly great, there sometimes can be nothing as heavy to
lug around as their own accomplishments.
	   Woods will win more major championships, that seems certain. But
he may never win another one as impressively as he did at Augusta
National.
	   Time will put into perspective the magnitude of that
performance. And as time passes, people will appreciate the
accomplishment rather than focus on what it possibly foreshadowed _
an era of domination by Woods.
	   Woods, however, must live with the fact that he has not
seriously contended in the five majors since his victory at Augusta
National in 1997.
	   ``It's just one of those weeks when I haven't been able to put
all the pieces together,'' Woods said after he finished 10 strokes
behind winner Lee Janzen in the U.S. Open.
	   There are three ways to look at the matter:
	   _Woods is as good as ever, but other players have raised the
level of their games.
	   _Woods' flaws pop up more during the grueling test of a major.
	   _Everything is fine; it's just that unrealistic expectations
follow Woods.
	   Let's look at each.
	   Yes, other players have improved. David Duval and Justin Leonard
emerged as among the best players in the last year, while others
like Ernie Els, Fred Couples, Tom Lehman, Payne Stewart and Janzen
have found new enthusiasm.
	   In the meantime, Woods still has the best record on the PGA Tour
since he turned pro in Augusta in 1996. Woods has seven victories,
a major championship and 13 top-three finishes in less than two
years.
	   The next best in that period is Duval, who has five wins and 10
top-10 finishes but no majors. Els, Leonard, Davis Love III and
Mark O'Meara have three victories each and a major championship.
	   Woods' record holds up against anyone.
	   Yes, Woods has battled his flaws more this year. While he is
more consistent this year and his bad shots are better than his bad
shots last year, he still has three chronic problems: missed
fairways, distance control with irons, erratic short putter.
	   His statistics in two of those three categories have gotten
worse and the third has remained mediocre.
	   Woods puts his drive in the fairway 69.6 percent of the time
this year compared to 68.6 percent last year, barely in the top 100
among PGA Tour players.
	   The number of greens he hits in regulation with his irons has
dropped from 70.3 percent last year to 67.4 percent this year,
falling from fourth on tour to 22nd. That could mean he is still
adjusting to the switch from Mizuno irons last year to Titleist
this year.
	   And Woods' average number of putts when he is on a green in
regulation has risen from 1.776 (60th place) last year to 1.797
(101st place) this year.
	   That means that while being in the fairway about the same amount
of time as last year, Woods hit fewer greens and made fewer putts
this year.
	   The result is that his scoring average has risen from 69.10 to
69.56. That's .46 more strokes per round and 1.84 more strokes per
four-round tournament.
	   Are the expectations too great for Woods? Probably, especially
from the casual fans whose interest in the game increased after
Woods' victory in the Masters.
	   But that is a burden he likely will always carry.
	   ``Most people forget how young he is,'' said Butch Harmon, who
coaches Woods. ``He is still developing, still maturing, still
getting better.''
	   And if that is the case, Woods might still realize those wild
expectations and rise above the crowd. But right now, he is one of
a handful of golfers who are among the best in the world.

After cliffhanger, Italy's lawmakers ratify NATO expansion 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: COMBINES takes, ADDS details on who voted against
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Ending a cliffhanger for Premier Romano Prodi,
lawmakers Tuesday night gave final Italian approval to NATO's
eastward expansion, sparing the government an embarrassing defeat
in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   It was Italy's quirky politics and not any widespread opposition
to NATO expansion that forced Prodi to make two last-minute appeals
to the lower chamber of Parliament to ratify the enlargement of the
military alliance.
	   After much touch-and-go, ratification of the inclusion of the
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary into NATO came thanks to the
last-hour decision of a centrist opposition party to vote yes.
	   The final vote on the entire bill was 310 in favor, 79 opposed
and 169 abstaining. Hardline Communists, who normally give Prodi's
center-left coalition a majority in the Chamber, had led the
opposition.
	   But approval by a wide margin was assured after another
last-minute decision. The conservative Freedom Alliance opposition
led by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi abstained to allow the NATO
vote to pass without actually voting for a bill presented by
Prodi's center-left Olive Tree coalition.
	   The Senate, where Prodi has a majority, has already approved
ratification, which is required of all 16 NATO members. Belgium,
the Netherlands, Britain, Turkey, Portugal and Spain are expected
to ratify enlargement in a few months.
	   The centrists had balked until the last minute because of recent
criticism by a Prodi ally of their leader, former President
Francesco Cossiga.
	   ``Our yes vote is not for the government but for the
international dignity of our country,'' said Clemente Mastella, a
leader of Cossiga's Union for Democratic Reform.
	   Berlusconi's bloc refused to vote yes, despite their staunch
support for the Western alliance, because they had vowed not to
bail Prodi out again on a major issue involving military matters.
	   As happened last year when Parliament debated the sending of
Italian troops into Albania, Prodi was forced to reach out to the
center-right opposition because Communist refusal to back the
government on military matters.
	   In the morning, Prodi told the Chamber: ``We cannot reply with a
refusal to this request from eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he
said, asking the entire Chamber of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the
name of the Italian people.''
	   After debate was broken off for several hours while Italy
watched their soccer team beat Austria in Paris in the World Cup,
Prodi returned and renewed his appeal for approval, ``so that Italy
can meet its international commitments.''
	   The government appeared to secure the support it needed Monday
night when Berlusconi's bloc decided to vote for NATO enlargement.
	   But Berlusconi insisted Prodi resign as a condition for their
vote, saying a coalition that needs opposition help on such a
crucial foreign policy issue lacks the backing to continue
governing.
	   In his address to the Chamber of Deputies Tuesday, Prodi
rejected Berlusconi's call to resign. ``The NATO vote doesn't put
the majority at stake; the government will go on with its
program,'' he said.
	   However, immediately after the vote, several leaders of Prodi's
coalition called for meetings to verify that the coalition was
still sound, and Prodi said he would discuss the situation with
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who could ask him to resign
if he feels the coalition is shaky.
	   However, the Communists have promised Prodi they would back his
coalition if the NATO spat led to a confidence vote.

Firm agrees to pay dlrs 400,000 fine for fixing citric acid prices 
</HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A Dutch subsidiary of a French agribusiness
giant agreed Tuesday to plead guilty and pay a dlrs 400,000 fine
for its role in an international conspiracy to fix the price of
citric acid around the world, the U.S. Justice Department said.
	   Cerestar Bioproducts BV, a Dutch subsidiary of Eridania
Beghim-Say SA, was the fifth company to agree to a guilty plea and
fine in the citric acid investigation by the department' antitrust
division. Earlier, the government obtained a guilty plea and dlrs
30 million fine from Archer Daniels Midland Co., an American
agribusiness conglomerate.
	   A single criminal count of violating the Sherman Act was filed
in U.S. District Court in San Francisco against Cerestar. The
department said the guilty plea would be entered within days.
	   A string of international price-fixing prosecutions over the
past 20 months has produced more than dlrs 400 million in fines,
including dlrs 70 million from Archer Daniels Midland in the probe
of another food additive, lysine.
	   In Tuesday's case, Cerestar's managing director, Silvio Kluzer,
an Italian citizen, also agreed to plead guilty and pay a criminal
fine of dlrs 40,000 for his role in the citric acid plot, the
department said.
	   Cerestar and Kluzer agreed to cooperate with the department's
continuing investigation of the citric acid cartel.
	   Citric acid, derived from various sugars, is used to flavor or
preserve soft drinks, processed foods, detergents, pharmaceuticals
and cosmetics. Worldwide sales of citric acid are dlrs 1.2 billion
a year.
	   The government alleged that Kluzer and Cerestar plotted with the
world's major citric acid producers to eliminate competition from
November 1992 until April 1994.
	   They held meetings in Chicago and elsewhere to discuss the
prices and sales of citric acid in the United States and abroad,
agreed to increase those prices and allocate market shares and
monitored and policed those agreements, the government said.
	   In addition to Archer Daniels Midland, the department has
obtained guilty pleas and fines from three other companies in the
citric acid cartel since August 1996:
	   _Haarmann &AMP; Reimer Corp., a New Jersey-based subsidiary of
German pharmaceutical and chemical giant Bayer AG, was fined dlrs
50 million. A senior executive, Hans Hartmann of Haarman &AMP; Reimer
Gmbh, was fined dlrs 150,000.
	   _F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., headquartered in Switzerland, was
fined dlrs 14 million. Udo Haas, former managing director of its
citric acid affiliate, paid a dlrs 150,000 fine.
	   _Jungbunzlauer International AG, headquartered in Switzerland,
paid a fine of dlrs 11 million. Its chairman and president, Rainer
Bichlbauer, paid a dlrs 150,000 fine.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's brother says he traveled a
``tunnel of grief'' in the weeks after learning in long-distance
telephone calls to his home in South Africa that she had been
killed in a car crash.
	   The first caller to his Cape Town home in the early hours of
Aug. 31 told him Diana had merely been injured, Charles Spencer
said in an interview with Radio Times magazine, published
Wednesday. ``I got up out of bed and I went downstairs and turned
on the television and flicked between CNN and BBC World,'' the
satellite news channels.
	   ``And both of them had independent witnesses at that stage who
said they'd seen her walk away and that she'd probably broken her
arm and had a gash in her thigh,'' said the 9th Earl Spencer, who
was promoting a new television program about Diana to be broadcast
Wednesday night.
	   But then his eldest sister Sarah McCorquodale called to tell him
Diana had been seriously injured, and had possibly sustained brain
damage, Spencer said. He called his other sister Jane Fellowes,
whose husband Robert is an aide to Queen Elizabeth II.
	   ``And Jane said 'Oh, hang on, Robert's just on the other line to
Paris' and then she stopped talking and then I heard Robert go `Oh,
no!' and I remember just sitting there in shock for several
hours,'' Spencer recalled.
	   ``And then my children came through - my three little girls -
and I said `I've got some awful news, I'm afraid Aunt Diana's been
killed' and the little middle twin of mine, she looked at me and
smiled and said `But not in real life, Daddy'.''
	   Spencer, 34, took part in and edited ``Diana: My Sister the
Princess,'' which will be screened by the British Broadcasting
Corp. It includes a televised tour or the Spencer family estate,
Althorp, and home video footage of the young Diana.
	   Spencer, who is unhappy with some of the fundraising campaigns
sanctioned by Diana's memorial fund, has ordered that proceeds from
the program sales go direct to Diana's six favorite charities.
	   The earl told RadioTimes he found his sister's highly public
funeral on Sept. 6 ``harrowing really. I was walking down a tunnel
of grief and you could feel the intensity of that grief every
footstep,'' he said.
	   ``And you'd walk a hundred yards in complete silence, but with
this grief bearing down on you, and then somebody would scream -
almost in tortured pain they'd bellow - which was just awful.
	   ``And then other people would be sobbing, others would applaud
and then silence again. It just seemed endless to me.''
	   He said the dignity showed by Diana's sons Prince William and
Prince Harry as they walked behind their mother's coffin helped him
get through the day. ``I'd have been in tears if they hadn't been
there and, being a generation senior to them, I couldn't cry if
they weren't,'' he said.
	   ``My admiration for those two boys is without bounds now. How
they could have got through it - it's the most amazing display of
courage that I'll ever see.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu edged Israel
closer to a national referendum on an Israeli West Bank troop
withdrawal, saying he considered a broad public consensus essential
for any deal.
	   Meanwhile, the PLO said it has complained to the U.N. Security
Council about Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes _ even as
Israel destroyed another house and four Bedouin shacks in the West
Bank on Tuesday.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States to step
up pressure on Israel and go public with a U.S. plan for a
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said the appeal was contained in a letter by Arafat to
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Albright has urged Netanyahu to make a decision quickly on the
U.S. proposal, first introduced in January. Netanyahu has ignored
informal U.S. deadlines and the United States has taken no action.
	   Israel's Channel 2 said Netanyahu could announce as early as
Wednesday a non-binding referendum, or nationwide public opinion
poll, on the U.S. proposal.
	   Such a referendum would delay a withdrawal for at least two
months because parliament would have to pass special legislation
first.
	   ``I think that the issue of reaching a broad public consensus is
not a joke, it is a very important and essential matter. I always
said I wanted the broadest consensus possible for the agreements
that I deliver,'' Netanyahu said Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu met Tuesday with members of a committee he appointed
to research options for a referendum.
	   Jewish settlers who oppose any troop withdrawal from West Bank
land, which they believe was promised to the Jews by God, protested
outside Netanyahu's office against any pullout deal.
	   Families pitched tents adorned with Israeli flags, hauled in
portable bathrooms and brought provisions to stay for at least a
month.
	   ``What we're saying here is: Bibi, don't cross the line,'' said
settler leader Ahron Domb, referring to the prime minister by his
nickname.
	   Also Tuesday, Israel and the Palestinians accused each other of
violating an agreement not to make changes in Jerusalem until the
disputed city's future has been decided in peace talks.
	   On Sunday, Israel's Cabinet approved a plan to extend Jerusalem
municipal authority to nearby Jewish West Bank settlements, a step
that falls short of annexation but strengthens ties between the
settlements and the city.
	   In response, the Palestinians turned to the U.N. Security
Council, requesting an urgent meeting on the plan, which they said
was aimed at cementing Israeli rule over all of the city.
	   They also complained to the Security Council about the Israeli
demolition of Arab homes.
	   Israel routinely demolishes Palestinian homes built without
licenses in Jerusalem and areas of the West Bank still under
Israeli control. The Palestinians say Israel rarely grants
construction permits to Palestinians, forcing expanding families to
build without permission.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as a capital. Israel captured east
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, and has said it
would never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.

After cliffhanger, Italy's lawmakers ratify NATO expansion EDITS to tighten 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with quote from deputy premier on government's future;
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Ending a cliffhanger for Premier Romano Prodi,
lawmakers Tuesday night gave final Italian approval to NATO's
eastward expansion, sparing the government an embarrassing defeat
in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   It was Italy's quirky politics and not any widespread opposition
to NATO expansion that forced Prodi to make two last-minute appeals
to the lower chamber of Parliament to ratify enlargement of the
military alliance.
	   After much touch-and-go, ratification of the inclusion of the
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary into NATO came thanks to the
last-hour decision of a centrist opposition party to vote yes.
	   The final vote on the entire bill was 310 in favor, 79 opposed
and 169 abstaining. Hardline Communists, who normally give Prodi's
center-left coalition a majority in the Chamber, had led the
opposition.
	   But approval by a wide margin was assured after another
last-minute decision. The conservative Freedom Alliance opposition
led by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi abstained to allow the NATO
vote to pass without actually voting for a bill presented by
Prodi's center-left Olive Tree coalition.
	   The Senate, where Prodi has a majority, has already approved
ratification, which is required of all 16 NATO members. Belgium,
the Netherlands, Britain, Turkey, Portugal and Spain are expected
to ratify enlargement in a few months.
	   The centrists had balked until the last minute because of recent
criticism by a Prodi ally of their leader, former President
Francesco Cossiga.
	   ``Our yes vote is not for the government but for the
international dignity of our country,'' said Clemente Mastella, a
leader of Cossiga's Union for Democratic Reform.
	   Berlusconi's bloc refused to vote yes, despite their staunch
support for the Western alliance, because they had vowed not to
bail Prodi out again on a major issue involving military matters.
	   As happened last year when Parliament debated the sending of
Italian troops into Albania, Prodi was forced to reach out to the
center-right opposition because Communist refusal to back the
government on military matters.
	   In the morning, Prodi told the Chamber: ``We cannot reply with a
refusal to this request from eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' he
said, asking the entire Chamber of Deputies to cast a ``vote in the
name of the Italian people.''
	   After debate was broken off for several hours while Italy
watched their soccer team beat Austria in Paris in the World Cup,
Prodi returned and renewed his appeal for approval, ``so that Italy
can meet its international commitments.''
	   Berlusconi insisted Prodi resign as a condition for their vote,
saying a coalition that needs opposition help on such a crucial
foreign policy issue shouldn't continue to govern.
	   But Prodi rejected the demand. ``The NATO vote doesn't put the
majority at stake; the government will go on with its program,''
Prodi told the Chamber of Deputies.
	   However, immediately after the vote, Deputy Premier Walter
Veltroni, said coalition leaders would meet shortly to test the
health of the majority.
	   ``We'll see if we have before us 2 1-2 years,'' Veltroni said,
referring to the remaining term of Parliament.
	   However, the Communists have promised Prodi they would back his
coalition if the NATO spat led to a confidence vote, making it
appear unlikely the government was in any immiment danger.

World Cup: big crowd for Italy's crucial match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ The biggest crowd of Italian
supporters in the World Cup so far showed up at the Saint-Denis
stadium Tuesday to cheer Italy's qualification for the second
round.
	   Several thousands chanted and waved Italian flags as Italy
downed Austria 2-1 in a crucial Group B match.
	   Many had their faces painted with the Italian colors. Groups of
teenagers displayed wide stripes supporting team star Alessandro
Del Piero.
	   ``Alex I love you, I'm here for you,'' one poster read.
	   The big crowd of Italians was an apparent response to
lamentations by some players who had stressed the lack of fans
support in the opening match against Chile.
	   In the World Cup game Italy tied 2-2 against the Latin American
team at Bordeaux, the few hundreds of Italians had been outnumbered
by Chilean supporters.
	   ``Italians by now are used to televised soccer,'' midfielder
Francesco Moeriero had said last week. ``They prefer to watch
matches on television, with a plate of spaghetti (pasta) and a
glass of wine on the table. We really needed their support while
trailing Chile in the second half.''
	   Alberto Barravecchia, one of the Italian supporters at
Saint-Denis Tuesday, said ``the farther the team goes in the
competition, more fans will be attending Italy's matches. We really
love this squad.''
	   He said he was going to celebrate victory with other Italian
friends in downtown Paris.
	   ``But first I want to have a pizza,'' he said.

Better late than never: Venus earns 1st Wimbledon win AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Court 13 at Wimbledon is tucked in a
remote corner past the rose bushes at the end of a narrow walkway,
and Venus Williams found it just in time Tuesday.
	   Following a three-hour rain delay, Williams showed up for her
opening-round match 10 minutes late, meaning she was within five
minutes of being defaulted.
	   Once on the court, getting to the second round was no problem.
Williams beat Jana Nejedly 6-3, 6-3 to earn her first Wimbledon
victory.
	   Williams, who wears a watch while playing, denied that she was
late for her match. But she admitted being confused about the
location of her court, and a WTA Tour official said Williams barely
avoided a default.
	   ``I could never figure out where Court 13 was,'' said Williams.
``I thought I was playing on Court 18. I thought that was Court 13,
but no. So generally I got there on time, I believe.''
	   If the layout at Wimbledon was a problem for Williams, the grass
and rain weren't. She easily dispatched Nejedly, a Canadian ranked
98th, then proclaimed herself a contender for her first Grand Slam
title.
	   ``Everyone wants to win Wimbledon, especially the players who
are doing well this year,'' she said. ``I'm one of those players.''
	   The seventh-seeded Williams, who turned 18 last week, is the
oldest member of the tour's heralded teen-age vanguard, which also
includes her 16-year-old sister, Serena.
	   The sisters could meet in the fourth round. Their quarter of the
draw now looks easier due to the withdrawal of 17-year-old Anna
Kournikova because of a thumb injury.
	   Venus' victory Tuesday represented a personal breakthrough. She
lost in the first round on grass at Eastbourne last week and lost a
first-rounder in her Wimbledon debut a year ago.
	   ``I think through the years I'll play better on grass as I
understand more,'' she said.
	   Williams, still sporting the beaded hair that gave the
tournament a flashy new look last year, said she has just one
complaint about staid old Wimbledon: the extensive electronic
security.
	   ``It's not so bad, except that people generally want to scan you
out, and I'm not into all that scanning,'' she said. ``When you
come in in the car they want to scan, and when you leave ... they
want to scan. When you come in the gate they want to scan.
	   ``Only one scan a day.''
	   Once Williams passed through security and found Court 13, she
hugged the baseline for most of her match, settling into rallies of
up to two dozen shots.
	   The 6-foot-1{ American preferred to hit slice forehands rather
than charging the net _ conservative strategy from such a powerful
player. The cautious approach probably wouldn't work against, say,
defending champion Martina Hingis.
	   ``I wasn't really trying too many new things,'' Williams said.
``My plan was more or less make my shots and get off the court
before it rains.''
	   That didn't happen; a two-hour delay interrupted the second set.
But Williams finished strong, then promised to serve-and-volley
more as the tournament progresses.
	   ``More would be at least one,'' she said with a chuckle,
``because I didn't attempt it at all today.''
	   And so Williams may show up at the net more in the second round.
She'll likely show up on time, too.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez testified before the Supreme Court Tuesday that he had
nothing to do with the kidnapping of a French businessman in 1983
by the GAL death squad.
	   Twelve people, mostly former security officials and police, are
on trial accused of kidnapping Segundo Marey in the first violent
action blamed on the GAL, the Spanish initials for Anti-terrorist
Liberation Groups.
	   The prosecution contends that the illegal group was organized by
Gonzalez's government to combat the armed ETA Basque separatists.
	   The interior minister at the time, Jose Barrionuevo and his
deputy, Rafael Vera, are the only defendants who have denied all
charges of being involved with the kidnapping or GAL.
	   The other defendants in the trial that began on May 25 have
admitted to participating in the kidnapping and said it was
authorized by Barrionuevo and Vera. Some have testified that
Gonzalez knew what was going on.
	   The case is being tried in Supreme Court because it involves a
government minister.
	   Marey's kidnapping was the first violent action by the GAL,
which killed 27 people in its pursuit of ETA members in southern
France between 1983 and 1987. Eight of those killed turned out to
have no ties to the ETA, the Basque initials for Basque Homeland
and Liberty.
	   During his three hours in the witness chair, Gonzalez said the
trial was part of a plot to bring up old issues to discredit his
Socialist party.
	   Gonzalez said that he never ordered the ``dirty war'' against
ETA. ``It never occurred to me to do something like that,'' he told
the 11-judge panel. He also said that during his thirteen years in
office ``neither Interior minister Jose Barrionuevo nor anyone else
of the cabinet'' proposed him illegal actions in southern France.
	   Prior witnesses, including current Deputy Prime Minister
Francisco Alvarez Cascos, have testified Gonzalez was consulted
before the kidnapping.

Three Germans sentenced; policeman, Englishman in critical condition 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with German under formal investigation; TRIMS
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced
three more Germans to prison as France grappled with World Cup
violence that has left a policeman in a coma and an English fan in
critical condition.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
that has erupted in several French cities hosting the soccer
championship that began June 10. More than 200 people have been
arrested.
	   A court in the northern city of Bethune, near Lille, convicted
the three Germans to a year in prison for attacking French police
in some of the World Cup's worst violence. It followed Sunday's
game between Germany and Yugoslavia in nearby Lens.
	   Ranging in age from 22 to 30, they were also barred from France
for two years after serving their terms.
	   Authorities probing the attack in Lens that left the policeman
in a coma placed a German skinhead under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged _ for attempted murder.
	   Markus Warnecke, a 27-year-old tattoo shop owner from Hanover,
was ordered to remain in jail. He denied the allegation and refused
to talk to police, said his lawyer, Bertrand Wambeke.
	   Another 27-year-old German man was also held for allegedly
bashing in the head of the policeman, Daniel Nivel, 43. Doctors
called Nivel's condition ``still very worrying.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said. Six Germans were to be deported.
	   President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling around
World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   In Toulouse, an English fan was hospitalized in ``very serious
condition'' and on life support Tuesday after being stabbed in the
stomach and lungs, hospital officials said.
	   Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West Midlands,
underwent three hours of surgery after the attack that occurred
around Monday night's match between England and Romania.
	   Circumstances of the attack were unclear, police said, but
Clarke was with two other English fans who were attacked while
walking in the working-class Embalot neighborhood near the stadium.
	   The week before, violence in Marseille between English fans and
French North African youths around the England-Tunisia match left
about 50 people injured. Police arrested more than 100 people.
	   Another English fan in Toulouse was sentenced to four months in
prison for violence after Monday's match. Maurice Woodward, 26, was
also banned from returning to France for two years after his jail
term.
	   A British reporter, Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association,
broke his collarbone when English fans, who accused him of giving
them a bad name, threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon
in Toulouse on Monday.

Holbrooke arrives to make `last-chance' demands on Kosovo with Milosevic.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Saying that ''we are at a critical
moment,'' a top U.S. diplomat met Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade Tuesday to issue what could be the final
warning before NATO tries to end the fighting in Kosovo by force.
	   Emerging from four hours of talks with Milosevic, special envoy
for the Balkans Richard Holbrooke said the Yugoslav leader
reaffirmed an earlier promise to allow foreign diplomats to observe
the conflict in Kosovo.
	   ''We have to try to prevent the fighting from escalating into a
general war,'' Holbrooke said after he and Chris Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, met Milosevic.
	   ''We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' said Holbrooke, who last week was named as the next U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations.
	   Holbrooke said the meeting was confidential and he would reveal
nothing about it. He is to travel to Kosovo Wednesday, visiting its
capital Pristina and areas west of that city where fighting has
been heavy in recent weeks. He said he would return to Belgrade
Thursday, and travel to Athens, Greece on Friday.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke met in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and
President Kiro Gligorov, as well as the leader of the Kosovo
Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Holbrooke called his meeting with Rugova ''very productive,''
but again declined details.
	   There are widespread fears that the fighting between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could spread to Macedonia, which borders
on Kosovo and also has a sizable community of restive ethnic
Albanians.
	   Western nations, which sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in
a warning to Milosevic this month, have been deliberating on what
measures they will take if he continues to defy them.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO member countries met in Brussels
Tuesday to discuss military planning in the region. They said plans
included possibly bombing targets against Serbian air defenses and
other targets both inside Kosovo and in other parts of Serbia.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting in Kosovo
escalated earlier this year between Serb-led army and police forces
and the KLA, which is gaining in public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo while Rugova's influence wanes.
	   Clashes continued Tuesday across the troubled province.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported that 800 Serb civilians have
evacuated one of the remaining Serb enclaves, 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of the capital Pristina near the town of Klina. They
said ethnic Albanians had driven them out, burning down 12 Serb
homes.
	   Serb police said the KLA had seized control of the village of
Belacevac.
	   Reports from Serb and ethnic Albanian sources say the KLA also
now control the town's surface coal mine Belacevac, nearby where
Serb sources nine Serbs were reportedly kidnapped Monday.
	   The pit supplies is crucial to the region, as it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of the province.
	   The Kosovo Information Center close to Rugova's party, said
Tuesday Serb forces were shelling seven villages in the Klina area.
According to the center, 12 people were wounded in the attacks, two
of them children.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   Holbrooke is credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   Milosevic met in Russia last week with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to hold new talks with Rugova. But he has refused
demands to pull back and cease security forces' fire.
	   Russia, a fellow Slavic nation, opposes Western military
pressure on its long-time ally but is trying to use its influence
with Belgrade to gain a breakthrough in peace efforts.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky held talks
with Milosevic on Tuesday, before Holbrooke. Statements indicated
the meeting brought no breakthrough.

World Cup: Two late goals give Norway 2-1 victory, send it to second round 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Kjetil Rekdal converted an 89th-minute
penalty kick and Norway rallied with two goals in the final seven
minutes to move into the second round of the World Cup with a
dramatic 2-1 victory over Brazil Tuesday night.
	   Trailing 1-0 and looking like it was headed out after the first
round, Tore Andre Flo gave Norway hope with a remarkable individual
effort in the 83rd minute.
	   Flo ran onto a ball from deep in the back, one-touched it to the
middle of the penalty area and beat Taffarel with a strike from 12
meters.
	   With Morocco beating Scotland 3-0 in Saint-Etienne and sure to
advance from Group A with a Brazil victory or draw, American
referee Esse Baharmast called Junior Baino for knocking down Flo as
the two battled for position on a high ball.
	   Rekdal firmly stuck his spot chance into the lower left side of
the net and Norway reached the second round of the World Cup for
the first time in three tries.
	   The Norwegian reserves sprinted onto the field to hug and
contratulate their teammates.
	   Bebeto converted a Denilson cross with a header in the 78th
minute and Brazil looked the sure winner as the game wore down.
	   Brazil didn't look inspired either, but it contolled the
possession and had the more dangerous chances.
	   Ronaldo put a header wide of the post from five meters in the
fourth minute, but neither side looked particularly dangerous until
the final 20 minutes.
	   Brazil already had qualified for the second round, assured of
winning Group A and a round-of-16 meeting with Chile on Saturday in
Paris.
	   Norway's victory finished it with five points from a pair of
draws and Tuesday night's victory.
	   Throughout the match Brazil had the majority of possession, but
its buildups usually were diffused as they neared the top of the
penalty area or headed away as crosses entered the box.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Brazil: Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Goncalves, Roberto

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Six people were killed when police exchanged
gunfire with tribesmen blocking gas trucks in central Yemen Tuesday
in the fifth straight day of violence over a 40 percent hike in
fuel prices.
	   Tribesmen also blew up part of a gas pipeline, news reports
said.
	   The latest deaths raised to 12 the number of people killed in
rioting since Friday when the government announced it had raised
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas to meet the
International Monetary Fund's demands.
	   Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani told Parliament on Tuesday
that the government will not reverse its decision and blamed the
protests, which have been banned, on saboteurs and opposition
parties. He did not provide specifics.

World Cup: Morocco wins 3-0 but both go out AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Morocco scored a 3-0 victory over
Scotland in a gallant but unsuccessful bid to make it to the second
round of the World Cup Tuesday and the result left the Scots first
round losers for the eighth time in a row.
	   Salaheddine Bassir and Abdeljilil Hadda punished the sleeping
Scottish defense with strikes in the 22nd and 47th minutes and
Bassir added a third five minutes from the end.
	   It looked enough to put the Moroccans into the second round for
the second time in their history until Norway scored a
come-from-behind 2-1 victory over defending titlist Brazil in
Marseille.
	   Brazil won the group ahead of Norway with the Moroccans third
and Scotland, who have never made the second round, last.
	   Scotland went close in the 14th when Monaco midfielder John
Collins floated a free kick towards Gordon Durie who beat advancing
'keeper Driss Benzekri and a defender in the air but glanced his
header wide.
	   It was the only real chance of the first spell but then Morocco
put together a simple move to take the lead in the 22nd.
	   Tahar El-Khalej aimed a high through ball over the top of the
slow-moving Scottish defense and Bassir got clear of Colin Hendry
to fire a powerful, angled left-footed shot between 'keeper Jim
Leighton and his near post.
	   A minute later the Scots appealed for a penalty when Lahcen
Abrami appeared a block a cross fromk Jackie McNamara with his left
arm but it was ruled no foul by the referee.
	   On the half hour, Durie tried the long-range approach, firing a
30-meter (yard) drive that flashed past the post with Benzekri
diving acrobatically across goal.
	   Benzekri made his first save in the 31st minute, moving to his
right to hold a well struck, close-range shot from Kevin Gallacher.
	   In the 32nd minute, the Moroccan keeper lost the ball in a
scramble in front of his goal and El Khalej did well to clear the
danger with Gallacher about to prod the ball into an empty net.
	   Six minutes before half time, Craig Burley, who scored
Scotland's equalizer in the 1-1 tie with Norway from a breakaway,
got into a similar position but his shot was blocked by the
'keeper.
	   Two minutes into the second half the Moroccans struck again with
another breakaway goal.
	   El Moustafa Hadji fired another long pass from deep and Hadda
outpaced Scottish defender David Weir in a dash down the left.
Hadda got in front of Weir and tried an audacious lobbed shot.
Leighton got his fingertips to the ball but turned to watch it
bounce agonisingly behind him into empty net.
	   It was even worse for Scotland seven minutes later when Burley
was shown the red card for a tackle from behind on Bassir in the
center circle.
	   Though hugely outnumbered by the Scots in the Geoffrey-Guichard
stadium, the noisy Moroccans began chanting ``Brazil, Brazil'' to
compare their team with the mighty four-time titlist.
	   With the one-man advantage and a two-goal lead, the Moroccans
cleverly kept possession and allowed the Scots few chances
	   The Moroccans added a third five minutes from the end when Hadda
flicked a pass to Bassir, who lobbed the ball cleverly over Weir
and fired home from 12 meters, the ball deflecting slightly off
Hendry's knee.
	   Lineups:
	   Scotland _ Jim Leighton; Jackie McNamara (Tosh McKinlay, 54th),
Colin Hendry, David Weir, Tommy Boyd; Craig Burley, Paul Lambert,
John Collins, Christian Dailly; Gordon Durie (Scott Booth, 84th),
Kevin Gallacher.
	   Morocco _ Driss Benzekri; Abdelilah Saber (Youssef Rossi, 72nd),
Lahcen Abrami, Noureddine Naybet; El Moustafa Hadji, Smahi Triki,
Gharib Amzine (Rachid Azzouzi, 77th), Youssef Chippo (Jamal
Sellami, 87th), Tahar El Khalej; Abdeljilil Hadda, Salaheddine
Bassir

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Kjetil Rekdal converted an 89th-minute
penalty kick and Norway rallied with two goals in the final seven
minutes to move into the second round of the World Cup with a
dramatic 2-1 victory over Brazil Tuesday night.
	   Trailing 1-0 and looking like it was headed out after the first
round, Tore Andre Flo gave Norway hope with a remarkable individual
effort in the 83rd minute.
	   Flo ran onto a ball from deep in the back, one-touched it to the
middle of the penalty area and beat goalkeeper Taffarel with a
strike from 12 meters.
	   With Morocco beating Scotland 3-0 in Saint-Etienne and sure to
advance from Group A with a Brazil victory or draw, American
referee Esse Baharmast called Junior Baino for knocking down Flo as
the two battled for position on a high ball.
	   Rekdal firmly stuck his spot chance into the lower left side of
the net and Norway reached the second round of the World Cup for
the first time in three tries.
	   The Norwegian reserves sprinted onto the field to hug and
contratulate their teammates.
	   The Scandinavians will face Italy on Saturday in Marseille.
	   Brazil controlled the possession throughout and finally looked
like the sure winner when Bebeto converted a Denilson cross with a
header in the 78th minute.
	   Denilson fell but still managed to keep possesion, spin away
from Norwegian defender Henning and strike a left-footed cross
chest high across the penalty area. Streaking through the penalty
area, Bebeto put his head onto the ball and directed it into the
middle of the net.
	   Until then neither side looked particularly inspired, but Brazil
contolled the possession and had the more dangerous chances.
	   Ronaldo put a header wide of the post from five meters in the
fourth minute, but neither side looked particularly dangerous until
the final 20 minutes.
	   Brazil already had qualified for the second round, assured of
winning Group A and a round-of-16 meeting with Chile on Saturday in
Paris.
	   The victory finished Norway five points and five goals in three
games, a far cry from 1994 when it went 1-1-1 and scored only once.
The only other time it reached the World Cup finals, in 1938, it
also was eliminated in the first round.

Hingis survives threat of first-round dousing AP Tennis Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ A spitting nuisance of a rain, not
enough to fill a tea cup, washed away 60 matches Tuesday and doused
Lisa Raymond's shot at knocking out defending Wimbledon champion
Martina Hingis in the first round.
	   No other sport would have come to a halt in so flimsy a drizzle,
but for tennis players skidding on slick new grass it was too, too
much. Sort of like some of the days last year in the wettest of all
Wimbledons.
	   Only one match was completed on Centre Court, and for Raymond it
lasted about an hour and a half too long. That was the time of the
rain delay, from which the 19th-ranked Raymond emerged as if in a
stupor.
	   After giving Hingis fits in the first set with booming backhands
and gutsy, go-for-broke winners, Raymond came out of the locker
room the second time and immediately double-faulted, dropped serve
twice and lost her fourth straight game to fall behind 5-1.
	   The American, who won their last match on carpet in Hingis'
adopted Swiss homeland, didn't go quietly, but she went
nevertheless, 7-5, 6-3, after saving three match points, breaking
Hingis and holding at love to 5-3.
	   ``I definitely didn't come out of the blocks (after the rain
delay) as well as I had in the first set,'' Raymond said. ``It
definitely was not to my advantage to stop. I think I played a lot
more loose points in the second set ... and you just can't do that
against her.''
	   Hingis is chunkier than a year ago, looks more vulnerable, and
is surrounded by challengers young and old. But she has a knack for
getting out of trouble and putting pressure on her opponents.
Raymond kept Hingis deep, ran her from side to side, and still
couldn't put her away.
	   Perhaps no shot was more telling of Hingis' ability to come up
with what's needed as the running forehand she drilled down the
line from off court to give her set point in the first set.
Raymond, deflated by that shot after doing so much to get Hingis
out of position, weakly netted a backhand on the next point to drop
the set.
	   ``It's very frustrating,'' Raymond said. ``Martina seems to be
able to come up with those shots, and that's one of the reasons why
she's No. 1 in the world. That's one of her talents.''
	   Yet with a field that includes seven-time champion Steffi Graf,
resurgent Monica Seles, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Jana Novotna,
and young threats like Venus and Serena Williams, Raymond hardly
thought Hingis has a lock on this title again.
	   ``I think she's vulnerable here,'' Raymond said. ``Any top
player is vulnerable in the first couple of round. That was why it
was such a good opportunity for me today, because I knew she hadn't
played any grass court matches and she's got the pressure of
defending champion. I think the loss at the French probably
affected her as well. She feels like she's got something to prove
again.''
	   Novotna, a finalist for the second time last year and No. 3 seed
this year, won her opener, 6-2, 6-2 against fellow Czech Sandra
Kleinova. No. 7 Venus Williams, a first-round loser in her
Wimbledon debut a year ago, followed her sister into the second
round with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Canada's Jana Nejedly.
	   The only seeded man to complete a match, No. 6 Patrick Rafter,
won 6-1, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1 against Ivo Heuberger.
	   Raymond said she could see the nervousness and uncertainty on
Hingis' face.
	   ``I know Martina, and we're friends off the court, and you can
just sense when someone's a little apprehensive, a little
not-at-ease with themselves or with the situation,'' Raymond said.
``Just in the warm-up, I could tell that she wasn't striking the
ball as well as she usually does. I'm sure that had a lot to do
with some nerves.''
	   Hingis admitted as much, though she's still as confident, or
cocky, as ever.
	   ``I hope now it is going to be easier for the next two or three
rounds,'' she said. ``Last year I was still kind of the underdog. I
was seeded No. 1 when I won the Australian Open and made the French
final, but on grass nobody expected me to win it or gave me the
credit. Now I am the favorite, since (Anna) Kournikova is not in
and (Mary) Pierce lost, and nobody know what is going to happen
with Steffi. It is quite a different feeling to come back here as a
defending champion with the opening round on Centre Court. It feels
good.''

Libya violates U.N. air embargo, sends plane to Chad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Libyan plane flew to Chad and returned
Tuesday, violating a 6-year U.N. air embargo, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported. It said the country is planning more such
flights.
	   The plane landed in Tripoli international airport with a senior
Chadian diplomat and the wife of Chad's parliament speaker, MENA
said. It gave their names in Arabic as Adam Kojo and Marina
Kamochi.
	   The airliner went to Chad on Monday, MENA said but it was not
clear why the two Chadians were brought to Libya. MENA quoted the
sources as saying that Libyan planes will make more flights in the
coming days.
	   This is not the first violation of the air embargo, which was
imposed in 1992 after the north African country refused to hand
over for trial two suspects wanted in Britain and the United States
for the bombing of a U.S. jetliner over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie in 1988. The attack killed 270 people.
	   MENA quoted unnamed sources as saying that Monday's and
Tuesday's flights were in compliance with an African nations'
summit earlier this month, which called for defying the embargo.
	   Since 1994, Libya has violated the ban every year, ferrying
pilgrims aboard Libyan airliners to Saudi Arabia to perform the
annual hajj or major Islamic pilgrimage in the Saudi holy city of
Mecca.
	   Each time, the Security Council has deemed the flights in
violation of sanctions but issued only mild rebukes.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has himself defied the embargo by
flying to an Arab summit in Cairo in 1996 and making a tour of West
Africa last year.
	   In April, an Italian Parliament member flew into the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, to seek the release of an employee of an Italian
construction company in Libya who was being held there by the
government for non-repayment of debts by his company.

Eds: RECASTS to LEAD with Iraq challenging findings, blasts leaks,
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday rejected a report by a
U.S. laboratory that found traces of the deadly VX nerve gas agent
in Iraqi missile warheads and demanded the findings be reviewed by
a neutral country or experts from several nations.
	   U.S. and diplomatic sources confirmed Tuesday that chemical
analysis of Iraqi warheads, handed over to the U.N. Special
Commission, revealed traces of VX despite Baghdad's claims that it
never successfully manufactured weapons from the nerve gas agent.
	   The head of the commission, Richard Butler, is expected to brief
the Security Council on the findings Wednesday.
	   The council has said it will not lift sanctions on Iraq until
Baghdad satisfies U.N. inspectors that it has destroyed all weapons
of mass destruction.
	   The sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said that if the report is
accurate, ``that will set back Iraq's efforts to try to lift
sanctions'' because ``it shows that they've been concealing,
they've been lying, and it calls into question their commitment to
disarmament.''
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
tests were conducted by the U.S. Army laboratory in Aberdeen,
Maryland, from samples taken from a site in Iraq last March.
	   ``Iraq rejects these results categorically,'' the Iraqi Mission
to the United Nations said in a statement. ``The results cannot be
accurate since VX was not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due
to continuous production failure.''
	   The statement said Butler informed the Iraqi government during a
meeting in Baghdad this month that ``variable traces of VX'' had
been found in the analysis of seven samples of warhead parts.
	   A ``trace of a stabilizer'' was found in one of those samples,
the statement added.
	   ``Finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because if VX was used, a stabilizer would
have been found in every sample,'' the Iraqi statement said.
	   The statement said some of the samples had been in the U.N.'s
possession since 1995. The Iraqis said sensitive analysis should be
performed in a neutral county or in laboratories of several
countries, including France, Russia and the United States.
	   During the Baghdad meeting, Butler and the Iraqis agreed to
further technical meetings in the Iraqi capital to review the
analysis. The United Nations agreed to Iraq's demands that the
session include scientists from France, Russia and China.
	   Those countries are the members of the Security Council most
sympathetic to Baghdad's position.
	   Regardless of the findings, positions within the Security
Council are so polarized that several diplomats expressed doubt
whether the report would change any opinions, especially among the
French, Russians and Chinese.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, feared that
instead of reacting negatively toward Iraq, Baghdad's supporters on
the Security Council would instead cite the report as an example of
political leaks by the special commission, which is supposed to
report only to the council.
	   They noted that The Washington Post, in a report Tuesday, said
it obtained a copy of the findings from the opposition Iraqi
National Congress, the principle Iraqi exile group.
	   Iraq said it was ``astonished'' that an opposition group would
have access to such material ``which challenges the professional
and scientific nature of (the inspectors') work.''

Microsoft appeals victory could affect broader antitrust case 
</HEADLINE>
Eds:UPDATES with new material
By TED BRIDIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a victory for Microsoft with important
implications for the U.S. government's landmark antitrust case, a
federal appeals court on Tuesday removed restrictions a judge had
imposed on the company's Windows 95 software.
	   The three-judge panel decided there was adequate justification
for Microsoft to bundle its Internet browser within its popular
Windows 95 software.
	   The same practice in Windows 98, which goes on sale this week,
is one of the core complaints of the Justice Department and 20
states currently suing Microsoft.
	   Government lawyers contend that requiring computer makers to buy
Microsoft's browser as part of Windows 95 amounted to an illegal
``tying'' of the products and violated a 1995 court-sanctioned
agreement between the company and the government. But the appeals
court on Tuesday described the packaging of the browser with
Windows 95 as ``a genuine integration,'' which is legal, because a
single combined product offers benefits over separate ones.
	   ``Microsoft has clearly met the burden of ascribing facially
plausible benefits to its integrated design,'' the appeals court
wrote, but also noted that ``the factual conclusion is, of course,
subject to re-examination.''
	   Microsoft's stock soared 4.3 percent after the ruling, climbing
from just under dlrs 96 to close just over dlrs 100. The surge
meant that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, named the world's richest
person earlier this week by Forbes magazine, earned about dlrs 2.3
billion Tuesday, with total stock holdings worth about dlrs 54
billion.
	   The court's decision Tuesday overturns limits that U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had imposed in December, when he
prohibited Microsoft from forcing computer makers that sell Windows
95 ``or any successor'' to also sell its browser. He also required
the company to allow the sale of a Windows version without all the
browser components.
	   Microsoft's chief operating officer, Bob Herbold, said the
appeals ruling on Windows 95 ``will provide helpful guidance to
resolve the Windows 98 lawsuit. ... Both the government's lawsuits
are based on the same argument.''
	   During a hearing last month in the antitrust case, the judge
suggested he was eager to hear the appeals ruling, saying: ``It may
be that we will have a decision in that case and we will have some
expression of appellate opinion on some of the issues that will
cover this.''
	   The Justice Department said it was disappointed and was
reviewing the 57-page decision to consider its options. It said the
appeals loss won't affect its broader antitrust case against
Microsoft.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters fighting the sale of
Puerto Rico's telephone company cut fiber optic lines serving the
sprawling U.S. Navy base at Roosevelt Roads Tuesday, leaving its
7,600 people without local service.
	   Telephone officials blamed the sabotage on striking workers who
are trying to stop the government from selling control of Puerto
Rico Telephone Co. to private investors for dlrs 1.9 billion. Union
leaders fear mass layoffs.
	   The House of Representatives was considering the sale Tuesday.
The Senate already has approved the deal, the centerpiece of Gov.
Pedro Rossello's privatization program.
	   Operations at the Navy base in northeastern Puerto Rico weren't
affected, and calls to the U.S. mainland were getting through, said
base spokesman Roberto Nelson. Staff used cellular phones for local
calls.
	   Since the strike began Thursday, sabotage to telephone lines has
affected more than 75,000 customers, shut down automated bank
machines and slowed electronic cash transfers. Some cellular phone
antennas are not operating.
	   About 6,500 state electrical workers joined the strike Tuesday,
and some government water utility and ports workers walked picket
lines.
	   Clashes Monday between strikers and police injured at least 10
people, but no violence was reported Tuesday.
	   Spain's Telefonica Internacional S.A. said Monday it intended to
make an offer for PRTC, but the head of the Government Development
Bank, Marcos Rodriguez-Ema, said Tuesday he had heard nothing from
the firm.

World Cup: Morocco wins 3-0 but both go out AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quote from Scotland coach
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Morocco scored a 3-0 victory over
Scotland in a gallant but unsuccessful bid to make it to the second
round of the World Cup Tuesday, and the result sent the Scots home
after the first round for the eighth time in a row.
	   Salaheddine Bassir and Abdeljilil Hadda punished the sleeping
Scottish defense with strikes in the 22nd and 47th minutes and
Bassir added a third five minutes from the end.
	   It looked enough to put the Moroccans into the second round for
the second time in their history until Norway scored a
come-from-behind 2-1 victory over defending titlist Brazil in
Marseille.
	   Brazil won the group ahead of Norway with the Moroccans third
and Scotland, which has never made the second round, last.
	   ``I am very disappointed, particularly for the wonderful
supporters who have come here,'' Scotland coach Craig Brown said.
``I am afraid you can't give goals away at this level as we did and
hope to survive. We gave away two terrible goals. When we were
reduced to 10 it was all over.''
	   Scotland went close in the 14th when Monaco midfielder John
Collins floated a free kick toward Gordon Durie, who beat advancing
'keeper Driss Benzekri and a defender in the air but glanced his
header wide.
	   It was the only real chance of the first spell but then Morocco
put together a simple move to take the lead in the 22nd.
	   Tahar El-Khalej aimed a high through ball over the top of the
slow-moving Scottish defense and Bassir got clear of Colin Hendry
to fire a powerful, angled left-footed shot between 'keeper Jim
Leighton and his near post.
	   A minute later the Scots appealed for a penalty when Lahcen
Abrami appeared to block a cross from Jackie McNamara with his left
arm but it was ruled no foul by the referee.
	   On the half hour, Durie tried the long-range approach, firing a
30-meter (yard) drive that flashed past the post with Benzekri
diving acrobatically across goal.
	   Benzekri made his first save in the 31st minute, moving to his
right to hold a well struck, close-range shot from Kevin Gallacher.
	   In the 32nd minute, the Moroccan keeper lost the ball in a
scramble in front of his goal and El Khalej did well to clear the
danger with Gallacher about to prod the ball into an empty net.
	   Six minutes before half time, Craig Burley, who scored
Scotland's equalizer in the 1-1 tie with Norway on a breakaway, got
into a similar position but his shot was blocked by the 'keeper.
	   Two minutes into the second half the Moroccans struck again with
another breakaway goal.
	   El Moustafa Hadji fired another long pass from deep and Hadda
outpaced Scottish defender David Weir in a dash down the left.
Hadda got in front of Weir and tried an audacious lobbed shot.
Leighton got his fingertips to the ball but turned to watch it
bounce agonizingly behind him into empty net.
	   It was even worse for Scotland seven minutes later when Burley
was shown the red card for a tackle from behind on Bassir in the
center circle.
	   Though hugely outnumbered by the Scots in the Geoffrey-Guichard
stadium, the noisy Moroccans began chanting ``Brazil, Brazil'' to
compare their team with the mighty four-time titlist.
	   With the one-man advantage and a two-goal lead, the Moroccans
cleverly kept possession and allowed the Scots few chances
	   The Moroccans added a third five minutes from the end when Hadda
flicked a pass to Bassir, who lobbed the ball cleverly over Weir
and fired home from 12 meters, the ball deflecting slightly off
Hendry's knee.
	   Lineups:
	   Scotland _ Jim Leighton; Jackie McNamara (Tosh McKinlay, 54th),
Colin Hendry, David Weir, Tommy Boyd; Craig Burley, Paul Lambert,
John Collins, Christian Dailly; Gordon Durie (Scott Booth, 84th),
Kevin Gallacher.
	   Morocco _ Driss Benzekri; Abdelilah Saber (Youssef Rossi, 72nd),
Lahcen Abrami, Noureddine Naybet; El Moustafa Hadji, Smahi Triki,
Gharib Amzine (Rachid Azzouzi, 77th), Youssef Chippo (Jamal
Sellami, 87th), Tahar El Khalej; Abdeljilil Hadda, Salaheddine
Bassir

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President-elect Andres Pastrana on
Tuesday named his widely respected campaign manager, Juan Camilo
Restrepo, as finance minister and markets immediately reacted with
a vote of confidence.
	   The stock market jumped 10 percentage points and the peso,
severely weakened in recent months, surged. The dollar closed
Tuesday a 1,378 pesos, down from 1,395 on Friday, the last previous
trading day.
	   Restrepo, a former senator and energy minister, announced that
he would impose unspecified austerity measures to reduce a fiscal
deficit that rose precipitously under outgoing President Ernesto
Samper.
	   Pastrana's victory and Restrepo's assurances were warmly greeted
by the financial sector, whose jitters in the weeks leading to
Sunday's election had helped drive up interest rates and inflation.
	   Pastrana, who takes office Aug. 7, has promised to bring down
inflation, running at over 20 percent, to single digits and to cut
a fiscal deficit now at nearly 6 percent of Gross Domestic Product.

	   SANTA ANA, El Salvador (AP) _ Three prisoners and a guard were
hurt in a prison uprising at a penitentiary northwest of the El
Salvadoran capital.
	   Some 250 inmates seized three guards Tuesday morning as hostages
to demand reviews of their cases and better food at the Apanteos
prison 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of San Salvador.
	   The guards later were released and elite police squads entered
the prison to try to regain control, but had yet to do so by
Tuesday afternoon. Several prisoners could be seen on the roofs of
the prison.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras' top military body said
Tuesday it will investigate links between its top commanders and
organized crime.
	   The investigation, ordered by the Superior Council, comes as
police search for an infantry subcommander, Lt. Col. Wilfredo Leva
Cabrera, wanted in connection with the kidnappings and killings of
seven businessmen. Police say the case was tied to drug
trafficking.
	   Army spokesman Mario David Villanueva said ``the armed forces
have the greatest interest in clearing up this situation that soils
the military's image.''
	   The scandal is the latest crisis affecting Honduras' military,
which overthrew presidents in 1956, 1963 and 1972, ruling the
Central American country for a total of 18 years before giving up
power in 1981.
	   In recent years, it has been accused of corruption and human
rights violations.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Tropical Storm Blas was swirling Tuesday far
off Mexico's Pacific Coast and picking up strength as it appeared
headed toward hurricane status.
	   Blas was 345 miles (555 kilometers) south of Acapulco and moving
to the west-northwest at 13 mph (21 kph), the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said in Miami. The storm's general direction was
expected to continue through at least Wednesday.
	   Blas, the second Pacific tropical storm of the season, had
maximum sustained winds of near 65 mph and was expected to grow
into a hurricane by Wednesday, the center said. A storm is declared
a hurricane when its sustained winds reach 74 mph (119 kph).
	   Authorities closed Acapulco port to all navigation Monday night
and restricted navigation at the Pacific resort of Huatulco, the
government's Notimex news agency reported.
	   Acapulco port Capt. Vicente Martinez Morales urged vessels to
take extreme caution along the coast from Chiapas state in the
south to Michoacan in the north, Notimex said.
	   ___
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Authorities said Tuesday that an ambush
that killed three Mexican soldiers was carried out by leftist
rebels.
	   The soldiers, on an anti-drug patrol, were attacked Monday
afternoon near the village of El Pantano, about 125 miles (200
kilometers) northwest of Acapulco, when they were fired on by about
20 people wearing hoods and military-style clothing. Three soldiers
also were wounded in the attack.
	   The gunmen escaped.
	   The Attorney General's office blamed the Popular Revolutionary
Army, or EPR, which rose up in Guerrero two years ago to demand
political and social reform.
	   This Sunday will mark the second anniversary of the emergence of
the rebel group, which first appeared at a service to honor 17
Guerrero farmers who were killed by state police on June 28, 1995,
while en route to a political protest.

<SLUG> Molson Companies to buy out Foster Group stake in Molson Breweries </SLUG>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Molson Companies will pay dlrs 1 billion to take
control of its joint venture Molson Breweries Ltd. subsidiary from
Australia's Foster Brewing Group.
	   ``This is an historic moment for the corporation,'' Molson
president James Arnett told a news conference. ``The acquisition of
100 per cent of Molson Breweries is the key to our ability to build
value for shareholders.''
	   Arnett said the company, as 100 per cent owner of Molson
Breweries, will be able to cash in on the Molson name, beer brand
and trademark.
	   ``We strongly believe there is significant untapped value in the
Molson trademark, both in Canada and abroad,'' he said.
	   Molson Companies has been trying to expand its stake in the
joint venture brewery for more than a year but had so far been
rebuffed by Foster. Reports last year said Molson offered Foster's
about dlrs 800 million for its Molson Breweries stake.
	   Last year, Molson and Foster's each bought an additional 10 per
cent of the Toronto brewery from Miller Brewing Co. for dlrs 210
million each. That pushed each company's stake to 50 per cent.
	   Molson has been pulling out of businesses not related to its
core brewing and sports operations. The company sold its troubled
Diversey chemical business two years ago and has also disposed of
investments in home improvement warehouse businesses, including its
former 45.1 per cent stake in Quebec-based Reno-Depot.
	   The holding company still owns Beaver Lumber Co. Ltd., a
Toronto-area-based hardware chain.
	   In April, Molson Companies Ltd. sold its minority stake in Home
Depot Canada to the home renovation retailer's U.S. parent for dlrs
375 million.
	   The owner of Molson Breweries, Beaver Lumber and the Montreal
Canadiens hockey club sold its 25 per cent share of Home Depot
Canada for a net gain of dlrs 189 million.

World Cup: Two late goals give Norway 2-1 victory, send it to second round 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Flo, Zagallo quotes.
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Kjetil Rekdal converted an 89th-minute
penalty kick and Norway rallied with two goals in the final seven
minutes to move into the second round of the World Cup with a
dramatic 2-1 victory over Brazil Tuesday night.
	   Trailing 1-0 and looking like it was headed out after the first
round, Tore Andre Flo gave Norway hope with a remarkable individual
effort in the 83rd minute.
	   Flo ran onto a ball from deep in the back, one-touched it to the
middle of the penalty area and beat goalkeeper Taffarel with a
strike from 12 meters.
	   ``I got the ball. I was lucky I guess,'' Flo said. ``I took a
shot an it went into the corner. It was a good goal, but we knew we
needed one more. Then we got the penalty and it was a very cool
finish by Rekdal.''
	   With Morocco beating Scotland 3-0 in Saint-Etienne and sure to
advance from Group A with a Brazil victory or draw, American
referee Esse Baharmast called Junior Baiano for knocking down Flo
as the two battled for position on a high ball.
	   Rekdal firmly stuck his spot chance into the lower left side of
the net and Norway reached the second round of the World Cup for
the first time in three tries.
	   ``It was one of the best (victories), definitely,'' Flo said.
``We made history in Norway today.''
	   The Norwegian reserves sprinted onto the field to hug and
contratulate their teammates.
	   The Scandinavians will face Italy on Saturday in Marseille.
	   Brazil controlled the possession throughout and finally looked
like the sure winner when Bebeto converted a Denilson cross with a
header in the 78th minute.
	   Denilson fell but still managed to keep possession, spin away
from Norwegian defender Berg Henning and strike a left-footed cross
chest high across the penalty area. Streaking through the penalty
area, Bebeto put his head onto the ball and directed it into the
middle of the net.
	   Until then neither side looked particularly inspired, but Brazil
contolled the possession and had the more dangerous chances.
	   ``We came in overconfident against a rival we didn't know how
would play against us,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said. ``But
we developed our soccer and will continue to do so.
	   ``But they scored and then came the penalty which I don't really
know what happened there. We played well. We now have to keep
going.''
	   Ronaldo put a header wide of the post from five meters in the
fourth minute, but neither side looked particularly dangerous until
the final 20 minutes.
	   Brazil already had qualified for the second round, assured of
winning Group A and a round-of-16 meeting with Chile on Saturday in
Paris.
	   The victory finished Norway five points and five goals in three
games, a far cry from 1994 when it went 1-1-1 and scored only once.
The only other time it reached the World Cup finals, in 1938, it
also was eliminated in the first round.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
confronted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday,
delivering what could be the final warning before NATO tries to end
the fighting in Kosovo by force.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, the next U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic to stop his
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Yugoslav
province.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said.
	   After four hours of talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke said the
Yugoslav leader reaffirmed an earlier promise to allow foreign
diplomats to observe the situation in Kosovo.
	   He refused to reveal anything else about the meeting, saying it
was confidential.
	   Holbrooke is to travel to Kosovo on Wednesday, visiting its
capital Pristina and areas west of that city where fighting has
been heavy. He said he would return to Belgrade Thursday, and
travel to Greece on Friday.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke met in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and
President Kiro Gligorov, as well as the leader of the Kosovo
Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Holbrooke called his meeting with Rugova ``very productive,''
but again declined details.
	   There are widespread fears that the fighting between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could spread to Macedonia, which borders
on Kosovo and also has a sizable community of restive ethnic
Albanians.
	   Western nations, which sent NATO jets buzzing over the region in
a warning to Milosevic this month, have been deliberating on what
measures they will take if he continues to defy them.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO member countries met in Brussels on
Tuesday to discuss military planning in the region. They said plans
included possibly bombing targets against Serbian air defenses and
other targets both inside Kosovo and in other parts of Serbia.
	   Greece has opposed possible air strikes and could veto strikes
against Kosovo, since all actions by the alliance are taken by
consensus. In the past, however, the Greeks have buckled under to
U.S. pressure.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is gaining in public support in
predominantly Albanian Kosovo while Rugova's moderate influence
wanes.
	   Clashes continued Tuesday across the troubled province.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported that 800 Serb civilians have
evacuated one of the remaining Serb enclaves, 30 miles (50
kilometers) west of the capital, Pristina. They said ethnic
Albanians had driven them out of the village of Belacevac, burning
down 12 Serb homes.
	   The coal mine in Belacevac is now controlled by the KLA, reports
from Serb and ethnic Albanian sources say. The pit supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of the province.
	   Belacevac is in the same area where nine Serbs were reportedly
kidnapped Monday, Serb sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center _ which is close to Rugova's party
_ said Tuesday that Serb forces were shelling seven villages
nearby. According to the center, 12 people were wounded in the
attacks, two of them children. None of the reports could be
independently confirmed.
	   Holbrooke is credited with getting Milosevic and other Balkan
leaders to sign the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia. But he has
made no progress in months of efforts to get the autocratic
Yugoslav leader to halt his campaign to crush militants in Kosovo.
	   Last month, he persuaded Milosevic to go to the bargaining table
with Rugova for the first time. But the offensive by Serb forces
has continued without letup, and Rugova's ethnic Albanian
delegation halted the talks in protest.
	   Milosevic met in Russia last week with President Boris Yeltsin
and pledged to hold new talks with Rugova. But he has refused
demands to pull back and cease security forces' fire.
	   Russia opposes Western military pressure on its longtime ally
but is trying to use its influence with Belgrade to gain a
breakthrough in peace efforts.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky talked with
Milosevic on Tuesday before Holbrooke's arrival. It marked the
third straight day of Russian-Yugoslav diplomatic talks on Kosovo,
involving officials from both sides.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Libyan plane flew to Chad and returned,
violating a 6-year U.N. air embargo, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The plane landed at Tripoli international airport Tuesday with a
senior Chadian diplomat and the wife of Chad's parliament speaker,
MENA said. It gave their names in Arabic as Adam Kojo and Marina
Kamochi.
	   The airliner went to Chad on Monday, MENA said but it was not
clear why the two Chadians were visiting Libya. MENA quoted the
sources as saying that Libyan planes will make more flights in the
coming days.
	   This is not the first violation of the air embargo, which was
imposed in 1992 after the north African country refused to hand
over for trial two suspects wanted in connection to the bombing of
a U.S. jetliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988. The
attack killed 270 people.
	   MENA quoted unnamed sources as saying that the flights were in
compliance with an African nations' summit earlier this month,
which called for defying the embargo.
	   Since 1994, Libya has violated the ban every year, ferrying
pilgrims aboard Libyan airliners to Saudi Arabia to perform the
annual hajj or major Islamic pilgrimage in the Saudi holy city of
Mecca. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also has violated the ban by
flying to an Arab summit in Cairo in 1996 and making a tour of West
Africa last year.

Molson Companies to buy out Foster Group stake in Molson Breweries ,0330 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to add US dlr conversions.
<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Molson Companies will pay dlrs 1 billion (US
dlrs 670 million) to take control of its joint venture Molson
Breweries Ltd. subsidiary from Australia's Foster Brewing Group.
	   ``This is an historic moment for the corporation,'' Molson
president James Arnett told a news conference. ``The acquisition of
100 per cent of Molson Breweries is the key to our ability to build
value for shareholders.''
	   Arnett said the company, as 100 per cent owner of Molson
Breweries, will be able to cash in on the Molson name, beer brand
and trademark.
	   ``We strongly believe there is significant untapped value in the
Molson trademark, both in Canada and abroad,'' he said.
	   Molson Companies has been trying to expand its stake in the
joint venture brewery for more than a year but had so far been
rebuffed by Foster. Reports last year said Molson offered Foster's
about dlrs 800 million (US dlrs 536 million) for its Molson
Breweries stake.
	   Last year, Molson and Foster's each bought an additional 10 per
cent of the Toronto brewery from Miller Brewing Co. for dlrs 210
million (US dlrs 140 million) each. That pushed each company's
stake to 50 per cent.
	   Molson has been pulling out of businesses not related to its
core brewing and sports operations. The company sold its troubled
Diversey chemical business two years ago and has also disposed of
investments in home improvement warehouse businesses, including its
former 45.1 per cent stake in Quebec-based Reno-Depot.
	   The holding company still owns Beaver Lumber Co. Ltd., a
Toronto-area-based hardware chain.
	   In April, Molson Companies Ltd. sold its minority stake in Home
Depot Canada to the home renovation retailer's U.S. parent for dlrs
375 million (US dlrs 251 million).
	   The owner of Molson Breweries, Beaver Lumber and the Montreal
Canadiens hockey club sold its 25 per cent share of Home Depot
Canada for a net gain of dlrs 189 million (US dlrs 126 million.

EDs: LEADS with more ministers saying they will cut production,
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ As OPEC struggles to raise the depressed
price of oil, some key players said Tuesday they want to remove
more than 1 million barrels a day from the glutted market.
	   That would almost double the amount of new production cuts that
six OPEC nations have already promised while watching crude prices
tumble to 12-year lows.
	   ``The price has reached a very low level. We need a drastic
decision,'' said Libyan oil minister Abdalla Salem el-Badri, adding
his name to the list of ministers who say they will restrain
production. ``We need a shock, not a shot.''
	   Futures traders responded to the prospect of deeper cuts by
pushing prices sharply higher in New York and London.
	   ``We're all discussing further cuts,'' Kuwaiti oil minister
Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah said after talking privately with Saudi
oil minister Ali Naimi.
	   The Saudis, OPEC's biggest producers, have indicated they would
consider slashing their massive output by more than the 225,000
barrels per day that Naimi has already pledged, according to a
Persian Gulf source who spoke to reporters only on condition of
anonymity.
	   But nobody has suggested _ at least not publicly _ how many
extra barrels any particular producer should cut.
	   Although the Saudis are cutting the most barrels, they have by
far the biggest output and their initial pledge to restrain output
was proportionately smaller than promises from some of the other
OPEC states.
	   Iran has proposed across-the-board cuts of 10 percent, starting
from February production levels, and the United Arab Emirates oil
minister, Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri, said Tuesday he had no
problems with that proposal.
	   OPEC got itself into trouble in the winter by agreeing to pump
more crude, flooding the market with crude just as the Asian
economic crisis began choking off demand.
	   Sheik Saud said he would like to see OPEC agree to cut more than
1.245 million barrels a day, citing the same figure that OPEC
promised to cut in an emergency session called in March to address
the collapsing market.
	   OPEC actually delivered less than 1 million barrels a day of its
first round of cuts, and prices plunged further. OPEC's average
price fell below dlrs 11 per barrel last week, though it is
slightly higher now.
	   The cheap oil is a bargain for consumers but awful news for OPEC
and other producers who think they should be getting somewhere
between dlrs 17 and dlrs 20 per barrel.
	   Heading into a meeting that formally opens on Wednesday, six of
the 11 OPEC members have promised new cuts that would equal 620,000
barrels a day, beginning July 1.
	   Non-OPEC members including Mexico, Russia and Oman have chipped
in with more pledges to remove oil from the market, bringing the
total to 823,000 barrels.
	   Among the OPEC producers who have not yet specified any offers
to cut production, Libya stated Tuesday night it would reduce
output, but el-Badri would not give any figures. Nigeria and
Algeria hinted they would announce cuts later.
	   ``Personally, I think we need 1.3 million barrels a day,'' said
Luis Giusti, the president of Venezuela's state oil company,
Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Giusti was referring to cuts from OPEC
and non-OPEC.
	   Traders seemed cautiously optimistic, extending price gains that
began on Monday.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August rose 68 cents to close
at dlrs 13.92 per barrel on London's International Petroleum
Exchange. Light sweet crude oil for August was up 87 cents at dlrs
14.52 per barrel around midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
	   But one prominent analyst said markets may have been overly
enthusiastic.
	   ``It's a question of `How much and will they deliver?''' said
Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Center for Global
Energy Studies.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Indians edge Cubs; Astros rout Twins 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW with Tuesday's early games; will be updated
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Travis Fryman tied the game with an eighth-inning
home run as the Cleveland Indians rallied for a 5-4 victory over
the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday.
	   After Fryman connected against loser Terry Adams (6-4), pinch
hitter Mark Whiten doubled and scored on a single by Pat Borders,
putting Cleveland in front. It was the 12th homer of the year for
Fryman, who also doubled home a run earlier. Jim Thome had three
hits for the Indians.
	   Eric Plunk (3-1) pitched 1 1-3 innings of hitless relief for the
win, Cleveland's third straight. The Cubs dropped their third in a
row and finished a nine-game home stand 3-6.
	   Henry Rodriguez hit his second homer in as many games for the
Cubs but Sammy Sosa, one shy of the major league mark for most home
runs in a month, went 0-for-5 and is homerless in two straight
games.
	   Sosa, who has 30 homers, 17 of them in June, flied out to the
wall in left, grounded out twice and popped up.
 &UR; Astros 9, Twins 0
	   In Houston, Shane Reynolds overcame a stomach ache to pitch
seven shutout innings and Jeff Bagwell had three RBIs as the Astros
beat the Minnesota Twins.
	   Reynolds suffered an attack of gastroenteritis, an inflamed
stomach condition on Sunday night, and was originally scratched
from the starting lineup.
	   But Reynolds (8-5) showed up in uniform to keep his regular
start and allowed only one runner past first base _ Marty Cordova's
fourth inning double.
	   Reynolds retired 10 of the first 11 batters he faced and allowed
only four hits and no walks with six strikeouts. C.J. Nitkowski,
who was expected to start in Reynolds' place, pitched the final two
innings of the five-hitter. The Astros gave Reynolds plenty of
offense. Craig Biggio and Carl Everett had three hits and two RBIs
each and Bagwell drove in three runs on a double and single in
Houston's 13-hit attack.
 &UR; Royals 6, Reds 4
	   In Cincinnati, Johnny Damon drove in four runs with the first
two-homer game of his career and the Kansas City Royals held on to
beat Cincinnati, extending the Reds' losing streak to 10 games.
	   The 10-game slump is Cincinnati worst since it dropped 12 in a
row from Sept. 10-22, 1993, the year that Tony Perez was fired as
manager and Davey Johnson took over an injured, demoralized team.
	   The Royals finished their road trip with a 7-2 mark, their best
since they went 7-3 on a road trip in 1995. Kansas City has won
nine of its last 12 games overall.
	   Pat Rapp (7-6) gave up eight hits and three runs in six innings
to break out of a rut and win consecutive starts for the first time
since May 7-13. Rapp had alternated wins and losses in his last
seven decisions.
 &UR; Brewers 7, Rockies 5
	   In Milwaukee, Bronswell Patrick was staked to a six-run,
first-inning lead and held on for the victory in his first major
league start as the Brewers beat the Colorado Rockies.
	   Patrick (3-0), a 27-year-old rookie who was called up from the
minors last month, gave up four earned runs on seven hits in 7 1-3
innings as the Brewers swept the two-game series in the Rockies'
first trip ever to County Stadium.
	   All seven of his previous appearances had been in relief.
	   Patrick left to cheers after giving up a single to Todd Helton
with one out in the eighth. But the crowd booed reliever Doug
Jones, who recently lost his closer's job, and was greeted by Vinny
Castilla's 23rd homer, making it 7-5. It was Castilla's first home
run in 73 at-bats, dating to June 3.
	   Jones has surrendered 11 homers in 46 1-3 innings. Bob Wickman
pitched the ninth for his eighth save in nine chances.

Airline asks for censored newscasts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Qantas has asked Australia's Nine
television network, which produces the airline's in-flight news
programs, to censor stories about Pauline Hanson and her right-wing
political party, it was reported Wednesday.
	   Qantas spokesman Bernard Shirley told The Sydney Morning Herald
that a staff member of the airline's in-flight entertainment office
wrote to Channel Nine asking the network to cut references to
Hanson or her One Nation party in bulletins supplied to Qantas.
	   Shirley said the letter was written after a Qantas staffer
complained about an inflight news item he found unacceptable.
	   The newspaper reported that the staffer may have been a Qantas
manager returning from Indonesia who felt news items about Hanson
were offensive to Indonesian passengers.
	   Nine news director Paul Fenn replied to the request on Monday
saying the ban would make it impossible for the network to provide
any stories on federal politics or the federal election, the
newspaper reported.
	   Shirley later said that Qantas did not want valid political
stories excluded, just reports containing material offensive to any
particular ethnic group.
	   Hanson adviser David Oldfield told the newspaper that ``people
should have the right to judge for themselves whether something
matters or doesn't.''
	   Hanson has been criticized as racist for claiming Australia is
in danger of being ``swamped by Asians'' and opposing immigration.
She also opposes special welfare benefits for Aborigines and
advocates protectionist economics.
	   Hanson's One Nation party won 11 seats in the Queensland state
election held June 13.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President-elect Andres Pastrana on
Tuesday named his widely respected campaign manager, Juan Camilo
Restrepo, as finance minister and markets immediately reacted with
a vote of confidence.
	   The stock market jumped 10 percentage points and the peso,
severely weakened in recent months, surged. The dollar closed
Tuesday a 1,378 pesos, down from 1,395 on Friday, the last previous
trading day.
	   Restrepo, a former senator and energy minister, announced that
he would impose unspecified austerity measures to reduce a fiscal
deficit that rose precipitously under outgoing President Ernesto
Samper.
	   Pastrana's victory and Restrepo's assurances were warmly greeted
by the financial sector, whose jitters in the weeks leading to
Sunday's election had helped drive up interest rates and inflation.
	   Pastrana, who takes office Aug. 7, has promised to bring down
inflation, running at over 20 percent, to single digits and to cut
a fiscal deficit now at nearly 6 percent of Gross Domestic Product.

	   SANTA ANA, El Salvador (AP) _ Three prisoners and a guard were
hurt in a prison uprising at a penitentiary northwest of the El
Salvadoran capital.
	   Some 250 inmates seized three guards Tuesday morning as hostages
to demand reviews of their cases and better food at the Apanteos
prison 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of San Salvador.
	   The guards later were released and elite police squads entered
the prison to try to regain control, but had yet to do so by
Tuesday afternoon. Several prisoners could be seen on the roofs of
the prison.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras' top military body said
Tuesday it will investigate links between its top commanders and
organized crime.
	   The investigation, ordered by the Superior Council, comes as
police search for an infantry subcommander, Lt. Col. Wilfredo Leva
Cabrera, wanted in connection with the kidnappings and killings of
seven businessmen. Police say the case was tied to drug
trafficking.
	   Army spokesman Mario David Villanueva said ``the armed forces
have the greatest interest in clearing up this situation that soils
the military's image.''
	   The scandal is the latest crisis affecting Honduras' military,
which overthrew presidents in 1956, 1963 and 1972, ruling the
Central American country for a total of 18 years before giving up
power in 1981.
	   In recent years, it has been accused of corruption and human
rights violations.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Tropical Storm Blas grew into the season's
first Pacific hurricane Tuesday, swirling far off Mexico's coast
and forcing at least partial closures of eight ports.
	   Hurricane Blas was 300 miles (500 kilometers) south-southwest of
Acapulco Tuesday afternoon and moving west-northwest at 15 mph (24
kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in Miami. The storm's
general direction _ roughly parallel to the Mexican coastline _ was
expected to continue through Wednesday.
	   Blas had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), just over
the threshold for hurricane status. Winds were expected to reach
near 100 mph (160 kph) by Wednesday, the center said.
	   The hurricane center said there was a chance Blas could
eventually affect the southern tip of the Baja California
Peninsula. Cloudy skies and rains were already being reported in
the southern states of Guerrero and Oaxaca.
	   Authorities closed Acapulco port to all navigation Monday night
and restricted navigation at the Pacific resort of Huatulco, the
government's Notimex news agency reported.
	   Acapulco port Capt. Vicente Martinez Morales urged vessels to
take extreme caution along the coast from Chiapas state in the
south to Michoacan in the north, Notimex said.
	   ___
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Authorities said Tuesday that an ambush
that killed three Mexican soldiers was carried out by leftist
rebels.
	   The soldiers, on an anti-drug patrol, were attacked Monday
afternoon near the village of El Pantano, about 125 miles (200
kilometers) northwest of Acapulco, when they were fired on by about
20 people wearing hoods and military-style clothing. Three soldiers
also were wounded in the attack.
	   The gunmen escaped.
	   The Attorney General's office blamed the Popular Revolutionary
Army, or EPR, which rose up in Guerrero two years ago to demand
political and social reform.
	   This Sunday will mark the second anniversary of the emergence of
the rebel group, which first appeared at a service to honor 17
Guerrero farmers who were killed by state police on June 28, 1995,
while en route to a political protest.

<TEXT>
	   MASHANTUCKET, Connecticut (AP) _ Julio Cesar Chavez is looking
forward to a rematch against Oscar De La Hoya, but he says he's not
looking past Ken Sigurani.
	   ``A lot of people say I'm finished,'' said the 35-year-old
Mexican, who will fight Sigurani Thursday night at Foxwoods Resort
Casino. ``I definitely am not. I am not going to underestimate the
kid because he stands in the way of a great opportunity.''
	   A victory will get Chavez a second chance against De La Hoya,
the WBC welterweight champion.
	   ``September 18 will be the surprise of the year,'' Chavez said
at a news conference Monday. ``This time, I'm going to beat
Oscar.''
	   De La Hoya stopped Chavez in the four rounds in defense of the
WBC super lightweight title June 7, 1996, at Las Vegas.
	   If the former champion in three weight classes (100-2-2, 83
knockouts) needs any further incentive against Sigurani (22-1, 8
knockouts), of Youngstown, Ohio, promoter Bob Arum is providing it
by offering Chavez a dlrs 250,000 bonus if he wins by a knockout.

Three Germans sentenced; policeman, Englishman in critical condition attacking officer

Eds: UPDATES with second German under formal investigation for
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced
three more Germans to prison as France grappled with World Cup
violence that has left a policeman in a coma and an English fan in
critical condition.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
that has erupted in several French cities hosting the soccer
championship that began June 10. More than 200 people have been
arrested.
	   A court in the northern city of Bethune, near Lille, convicted
the three Germans to a year in prison for attacking French police
in some of the World Cup's worst violence. It followed Sunday's
game between Germany and Yugoslavia in nearby Lens.
	   Ranging in age from 22 to 30, they were also barred from France
for two years after serving their terms.
	   Authorities probing the attack in Lens that left the policeman
in a coma placed two Germans under formal investigation _ one step
short of being charged _ for attempted murder, officials said.
	   Markus Warnecke, a 27-year-old tattoo shop owner and skinhead
from Hanover, was ordered to remain in jail. He denied the

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday rejected a report by a
U.S. laboratory that found traces of the deadly VX nerve gas agent
in Iraqi missile warheads and demanded the findings be reviewed by
a neutral country or experts from several nations.
	   U.S. and diplomatic sources confirmed Tuesday that chemical
analysis of Iraqi warheads, handed over to the U.N. Special
Commission, revealed traces of VX despite Baghdad's claims that it
never successfully manufactured weapons from the nerve gas agent.
	   The head of the commission, Richard Butler, is expected to brief
the Security Council on the findings Wednesday.
	   The council has said it will not lift sanctions on Iraq until
Baghdad satisfies U.N. inspectors that it has destroyed all weapons
of mass destruction.
	   The sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the 1991 Gulf War.

World Cup: Norway stuns Brazil to qualify 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional lead; WILL be UPDATED with more quotes.
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ With its future in the World Cup down
to seven minutes, Norway gave the defending world champions a
lesson on delivering in the clutch.
	   With a pair of goals six minutes apart, the Norwegians stunned
Brazil 2-1 to hand the four-time Cup winners their first defeat and
qualify for the second round for the first time in its history.
	   After a Bebeto header gave Brazil a 1-0 lead in the 78th minute,
Chelsea striker Tore Andre Flo evened the score on a solo effort
five minutes later. Kjetil Rekdal converted a penalty kick in the
89th for an electrifying finish to an otherwise boring game.
	   The fans in Viking helmets and red-and-blue Norwegian flags
refused to let their heroes leave the field at Stade Velodrome, and
the team trotted around the field to salute their ecstatic
supporters.
	   ``It's incredible. I'm amazed at what happened,'' Norwegian
coach Egil Olsen said.
	   ``It was one of the best (victories), definitely,'' Flo said.
``We made history in Norway today.''
	   The game actually meant little for Brazil. After victories over
Scotland and Morocco, the team already was qualified in first place
in Group A. Norway, with two points going in, needed a win to
qualify after Morocco jumped to four points with a 2-0 victory over
Scotland in their final match.
	   But Brazil wanted this one. Stung by a 4-2 loss to Norway in a
friendly game last year and Olsen's bragging ever since, the
Brazilians wanted revenge.
	   The Brazilians could have fielded their ``B'' team, tested their
second-stringers and not risked an injury to Ronaldo or its other
stars. Instead, they tested a new, attack-heavy formation with
quicksilver midfielder Denilson in place of Cesar Sampaio,
suspended for one game after drawing his second yellow card against
Morocco.
	   But they might have sensed it wasn't their night when the band
got their national anthem wrong.
	   ``We came in overconfident against a rival we didn't know how
would play against us,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said. ``But
we developed our soccer and will continue to do so.
	   ``But they scored and then came the penalty which I don't really
know what happened there. We played well. We now have to keep
going.''
	   The game started slow and saw scant chances by either side, but
the Brazilians controlled the possession and had the better of
play.
	   The game put many to sleep until Denilson awoke everybody in the
78th minute.
	   He broke in on the left, stumbled, fell, got up, spun past
defender Henning Berg and sent in a perfect cross that a diving
Bebeto headed in for a 1-0 lead.
	   With Morocco winning easily over Scotland in Saint-Etienne in
the other Group A contest, Norway looked sure to be headed for
another first-round exit.
	   But in the 83nd minute, Flo took a long ball, dibbled around
defender Junior Baiano and shot into the left corner past a diving
Taffarel to make it 1-1.
	   Then with a minute left, Junior Baiano collided with Flo in the
penalty area, and American referee Esse Baharmast whistled the
foul. Rekdal fired it into the left side for the clincher.
	   ``I got the ball. I was lucky I guess,'' Flo said. ``I took a
shot an it went into the corner. It was a good goal, but we knew we
needed one more. Then we got the penalty and it was a very cool
finish by Rekdal.''
	   In the final minute, Grodas smothered a booming shot from
Roberto Carlos to seal the victory.
	   Still, the rivalry was strictly on the field. Norwegians and
Brazilians were united in the pre- and post-game partying _ and two
vowed to stay together forever.
	   Olvind Ekeland, a 28-year-old Norwegian, married 29-year-old
Brazilian Rosangela de Souza on the pitch before the game. After
his ``da'' and her ``sim,'' fans of both teams joined in a chorus
of ``Stand By Me,'' in English.

World Cup: Flo says it's his best moment AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Last month, Tore Andre Flo helped
Chelsea win the European Cup Winners' Cup in his rookie season in
England.
	   Beating Brazil 2-1 Tuesday night and clinching Norway's
first-ever World Cup second-round appearance easily topped that.
	   ``I've never been so happy like tonight,'' said the tall striker
who got Norway back into the game by netting the equalizer in the
83rd minutes. ``I won the Cup Winners' Cup and other prizes, but
you just can't compare it with this.''
	   Flo also was involved in the game-winner when he was brought
down inside the penalty area in the 89th minute. Midfielder Kjetil
Rekdal cooly beat goalkeeper Taffarel from the spot.
	   Bebeto, one of Brazil's heroes in the 1994 tournament in the
United States, gave Brazil a 1-0 lead in the 78th minute, beating
keeper Frode Grodas with a header.
	   Flo, whose brother Jostein also saw action for the first time in
this tournament as a substitute in the second half, failed to score
in the two previous matches against Morocco (2-2) and Scotland
(1-1).
	   ``I received a very nice pass and after getting past the
defender (Junior Baiano) I just fired the ball,'' said Flo.
	   Norway, which failed to make it to the second round in two
previous World Cup finals, will face Italy next here Friday.
	   ``If we play like tonight anything can happen against Italy,''
said Rekdal.
	   For Flo, it was his third goal against the Brazilians in a year.
He scored twice in a 4-2 exhibition victory in Oslo last May,
earning him his nickname ``Flonaldo.''
	   Norway has never lost to Brazil, drawing 1-1 in their only other
meeting 10 years ago, also in Oslo.
	   Caoch Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen, who will retire after the World Cup
and has been linked with the vacant manager's job at Glasgow Celtic
in Scotland, was ``more than pleased.''
	   ``I'm very proud,'' he said. ``It's almost unbelievable. We
heard the result of the other game (Morocco beat Scotland 3-0) and
we had no choice but taking bigger risks after we made the
substitutions in the second half.''
	   Olsen said he would start preparations for the Italy game as
early as possible.
	   ``I've already started thinking about it,'' he said. ``We must
not be carried away by our win tonight.''

Chile rises from disgrace to second round in nine years; Norway stuns Brazil to advance 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECASTS with late games.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ From disgrace to the second round; from seven
minutes from elimination to the second round.
	   Chile and Norway both advanced to the round of 16 at the World
Cup Tuesday, one being dramatic because of its history, the other
because it was just plain dramatic.
	   Outplayed for 83 minutes, Norway rallied with two goals in the
final seven minutes to stun defending champion Brazil 2-1 and reach
the second round for the first time in three tries.
	   Earlier, Chile joined the world's elite 16, drawing 1-1 with
Cameroon and slipping into the second round without a victory.
	   But Chile's triumph wasn't just because it advanced past the
first round for the first time since 1962, it mostly was due to its
phoenix-like rise from the ashes of a cheating scandal only nine
years ago.
	   The scandal during World Cup qualifying for Italy '90 shamed
Chile and resulted in its banishment from the 1990 and 1994
championships.
	   It moved on as the second-placed team in Group B and earned a
meeting with Brazil on Saturday in Paris.
	   As expected, Italy won the group, beating Austria 2-1 in
Saint-Denis at the same time Chile was celebrating its advancement.
Italy will face Norway in Marseille on Saturday.
	   Norway's qualification brought the number of teams in the second
round to nine.
	   Chile's berth, earned with draws against Italy (2-2) and Austria
(1-1), was probably appreciated more than any of the others, with
possible exception of Croatia's.
	   ``Chile has qualified after many years of sacrifice,'' striker
Marcelo Salas said. ``You have to go through hardships. It really
is a dream for us.''
	   Chile was soccer's pariah in 1989, humiliated when its
goalkeeper Roberto Rojas cut himself when a flare was thrown near
him during a Sept. 3 match in Rio de Janeiro. Losing 1-0, Chile
walked off the field in protest in the 65th minute, carring Rojas
on a stretcher.
	   A subsequent investigation found Rojas faked the injury and FIFA
barred him from playing at the national level for life. It barred
Chile from the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, banned coach Orlando
Aravena and issued lesser sanctions to several other officials and
players.
	   Qualifying for the World Cup finals was greeted with celebration
in Santiago last year, but the second round was even more glorious.
	   In Nantes, Jose Sierra's 30-meter curling free kick in the 31st
minute was all Chile needed for the draw, but despite having a man
advantage for the final 38 minutes and a two-man advantage after
the 89th, it had to hang on for the point.
	   Patrick Mboma tied it for Cameroon on a header four minutes
after Rigobert Song was ejected for elbowing Salas. Cameroon, the
darlings of the 1990 World Cup who failed miserably four years
later, continued to push and had a game-winning goal by Francois
Omam Biyick disallowed in the 58th because of a pushing foul.
	   Losing gracefully apparently was not a trait of Cameroon's
French coach, Claude Leroy.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope (FIFA president
Sepp) Blatter was watching,'' Leroy said. ``There wasn't a shove or
a foul.
	   ``I can accept a lot of things, but I can't accept that one. I'm
sorry we were eliminated, but especially on a decision that was an
incompetent one.''
	   In Saint-Denis, Italy used its deep well of strikers to advance,
getting a fourth goal from Christian Vieri and a second from
Roberto Baggio to eliminate Austria.
	   After being fouled, Alessandro Del Piero bent a free kick from
the left side of the penalty area into the goal box, where Vieri
ran through to knock it in in the 49th minute.
	   Baggio, who replaced Del Piero in the 73rd minute, secured the
match in the 90th, latching onto a cross from Filippo Inzaghi, who
replaced Vieri in the 60th, and tapping it into the net.
	   Andreas Herzog gave Austria its only goal on a penalty, the
third time in as many games the central Europeans had scored in
injury time.
	   Norway's victory created drama in two places at the same time.
	   In Saint-Etienne, Morocco was on its way to a 3-0 victory over
Scotland, and the Norwegians knew a draw would only send them home
again after the first round for the third time.
	   But Tore Andre Flo used a remarkable individual effort to
equalize in the 83rd and Kjetil Rekdal won it with a penalty in the
89th minute as Norway rallied to put itself into the second round
and crush the Moroccan hopes.
	   ``I got the ball. I was lucky I guess,'' Flo said. ``I took a
shot an it went into the corner. It was a good goal, but we knew we
needed one more. Then we got the penalty and it was a very cool
finish by Rekdal.''
	   ``It was one of the best (victories), definitely. We made
history in Norway today.''
	   What created tears of joy in Norway caused only crying for
Morocco.
	   Salaheddine Bassir and Abdeljilil Hadda punished the sleeping
Scottish defense with strikes in the 22nd and 47th minutes and
Bassir added a third five minutes from the end.
	   But it was wasted effort. Morocco coach Henri Michel could be
seen on TV kicking the bench as he got word that the Norwegians had
gone ahead.
	   ``All of us, we and the players are extremely disappointed,''
Michel said. ``I want to pay tribute to an excellent and an
outstanding team and I want to thank them from the bottom of my
heart.
	   ``Morocco has shown the world that we were playing an excellent
World Cup and deserved to be here.''
	   Elsewhere at the World Cup, a police officer beaten Sunday by
German fans remained in a coma and his recovery prospects looked no
better.
	   A second suspect was identified and judicial officials said the
man was among 15 Germans already detained for suspected involvement
in the melee.

Spaniard gives himself up after hijacking domestic flight

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish man who hijacked a domestic
Iberia Air Lines flight with 131 people aboard and demanded to be
flown to Tel Aviv surrendered peacefully to police after speaking
to his psychiatrist, authorities said.
	   The hijacker, identified as Javier Gomez, said he had
``short-circuited,'' police chief Juan Cotino told reporters in the
aftermath of four-hour standoff.
	   After he surrendered police discovered Gomez was unarmed when he
forced Iberia's flight 1121 between Seville and Barcelona to land
in Valencia's Manises airport in eastern Spain at 8:40 a.m.
(0640GMT), Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Gomez was brandishing a remote control device and threatening to
explode a bomb, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Once Gomez had identified himself to police surrounding the
aircraft, it was discovered he was under psychiatric treatment. His
doctor, Ildefonso Mateo, persuaded him to give up in a cellular
call from Seville.
	   ``After talking to him for four minutes, he softened and the
situation was resolved,'' Mateo said on Spanish television.
	   Several of the hostages, including Seville Mayor Soledad
Becerril and city councilor Jose Antonio Aguirre, were able to talk
to police and family using their cellular phones during the hijack.
	   Becerril and Aguirre were on their way to a meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland, to promote Seville's candidacy to hold the 2008
Olympics. After their release, most passengers continued on to
Barcelona, although Becerril's office reported she had missed her
connection and was returning to Seville.
	   ``It isn't a very good feeling when you're on a big plane and
you know a bomb can set it off,'' said American passenger Ollan
Cassell, a vice president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation. But, he continued, ``After a while, we realized he had
no weapons, no knife, no gun.''

World Cup: Injured defender returning home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy's young defender Alessandro Nesta
was ruled out of the World Cup with tore right knee ligaments, team
doctors announced Tuesday night.
	   The 22-year-old defender of Lazio of Rome, who was injured
following a collision with an Austrian defender during a Group-B
match at Saint-Denis, will return home Wednesday, leaving the
Italian team with only 21 players.
	   Under FIFA rules injured players can't be replaced during the
competition.
	   Team doctors said said that magnetic resonance scanning in a
Paris hospital indicated that the injury was more serious than
feared.
	   It was the latest blow of bad luck for the Italian team which
lost striker Fabrizio Ravanelli on the eve of the World Cup and
goalie Angelo Peruzzi just before the transfer to France '98.
	   Nesta, who had made his World Cup debut against Chile, was
knocked out after only four minutes of Tuesday's match with
Austria, which Italy won 2-1 earning qualification for the second
round.
	   Italian team officials said Lazio doctors will decide treatment
of Nesta's knee injury.

Error causes dlrs 1 billion inflation in Argentina's trade deficit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ President Carlos Menem said
Tuesday that an administrative error had caused Argentina's trade
deficit to be overstated by dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``The trade deficit is lower by dlrs 1 billion than is actually
reported,'' Menem said in prepared remarks at a banking conference.
	   Menem said the federal customs agency, which compiles the
deficit numbers, calculates its operations by hand since it doesn't
have a computer system.
	   The figures are then released by the National Institute of
Statistics, an agency in Argentina's Economy Ministry.
	   Argentina's trade deficit was dlrs 2.49 billion in the first
four months of 1998 - the most-recent data available - compared
with dlrs 914 million for the same period in 1997, the institute
has said.
	   The Economy Ministry, customs agency and the president's office
were not immediately available for comment.
	   News of the error emerged over the weekend, when a Buenos Aires
newspaper, citing an unnamed Economy Ministry source, reported a
``large'' but unspecified gap between the deficit figure from the
statistical institute and that from the customs service.
	   The lower figure is good news for the government, which has
promised the International Monetary Fund it would keep its trade
deficit under dlrs 5 billion.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Audubon Society, which is concerned
about possible health problems to birds and fish caused by
pesticides on golf courses, has placed Augusta National Golf Club
on its ``Bad'' list.
	   In an article in the July-August issue of Audubon, which hits
the newsstands on July 1, the group says Augusta National requires
more fertilizers and pesticides than most other courses because it
cuts its fairways so short. The group also noted that the ponds at
Augusta National are colored with a green dye.
	   Also in the ``Bad'' group are the Golf Club of Miami in Florida
and Shadow Creek Golf Club in North Las Vegas.
	   Augusta is the only course used on the PGA Tour.
	   The ``Good'' courses are Collier's Reserve in Naples, Florida,
Old Westbury Golf and Country Club in Old Westbury, New York and
Widow's Walk Golf Course in Scituate, Massachusetts.
	   The ``Formerly Ugly'' courses praised for reclaiming land are
Bay Harbor Golf Club in Bay Harbor, Michigan; Coyote Hills Golf
Course in Fullerton, California; and Old Works Golf Course in

World Cup: Italian coach expected second-round clash with Norway 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy's coach Cesare Maldini on Tuesday
showed no surprise in learning that Norway will be the second-round
opponent of the Italian team in the World Cup.
	   ``Norway's qualification was expected, although it was achieved
through complex results,'' Maldini said.
	   The Norwegian team stunned defending champion Brazil 2-1 to earn
a second-round berth as runnerup in Group A.
	   Brazil, still the Group A leader, will take on Chile in the
second round.
	   Italy won the Group B beating Austria 2-1 in an earlier match.
	   ``Norway proved a strong team by defeating Brazil. Thus we are
looking forward to a tough match in Marseille,'' Maldini said.
	   Italy will play Norway in Marseille Saturday.

World Cup: Norway stuns Brazil to qualify 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with more quotes, edits to conform.
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ With its future in the World Cup down
to seven minutes, Norway gave the defending world champions a
lesson on delivering in the clutch.
	   With a pair of goals six minutes apart, the Norwegians stunned
Brazil 2-1 to hand the four-time Cup winners their first defeat and
qualify for the second round for the first time in its history.
	   After a Bebeto header gave Brazil a 1-0 lead in the 78th minute,
Chelsea striker Tore Andre Flo evened the score on a solo effort
five minutes later. Kjetil Rekdal converted a penalty kick in the
89th for an electrifying finish to an otherwise boring game.
	   The fans in Viking helmets and red-and-blue Norwegian flags
refused to let their heroes leave the field at Stade Velodrome, and
the team trotted around the field to salute their ecstatic
supporters.
	   ``It's incredible. I'm amazed at what happened,'' Norwegian
coach Egil Olsen said.
	   ``It was one of the best (victories), definitely,'' Flo said.
``We made history in Norway today.''
	   For Bebeto, Brazil came away sadder but wiser.
	   ``We were better, we created the chances, we deserved to win,''
he said. ``But there are evils that come for the good. This will
make us stronger. We lost when we could lose. We can't in the next
round.''
	   The game actually meant little for Brazil. After victories over
Scotland and Morocco, the team already had qualified in first place
in Group A. Norway, with two points going in, needed a victory to
qualify with Morocco winning 3-0 over Scotland in their final
match.
	   But Brazil wanted this one. Stung by a 4-2 loss to Norway in a
friendly game last year and Olsen's bragging ever since, the
Brazilians wanted revenge.
	   The Brazilians could have fielded their ``B'' team, tested their
second-stringers and not risked an injury to Ronaldo or its other
stars. Instead, they tested a new, attack-heavy formation with
quicksilver midfielder Denilson in place of Cesar Sampaio,
suspended for one game after drawing his second yellow card against
Morocco.
	   But they might have sensed it wasn't their night when the band
got their national anthem wrong.
	   ``We lost a game that was won,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo
said. ``This will serve as a great lesson to us not to lose our
concentration. It was a defeat on the road to the `penta','' as
Brazilians call the hoped-for fifth Cup title.
	   The game started slow and saw scant chances by either side, but
the Brazilians controlled the possession and had the better of
play. But the sluggish pace and lack of scoring brought catcalls
from the crowd.
	   The game put many to sleep until Denilson awoke everybody in the
78th minute.
	   He broke in on the left, stumbled, fell, got up, spun past
defender Henning Berg and sent in a perfect cross that a diving
Bebeto headed in for a 1-0 lead.
	   With Morocco winning easily over Scotland in Saint-Etienne in
the other Group A contest, Norway looked sure to be headed for
another first-round exit.
	   But in the 83nd minute, Flo took a long ball, dibbled around
defender Junior Baiano and shot into the left corner past a diving
Taffarel to make it 1-1.
	   ``We didn't let Norway do anything,'' said Rivaldo. ``But
unfortunately after the goal, we lost our cool and went on the
attack like runaway horses, which made things easier for the
Norwegians.''
	   Zagallo felt the Norwegians didn't deserve the goal for their
stodgy play to that point.
	   ``They played anti-soccer. They had two defensive lines and only
one striker, as if they didn't need to win,'' said the frustrated
coach. ``We should have just traded passes in the midfield and let
the Norwegian fans boo. But one goal wasn't enough for us and we
went looking for the second.''
	   Then with a minute left, Junior Baiano collided with Flo in the
penalty area, and American referee Esse Baharmast whistled the
foul. Rekdal fired it into the left side for the clincher.
	   ``I got the ball. I was lucky I guess,'' Flo said. ``I took a
shot and it went into the corner. It was a good goal, but we knew
we needed one more. Then we got the penalty and it was a very cool
finish by Rekdal.''
	   In the final minute, Grodas smothered a booming shot from
Roberto Carlos to seal the victory.
	   Brazilian captain Dunga was one of the harshest critics of his
team's play.
	   ``The Norwegian victory is the least of it,'' he said. ``What I
regret is the wrong-headed way we played in the final minutes. We
forgot everything we know how to do well, which is move the ball.''
	   Still, the rivalry was strictly on the field. Norwegians and
Brazilians were united in the pre- and post-game partying _ and two
vowed to stay together forever.
	   Olvind Ekeland, a 28-year-old Norwegian, married 29-year-old
Brazilian Rosangela de Souza on the pitch before the game. After
his ``da'' and her ``sim,'' fans of both teams joined in a chorus
of ``Stand By Me,'' in English.

World Cup: Injured defender returning home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy's young defender Alessandro Nesta
was ruled out of the World Cup with tore right knee ligaments, team
doctors announced Tuesday night.
	   The 22-year-old defender of Lazio of Rome, who was injured
following a collision with an Austrian defender during a Group-B
match at Saint-Denis, will return home Wednesday, leaving the
Italian team with only 21 players.
	   Under FIFA rules injured players can't be replaced during the
competition.
	   Team doctors said said that magnetic resonance scanning in a
Paris hospital indicated that the injury was more serious than
feared.
	   It was the latest blow of bad luck for the Italian team which
lost striker Fabrizio Ravanelli on the eve of the World Cup and
goalie Angelo Peruzzi just before the transfer to France '98.
	   Nesta, who had made his World Cup debut against Chile, was
knocked out after only four minutes of Tuesday's match with
Austria, which Italy won 2-1 earning qualification for the second
round.
	   Italian team officials said Lazio doctors will decide treatment
of Nesta's knee injury.

Spaniard gives himself up after hijacking domestic flight

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish man who hijacked a domestic
Iberia Air Lines flight with 131 people aboard and demanded to be
flown to Tel Aviv surrendered peacefully to police after speaking
to his psychiatrist, authorities said.
	   The hijacker, identified as Javier Gomez, said he had
``short-circuited,'' police chief Juan Cotino told reporters in the
aftermath of four-hour standoff.
	   After he surrendered police discovered Gomez was unarmed when he
forced Iberia's flight 1121 between Seville and Barcelona to land
in Valencia's Manises airport in eastern Spain at 8:40 a.m.
(0640GMT), Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said.
	   Gomez was brandishing a remote control device and threatening to
explode a bomb, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Once Gomez had identified himself to police surrounding the
aircraft, it was discovered he was under psychiatric treatment. His
doctor, Ildefonso Mateo, persuaded him to give up in a cellular
call from Seville.
	   ``After talking to him for four minutes, he softened and the
situation was resolved,'' Mateo said on Spanish television.
	   Several of the hostages, including Seville Mayor Soledad
Becerril and city councilor Jose Antonio Aguirre, were able to talk
to police and family using their cellular phones during the hijack.
	   Becerril and Aguirre were on their way to a meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland, to promote Seville's candidacy to hold the 2008
Olympics. After their release, most passengers continued on to
Barcelona, although Becerril's office reported she had missed her
connection and was returning to Seville.
	   ``It isn't a very good feeling when you're on a big plane and
you know a bomb can set it off,'' said American passenger Ollan
Cassell, a vice president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation. But, he continued, ``After a while, we realized he had
no weapons, no knife, no gun.''

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday rejected a report by a
U.S. laboratory that found traces of the deadly VX nerve gas agent
in Iraqi missile warheads and demanded the findings be reviewed by
a neutral country or experts from several nations. U.S. and
diplomatic sources confirmed Tuesday that chemical analysis of
Iraqi warheads, handed over to the U.N. Special Commission,
revealed traces of VX despite Baghdad's claims that it never
successfully manufactured weapons from the nerve gas agent. The
head of the commission, Richard Butler, is expected to brief the
Security Council on the findings Wednesday. The council has said it
will not lift sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990, until Baghdad satisfies U.N. inspectors that it has
destroyed all weapons of mass destruction. (UN-IRAQ WEAPONS)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
confronted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday,
delivering what could be the final warning before NATO tries to end
the fighting in Kosovo by force. The visit by Holbrooke, the next
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is seen as a last attempt to
get Milosevic to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the
secessionist Yugoslav province. After four hours of talks with
Milosevic, Holbrooke said the Yugoslav leader reaffirmed an earlier
promise to allow foreign diplomats to observe the situation in
Kosovo, but the American envoy refused to reveal anything else.
There are widespread fears that the fighting between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could spread to Macedonia, which borders
on Kosovo and also has a sizable community of restive ethnic
Albanians. Western nations have been deliberating on what measures
they will take if he continues to defy them. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced
three more Germans to prison as France grappled with World Cup
violence that has left a policeman in a coma and an English fan in
critical condition. Scores of fans and police officers have been
injured in violence that has erupted in several French cities
hosting the soccer championship that began June 10. More than 200
people have been arrested. A court in the northern city of Bethune,
near Lille, convicted the three Germans to a year in prison for
attacking French police in some of the World Cup's worst violence.
It followed Sunday's game between Germany and Yugoslavia in nearby
Lens. Ranging in age from 22 to 30, they were also barred from
France for two years after serving their terms. (FRANCE-WORLD

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Volunteers across the United States began
receiving injections Tuesday in the first-ever large-scale human
test of an AIDS vaccine. The three-year trial of VaxGen Inc.'s
AIDSvax is intended to learn whether it can protect people from
infection with the AIDS virus. The testing is the final step before
Food and Drug Administration approval. Five thousand volunteers
will participate in more than 30 U.S. cities, including New York,
San Francisco, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Los
Angeles and St. Louis. Volunteers will be injected with either a
placebo or AIDSvax, which scientists say is not dangerous because
it is not a live strain of the AIDS virus. Some 25 potential
vaccines have been tested worldwide, but none has advanced to this
larger-scale testing, known as a Phase III trial. (US-MED-AIDS

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Leading stock measures rose sharply Tuesday as
big-name technology stocks rallied for a second day and energy
shares rose amid hopes for a rebound in oil prices. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 117 to 8,828. Broader indexes also posted
big gains, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rising more
than 2 percent. IBM rose sharply as the Dow's strongest component
for a second straight day. Hewlett-Packard, the Dow's other
technology issue, also posted a sizable gain. Microsoft's shares
soared after a federal court threw out a preliminary injunction _
granted under the federal antitrust suit against the software maker
_ that had barred the company from packaging its Internet browser
with its popular Windows operating system. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ As OPEC struggles to raise the depressed
price of oil, some key players said Tuesday they want to remove
more than 1 million barrels a day from the glutted market. That
would almost double the amount of new production cuts that six OPEC
nations have already promised while watching crude prices tumble to
12-year lows. Futures traders responded to the prospect of deeper
cuts by pushing prices sharply higher in New York and London.
(OPEC)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government announced its plan Tuesday
to take the bitter medicine prescribed by the International
Monetary Fund: sharp budget cuts combined with improved tax
collection. ``Carrying out this program will be difficult, but we
have no other way,'' President Boris Yeltsin told his Cabinet at a
special session prompted by the country's economic crisis and
urgent negotiations with the IMF. The plan was announced by Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who called for 42 billion rubles (dlrs
6.8 billion) in spending cuts and 20 billion rubles (dlrs 3.2
billion) in increased tax collection this year. Kiriyenko said the
plan would be sent to parliament for its approval Wednesday. Parts
of the program _ big cuts in the government workforce, a revamped
tax code _ are certain to run into strong resistance in the Duma,
the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a victory for Microsoft with important
implications for the U.S. government's landmark antitrust case, a
federal appeals court on Tuesday removed restrictions a judge had
imposed on the company's Windows 95 software. The three-judge panel
decided there was adequate justification for Microsoft to bundle
its Internet browser within its popular Windows 95 software. The
same practice in Windows 98, which goes on sale this week, is one
of the core complaints of the Justice Department and 20 states
currently suing Microsoft. Government lawyers contend that
requiring computer makers to buy Microsoft's browser as part of
Windows 95 amounted to an illegal ``tying'' of the products and
violated a 1995 court-sanctioned agreement between the company and
the government. But the appeals court on Tuesday described the
packaging of the browser with Windows 95 as ``a genuine
integration,'' which is legal, because a single combined product
offers benefits over separate ones. (US-MICROSOFT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials rallied behind one of the
nation's largest lenders Tuesday, hoping to calm investors in what
is fast becoming a major test of how effectively Japan can handle a
bad-debt crisis looming over its banking system. Shares of
Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd., which is saddled with more than 1.4
trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans, rebounded Tuesday
after Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga and other top financial
officials expressed confidence in the bank's ability to stay
afloat. Analysts said the government will likely do whatever is
necessary to prevent the bank's collapse, including arranging a
merger or providing short-term loans. LTCB is so big that its
failure could shatter the already fragile faith Japanese depositors
have in their banks. (JAPAN-BANK RESCUE)

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Actor Roger Moore says the adventures faced
by his character British secret agent James Bond were nothing
compared to his job now as a UNICEF ambassador who calls on
governments to improve the well-being of children.
	   The world of Bond was a fantasy, but this is real life, said
Moore, who portrayed the agent on film for more than a decade.
	   Moore, who has worked with the U.N. program for seven years,
said Monday in Mexico City that the main problems facing children
are rooted in poverty, the lack of education and abuse. He urged
governments to act on their pledges to help children and mothers.
	   Moore will be in Mexico for one week to raise support for
projects benefiting children.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Pop singer Michael Jackson will
invest an estimated dlrs 800 million to build a family theme park
in Rio de Janeiro, city officials said Tuesday.
	   Construction of the theme park, which will be similar to the one
Jackson built in Poland, is scheduled to begin next year said
Patricia Nolasco, press spokeswoman for Rio de Janeiro's city
government.
	   The exact site of the park, which has yet to be decided, will
occupy an area of 1.2 million square yards (1 million square
meters), Nolasco said.
	   The new park is expected to create 12,000 new jobs, she added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Macaulay Culkin, star of the ``Home Alone''
movies, won't be alone any more.
	   Culkin and Broadway actress Rachel Miner, both 17, married
Sunday at an undisclosed location in Connecticut in front of family
and friends, according to Culkin's publicist, Paul Bloch.
	   Miss Miner starred in the recent Broadway production of ``The
Diary of Anne Frank'' in the role of Margot, Anne's sister.
	   Culkin's film credits include two ``Home Alone'' movies, ``My
Girl,'' ``The Good Son'' and ``Richie Rich.'' He made the Forbes
magazine richest entertainer list in 1993 after earning dlrs 23
million over two years.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles benefited from a handsome increase
in profits from the Duchy of Cornwall, the historic estates that
support the heir to the throne.
	   The Duchy reported Tuesday that it turned a profit of nearly
dlrs 10 million in the year ending March 31, up 9 percent from the
previous year. That wasn't quite as good as the 9.8 percent
increase in the previous year.
	   The Duchy of Cornwall business, created in 1337, owns 128,000
acres (51,800 hectares) of land and property in 22 counties. The
Duchy is tax-exempt, but Charles voluntarily pays income tax _
currently at 40 percent _ on his income after deducting for
official expenditures.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Linda McCartney was remembered with her
husband's songs ``My Love'' and ``The Lovely Linda'' at a memorial
service in a church filled with 45,000 flowers.
	   An Appaloosa horse was led through the Riverside Church on
Monday evening in a tribute to Mrs. McCartney's love of riding and
her work as an animal rights activist.
	   The Boys Choir of Harlem sang the Beatles tune ``Blackbird'' and
the spiritual ``His Eye Is On the Sparrow'' at the private service.
About 400 guests attended, while 300 fans gathered outside.
	   ``Linda would love this, because Linda loved music,'' said
singer Neil Young, according to Paul McCartney's spokesman, Geoff
Baker. ``She loved music and she ended up living in a house of
music and now she is music.''
	   Wearing a black suit, McCartney said: ``It's a very sad time for
all of us, but she wouldn't want us to be sad, but to count our
blessings, as there are so many of them.''
	   McCartney blew a kiss to fans outside as he left the church. As
his limousine pulled away, he thrust a hand out the window and
flashed a peace sign.
	   Mrs. McCartney, who died of breast cancer at age 56 in April,
grew up in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb.
	   John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono _ who lives in Manhattan _ was not
invited to the service Monday, according to a woman at Ono's office
who identified herself only as Helen. Ono recently wrote a tribute
to Mrs. McCartney in Rolling Stone magazine.

Puerto Rico lawmakers approve sale of state phone company labor reax, detail. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS, UPDATING throughout with lawmakers approving sale,
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's legislature,
undeterred by violent protests, has approved the dlrs 1.9 billion
privatization of the island's telephone company.
	   Tuesday's vote by the House of Representatives was another blow
to a labor movement that has suffered a wave of privatizations of
state-owned companies and properties under Puerto Rico's governor,
Pedro Rossello.
	   Under the deal, a consortium led by U.S. telecommunications
giant GTE Corp. will acquire a controlling stake in the Puerto Rico
Telephone Company.
	   Hundreds of protesters marched outside the capitol building,
chanting ``No to the sale!'' They continued demonstrating after the
House voted 34-18 to approve five of six bills clearing the sale.
The sixth bill passed 31-21.
	   Labor unions, which began striking Thursday, contend that
hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs will be lost. They portrayed
the deal as a sellout of Puerto Rico's patrimony _ a nationalistic
appeal that was taken up by Rossello's vocal political opposition.
	   Rossello, however, insisted that the state-operated telephone
system _ often criticized for high rates and poor service _
couldn't compete in the Puerto Rican market, where it enjoyed a
monopoly until recently.
	   His government has sold hotels and a shipping company, courted
private investment in the power industry, and sought to shift
health care management to the private sector.
	   The telephone deal awaits only Rossello's signature and Federal
Communications Commission approval to go into effect. FCC review
could take months.
	   In a strike marked by sabotage of phone lines, harassment of
managers and violent clashes with police, 6,400 telephone workers
have tried to stop the deal. In 1990, their unions successfully
stopped plans to sell the telephone company by Gov. Rafael
Hernandez Colon, whose party now opposes privatization.
	   About 6,500 state electrical workers joined the expanding
protest Tuesday, and government water utility and ports workers
walked picket lines.
	   ``Our strike will go on as long as it takes,'' said Telizia
Dolz, secretary-general of the Independent Brotherhood of Telephone
Employees.
	   Protesters cut fiber optic lines serving the sprawling U.S. Navy
base at Roosevelt Roads in northeastern Puerto Rico Tuesday,
leaving its 7,600 people without local service. Navy operations
weren't affected, and calls to the U.S. mainland were getting
through, said base spokesman Roberto Nelson.
	   Sabotaged telephone lines have affected more than 75,000
customers, shut down automated bank machines and slowed electronic
cash transfers.
	   Clashes Monday between strikers and police injured at least 10
people. Protests were calm Tuesday.

Italian mobsters escape through tunnel under courtroom

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ Authorities were searching for two
mobsters who escaped during their own trial by slipping away
through a tunnel dug under their southern Italy courtroom.
	   Court was in session and dozens of security guards, lawyers,
prosecutors and judges were present when Guiseppe Autorino and
Ferdinando Cesarano sneaked away Monday. The men remained at large
on Tuesday.
	   Accomplices allegedly built the tunnel, which emerged in a field
outside the Salerno courtroom.
	   Police said they saw Autorino and Cesarano emerge on the field
and flee in a car that had been parked nearby. Guns and grenades
were found inside the tunnel.
	   New reports said the accomplices had earlier cut a hole into the
floor of the court's holding cage then covered it with something.
The hole connected to the tunnel. While other defendants in the
cage blocked the view of authorities, the mobsters escaped.
	   Already serving life sentences for mob-related crimes, the two
were among dozens of defendants at the trial against one of the
most powerful clans of the region's Camorra crime syndicate.
	   Justice Minister Giorgio Napolitano called the escape
``extremely serious'' and promised to punish those responsible.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's legislature,
undeterred by violent protests, has approved the dlrs 1.9 billion
privatization of the island's telephone company.
	   Tuesday's vote by the House of Representatives was another blow
to a labor movement that has suffered a wave of privatizations of
state-owned companies and properties under Puerto Rico's governor,
Pedro Rossello.
	   Under the deal, a consortium led by U.S. telecommunications
giant GTE Corp. will acquire a controlling stake in the Puerto Rico
Telephone Company.
	   Hundreds of protesters marched outside the capitol building,
chanting ``No to the sale!'' They continued demonstrating after the
House voted 35-17 to approve five of six bills clearing the sale.
The sixth bill passed 30-20.

Venus gets lost but shows up just in time Court 1 at 1300 GMT; 1100 GMT on all others AP Sports Writer

By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Last year, Venus Williams flopped in
her Wimbledon debut. This time, she nearly failed to show up.
	   The 18-year-old American came within five minutes of being
defaulted when she got lost on the All England Club grounds and
turned up late for her first-round match Tuesday.
	   ``I could never figure out where Court 13 was,'' she said. ``I
thought I was playing on Court 18, but I thought that was Court 13,
but no.''
	   Williams said she made it on time but WTA Tour officials
confirmed she was 10 minutes late. A no-show after 15 minutes
results in an automatic default.
	   Winning the match proved easier than finding the court as
Williams cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Canada's Jana Nejedly _
one of only 14 matches completed on a day disrupted by intermittent
showers.
	   Other women's seeds advancing Tuesday were No. 1 Martina Hingis,
No. 3 Jana Novotna, No. 14 Sandrine Testud and No. 16 Nathalie
Tauziat.
	   The forecast was better for Wednesday, with No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport, No. 3 Monica Seles and No. 4 Steffi Graf among those
scheduled to play second-round matches.
	   The only men's seed to complete a match Tuesday was No. 6
Patrick Rafter, who downed Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuberger, 6-1, 6-2,
4-6, 6-1.
	   Fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski, limping with a sprained left ankle,
split the first two sets against Mark Draper and trailed 5-4 in the
third. Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, led
Brett Steven two sets to love.
	   In second-round matches scheduled Wednesday, defending champion
Pete Sampras was due to face Sweden's Mikael Tillstrom and Andre
Agassi was up against Germany's Tommy Haas.
	   Getting past the opening round was a relief for Williams, who
was upset in her first Wimbledon match last year by Magdalena
Grzybowska. Williams lost her only grass-court match this year at
the Wimbledon warmup event at Eastbourne.
	   ``It feels real nice,'' she said. ``It's comforting to know that
I'm doing better.''
	   But Williams isn't doing much different. She remained glued to
the baseline and refused to try the serve-and-volley tactics which
are so effective on grass.
	   ``I wasn't really trying too many things,'' she said. ``My plan
was more or less, make my shots and get off the court before it
rains.''
	   Williams indicated, without too much conviction, that she will
mix her game up more in coming matches.
	   ``You know, more serve and volleying would be at least one serve
and volley because I didn't attempt it at all today,'' she said.
	   When it was pointed out that she did come in and hit a forehand
volley, Williams said, ``Something must have been wrong with me,
then.''
	   There was little wrong with Hingis, who opened defense of her
title with a hard-fought 7-5, 6-3 win over Lisa Raymond.
	   The 19th-ranked American was one of only five players to beat
Hingis last year. In their last meeting, Raymond won in three sets
in Zurich.
	   ``When you play Wimbledon, you don't want to play the No. 19 who
you lost to last time,'' Hingis said. ``I had to give everything to
just get through the first round.''
	   Raymond sensed that Hingis can be beaten.
	   ``I think she's vulnerable here,'' she said. ``I think she feels
like she's got something to prove again, and the first couple of
matches are going to be tough for her.''
	   Hingis, who became the youngest Wimbledon women's champion in
110 years when she won the title last year at 16 years, nine
months, said she has a different attitude this time.
	   ``Last year I was still kind of the underdog,'' she said. ``On
grass, nobody expected me to win it or gave me the credit. Now I am
the favorite and it is quite a different feeling to come back here
as a defending champion with the opening round on Centre Court. It
feels good.''

Rainy day at Wimbledon? Turn on the World Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ What to do during rain breaks at
Wimbledon?
	   ``Just (waiting) in the lockerroom, laying down, reading
magazines, watching TV,'' said defending champion Martina Hingis,
who won her first-round match Tuesday over American Lisa Raymond
7-5, 6-3.
	   And the World Cup in France?
	   ``I was watching, Italy won 2-1 (over Austria),'' she added.
``Everyone was watching soccer at the break.
	   Even American Venus Williams.
	   ``I watched a little soccer, had a sandwich,'' she said.
	   It was that kind of day Tuesday. Only 14 of 74 matches were
played as on-and-off showers ruined the day.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WEATHER UPDATE: &LR;  Weather in England changes hourly, but
officials at the London Weather Center are calling for mostly sunny
skies Wednesday through Saturday with Thursday the most likely day
for heavy showers.
	   Last year, two full days were rained out _ the wettest in
Wimbledon in history.
	   ``I don't see that right now,'' said duty forecaster Graham Rye.
``There's a reasonable chance for it to be fairly sunny.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VENUS WAXINGS: &LR;  Venus Williams has just one complaint about
Wimbledon: the extensive electronic security.
	   ``I'm not into all that scanning,'' she said. ``When you come in
in the car they want to scan, and when you leave... they want to
scan. When you come in the gate they want to scan.
	   ``Only one scan a day.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONGING FOR ANNA: &LR;  Anna Kournikova is gone, but not forgotten.
	   British newspapers peppered their pages Tuesday with her photos,
a day after the 17-year-old Russian withdrew with a thumb injury.
	   ``Notice to all Men: Wimbledon is over,'' said The Mirror.
	   ``If you're a man, Wimbledon is history,'' the paper said.
	   ``Sexy Anna out of Wimbledon,'' said The Sun, which treated her
injury as a news story.
	   ``British blokes were broken-hearted yesterday as tennis smasher
Anna Kournikova pulled out of Wimbledon,'' The Sun said.
	   ``And that means no more sexy smiles and skimpy outfits... to
keep legions of lads glued to their tellies.''
	   The Daily Telegraph, Britain's most conservative broadsheet,
carried the story of her withdrawl on the front page _ bumping
inside a BBC interview with au pair Louise Woodward, convicted of
manslaughter in the death of an American baby.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UN-FASHION TIP: &LR;  On a scale of 1 to 10, Andre Agassi scored
about a 2 for his outfit in a first-round victory over Alex
Calatrava.
	   ``Agassi was wearing a sort of long-sleeved pregnancy smock,
shorts that reached all the way down to this calves, and a baseball
cap _ daringly worn the right way around,'' Simon Barnes wrote in
The Times.
	   ``No player has exposed less naked flesh to the Wimbledon crowd
since Anne White turned out in a skin-tight catsuit in 1985.''
	   In other fashion news, Monica Seles wore what the Daily Mail
described as a see-through dress _ with a white bodysuit underneath
_ in her first-round win.
	   ``It looks pretty sensational _ the sort of dress girls are
wearing to go out nightclubbing at the moment,'' Nike spokesman
Debbie Cox was quoted as saying.

Rafter gets motivational kick from Newcombe AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ That must have been some fax John
Newcombe sent to U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter.
	   ``I needed a bit of a kick,'' Rafter said. ``That's what he did.
Although I'd heard the information from other people, it hadn't
sunk in.''
	   A two-time Wimbledon champion, Newcombe has been a steady
supporter of Rafter, who is the backbone of his Australian Davis
Cup team.
	   ``It's just between me and Newc,'' added the 25-year-old Rafter,
Wimbledon's sixth seed and as good a bet as anyone to dislodge
defending champion Pete Sampras as he bids for his fifth title in
six years.
	   Rafter, coming off a period of indifferent tennis and
first-round losses, defeated Switzerland's Ivo Heuberger 6-1, 6-2,
4-6, 6-1 in his first-round match Tuesday interrupted for two hours
by rain.
	   Rafter was the only seeded man to complete a match Tuesday.
	   Two weeks ago, Rafter was ready to take a break after losing
meekly to fellow Australian Scott Draper in the first round of the
Wimbledon warmup at Queens.
	   ``Now I feel good,'' he said. ``I feel a big sense of relief.
I've got my happiness back on the court, and that's the main thing.
When I have that, I start playing well.
	   Rafter won the first set in 27 minutes and led 5-1 in the second
when on-and-off rain stopped play for two hours.
	   He won the second set soon after the break, stumbled in the
third, but got back on top in the fourth as he waited his chance to
break Heuberger, ranked only 146 on the ATP Tour.
	   Rafter used his strong second serve to win the U.S. Open, but he
discounted it as a weapon at Wimbledon.
	   ``On grass, it's never really a main weapon because I feel I've
got more of a kick serve,'' he said. ``But here it's mainly a solid
first serve in the corner, then get in.''
	   Rafter said he felt pressure back home. But maybe losing
repeatedly in recent months had solved that, he joked.
	   ``People are realizing now that I'm not supposed to win all the
time,'' he said. ``I'm having a lot of losses, I think in a way
that took a bit of pressure off me.
	   ``Maybe now people don't expect as much from me.''

Two tweets heard 'round the world AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The power of a referee's whistle could hardly be
more profound.
	   Two controversial fouls _ two cases of apparent incidental
contact _ in two games Tuesday at the World Cup led to street
celebrations on the other side of the world, sent teams to
unprecedented levels of success and left losing coaches angry,
bitter or perplexed.
	   Norway _ not Morocco _ is in the second round because of a
penalty in the 89th minute that gave the Norwegians a stunning 2-1
victory over defending champion Brazil. It's the first time Norway
has ever made it past the first round.
	   ``We made history in Norway today,'' Norwegian striker Tore
Andre Flo said.
	   The game didn't matter to Brazil, which had already clinch first
place in Group A, but even coach Mario Zagallo couldn't help but
raise the proverbial eyebrow to American referee Esse Baharmast's
decision that Junior Baiano's bump with Flo as the two battled for
position on a high ball was worthy of the most decisive of fouls.
	   ``I don't really know what happened there,'' said Zagallo,
shrugging his shoulders. ``The referee is FIFA's problem, not
Brazil's problem.''
	   It was a problem for the Moroccans, who thought they had
qualified with a 3-0 victory over Scotland _ until they learned
that Norway had staged its amazing comeback.
	   Morocco's players wept on the field. Coach Henri Michel kicked
the bench, then hugged each of his stars. And he hadn't even heard
about the dubious penalty that did his team in.
	   ``All of us, we and the players are extremely disappointed,''
Michel said. ``I want to pay tribute to an excellent and an
outstanding team, and I want to thank them from the bottom of my
heart.''
	   For truly bitter words, turn to Cameroon's Claude Le Roy, whose
tirade went straight to the top over a call that cost his team a
probable winning goal and a second-round berth in a 1-1 draw with
Chile.
	   ``I can accept a lot of things, but I can't accept that one,''
Le Roy said. ``I'm sorry we were eliminated, especially on a
decision that was an incompetent one.''
	   The foul came in the 58th minute, when Hungarian referee Laszlo
Vagner claimed Patrick Mboma pushed Ronaldo Fuentes just before
Francois Omam Biyick put the ball in the net.
	   ``We can't really accept this unfair decision,'' midfielder
Salomon Olembe said. ``The referee will not be welcome in Cameroon
if he wanted to spend a holiday there.''
	   Le Roy launched into repeated verbal attacks on FIFA president
Sepp Blatter, who last week told referees to call more fouls.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope Mr. Blatter was
watching,'' Le Roy said. ``There wasn't a shove or a foul.
	   ``Perhaps the Figaro newspaper in France will complain I'm a
sore loser. I hope FIFA will discuss the issue of what happened
today. Perhaps he should listen to (World Cup organizing head
Michel) Platini more often. Mr. Platini is the one who knows about
football. Perhaps he should stick to administrative tasks.''
	   The result put Chile into the second round for the first time on
foreign soil _ it finished third when it played host in 1962 _ and
sent thousands into the streets of Santiago. A ban over a faked
injury during a qualifying match in 1989 had kept Chile out of the
last two World Cups altogether.
	   ``Chile has qualified after many years of sacrifice,'' striker
Marcelo Salas said. ``You have to go through hardships. It really
is a dream for us.''
	   Chile will play Brazil in the second round Saturday. Norway will
face Italy, which won Group B by beating Austria 2-1.
	   More celebrations and heartbreak were due Wednesday, when Groups
C and D are decided.
	   South Africa needs a near-miraculous set of circumstances to
avoid elimination in Group C. The Bafana Bafana need to beat Saudi
Arabia and root for Denmark to lose to France _ and hope the score
of at least one of the games is lopsided.
	   France, like Nigeria in Group D, has already qualified for the
second round. Unless, Paraguay can upset Nigeria at Toulouse, then
the winner of the Spain-Bulgaria game _ assuming there's not a tie
_ will leapfrog into second place and join the Nigerians in the
round of 16.
	   Meanwhile, Tunisia became the third eliminated team to dismiss
its coach, sending Polish-born Henry Kasperczak on his way after
two losses. Saudi Arabia's Carlos Alberto Parreira and South
Korea's Cha Bum-kun have also been given the sack.
	   On the hooligan front, a court in Bethune convicted and
sentenced three more Germans to prison. Each received a one-year
sentence for attacking French police following Sunday's
Germany-Yugoslavia game in nearby Lens.
	   Also, two 27-year-old Germans were placed under formal
investigation _ a step short of being charged _ for the attempted
murder of a policeman who remains in a coma after Sunday's
violence.
	   In Toulouse, an English fan underwent three hours of surgery and
was in ``very serious condition'' on life support after being
stabbed in a attack that occurred sometime around Monday's
England-Romania game.
	   More than 200 violence-related arrests have been made since the
start of the World Cup, a pace matched only by the now-repetitive
anti-hooligan rhetoric that follows it every day.
	   ``What has happened shows that we must now do everything, and I
mean everything, to prevent something like that happening in the
future,'' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who voiced
support for a data bank on known soccer hooligans. ``They are
troublemakers and their activity must be stopped.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Predrag Mijatovic was credited for Yugoslavia's
first goal against Germany following ``extensive studies of the
video'' by FIFA's technical study group.
	   Fellow forward Dejan Stankovic was originally named as having
scored the 13th minute goal in sunday's match.
	   Germany's first goal, originally credited to Michael Tarnat on a
deflected free kick in the 74th minute, also was changed to an own
goal by Yugoslavia's Sinisa Mihajlovic.
	   The own goal is the fourth of the tournament, tying the World
Cup record set in Switzerland in 1954.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Spanish coach Javier Clemente said Tuesday
he hopes to continue at the helm well into the next century, even
if his squad is eliminated from the World Cup's first round.
	   ``I'm not worried about it,'' Clemente said on being asked if he
felt he would still have a job after Wednesday's critical Group D
game against Bulgaria, which some believe could be his last.
	   ``I'll probably stay until 2004, or maybe 2010.'' said the
48-year-old tough-talking Basque.
	   Two coaches have already been shown the door so far in the World
Cup with Saudia Arabia bidding farewell to Carlos Alberto Parreira
and South Korea ousting Cha Bum-Kun
	   Calls for Clemente's ouster have surged with Spain's disastrous
start in the World Cup comprising a 3-2 defeat against Nigeria
followed by a poor 0-0 tie against Paraguay.
	   On Wednesday, a victory for Paraguay over already-qualified
Nigeria would eliminate Spain while a draw would require the
Spaniards to down Bugaria.
	   Clemente took over the squad in 1992 and has a solid record of
just five defeats in 60 matches. However, the team has failed to
make it to the final of any major competition during his reign.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONTHIEUX, France (AP) _ Belgium is in trouble ahead of its
decisive Group E game against South Korea Thursday, with winger
Danny Boffin out with a knee injury and goalkeeper Filip De Wilde
and captain Franky Van der Elst uncertain.
	   Boffin had to be carried off in the weekend 2-2 draw against
Mexico and will at least be 10 days out of action with a ligament
strain in his left knee.
	   De Wilde continues to be troubled by pain in his abductor
muscles. ``Every time he goes up for a high cross he doesn't feel
good,'' coach Georges Leekens said.
	   Captain Van der Elst left the Mexico game, played under a
scorching sun in 37 C (97F) temperatures, and the 37-year-old
hasn't felt fine since.
	   ``We will have a talk about the situation,'' said Leekens.
	   Belgium has to beat South Korea and hope that the Netherlands
defeats Mexico to advance. Belgium would need to win by three goals
over South Korea, which is already eliminated in case of a Mexican
draw against the Netherlands.
	   ``This is what the whole World Cup comes down to for us,'' said
Leekens.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Thousands of Italian fans gathered at
Saint-Denis stadium to cheer their national team as it downed
Austria 2-1 to qualify into the second round of the World Cup.
	   They chanted and waved Italian flags and many had their faces
painted with the Italian colors. Groups of teenagers displayed wide
stripes supporting team star Alessandro Del Piero.
	   ``Alex I love you, I'm here for you,'' one poster read.
	   The big crowd of Italians was an apparent response to
lamentations by some players who had stressed the lack of fans
support in the opening match against Chile.
	   In the World Cup game Italy tied 2-2 against the Latin American
team at Bordeaux, the few hundreds of Italians had been outnumbered
by Chilean supporters.
	   ``Italians by now are used to televised soccer,'' midfielder
Francesco Moeriero had said last week. ``They prefer to watch
matches on television, with a plate of spaghetti (pasta) and a
glass of wine on the table. We really needed their support while
trailing Chile in the second half.''
	   Alberto Barravecchia, one of the Italian supporters at
Saint-Denis Tuesday, said ``the farther the team goes in the
competition, more fans will be attending Italy's matches. We really
love this squad.''

World Cup: Continental coaches still dominate in Africa 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Trott Moloto has a seemingly impeccable
pedigree for aspiring to become South Africa's national soccer
coach.
	   Moloto knows the South African game and players, having played
with top club Kaizer Chiefs and then coaching a local club. Now
middle-aged, he is assisting Philippe Troussier, a Frenchman, in
coaching the national team at its first World Cup. And blacks now
have better opportunities for top positions in South Africa, after
the end of apartheid.
	   But ask Moloto who should be coach and he doesn't hesitate in
endorsing Troussier for the job, at least until the 2006 World Cup,
which South Africa hopes to host.
	   ``Personally, I'm a student at the moment. I don't know if I
will have graduated by the time he leaves South African football,''
Moloto said of the European he called a ``man of vision.''
	   Europeans dominate the coaching ranks in Africa, and have done
so for years. All five African teams at this year's World Cup
started the first round with European coaches.
	   Despite calls in some countries for locals to take over coaching
duties, the practice of keeping Europeans at the helm is
entrenched.
	   According to Troussier, Europeans bring discipline, advanced
training methods and motivational skills of the wealthy
professional leagues to Africa, where most national associations
and leagues remain relatively unrefined.
	   He noted that Africans have yet to exert any influence in
coaching.
	   ``What is the African school? I don't think we have an African
coach in the world,'' Troussier said. ``African countries need to
accept the discipline, the organization, because until now the
African countries have never proven successful at a world level.''
	   Underlining his authority, Troussier this week sent home two
South African players, including starting midfielder Brendan
Augustine, for partying all night in violation of a team curfew.
	   Black nationalists in South Africa called for Troussier to be
replaced by Moloto or another black _ former international star
Jomo Sono _ after South Africa lost its World Cup opener 3-0 to
France. But Moloto and most of the players support Troussier. Even
Naughty Mokoena, one of the players Troussier suspended, said he
had no problem with the coach.
	   ``I've played under a lot of different coaches,'' said veteran
midfielder Doctor Khumalo. ``He has good vision, a good handle on
the international game. ... He's a smart guy.''
	   Both Troussier and Claude Le Roy, the French coach of Cameroon,
said a foreigner often has an easier time coaching in the
hurly-burly politics of African soccer. A local coach would come
from one of several tribal groups, setting off rivalries and
jealousies that could undermine an entire program, they noted.
	   ``The presence of a foreign coach is not about competence,''
Troussier said. ``It's about the neutrality of his status.''
	   To Bora Milutinovic, the well-traveled Yugoslav coaching
Nigeria, all that matters is the coach's personality.
	   ``Can he work with people?'' said Milutinovic, who this year
became the first coach to take four different countries to the
second round of the World Cup. ``Players are all the same. It
doesn't matter where you are. Look at me.''
	   Nigerian defender Taribo West agreed.
	   ``Soccer is not a game of language,'' he said. ``It's a game of
fitness and technique. The only problem is to adapt to the system
and style of the coach. Once you do that, it works.''
	   Troussier said he takes a low-key approach to handling the
players by trying to understand them without imposing too much of
himself.
	   Some players disagree. Midfielder Delron Buckley of VfL Bochum
in Germany complained after South Africa's drubbing by France that
Troussier's disciplined, defense-first system was stifling the
players' ``African flair.''
	   ``Africans have to play the African style,'' he said, referring
to the freedom to use their ball skills and take on defenders
one-on-one. ``I don't think European teams can beat them when they
play that way.''
	   The main criticism of European coaches is their tendency to move
from job to job. Troussier took over South Africa in March and is
certain to move on after the World Cup. Le Roy came to Cameroon in
April, while Milutinovic was hired by Nigeria last December.
	   Le Roy said a coach's tenure depends on the individual. He
previously worked for four years in Cameroon and four years in
Senegal. Morocco's French coach Henri Michel has been in the same
job since October 1995.
	   A poor record can get a coach fired just as quickly in Africa as
anywhere else. Tunisia's coach Henri Kasperczak, a Pole in charge
of the national team since June 1994, was fired Tuesday after his
team dropped two straight matches and was ousted from the World
Cup.

World Cup: Japan federation head satisfied with team's performance 
</HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japan so far has only two losses to
show at its first World Cup. But the head of the Japanese soccer
federation couldn't be more pleased.
	   ``There was a wall between us and the world. But like the Berlin
Wall, part of that wall has come down,'' Japan Football Association
president Ken Naganuma told The Associated Press. ``I am very happy
about that.''
	   Although losing to both Argentina and Croatia, Japan has held up
well against the more experienced teams, allowing only one goal in
each game _ to world-class strikers Gabriel Batistuta and Davor
Suker.
	   It still has one final game, against Jamaica, on Friday.
	   Japan has relied on coordinated team work and tight defense at
the World Cup to cover up for its lack of individual talent and
physical power. In contrast, it has not been able to show much in
offense, having scored no goals so far.
	   But Naganuma said he had not expected much more than what the
team has delivered at its World Cup debut.
	   Japan can hope to do better at the next World Cup, which it will
co-host with South Korea, he said.
	   ``We must use what we have learned from this experience. There
were some aspects that were not good,'' Naganuma said in this
resort town, which serves as Japan's base camp during the
tournament.
	   ``We must raise the level of the individual players much higher,
in many ways. We already have fine, organized team work.''
	   Forward Masashi Nakayama also believes Japan could not have done
much else at this World Cup.
	   ``If we had relied on individual play this time, we would never
win,'' Nakayama said. ``For now, this was inevitable. In the
future, there may be new players with more technique and power.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made it
clear after meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
time was running out for a peaceful end to ethnic violence in
Kosovo.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday after four hours of talks with
Milosevic.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, the next U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic to stop his
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Yugoslav
province.
	   Holbrooke said Milosevic reaffirmed an earlier promise to allow
foreign diplomats to observe the situation in Kosovo, but the envoy
refused to reveal anything else about the meeting, saying it was
confidential.
	   Holbrooke was to travel to Kosovo on Wednesday, visiting its
capital Pristina and areas west of that city where fighting has
been heavy. He said he would return to Belgrade Thursday, and
travel to Greece on Friday.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke met in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and
President Kiro Gligorov, as well as the leader of the Kosovo
Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Holbrooke called his meeting with Rugova ``very productive,''
but again declined details.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is gaining in public support in
predominantly Albanian Kosovo.
	   Clashes continued Tuesday across the troubled province.

World Cup: Coach hopes fewer restrictions will bring more results 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-QUENTIN, France (AP) _ The methods of South Korea's former
coach Cha Bum-kun didn't seem to work, so replacement-coach Kim
Pyung-seok is hoping a different approach might produce better
results.
	   Based on a strict physical regimen combined with rigid
discipline, South Korea's previous training program led its
national team to the World Cup finals.
	   But that was as far as the Asian team ever got.
	   Once in France, South Korea suffered a bitter 3-1 loss to
Mexico, followed by a stinging 5-0 defeat to the Netherlands,
prompting team officials to fire Cha.
	   Now, with Cha gone, the team's new coach has decided to
implement his own methods.
	   ``Cha's strength is with the players, he had a great deal of
leadership and was good at imposing discipline,'' said Kim.
	   ``My style is to give the players more freedom. To give them
more leaway and make the most of my players' strengths, allow them
more liberties to be creative.''
	   It was Cha's strict marking tactics which resulted in South
Korea's big gap in scoring against the Dutch.
	   Marking the Dutch stars man-to-man, Cha's team was quickly
rendered helpless against the likes of Dennis Bergkamp.
	   ``We are going to incorporate many changes into the next game,''
said Kim. ``We are going to reinforce the midfield and flanks, we
know they are going to try to take advantage of our weaknesses.''
	   ``We will adjust our tactics to our opponents, try to come up
with the best strategy and work to counter their strong points.''
	   Kim listed the Belgians diligence, steadiness and consistency as
the teams most dangerous attributes.
	   The South Korean players had other worries.
	   ``The Belgians play a typically European style,'' said the
team's star striker and leading scorer Choi Yong-soo. ``And they
are very tall.''

World Cup: Italy qualifies for last 16, eliminates Austria with 2-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; UPDATES with quotes.
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Having qualified for the second round
of the World Cup, Italian coach Cesare Maldini hopes to use his
four world class strikers to make it all the way to the final.
	   Strikers Alessandro Del Piero, Roberto Baggio, Christian Vieri
and Filippo Inzaghi were all instrumental as Italy beat Austria 2-1
Tuesday to make it through to the last 16 and eliminate the
Austrians.
	   ``The match was more difficult than expected,'' Maldini said.
``It is good to have two great strikers on the substitutes' bench.
I am happy to have avoided Brazil in the next round, but I want to
enjoy our victory and not think too much about the next match.''
	   Maldini acknowledged the Austrians' spirited performance.
	   Austria displayed a strong defense and aggressive offense that
translated into its best performance of the tournament. Coach
Herbert Prohaska suggested that to the very end, the game could
have gone either way.
	   ``I think we were lacking a bit of luck,'' he said. ``But the
Italian defense stood its ground well.''
	   ``Austria can be proud of this team,'' said captain Anton
Polster, who was substituted in the 61st minute of his 94th
international match.
	   Defender Anton Pfeffer said his team did well, but ``what
counts, unfortunately, is that we are eliminated.''
	   The Italians drew first blood in the 49th minute, compliments of
Vieri.
	   Del Piero, who had just been fouled, took a free kick from the
left of the penalty area, and Vieri climbed high above the Austrian
defense, to connect with a powerful header that surprised
goalkeeper Michael Konsel.
	   Baggio made it 2-0 in the 90th minute, when he nudged in a cross
from Inzaghi _ like Baggio a second-half substitute.
	   Austria surged forward in search of an equalizer with precise
passing and an untypically offensive game. But its only goal _ on a
penalty shot by forward Andreas Herzog _ came in the 92nd, too late
to serve as a springboard for an Austrian equalizer.
	   Vieri's goal puts him joint top of the goalscoring standings,
equal with Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Chances were few and far between during a match played in front
of 80,000 spectators at the Stade de France. Still, the resurgent
Austrian team gave the Italians some anxious moments.
	   In the 66th minute, Arnold Wetl, left unmarked five yards from
goal, neatly controlled a cross on his chest and flicked the ball
over his shoulder, only to see Inter Milan goalkeeper Gianluca
Pagliuca knock the ball away.
	   Francesco Moriero came closest for Italy in the first half.
	   In the 29th minute, Gianluca Pessotto crossed from the left and
Moriero hit a spectacular right-footed volley from 15 yards that
went wide of the post.
	   Italy got a blow within the first three minutes when Lazio
defender Alessandro Nesta went off with ligament injuries after a
clash with Austrian midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Nesta was replaced by 34-year-old Inter Milan sweeper Guiseppe
Bergomi and Maldini said that Nesta would likely miss the rest of
the World Cup.

Sampson: Will he stay or will he go? AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   PORNIC, France (AP) _ Steve Sampson is a failure for the first
time in his life.
	   He was the first American-born coach to lead the United States
at a World Cup, and now his future is uncertain following the
team's two-and-out crash-and-burn on soccer's biggest stage.
	   ``Name me one other American that has succeeded at all levels,''
Sampson said before the wipeout. ``I've never had a losing season
in my life, and every team I've ever coached has always achieved
its goal. Always. I hope this one will be no exception.''
	   Instead, American soccer is at its lowest point since 1985, when
it failed for the ninth straight time in World Cup qualifying. And
U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg once again is
deliberating whether to retain Sampson or sign a high-profile
foreigner such as Carlos Alberto Parreira to start the rebuilding
for 2002.
	   ``I feel very confident and very proud of what I've done,''
Sampson said moments after Sunday night's humiliating 2-1 loss to
Iran. ``If the federation doesn't want me, I'm sure some other
organization will want me.''
	   Given a day to reflect, he still was proud of his team's
performance, except for the first 45 minutes against Germany. He
responded to a question about his future with a virtual verbal
resume.
	   ``I've got an enormous amount of international experience,'' he
said. ``I'm one of two coaches out of what, 40, in North and
Central American who has survived this process, and I think this
experience is rare and hard to come by.''
	   If Rothenberg fires him, Sampson's future could be in Major
League Soccer. Or it could be with a club or national team in
Central or South America. He is fluent in Spanish.
	   ``I'm open to all offers,'' he said. ``I've already, in the last
six months, had offers.''
	   Since Sampson succeeded Bora Milutinovic as coach on April 22,
1995, the United States has gone 26-21-14, the first time it's
played above .500 under any coach for any sustained period.
	   He tossed out Milutinovic's defend-to-the-end style, and the
team responded with impressive victories over Brazil, Nigeria,
Argentina and Mexico.
	   But the biggest wins came over opponents at less-than-full
strength. And in the World Cup, when other teams stepped up their
play and aggressiveness, his players fell flat.
	   Rothenberg's postgame comments signaled Sampson's departure may
follow.
	   ``After the World Cup, we'll start to assess the future. I'm not
going to do it now,'' Rothenberg said, adding the team's showing
was ``a bitter disappointment.''
	   Sampson, 41, is extremely likable and extremely smart. And his
moves have been extremely controversial, at least in the insular
community of U.S. soccer.
	   He dropped captain John Harkes from the team two months before
the tournament, unhappy with his performance on the field and
leadership off it. He relegated Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa _
two of the team's 1994 stars _ to the bench and then benched Eric
Wynalda, America's career scoring leader, after a poor performance
against Germany.
	   Taking an unusual path, Sampson never was a pro head coach
before taking over the national team. After coaching at Santa Clara
for five seasons, leading his team to the NCAA co-championship in
1989, he became an executive with U.S. organizers of the 1994 World
Cup.
	   Wanting to get back on the field, he became an assistant to
Milutinovic in January 1993. When Bora was bounced, No. 1 assistant
Timo Liekoski was off coaching the 1996 Olympic team. Sampson got
the top job by default.
	   He transformed the team, which developed a wide-open
entertaining style, and Rothenberg hired him after Parreira (who
coached Brazil to the 1994 World Cup title) and Carlos Queiroz
(Portugal's former coach) turned it down.
	   Eliminating the players' fear of big-name opponents and opening
up the offense are his biggest accomplishments with this group. He
may not get a chance to take these players farther.
	   ``I hope my legacy,'' he said, ``will be that we went from
playing not to lose to playing to win under my tenure.''

After wowing markets by promising less oil, can OPEC deliver? AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recaps previous. Will be led, time uncertain.
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers pushed oil futures higher
by talking about some serious cuts in output. Now, it remains to be
seen whether they can deliver and keep the price from retreating
again.
	   The oil exporters were forced into action after prices plunged
to 12-year lows. As OPEC opened its summer meeting on Wednesday,
some ministers were saying they need to cut production by 1 million
barrels a day or more.
	   That's about twice what has been pledged thus far, but OPEC
members realize their oil-dependent economies are in deep trouble
if they can't find a way to get more money for their crude.
	   ``The price has reached a very low level. We need a drastic
decision,'' said Libyan oil minister Abdalla Salem el-Badri, adding
his name to the list of ministers vowing to show restraint. ``We
need a shock, not a shot.''
	   Futures traders were encouraged as minister after minister made
bold predictions Tuesday about cutting more production, and oil
prices climbed in London and New York.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August rose 68 cents to close
at dlrs 13.92 per barrel on London's International Petroleum
Exchange. Light sweet crude oil for August was up 87 cents at dlrs
14.52 per barrel around midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
	   The prospect of more expensive oil shook New York stock prices
as well, with Big Oil's shares rising and transportation companies,
such as airlines, falling on fears they will stop enjoying such a
big break on their fuel bills.
	   Crude oil is the world's most vital commodity and the recent
cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers but a nightmare for
OPEC and other producers.
	   OPEC found itself in a mess this winter after boosting output
just as the Asian economic crisis started eroding the growth in
world oil demand.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further.
	   Six of the 11 OPEC members have now pledged a second round of
cuts totaling 620,000 barrels a day _ and at least two ministers
say they're shooting for a target of more than 1 million barrels.
	   Libya became the seventh OPEC member to say it will cut
production, although it would not say by how much. Two more
stragglers, Algeria and Nigeria, hinted they soon will announce
their own cuts.
	   The big producers from the Gulf _ Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates _ all seem willing to slash output further
than already promised.
	   ``The market needs another cut. Everybody should admit it,''
said Abdulla bin Hamad al-Attiyah, the oil minister of tiny Gulf
state Qatar.
	   OPEC has been helped by non-OPEC members Mexico, Russia, Oman
and Egypt, who say they will withhold another 203,000 barrels from
the market.
	   After the futures prices rose, extending gains that began on
Monday, some analysts cautioned that OPEC still needs to deliver
more than words. The once-powerful group has in recent years shown
a marked inability to stick by its production agreements.
	   ``It's a question of `How much and will they deliver?''' said
Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Center for Global
Energy Studies.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons development 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recaps previous; Security Council meets at 1430 GMT.
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq is challenging a report by a U.S.
laboratory that says traces of deadly VX nerve gas were found on
Iraqi missile warheads, saying the finding must be verified by
independent analysis.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was scheduled
to brief the Security Council Wednesday on the analysis by the U.S.
Army laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   Diplomatic sources said the lab reported finding traces of VX
and a stabilizer on shards of Iraqi warheads, despite Iraq's claims
that it never succeeded in transforming the deadly nerve agent into
a weapon.
	   If true, the finding could undermine efforts by Russia, France
and China to close the seven-year inspection program and lift
crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after
President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If this allegation is correct ... that will set back Iraq's
efforts to try to lift sanctions,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said Tuesday. ``It shows that they've been concealing, they've been
lying, and it calls into question their commitment to
disarmament.''
	   In a statement issued Tuesday, Iraq's U.N. mission said Baghdad
``rejects these results categorically,'' adding they ``cannot be
accurate since VX was not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due
to continuous production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because if VX was used, a stabilizer would
have been found in every sample.''
	   Iraq said the results must be verified by laboratories in a
neutral country or in several countries, including France and
Russia in addition to the United States.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops of the nerve gas can
kill in minutes.
	   Despite the U.S. report, the Security Council is deeply divided
over the Iraq issue. The United States and Britain insist that Iraq
provide full disclosure of all banned weapons before sanctions are
lifted.
	   Russia, China and France are equally resolved that the
inspections should wrap up as quickly as possible, a position also
held by chief advisers to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   It remains unclear whether the new evidence will be enough to
persuade the Russians, French and Chinese to harden their position
against the Iraqis.
	   Even if the findings were verified, they would not prove
conclusively that Iraq is still maintaining banned weapons since
the samples were taken from warheads that Baghdad says were
destroyed after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But Iraq has repeatedly maintained it never produced VX warheads
nor figured out how to store the deadly nerve agents in bulk.
Findings to the contrary would call into question all of Iraq's
previous declarations about the state of its mass destruction
weapons programs.
	   France, Russia and China have been urging the council to accept
Iraq's declarations and limit the inspectors to simply reviewing
and verifying those claims.
	   In Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said that 1.7 tons
of the agent had been produced but it was not of weapons grade. But
U.N. officials suspect the Iraqis may have produced up to four tons
of VX and if some was placed in warheads, the rest could still be
stored secretly somewhere in Iraq.

World Cup: new action taken against German soccer violence 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities aiming to stamp out World Cup
violence have intensified legal action against Germans accused of
attacking police near a stadium in northern France.
	   Two German men Tuesday night were placed under formal
investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for beating an
officer into a coma after Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in
nearby Lens. Three others were given one-year jail terms.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
in several French cities hosting the five-week soccer championship
that began June 10. An English fan was hospitalized in critical
condition.
	   More than 250 people have been arrested, some of them sentenced
to jail terms or deported, but the threat of violence remained.
	   As a result, tighter security, alcohol restrictions and early
bar closings have been announced for other matches, including
Germany-Iran in Montpellier on Thursday and England-Colombia in
Lens on Friday.
	   Authorities probing the attack in Lens that left the policeman
in a coma placed under formal investigation Markus Warnecke, a
27-year-old tattoo shop owner and skinhead from Hanover.
	   Warnecke, ordered to remain in jail, denied the allegation and
refused to talk to police, said his lawyer, Bertrand Wambeke.
	   Warnecke and 27-year-old Karl-Heinz Elschner, a record salesman
who also denied the allegation, are accused of bashing in the head
of the policeman, Daniel Nivel, 43.
	   Nivel was hospitalized in Lille, where doctors on Tuesday called
his condition ``still very worrying.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said. Six Germans were to be deported.
	   President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling around
World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   In Toulouse, an English fan was hospitalized in ``very serious
condition'' and on life support Tuesday after being stabbed in the
stomach and lungs, hospital officials said.
	   Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West Midlands,
underwent three hours of surgery after the attack that occurred
around Monday night's match between England and Romania.
	   Clarke was attacked with two other English fans in the
working-class Embalot neighborhood near the stadium, authorities
said.
	   Clarke was among three people injured Monday in Toulouse, where
authorities arrested about 30 people, French radio reported.
	   The week before, violence in Marseille between English fans and
French North African youths around the England-Tunisia match left
about 50 people injured. Police arrested more than 100 people.

Dollar sharply higher early in Tokyo, Japanese stocks edge up 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose sharply against the yen early
Wednesday after a rating agency said it may downgrade Japan's
country credit rating. Tokyo stocks rose slightly.
	   The dollar bought 139.61 yen in early trading, up 1.86 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 139.15
overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
edged up 20.42 points, or 0.14 percent, to 15,075.02. The previous
day it dropped 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent.
	   The rating agency Fitch IBCA warned that Japan's credit rating
could be downgraded, increasing concerns about the country's
economy after its government failed to deliver a recovery plan to
global finance leaders last weekend.
	   The warning follows last week's downgrade of the Long-Term Bank
of Japan Ltd. by Moody's Investors Services, which sent shares of
the once mighty industrial lender tumbling to half their value in
just two trading sessions.
	   LTCB shares recovered slightly Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen,
after government officials promised support for the troubled bank.
In early trading Wednesday, LTCB shares moved slightly lower,
losing one yen to 70 yen.
	   The dollar also gained momentum against the yen as the effects
faded of last week's dramatic intervention by U.S. and Japanese
central banks.
	   And unless Japanese leaders take action to fix Japanese
financial ills, traders said the dollar would likely keep rising.
	   ``You are going to see dollar-yen strengthen, unless they say
something or do something,'' said Ralph DelZenero, vice president
of foreign exchange at First Chicago.
	   Tokyo stocks were little changed as investors awaited more
details of the government's promised ``total plan'' to revive the
economy and speed up reform of the banking industry.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 1.33 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,176.75. It
fell 11.89 points, or 1.00 percent, the previous day.
	   Key to any reform package would be steps to help banks write off
some 76 trillion yen (about dlrs 500 billion) in bad loans left on
their books from the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with a plan by July 8 for a ``bridge bank'' to handle
bad loans.
	   Traders said they hope the bank looks something like the special
company set up by the U.S. government to help clean up the savings
and loan debacle.
	   ``How the market responds to plans to create a bridge bank will
be the key point,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager of the
equities operation group at Nikko Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.235 percent from Tuesday's 1.260 percent,
driving its price up to 111.71 yen from 111.53 yen.

Jiang the star of U.S. president's visit to China 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit this week
gives President Jiang Zemin the chance to combine showmanship and
statesmanship, polish his own lackluster public appeal and
strengthen his standing among Communist Party elders.
	   Careful stage-managing of such events has helped Jiang bring a
lighter touch to the usual propaganda fare of wooden television
appearances and jargon-laden speeches.
	   When the occasion calls, he cites the Gettysburg Address, chats
in English, sings a show tune. During a stop in Honolulu on his way
to the United States last October, Jiang danced the hula, swam at
Waikiki and even tried his hand at the Hawaiian steel guitar.
	   It is Jiang who claims credit for finally getting Clinton to pay
a state visit _ the first such visit by a U.S. president since the
Chinese military's crackdown on 1989 democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square.
	   Such high-profile diplomatic breakthroughs have helped the
Soviet-schooled engineer confound those who judged him a transitory
figure after party elder Deng Xiaoping installed him as Communist
Party chief in the wake of those protests.
	   Since his ascent, Jiang has sought to cultivate a populist
image, touring factories and visiting workers' homes.
	   He also has recognized that image-building isn't enough. Jiang
also has fortified his status as Deng's political heir with deft
power-broking.
	   He has installed his supporters within the party, government and
military _ of great importance for a man who has no army
credentials.
	   Jiang has appeased hard-liners by talking tough on Taiwan and
resisting Western criticism of China's human rights record. At the
same time, he has guided market-oriented reforms _ enlisting the
aid of economic troubleshooter Zhu Rongji, who was named premier in
March.
	   Born into an intellectual family in eastern Yangzhou city in
1926, Jiang studied electrical engineering in Shanghai and joined
the Communist Party two years before it took power in 1949.
	   After training in Moscow, he worked at China's state-run No. 1
auto factory and later at government research institutes. Many in
those schools were persecuted by radical supporters of Mao during
the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, but it is not known if Jiang was
affected.
	   Jiang shot to prominence when, as mayor of Shanghai in 1989, he
peacefully defused pro-democracy protests in that city. The
contrast with the military crackdown in Beijing impressed Deng. He
brought Jiang to Beijing to be general-secretary of the party,
which was deeply divided by the aftermath of the violent crackdown.
	   Clinton's visit signals the end of Beijing's post-Tiananmen
diplomatic isolation _ and gives Jiang a chance to flaunt China's
rich cultural heritage and the tremendous progress made over 20
years of market-oriented reforms.
	   Jiang and the Communist Party propaganda machine he controls are
making sure the Chinese public gets the point. Last week, state-run
television ran a prime-time documentary on Jiang's Oct. 26-Nov. 2
swing through the United States.
	   Shot after shot showed Jiang and Clinton standing side-by-side _
waving from a podium, reviewing troops, walking across the South
Lawn of the White House.
	   A poster advertising video cassette disks of the movie at a
Beijing department store included only three words in English.
	   ``He's very cool,'' it said.

U.S. Coast Guard readies floating booms in attempt to free tanker 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ U.S. Coast Guard officials were
preparing to deploy absorbent booms around the environmentally
sensitive shoreline before pumping oil out of a Russian ship
stranded off southern Puerto Rico.
	   The 600-foot (180-meter) Kapitan E. Egorev ran aground on a sand
bar in about 30 feet (10 meters) of water on Sunday while
approaching a refinery near Guayanilla. None of the 12 million
gallons (45 million liters) of oil has leaked, the U.S. Coast Guard
said.
	   There are coral reefs about a half a mile (800 meters) away from
the ship, and mangroves where endangered manatees live are about
one mile (1.5 kilometers) away.
	   A beach where endangered hawksbill turtles lay eggs is about one
mile (1.5 kilometers) downwind, Coast Guard commander Brian Salerno
said. The floating booms will be strung in front of those areas, he
said.
	   Officials plan to pump the oil into a barge to lighten the ship,
a process that could take several days. They planned to install
10-foot-thick (3-meter-thick) boat fenders on Wednesday to keep the
two vessels from bumping.

World CUp: Morocco left holding defeat after victory 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT ETIENNE, France (AP) _ It was the kind of match that lends
itself perfectly to cliche. The agony of defeat; the bittersweet
victory; tears of joy and sorrow. They all apply.
	   But however it may be described, Morocco's colossal 3-0 win over
Scotland on Tuesday still was not enough to get the Atlas Lions
into the second round of the World Cup.
	   Norway's surprising 2-1 upset over Brazil took care of that.
	   Defender Youssef Rossi summed the feelings of a teary-eyed team
in two words.
	   ``Thanks, Brazil,'' he said sarcastically, then walked away from
a throng of reporters.
	   Star midfielder Moustafa Hadji was equally pointed in his
criticism. ``Since I was a child, I loved Brazil,'' he said. ``But
this is the first time I feel something different (towards the
Brazilian team).''
	   Blaming the defending champions comes easy in this case. For the
first time in this year's World Cup competition, Morocco played the
way the team said it could play: assertively, decisively and making
none of the errors that cost it valuable points in its first two
matches.
	   Yet, through no fault of its own, the win had no tangible value.
	   ``I want to pay tribute to an excellent and an outstanding team
and I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart,'' Atlas Lions
coach Henri Michel said. ``Morocco has shown the world that we were
playing an excellent World Cup and deserved to be here.''
	   If there were any doubts about this in Morocco's first match
against Norway (2-2) or in its second when the team lost 3-0 to
Brazil, there were no question marks in the showdown against the
Scots.
	   Deportivo la Coruna's Salaheddine Bassir and Club Africain's
Abdeljilil Hadda gave the Scottish defense rousing wake-up calls in
the 22nd and 47th minutes. Bassir produced the third goal five
minutes before the end of the match.
	   Bassir's teammate at Deportivo, star midfielder Hadji was his
usual, aggressive and charged self, launching frequent strikes on
Scottish goalie Jim Leighton's turf.
	   The match was by no means one-sided. Scotland made several
jaunts of its own towards the Moroccan goal but seemed to get lost
before a maze of Moroccan players and goalie Driss Benzekri who
gave one of his best performances to date.
	   ``What won the match was taking the chances they (Morocco)
created,'' said Scottish coach Craig Brown, admitting that his team
failed to capitalize on the opportunities it created.
	   In this match, Morocco showed little resemblance to the team
which gave away two goals to Norway in its first group match, and
then let themselves be intimidated and outclassed by Brazil.
	   ``We lost (the chance to qualify), not in the match against
Brazil, but against Norway,'' said Michel. One of the two goals in
Norway's favor in that match was an own-goal by Morocco.
	   But with this ironic ending, the tears and regrets are now food
for thought for future matches.
	   ``We did what we had to do (against Scotland), and did it well,
praise be to God,'' said striker Bassir told The Associated Press.
	   ``God willing, we will have the chance again.''

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Televisions had barely dimmed from
showing Hong Kong's much-hyped transfer to Chinese rule last July 1
when celebrating Asians were hurled into the real event of 1997.
	   On the other side of Southeast Asia, Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh of Thailand gave up a six-month defense of the baht
against speculators and severed its peg to the U.S. dollar.
	   It fell. The date was July 2, 1997. The Asian Crisis had begun.
Currencies, markets and banks collapsed. Eventually, so did the
governments of hard-hit Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia.
	   A year later, the upheaval shows no let-up. Asian nations are in
recession or heading there and the pain is making itself felt
worldwide.
	   Now, contrary to initial hopes the crisis would be short, few
believe in a turnaround for at least three years _ an inauspicious
debut to what was once billed as the coming Asian Century.
	   ``I think the crisis has already spread beyond Asia,'' said
Miron Mushkat, one of the region's top economic analysts.
	   ``It has not induced a recession-like condition anywhere else
yet,'' Mushkat said. ``But exports from the U.S. and Europe are
beginning to suffer and that will continue. Eventually, there could
be rising manufacturing unemployment there.''
	   The U.S. Commerce Department has been reporting record trade
deficits _ the latest figure, for April, was dlrs 14.5 billion _ as
Asia buys less of everything from aircraft to farm products.
	   That doesn't equal a new Great Depression for Americans. Few
experts predict that Asia's problems will deliver such a blow to
the United States. But Wall Street's high levels strikes them as
highly dangerous.
	   For Asians, a 1929-style disaster is already here. Currency
upheavals wiped out dlrs 2 trillion of the region's stock market
capitalization over the past year, equivalent to a 20 percent fall
in the U.S. stock market, according to Standard Chartered Bank.
	   Rioting and looting in Indonesia that toppled Suharto, Asia's
longest-serving leader, in May was simply the most dramatic example
of the uncertainty affecting millions who lost their jobs and
hundreds of millions made poorer.
	   A typical case is Nouphen Chartsri. She is not a broke
high-flier forced to sell sandwiches, but an ordinary Thai farm
woman with a few years' education. A life in the tropical sun has
aged her beyond her 30 years.
	   When Asia was booming, Nouphen and her husband left their
village, Ban Meng, in Thailand's poor northeast and worked for
three years in a factory making door locks near Bangkok.
	   The monthly 8,000 baht (at the time dlrs 320) they earned was
twice their previous income from farming rice and cutting cane. For
Nouphen, the certainty of daily wages made up for living in a tiny
company hostel room.
	   Those were good times for the 600 families in Ban Meng. The
young adults went to the city to work. Old folks stayed home, cared
for the kids and compared rising living standards with neighbors as
money sent home paid for cinder-block latrines and installments on
motorcycles, TVs and refrigerators.
	   Most of those migrants are now back. Nouphen and her husband
lost their jobs last August when half of the 200 workers at their
factory were laid off.
	   ``Globalization? I've heard of it, but I don't know what it
means,'' Nouphen said. ``Probably, it means a troubled world.''
	   She's cutting cane again, for free, since her family has gone
into debt to the growers to survive. But cane cutting is irregular.
	   The rice crop has been withered by drought. Fish that used to
supplement their diet have disappeared as irrigation canals filled
with pesticides _ part of Asia's leap into the modern world.
	   Can her family last three years for an economic turnaround?
	   ``I doubt it,'' she said. ``We'll be broken. People will steal,
commit crimes.''
	   Quick fixes to the crisis have failed. The first epidemic of the
globalized economic age has consistently outraced traditional cures
prescribed by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Many Asians accuse the International Monetary Fund, which
organized bailouts totaling dlrs 120 million for Thailand, South
Korea and Indonesia, for making events worse by forcing governments
to jack up interest rates, driving wobbling companies into
bankruptcy.
	   In hindsight, the currency crisis _ the sudden withdrawal of
speculative billions investors placed in Asia during boom years
when 8 percent annual growth seemed normal _ seems simply the most
vulnerable tip of an over-leveraged iceberg.
	   Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed is not alone in
viewing the Washington-based IMF as a front for Western powers to
flatten Asian competition and pick up assets for a bargain.
	   So far, though, few foreign investors are rushing back to buy.
Stock markets keep sinking with no bottom in sight and the real
risk of most firms isn't known and factored into prices.
	   That reflects what many see as the real roots of the crisis _
the culture of corruption and cozy deals between politicians and
businessmen operating without accountability or oversight.
	   Demands for reform are coming from the IMF on down, but
entrenched elites are generally yielding only the minimum they
think they need to hang on and get back to business as usual.

	   Says Bruce Gale, regional manager of the Hong Kong-based
Political and Economic Risk Consultancy:
	   ``If they get their way, we might find ourselves taking a long
time to crawl out of this crisis.''
	   No one has been punished in Thailand for blatant banking-sector
fraud, linked to influential politicians, and government and
central bank mismanagement that helped bring on the crisis.
	   In South Korea, prosecutors have indicted two top economic
advisers to former President Kim Young-sam charged with mishandling
the crisis, lying about its severity, and corruption. They are in
prison awaiting trial.
	   The biggest threats to Asia now lurk in Japan and China.
Japanese investment fueled the boom. Now, Japan's economy _ in its
deepest recession since World War II _ hobbles the region.
	   The collapse of Japan's banks would rock far more than Asia.
Eight years after the country's economic bubble burst, the banks
are buried under an estimated dlrs 550 billion in bad loans, a
figure greater than entire national economies of its troubled
neighbors.
	   ``The stability of the yen is important to every country around
the world, because after all, (Japan) is the second largest economy
in the world,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive.
	   China has resisted devaluing its own money, fearing the Hong
Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. currency would fall in the backlash
and the rest of Asia's currencies be thrown into fresh chaos.
	   But investment from now-broke Asian neighbors, a key element in
China's super-charged growth in the past decade, has plunged.
	   Beijing is aiming for 8 percent growth in 1988 _ once the norm
for superstars like Thailand and Malaysia.
	   That's what is believed to be the minimum needed to create
enough jobs to keep a lid on worker unrest as communist-era
state-owned enterprises are closed. Signs are the target will be
difficult to meet.
	   Social problems are rising. Almost no Asian countries have
Western-style unemployment relief. Families traditionally get
individuals through hard times.
	   But the pressure can be unbearable. In South Korea, some
laid-off men dress in suits and leave home every morning,
pretending to go to work rather than tell their families the truth.
Suicides have increased 36 percent, to 25 a day.
	   ``I told my husband I was thinking about getting a job,'' said
Choi Bun-soon, 42, a mother of three. ``He just laughed. Who is
going to hire a housewife with no work experience?''

World Cup: Norwegians celebrate victory over Brazil AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ For Norwegians, Brazil's Ronaldo is no
longer a threat. When their own Tore Andre Flo scored against
Brazil, he will forever be Flonaldo in their hearts.
	   ``Finally, we showed the world who are the technicians. Now it
is Flonaldo and not Ronaldo we're talking about,'' said Stian
Drageset, 20, an engineering student of Oslo.
	   Together with thousands of other Norwegians, he had invaded the
streets of Oslo on Tuesday. And Drageset's car was not alone, and
the traffic was jammed with cars.
	   ``We are the best! We beat Brazil. Now we can go far,'' cheered
Morten Meier while driving around downtown Oslo in an open car.
	   Norway's Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is one of the most
enthusiastic soccer fans in Norway.
	   ``Unbelievable, but true. Norway has beaten Brazil in the World
Cup. Thank you for your great effort, and good luck later on,'' he
wrote in a telegram to the Norwegian team.
	   Normally, Norwegians are calm and realistic. Not today. Most
cars honked their horns as they were greeting each other. Before
the game not many believed in a Norwegian victory.
	   Norwegians have never experienced anything like this. Norwegians
took the streets singing and playing catching Brazilian samba
rhythms. ``I don't have time to talk to you,'' one of them said
marching up Carl Johan with his drum.
	   ``I can live on this forever. It is not possible to do better,
and this is the greatest thing I have ever experienced,'' said
Torfinn Gossner, a 23-year old sociology student.
	   June 23 is normally the midsummernight celebration in Norway
with bon fires all over the country. However, some had chosen to
postpone the celebration. Most Norwegians did not have their
traditional bonfire, but some held on to the traditional
celebration in their boats in the Norwegian fjords.
	   However, many of the boats had a TV set onboard.

Brazilians express shock and anger surprise World Cup defeat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians reacted with surprise
and anger Tuesday, after their country's unbeaten World Cup run
ended with a 2-1 defeat by Norway.
	   Stunned by two late goals, many fans accused the referee of
giving the Scandinavian side a controversial penalty and letting
them pursue their physical game virtually unchecked.
	   ``He (the referee) was prejudiced against us. He did not take
any notice of fouls and only handed out a couple of yellow cards,''
said Everton Acioli, 34, a civil servant.
	   Fans watching the game on a giant outdoor screen in the middle
class neighborhood of Tijuca flung cans at it in disgust after the
game had ended.
	   Globo TV showed mobs of fans shouting ``we were robbed.''
	   Some accused the referee of giving the Norwegians the penalty in
order to assure them a place in the next round of play and called
for FIFA to examine his performance.
	   Brazilian soccer legend Pele saw the defeat differently, blaming
it on his countrymen's passivity.
	   ``The team did not play well. They had chances to win but let
Norway play their own game,'' he told Globo TV.
	   After Morocco beat Scotland, Norway needed a win to continue,
while Brazil could afford the loss.
	   The result left fans unsure about what to expect when Brazil
plays Chile in the next round on Saturday.
	   ``This is bound to have negative effect psychologically on our
team,'' predicted Acioli. ``But we start afresh against Chile so
you never know what will happen.''
	   Pele said Brazil would need to change its game against their
fellow South American qualifiers.
	   ``We have to counter-attack quickly and break down Chile's weak
defense,'' he said.

Boaters disappear, boat found full of cocaine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A boat that left Puerto Rico over
the weekend with two people aboard was found capsized, abandoned
and packed full of cocaine on Tuesday.
	   U.S. Coast Guard officials said the two men aboard, 39-year-old
Joaquin Diaz and 38-year-old Rafael Oquendo, left Naguabo, in
southeastern Puerto Rico, on Sunday morning. Oquendo's wife
reported them missing that evening.
	   Coast Guard planes began searching for the 23-foot (7-meter)
motorboat and found it Tuesday morning capsized off the southern
coast of Puerto Rico. About 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of cocaine
worth around dlrs 6 million were found inside.
	   Coast Guard Commander Norman Henslee said investigators had not
linked the two men to the drugs, saying the boat might have been
hijacked or stolen. A storm Sunday night may have caused the boat
to capsize, he said.

Financial crisis brings wave of political change 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-FEA-Asian Crisis
By PAULINE JELINEK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The economic tempest sweeping through
Asia has led to widespread political changes _ forcing out old
leaders, discrediting old policies and emboldening advocates of
reform.
	   ``It has had some benefits,'' said Pasuk Pongpaichit, an
economics professor at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand.
	   Government accountability and abuse of power are now political
topics of the day, following the debt-induced currency collapses
that devastated economies and tattered an Asian consensus for
development at the cost of democracy.
	   Disgust over money politics and economic mismanagement led to
the ouster of leaders in Thailand and South Korea late last year.
	   Rising inflation, unemployment and other economic hardship
inflamed long-smoldering political discontent in Indonesia last
month, bringing a chaotic and bloody end to the 32-year rule of
President Suharto.
	   His successor and longtime ally, B.J. Habibie, has allowed a
more critical press, freed political prisoners and purged Suharto
cronies from the Cabinet. Habibie said he welcomes dissent and
protests against him.
	   ``It's OK. It is part of living in a democracy,'' he said.
	   The man who took Suharto's title as longest-serving Asian leader
_ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad _ is not as easy-going
amid calls for his resignation.
	   Political analysts question how well Mahathir will weather the
storm amid rising criticism of corruption coming from inside as
well as outside his ruling camp.
	   ``One lesson to be drawn from the Indonesian crisis is that
there can be no effective economic reforms without political
reforms,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Malaysia's
parliament.
	   ``All governments in Asia, including Malaysia, should ... enlist
popular support ... to wipe out the 3 Cs: cronyism, corruption and
collusion,'' Lim said.
	   The government's answer so far to growing unrest over Malaysia's
economy has been to crack down on critics. It has suppressed
negative economic news reports and broken up meetings of opposition
leaders and consumer rights advocates.
	   Meanwhile, though they aren't saying so, the fall of Suharto was
likely a rude awakening for the repressive military regime in
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   There, generals have been struggling unsuccessfully for eight
years to duplicate Suharto's economic achievements while clinging
stubbornly to power by crushing dissent.
	   But if the political message from Asia's crisis eludes Myanmar,
Malaysia and the communist states of Laos, Vietnam and North Korea,
leaders in China appear to get the point.
	   China has entered a period of political openness rarely seen
since the Communist Party ordered the military to quell the
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.
	   Academics and dissidents have been inspired by China's new
premier, Zhu Rongji _ a no-nonsense, pragmatic reformer _ to call
for political changes they say are necessary to maintain successful
economic reforms.
	   Although no Chinese leader has embraced political change, Zhu
has pushed an activist, market-oriented agenda in the face of
slowing growth, slackening foreign investment and rising
unemployment.
	   ``The current leadership team is the one that is driving
change,'' said Philip Carmichael, vice chairman of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. ``They're not waiting to get thrown
out of office like some other folks in Southeast Asia recently did.
They're making the changes themselves.''
	   Calls also are increasing for change in the regional Association
of Southeast Asian Nations and its policy of ``constructive
engagement.'' It promotes quiet diplomacy and increased business
ties as a way to correct human rights and other abuses in sister
nations.
	   ``Perhaps it is time for ASEAN's cherished non-intervention
principle to be modified,'' Thailand's foreign minister, Surin
Pitsuwan, said at a recent seminar.
	   ``When a matter of domestic concern poses a threat to regional
stability, a dose of peer pressure or friendly advice can be
helpful.''

Cuba asks Europeans to report on sanctions pact with U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba has asked the European Union to open up
a European agreement with the United States for comment before the
World Trade Organization.
	   The Cuban government's Prensa Latina news agency reported
Tuesday that Cuba asked the European Union to notify the global
trade body about the May agreement, which was meant to head off a
showdown over U.S. sanctions against Cuba.
	   Notification would open the way for Cuba and other countries to
make formal comments about the measure, Prensa Latina reported.
	   Under the agreement, European countries agreed to discourage
investment in U.S. properties in Cuba since the 1959 revolution,
while the United States said it would not take legal action against
European companies who use the properties now.
	   European countries had argued the U.S. sanctions violate
international law. The agreement stalled a possible European
complaint before the Trade Organization.

By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Here is a chronology of the Asian financial crisis:
	   _July 2, 1997: Thailand, suffering from growing economic ills,
allows its beleaguered currency to depreciate, ending its longtime
peg to the U.S. dollar. The currency plunges. In the following days
speculators turn to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia,
forcing their currencies sharply lower as well.
	   _July 19, 1997: The IMF agrees to extend more than dlrs 1
billion in credits to the Philippines to replace money its central
bank used in an unsuccessful attempt to prop up its currency.
	   _Aug. 11, 1997: The IMF organizes dlrs 17.2 billion in
international loans to bail out Thailand's economy. Thailand agrees
to an IMF-imposed reform program.
	   _Oct. 27, 1997: Continued currency turmoil in Asia triggers
large declines on the Hong Kong stock market and the largest
single-day point loss in Wall Street history.
	   _Oct. 31, 1997: The IMF announces a dlrs 40 billion
international bailout package for Indonesia. The United States,
worried by the Wall Street plunge, agrees to participate after
having refused to take part in the Thai rescue plan. Indonesia
closes 16 insolvent banks and the president's youngest son is
removed as head of the controversial national car program.
	   _Nov. 24, 1997: Yamaichi Securities Co., Japan's fourth-largest
broker, becomes the biggest Japanese company to fold since World
War II. It leaves behind roughly 3 trillion yen (dlrs 24 billion)
in liabilities, and is the third Japanese financial company to fail
in less than a month.
	   _Dec. 3, 1997: The IMF agrees on a record dlrs 58 billion
international rescue plan for South Korea. The package is the
largest ever, exceeding the dlrs 48 billion IMF-organized bailout
of Mexico in 1995.
	   _Dec. 5, 1997: The IMF says the Asian currency crisis has shaved
nearly a full percentage point off world growth next year.
	   _Dec. 6, 1997: Halla Group, South Korea's 12th largest
conglomerate, collapses in what is seen as the first of a series of
major bankruptcies expected under strict IMF supervision.
	   _Dec. 8, 1997: Thailand launches the biggest-ever revamp of its
financial system, liquidating 56 out of 58 insolvent finance
companies suspended earlier in the year under the IMF bailout.
	   _Dec. 18, 1997: Kim Dae-jung becomes South Korea's first
president elected from an opposition party since the country was
founded in 1948. Describing himself as a champion of the
free-market economy, Kim vows to help the country's economic
recovery by sticking to painful IMF reforms.
	   _Jan. 12, 1998: A major Asian finance house, Hong Kong-based
Peregrine Investment Holdings Ltd., shuts down as its cash flow
evaporates. Hong Kong's key stock index falls nearly 9 percent.
	   _April 1998: Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan admits
Japan's economic crisis is one of its worst since World War II.
Norio Ohga, the chairman of Sony Corp., says the economy is on the
brink of collapse and compares Hashimoto to U.S. President Herbert
Hoover on the eve of America's Great Depression in 1929.
	   _April 24, 1998: Markets are disappointed by Japan's dlrs 128
billion stimulus plan. Fears of a weakening yen rattle regional
markets and dash hopes for an Asian export rebound.
	   _May 21, 1998: President Suharto of Indonesia resigns after 32
years in power in the face of deadly rioting that breaks out during
pro-democracy protests in Jakarta and other cities.
	   _June 12, 1998: Japan's economy sinks into a recession. The
latest figures tip growth for the entire fiscal year into negative
territory for the first time in more than two decades.
	   _June 15, 1998: The Dow Jones industrial average falls 2.4
percent following panicky selling in Asia as the weakening yen
renews fears that Asia's economic troubles could spread. The drop
brings the Dow to its lowest level in three months.
	   _June 17, 1998: The United States jumps into global currency
markets, along with Japan, to halt a slide in the yen. That
immediately lifts the Japanese currency and the U.S. stock market.

Why can't Japan help the rest of Asia? Look at its banks AP Graphic ASIAN-LENDING

With BC-FEA-Asian Crisis
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ever since the Asian crisis began, Japan has been
criticized for failing to stimulate its economy, for letting the
yen slide against the dollar, and for trying to export its way to
recovery on the backs of giants such as Toyota and Sony.
	   But ask Japan's struggling neighbors and they are more likely to
point to its banks, which are coping with such severe bad loans
that most can no longer play their key role in Asia: rich uncle.
	   It has been eight years since Japan's fast-growth economy ground
to a halt, leaving the country's banks with a heavy burden of
worthless loans. Those problems have led to a debilitating credit
crunch at home and are a major factor behind Japan's deepest
recession in decades.
	   While Japan's economic malaise was already threatening to
curtail regional recovery, there are new fears that the weak yen
will force Japanese banks to choke off lending in Asia just as
their money is needed as never before.
	   ``Clearly the weak yen and the continuing deterioration in Japan
both point to lower lending in Asia,'' said Walter Altherr, banking
industry analyst in the Tokyo office of Jardine Fleming Securities
Co.
	   Many Japanese banks have suffered record losses in recent years
as they chipped away at the mountain of debt left by real-estate
deals that went bad when the market collapsed in the early 1990s.
But banks have made surprisingly little progress.
	   Estimates of their bad loans have ballooned from 3.5 trillion
yen (dlrs 26 billion) in 1992, to 76 trillion yen (dlrs 550
billion) this year _ a sum nearly the size of the Canadian economy.
	   In Japan, worries that more banks could fail _ several major
financial institutions have gone under in the last six months _
have raised consumer anxiety and curtailed spending.
	   The bad-loan overhang has made banks reluctant to lend new
money, even to healthy companies _ something that needs to happen
if Japan is to climb out of its recession and lead Asia out of its
economic crisis.
	   And now there are signs the credit crunch is spreading beyond
Japan's shores.
	   Loans by Japanese banks to the rest of Asia fell 7 percent in
the second half of 1997, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.
	   ``We have seen a substantial curtailment of activities of the
Japanese banks which obviously have added to the problems of
availability of credit,'' Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
lamented at an international forum.
	   The cutbacks are bad news because Japanese banks have been by
far the biggest foreign lenders in the region, accounting for 30
percent of international loans in Asia.
	   Japanese money had helped fuel the region's phenomenal growth
earlier in the 1990s. Of 20 overseas branches opened by Japanese
banks in 1995, every one was in Asia.
	   But a weaker yen threatens to force a hasty retreat, analysts
said.
	   Joint intervention in the currency market by the United States
and Japan recently rescued the yen from an eight-year low against
the dollar, but it is still more than 10 percent lower than levels
three months ago.
	   Japanese banks are vulnerable to a weak yen because they measure
their capital in their home currency, while as much as one-third of
lending, including much in Asia, is denominated in dollars.
	   International banking rules dictate that banks hold capital at a
ratio of 8 percent of assets, which for banks are mostly loans.
Bad-loan losses have already eroded the capital of even the
strongest Japanese banks to near that level.
	   The rules are no mere formality. Japanese banks that have fallen
below the standard have been forced by regulators to withdraw from
doing business overseas.
	   And even the strongest banks aren't safe.
	   For example, Japan's largest lender, the Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi, had capital of just 8.5 percent at the end of the
Japanese fiscal year on March 31.
	   At 146 yen per dollar _ the level before the U.S. intervention _
the bank's capital would have slipped to below the level that
international bankers consider safe, according to figures published
in the Nihon Keizai newspaper.
	   Further declines in the yen would erase more Japanese bank
capital, leaving them with two choices: raise new money or reduce
lending, especially overseas. With the weakness of Japan's stock
market, most are choosing the latter.
	   ``In order to support Asia the banks need to provide new money,
but they won't be able to do this for some time,'' said Koyo Ozeki,
a bank analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
	   ``Japanese banks have become very weak, and they don't have the
capacity to take additional risk,'' he said.
	   No wonder then that the first recommendation made by a group of
international finance officials meeting in Tokyo recently was for
Japan to ``restore its banking system to health.''
	   And no wonder that they included it as a step ``of vital
importance to Japan, to the recovery of Asia...and to the entire
world economy.''

Mexican foreign secretary meets with Castro on first visit to Cuba comments on U.S. operation.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ On her first official visit to Cuba, Mexican
Foreign Secretary Rosario Green seemed to find Fidel Castro
wherever she looked _ underscoring the importance Cuba places on
ties with Mexico.
	   The Cuban president had a six-hour session with Green that ended
early Tuesday. He turned up for a speech she gave at the University
of Havana. And he attended a Wednesday night reception at the
Mexican Embassy.
	   Green said the two discussed the communist island's chances to
rejoin the Organization of American States and Mexico's relations
with Cuba, according to the Cuban government's Prensa Latina news
agency.
	   Castro also sided with Mexico in a spat with the United States
over a money-laundering probe, calling the U.S. operation
``illegal, disloyal and worthy of gangsters,'' according to the
Mexican government's Notimex news agency.
	   Mexico has protested the use of U.S. agents on Mexican soil
without its permission during the Operation Casablanca sting.
	   In 1962, OAS members voted to expel Cuba, saying its adherence
to communism was ``incompatible with the inter-American system.''
Mexico and five other nations abstained.
	   Green told Castro that Mexico would suggest OAS
Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria of Colombia organize a group to
examine the matter, Notimex said.
	   However, she said, the question is not of great concern to
Castro, and Mexico would only promote Cuba's re-inclusion after
consulting with the Cubans, Notimex said.
	   Green said that the meeting at the Palace of the Revolution
showed Castro to be a ``man of great personal stature,'' Notimex
said.
	   Castro ``is a universal man, with knowledge of everything. But I
discovered that he has a mathematical mind,'' Green said, noting
that he made frequent statistical references.
	   Cuba's Vice President Carlos Lage and Foreign Secretary Roberto
Robaina also attended the session, along with Mexican Ambassador
Pedro Joaquin Coldwell and Mexican Deputy Foreign Secretary Carlos
de Icaza.
	   Mexico is one of the few countries in the Americas to have
maintained relations with Cuba despite pressure from the United
States.
	   Green, who was appointed foreign secretary in January, is making
a two-day visit to discuss the two nations' cultural and
educational programs, economics, immigration and tourism, Prensa
Latina said.
	   Notimex reported Tuesday that Cuba and Mexico have agreed to
increase tourism in the Caribbean by increasing flights between
Havana and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
	   It said officials from the two countries also would discuss
their efforts to fight drug trafficking and would sign an agreement
to promote and protect commercial investments.

Private farming sprouts in Bulgaria after decades of collectivism

	   DOLNI DABNIK, Bulgaria (AP) _ A surgeon who raises pigs and
milks cows might be taken for an eccentric in many places, but not
here. He's one of Bulgaria's new breed of successful farmers.
	   ``Surgery is my hobby. Farming is my business,'' says Dr. Mihail
Krastev, whose changed priorities symbolize a modest farming
revival and a growing glimmer of hope for one of Europe's poorest
countries.
	   Sprawled across lush fields between the Balkan Mountains and the
Danube River, Krastev's prosperous 1,700-hectare (4,200-acre)
operation looks like the model farm that the communists talked
about but never achieved.
	   He proudly walks guests through neat alleys and freshly painted
sheds with 3,000 pigs, 100 cows, 1,000 sheep and a stable of
thoroughbred horses. There's a pond with 30 tons of fish. A small
fleet of modern equipment helps him harvest 12 tons of wheat per
acre _ a third higher than the national average.
	   The thick-set 56-year-old is among the promising sprouts of
private farming, which now accounts for 44 percent of Bulgaria's
land and 90 percent of its livestock. After working as an abdominal
surgeon all week in the capital, Sofia, every weekend he drives 160
kilometers (100 miles) northeast to tend to the farm in his native
Dolni Dabnik.
	   But Bulgaria _ like Krastev, whose doctor's earnings are just
180,000 leva (dlrs 100 a month) _ still has one foot in the past as
it seeks to regain lost agricultural glory.
	   Communist-style cooperatives still account for most farmland.
This large network of collective farming is in a shambles, victim
of inefficiency and neglect.
	   ``Communism weaned Bulgarians away from their land and the
desire to work it,'' Krastev says. ``It will take generations to
change this.''
	   With fertile land and centuries of agrarian tradition, Bulgaria
developed an extensive but poorly managed system of state-run farms
under communism. It was the Soviet bloc's main exporter of fruits,
vegetables, cheese, wine and tobacco.
	   But when communism and its accompanying subsidies ended in 1989,
agriculture crumbled.
	   A short-lived anti-communist government began turning land over
to the people in 1992. But the tiny plots were incompatible with
modern cultivation, and the selloff of collective farms profited
mainly government insiders.
	   With the anti-reform Socialists, the renamed communists, back in
power, more and more land fell idle and Bulgaria was forced to
import foods it once produced. A poor harvest and illegal exports
brought the farm crisis to a head in the winter of 1996-97, causing
bread shortages and a twentyfold increase in bread prices.
	   Only when street protests forced the Socialists to resign did
market reforms resume under the current government, which lifted
price controls to encourage farmers to grow more wheat.
	   As a measure of its progress, Bulgaria expects to export 150,000
tons of wheat this year, reversing last year's huge imports.
	   Like most of the farm entrepreneurs who have achieved success,
Krastev had a head start.
	   He and his younger brother, Ivan, had amassed capital from
breeding lambs in the 1970s and '80s _ a private business the
communist government allowed to encourage individuals to supply it
with meat for export.
	   When communism ended in 1989, Krastev rented land from 400 newly
private owners in Dolni Dabnik, paying them cash equivalent to
one-third the value of the crops.
	   Ivan quit his own doctor's job to run the business, and the two
bought buildings and equipment from a former state farm. They
estimate their farm's assets are now worth 5 billion leva (dlrs 3
million).
	   Evidence of the years of farm stagnation is visible everywhere.
	   A cooperative farm in the nearby village of Bukovlak provides a
typical picture. A wrecked tractor rusts in the farmyard, and goats
graze among weeds. A ruined livestock shed stands empty _ there's
no money to replace animals that were sold or slaughtered.
	   The cooperative can't afford to pay anything to its 230
smallholders. It can't even repay the 800,000 leva (dlrs 440) it
borrowed to buy seeds.
	   ``Our economic condition is grave,'' says Petar Tochev, who once
headed the communist collective farm and now helps run its much
smaller successor.
	   Ignoring the success of the Krastevs, Tochev, a staunch
Socialist Party supporter, brands economic reforms ``a conspiracy
to impoverish the peasants.''
	   The 72 workers on Krastev's farm aren't likely to listen. They
are paid nearly twice the nationwide average of 172,000 leva (dlrs
97) a month, plus all their food, rent and utility bills.

Two moderate quakes hit western Japan, but no damage or injuries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.0
shook western Japan early Wednesday, five hours after another
moderate tremor hit the same region. There were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries, police said.
	   Both were centered at an identical depth of about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) below ground in central Mie Prefecture, or state, 365
kilometers (226 miles), southwest of Tokyo, the Meteorological
Agency reported.
	   The quakes were also felt by residents in Kyoto and Nara,
Japan's ancient capitals.
	   The first quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.4, struck at
10:54 p.m. (1354 GMT) Tuesday and was followed by the second,
weaker one at 3:37 a.m. Wednesday (1837 GMT Tuesday), the agency
said.
	   Also, another earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.5,
hit near Hachijo island, 312 kilometers (193 miles), south of the
capital, at 1:12 a.m. Wednesday (1612 GMT Tuesday).
	   That tremor was centered about 80 kilometers (50 miles) under
the seabed. No damage or injuries were reported.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
it sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

Massive aid efforts in Cambodia fail to change old habits

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ When 18-year-old Sos Kun was taken
to a public hospital recently with a bullet in her spine, surgeons
and nurses in the emergency ward paid no attention.
	   They wanted dlrs 140 (560,000 riel) up front before doing
anything.
	   ``I held the hand of one of the nurses and begged for help,''
said Yan Kong, the girl's mother. ``I told them the money is on the
way, but please do something or she will die. But they did
nothing.''
	   Sos Kun's mother couldn't meet the demanded fee, which was about
half the annual average income in this desperately poor country.
But her daughter had a bit of luck _ she was wounded as a bystander
in a high-profile political murder and human-rights activists put
up the cash.
	   Tales of withheld medical care are commonplace in Cambodia,
where underpaid doctors often treat patients, especially the poor,
with contempt.
	   Cambodian physicians have long been known for openly disdaining
patients, particularly city doctors in their dealings with rural
peasants.
	   Such arrogance may have made doctors a special target during the
bloody 1975-79 rule of the Khmer Rouge peasant revolutionaries.
Only 30 of Cambodia's 600 doctors were alive by the time the
Vietnamese army drove the Khmer Rouge from power.
	   Aside from training new medical professionals _ with a focus on
quantity, not quality _ little was done to rebuild the health
sector during the decade-long Vietnamese occupation that followed.
	   A new chapter opened in 1993, when the United Nations organized
elections that opened Cambodia to the outside world for the first
time in two decades.
	   Some 400 humanitarian groups lined up to help rebuild Cambodian
society. About a quarter were involved in health, setting up
clinics and running some training programs, but they had little
success in getting the government to expand and improve the
delivery of health care.
	   Earning less than dlrs 20 (80,000 riel) a month in public
hospitals, doctors and nurses seek extra income in private
practice. Public hospitals are little more than waiting rooms for
their private activities.
	   They are willing to do almost anything to earn fees, even
prescribing unneeded, and sometimes unhealthy, treatments for
patients who have money.
	   Part of the problem is that efforts by international aid groups
have fallen short of ambitions to build a civil society in a
country hardened to suffering by genocide and war.
	   But the biggest obstacle to health sector improvements appears
to be a lack of political will. Only 6 percent of the 1998 national
budget goes to the Health Ministry, compared to 32 percent to the
Interior and Defense ministries, which are both involved in
security matters.
	   Arguing that Cambodia's civil war is almost over after big
government victories over the remnants of the Khmer Rouge, aid
groups say it is time to address society's other needs.
	   ``It is very easy to say health care reform, but it is difficult
to implement,'' said Mean Chhi Vun, deputy director of health.
	   In the health sector, like other areas of government, leaders
have refused to cut dead wood on overstaffed state payrolls to free
up money for higher salaries. Providing jobs is seen as a way to
keep social peace in a country with few economic opportunities.
	   Meanwhile, money earmarked for health services on the provincial
level goes through a circuitous path from the Finance Ministry to
the offices of provincial governors. Only half reaches health
facilities.
	   ``Virtually everybody in the Ministry of Health is very unhappy
with this,'' said Maurits van Pelt of the medical aid group Doctors
Without Borders.
	   But following the bloody coup that gave him sole power nearly a
year ago, Cambodia's leader, Hun Sen, needs to pay for the support
of provincial governors, who are often little more than warlords.
	   Foreign governmental assistance to Cambodia has leveled off
since 1993. Declines are likely to continue as long as the
government ignores the concerns of donors, such as the need to make
economic and fiscal reforms and to respect human rights.
	   In reaction, Hun Sen's government has clamored for increased
help from humanitarian groups.
	   MEDICAM, an umbrella organization for health aid groups, says
they won't do more as long as budget cuts hit the activities of
social welfare agencies more than the security ministries.

Shadowy investors, flashy tourists turn Czech spa into Little Russia

<TEXT>
	   KARLOVY VARY, Czech Republic (AP) _ Tucked along a river in a
Bohemian forest, this picturesque spa has for centuries been a
favorite haunt of Europe's elite, from kings to counts and
composers.
	   But today's visitors could be forgiven for thinking they've
stumbled on a ``New Russian'' theme park.
	   Pale Siberians stroll past stately colonnades and Victorian
buildings bearing signs in Cyrillic. Kiosks sell same-day Russian
newspapers and tins of Black Sea caviar. An accordionist serenades
passersby with ``Moscow Nights.'' Russian pop singers are flown in
for regular gigs.
	   Stripped of their Soviet bloc clout nearly a decade ago, the
Russians are back _ flush with cash.
	   Russian investors have snapped up most of Karlovy Vary's main
hotels and spas, spending tens of millions of dollars on the
choicest Czech real estate outside Prague, a two-hour drive east.
Thanks to their influence, the tiny airport this year established
its first two regular commercial flights _ both to Moscow, by two
separate airlines.
	   The idyllic resort scene and clip-clopping of horse-drawn
tourist carts beside the Tepla River mask an undercurrent of
tension. Russian money is good for business, but stirs unease among
local Czechs marked with the psychological scars of decades of
Soviet domination.
	   Exacerbating the nervousness is a fear that Russian crime
syndicates may be the mystery investors, through middlemen _ a
widely shared assumption that neither federal police nor town
authorities bother to deny. A Czech Interior Ministry spokesman,
Jiri Hajek, calls it ``a justified suspicion.''
	   The Russian elite actually have been regular visitors for
centuries, along with other monied Europeans.
	   They came for the hot spring water that contains 40 chemicals
believed to alleviate digestive system diseases and metabolic
disorders.
	   Czar Peter the Great took ``the treatment'' and kept up his
shooting skills in the surrounding woods; his canvas practice
targets are lovingly preserved in the local museum. Revered Russian
writers also left their mark _ plaques honor Tolstoy, Gogol and
Turgenev, and today's visitors can down vodka at the Hotel Pushkin.
Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin came. So did Kremlin insiders in the
Brezhnev era.
	   Now it's the post-Soviet business elite and other ``New
Russians.''
	   Russians are easily the most numerous nationality in Karlovy
Vary _ a third of 60,000 visitors last year and likely much more in
1998 _ even though Germany is just 15 miles (25 kilometers) away.
	   ``It's the tradition, it's the beauty, but the main thing is the
water,'' insists Andrei Janson, a Muscovite who with his wife
discovered Karlovy Vary four years ago. ``We drink the hot water
three times a day.''
	   The Russians still feel more at home here than in other
countries, with no visa required, plenty of Russian speakers and
low prices on everything from steak to shoes.
	   ``Russians buy everything,'' says Irena Krajska, who works at a
boutique. ``It only has to have the Gianni Versace label _ this is
very important for them.''
	   Mayor Josef Pavel, who has seen Karlovy Vary rescued from the
brink of dilapidation thanks to Russian and Western money, pauses
when asked about the possible role of Russian gangsters in local
real estate.
	   ``Maybe the top crime people from Russia come here, I don't
know,'' he says. ``We have no problem in the city with Russian
mafia.''
	   Police say many of the 100 companies registered here under
Russian names appear to be gang fronts used to ``legalize'' untaxed
income. The good news: The gangs consider Karlovy Vary a ``peace
zone,'' says the national police spokesman, Hajek.
	   Quiet zone or not, the Russians are too much of a good thing for
some.
	   Trying to limit Russian guests for fear of alienating ``old
money'' clientele, the city's only five-star hotel, the Grand Hotel
Pupp, doesn't advertise in Russia.
	   ``These Russian investments are good for Karlovy Vary. Without a
lot of this Russian money in the last two years, a lot of buildings
would have collapsed,'' says Roman Vacho, the hotel's managing
director.
	   But, he adds, ``there is nothing worse than when our guests come
down to breakfast in suits and ties and have to meet the Russians
in their sports outfits.''
	   Other Czechs complain the Russians dodge taxes and drive rents
higher by paying exorbitant amounts. Or simply that they're Russian
_ a bias Russians encounter due to Soviet sins or gangster
stereotypes.
	   ``For the time being, they're good for the economy,'' says Ivan
Babej, a photographer. ``But 10 or 20 years from now, who knows
what Karlovy Vary will become?''

World Cup: Norway shocks Brazil to advance to second round 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ With its future in the World Cup down
to seven minutes, Norway scored twice, including a controversial
penalty kick, to stun Brazil 2-1 and move into the second round.
	   Kjetil Rekdal converted the 89th-minute penalty kick only six
minutes after Tore Andre Flo got the tying goal. With the win,
Norway handed the four-time Cup winners their first defeat.
	   American referee Esse Baharmast awarded the penalty kick,
although replays showed little contact on the play.
	   ``It was one of the best, definitely,'' Flo said Tuesday. ``We
made history in Norway today.''
	   Trailing 1-0 and looking like it was headed out after the first
round, Flo gave Norway hope with a remarkable individual effort in
the 83rd minute. Flo ran onto a long pass, one-touched it to the
middle of the penalty area and beat goalkeeper Taffarel with a
strike from 12 yards.
	   Then came the penalty, called on Junior Baiano for knocking down
Flo as the two battled for position on a high ball. Replays
indicated little contact on the play.
	   With Morocco beating Scotland 3-0 in Saint-Etienne and sure to
advance from Group A with a Brazil victory or draw, Rekdal firmly
struck his penalty kick into the lower left side of the net. Norway
reached the second round of the World Cup for the first time in
three tries.
	   ``We came in overconfident against a rival we didn't know how
would play against us,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said. ``But
we developed our soccer and will continue to do so.''
	   The Norwegian reserves sprinted onto the field to hug and
congratulate their teammates when they clinched a spot vs. Italy on
Saturday in Marseille.
	   The fans in Viking helmets and red-and-blue Norwegian flags
refused to let their heroes leave the field at Stade Velodrome, and
the team trotted around the field to salute their ecstatic
supporters.
	   ``It's incredible. I'm amazed at what happened,'' Norwegian
coach Egil Olsen said.
	   ``It was one of the best (victories), definitely,'' Flo said.
``We made history in Norway today.''
	   Brazil controlled possession throughout and finally looked like
the winner when Bebeto converted Denilson's cross with a header in
the 78th minute.
	   Denilson fell, but still managed to keep possession, spin away
from Norwegian defender Berg Henning and strike a left-footed cross
chest high across the penalty area. Streaking through, Bebeto put
his head onto the ball and directed it into the middle of the net.
	   ``We were better, we created the chances, we deserved to win,''
Bebeto said. ``But there are evils that come for the good. This
will make us stronger. We lost when we could lose. We can't in the
next round.''
	   Brazil already had qualified for the second round, assured of
winning Group A and a round of 16 meeting with Chile on Saturday in
Paris.
	   But Brazil wanted this one. Stung by a 4-2 loss to Norway in a
friendly game last year and Olsen's bragging ever since, the
Brazilians wanted revenge.
	   The Brazilians could have fielded their ``B'' team, tested their
second-stringers and not risked an injury to Ronaldo or its other
stars. Instead, they tested a new, attack-heavy formation with
quicksilver midfielder Denilson in place of Cesar Sampaio,
suspended for one game after drawing his second yellow card against
Morocco.
	   They might have sensed it wasn't their night when the band got
their national anthem wrong.
	   ``We lost a game that was won,'' Zagallo said. ``This will serve
as a great lesson to us not to lose our concentration. It was a
defeat on the road to the `penta','' as Brazilians call the
hoped-for fifth Cup title.
	   The Brazilians blamed themselves for the loss.
	   ``We didn't let Norway do anything,'' said Rivaldo. ``But
unfortunately after the goal, we lost our cool and went on the
attack like runaway horses, which made things easier for the
Norwegians.''

Japan warns it will block Chinese nationalists from disputed islands 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's coast guard warned Wednesday it will block
a small flotilla of boats carrying Chinese nationalists from
landing on a chain of islands at the center of a territorial
dispute.
	   The coast guard has dispatched about 30 cutters and other ships
to intercept the six vessels, which carry protesters from Hong Kong
and Taiwan, said Yusuke Ono, a spokesman for Japan's Maritime
Safety Agency.
	   The protest vessels were spotted Wednesday morning about 44
kilometers (28 miles) southwest of the disputed archipelago, known
as the Senkaku in Japan, but the Diaoyu by Chinese speakers.
	   The uninhabited, rocky islets lie midway between Taiwan and
Japan's southern island of Okinawa. They are administered by Japan
but also claimed by China and Taiwan.
	   Ono said the Japanese coast guard has issued warnings to the
boats to turn back. If the protesters continue, he said Japanese
ships will try to block or encircle them before they reach the
islands.
	   Five of the vessels were Taiwanese and likely left the northern
Taiwanese port of Keelung on Tuesday night, Ono said. He didn't
know how many people were on board the boats.
	   Ethnic Chinese nationalists from Hong Kong and Taiwan have tried
repeatedly in the past to land on the islands to protest Japanese
control.
	   In a heated confrontation in May of last year, Japanese coast
guard ships blocked, nudged and collided with a fleet of 28 boats
carrying Hong Kong and Taiwan protesters who wanted to land on the
islands and tear down a lighthouse and markers put up by Japanese
nationalists.
	   The confrontation followed a visit to the islands by a Japanese
right-wing lawmaker that incited a surge of nationalism in Hong
Kong and Taiwan, where many still carry bitter anti-Japanese
memories.
	   Japan occupied Hong Kong during World War II and colonized
Taiwan for 50 years until 1945.
	   In 1996, a Hong Kong activist drowned after jumping into waters
near the islands from one of several protest boats that had come
from Taiwan and Hong Kong.
	   The last attempt to reach the islands by Chinese nationalists
was in September 1997, when rough seas forced a vessel from Hong
Kong carrying eight protesters to turn back.

Philippine plane aborts takeoff after tires burst 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine plane carrying more than
100 passengers and crew aborted take-off at Manila's domestic
airport Wednesday after three of its tires burst, officials said.
	   No one aboard the Cebu Pacific DC-9 jet bound for the central
Philippine city of Bacolod, were injured, the officials said.
	   Three of the plane's four main tires burst as it rolled down the
runway but the pilot was able to safely abort the takeoff, they
said, adding that the passengers were brought back to the airport
terminal.
	   Cebu Pacific's fleet was grounded after one of its eight DC-9
jets crashed into a mountain as it prepared to land at southern
Cagayan de Oro city airport on Feb. 2, killing all 99 passengers
and five crew members. That crash was the Philippines worst air
disaster.
	   The airline, one of several domestic carriers that opened after
the government deregulated the airline industry, resumed operations
in April.

Government reportedly agrees to set up bank to clean up bad debt crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has decided
to set up a ``bridge bank'' to absorb the assets of failed
financial instutions, a leading business daily reported Wednesday.
	   Party officials have formally agreed to go forward with the plan
and to propose it in Parliament shortly after elections for the
legislature's upper house in July, the Nihon Keizai newspaper
reported.
	   Senior government officials have already begun discussions of
how to set up the bank, which would dispose of soured loans, sell
off collateral and extend loans to the corporate customers of
failed banks.
	   Government officials declined to confirm details of the meeting,
but an LDP spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
a full proposal on the ``bridge bank'' was likely to be announced
in late July.
	   The bank may also have the authority to supervise the operations
of troubled financial institutions, former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said, according to Kyodo News.
	   The Nihon Keizai also reported that the Japan Development Bank
may take over some of the operations of corporate lending giant
Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been rumored to be on the verge of
collapse.
	   On Tuesday, the government sought to allay fears of further
financial instability by pledging support for LTCB and expressing
confidence that it will stay afloat.
	   That led to a rebound in LTCB shares, which had sunk 45 percent
Monday as rumors circulated that the bank might become the next
victim of Japan's decade-long banking crisis.
	   Shares of LTCB, which holds 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion)
in problem loans, first plummeted last week when Moody's Investors
Services lowered the bank's credit rating.
	   LTCB's share price dipped slightly in morning trading Wednesday
to 69 yen, down 2 yen from Tuesday's close.
	   The fate of LTCB is being closedly watched because investors
fear greater determination by the government to clean up the
bad-loan mess may mean it will let more weak banks fail. (js-et)

Dollar climbs in Tokyo, Japanese stocks bounce back moderately 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed against the yen Wednesday
morning after a British rating agency said it may downgrade Japan's
country credit rating. Tokyo stocks bounced back moderately.
	   The dollar bought 139.78 yen in late morning, up 2.03 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 139.15
overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 149.55 points, or 0.99 percent, to 15,204.15. On Tuesday,
the average fell 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent.
	   The rating agency Fitch IBCA warned Tuesday that Japan's credit
rating could be downgraded, increasing concerns about the nation's
economy after its government failed to deliver a bold recovery plan
to global finance leaders last weekend.
	   The warning follows last week's downgrade of the Long-Term Bank
of Japan Ltd. by Moody's Investors Services, which sent shares of
the once mighty industrial lender tumbling to half their value in
just two trading sessions.
	   LTCB shares recovered slightly Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen,
after government officials promised support for the troubled bank.
At late morning Wednesday, LTCB shares had moved slightly lower,
losing 2 yen to 69 yen.
	   The dollar also gained momentum against the yen as the effects
of last week's dramatic intervention by U.S. and Japanese central
banks faded.
	   And traders said that unless Japanese leaders take action to fix
their country's financial ills, the dollar would likely keep
rising.
	   ``You are going to see dollar-yen strengthen, unless they say
something or do something,'' said Ralph DelZenero, vice president
of foreign exchange at First Chicago.
	   Meanwhile, gains in some major bank issues helped move the Tokyo
Stock Exchange's main index into positive territory. Among early
gainers were Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank.
	   But many investors were waiting for more details of the
government's promised ``total plan'' to revive the economy and
accelerate reform of the banking industry, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 7.85 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,183.27
points. The TOPIX closed down 11.89 points, or 1.00 percent, the
previous day.
	   Key to any reform package would be steps to help banks write off
some 76 trillion yen (about dlrs 500 billion) in bad loans left on
their books from the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with a plan by July 8 for a ``bridge bank'' to handle
bad loans.
	   Traders said they hope the bank looks something like the special
company established by the U.S. government to help clean up the
savings and loan debacle in the 1980s.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.225 percent from Tuesday's 1.260 percent, driving
its price up to 111.78 yen from 111.53 yen.

South Korean navy tries to salvage North Korean submarine 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ With warships circling, South Korean
navy frogmen began attaching air bags to a sunken North Korean
submarine Wednesday, hoping to raise the captured craft and look
inside for signs of life and clues to its mission.
	   The small submarine broke loose from a towline and sank in 33
meters (110 feet) of water a mile off shore Tuesday while being
towed to this major east coast naval base by a South Korean
frigate.
	   Fearing the submarine's capture might derail his fragile efforts
to entice the North to open up its society, President Kim Dae-jung
ordered his hawkish Defense Ministry to refrain from any
retaliatory rhetoric, his aides said.
	   ``Our men are putting cables round the submarine. We hope that
we can bring it back to the surface by this evening,'' said navy
Capt. Park In-yong. ``Then we will use cranes to haul it onto the
pier and take a close look.''
	   Park declined comment on the possible fate of the submarine's
crew. But he had earlier said that the North Koreans, if still
inside the craft, were probably dead.
	   Other Defense Ministry officials speculated that the crew
managed to escape before their vessel was seized Monday while
entangled in a mackerel fishing net just a half mile south of the
North Korean border.
	   North Korea said Tuesday one of its submarines was missing on a
training mission after experiencing mechanical problems.
	   Authorities described the craft seized Monday as a ``midget
submersible,'' which can carry up to six crewmen and is used
primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct coastal surveillance.
	   When the submarine was first spotted by South Korean fishermen,
three crewmen were struggling desperately to free it from the net.
	   Navy divers got no response when they pounded on the sub's hull
with a hammer. They also used sonar scans but detected no signs of
life inside.
	   The discovery of the sub on the coast 200 kilometers (125 miles)
northeast of Seoul renewed concerns that North Korea was trying to
infiltrate spies despite the South's efforts to help the
famine-stricken North with humanitarian aid.
	   The submarine was found just miles away from where another,
larger North Korean sub ran aground off the east coast two years
ago. The 1996 incursion triggered a 53-day manhunt that left 24
North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead and relations
between the two Koreas at their worst in years.
	   The South cut off aid and jacked up diplomatic pressure until
the North apologized.
	   This time, presidential aides have said the incident will not
derail their new policy of engagement towards the North.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Network says it will not censor in-flight newscasts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Nine television network has
refused to censor stories about Pauline Hanson and her right-wing
One Nation political party for Qantas Airways' in-flight news
broadcasts, the network's news director said Wednesday.
	   Paul Fenn said the network had received a request from Qantas to
censor stories about Hanson because their racist content might
offend some passengers.
	   ``I wrote back to Qantas to say this would place us in an
awkward situation because we would have to eliminate references to
(Prime Minister) John Howard, (opposition leader) Kim Beazley and
the election campaign,'' Fenn said.
	   He said the in-flight news bulletins contained no offensive
material and therefore met Qantas' guidelines.
	   Qantas Airways spokesman Bernard Shirley said the request was
submitted after a member of Qantas' staff returning from Indonesia
complained about in-flight news items he found unacceptable.
	   Fenn said Nine was careful to avoid offensive material when
packaging the Qantas bulletins.
	   Hanson has been criticized as racist for claiming Australia is
in danger of being ``swamped by Asians'' and opposing immigration.
She also opposes special welfare benefits for aborigines and
advocates protectionist economics.
	   One Nation won 11 seats in the Queensland state election held
June 13.

Thousands of poor Thais protest against government

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thousands of Thai farmers descended
Wednesday on Parliament to demand relief from poverty made worse by
Asia's economic crisis.
	   But tens of thousands more stayed home after a deal was reached
to suspend their debt payments.
	   The last-minute compromise reached by Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's government with one of the largest farm groups robbed
what would have been the biggest protest against his
eight-month-old government of its punch.
	   The deal with the Thai Farmers Association, still pending
approval by debt authorities, involves 31,496 households and some
1.4 billion baht (dlrs 33 million) borrowed from state agricultural
banks. Association leaders said they had achieved their goals and
withdrew from the protest. About 10 smaller groups went ahead.
	   Chuan told reporters that the deal would not translate into a
debt moratorium for businesses who borrowed from local and foreign
banks during Thailand's collapsed economic boom and are now unable
to pay back their loans.
	   ``The private sector can deal with its own loans themselves,''
Chuan said. ``Thailand cannot order private lenders not to take
back what they're owed from private debtors. Doing that will only
damage the country.''
	   About 4,000 people had gathered by mid-morning outside
Parliament. Organizers said more than 10,000 were eventually
expected _ well down from the 50,000 initially projected.
	   They arrived by buses, trucks, pickups and cars and indicated
they could stay awhile, carrying sleeping mats, rice sacks, cooking
oil and charcoal. Protests by groups of the poor in recent years
have lasted for months.
	   About 500 riot police were on hand. There was no immediate
violence, but Bangkok's notorious traffic was made even worse by
the milling protesters.
	   Chuan has won a reputation for fiscal rectitude since taking
office in November, adhering closely to conditions laid down by the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout of the recession-bound Thai economy.
	   But critics say high-interest rates aimed at stabilizing the
currency are killing businesses and delaying recovery. Farmers who
have been suffering years of drought and other woes are especially
hard hit.
	   Since May, Chuan has been under attack from opposition
politicians who accuse him of helping the financial sector _ the
rich _ at the expense of the poor. Many of Wednesday's protesters
came from opposition strongholds.
	   Bamrung Kayotha, leader of the Assembly of the Poor, one of the
protesting groups, said that the government did not deserve to be
called democratic.
	   ``It's their intention to buy off our movement,'' Bamrung said.
	   Leaders submitted a proposal for a farm relief law with at least
50,000 signatures to Parliament officials. Among the demands is a
five-year suspension of debt payments for farmers.

CHICAGO: Fernandez scored. Devil Rays 6, Marlins 4 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   At St. Petersburg, Florida, Paul Sorrento homered and doubled to
drive in four runs as Tampa Bay beat Florida for their first
interleague victory over their in-state rivals.
	   Albie Lopez (3-2) pitched 2 2-3 innings in relief of
knuckleballer Dennis Springer to get the win before an announced
crowd of 27,523 _ about 3,100 less than the Devil Rays average
against AL opponents.
	   Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth for his 16th save.
	   Sorrento had a two-run double off Marlins starter Ryan Dempster
(0-3) to break a 1-1 tie in the fourth inning.
 &UR; Phillies 3, Red Sox 2
	   At Boston, Scott Rolen homered and Mark Portugal pitched his
first complete game in two years as Philadelphia beat Boston for
its second consecutive comeback win over the Red Sox.
	   Portugal (3-2) won for the first time in seven starts since May
14, allowing two runs and seven hits and striking out seven. He
walked none as the Phillies earned their 25th come-from-behind
victory of the season.
	   On the first anniversary of his last victory, Derek Lowe (0-6)
allowed three runs on seven hits, two walks and a hit batter in six
innings, striking out four.
 &UR; White Sox 5, Pirates 4
	   At Pittsburgh, Frank Thomas drove in two runs and the White Sox
jumped out to a big first inning for the second night in a row.
	   The White Sox scored three runs in the first off Jason Schmidt
(8-4). Chicago threatened for the second night in a row to squander
a big lead _ this time, it was 5-1 in the third _ but Mike Sirotka
(8-7) settled down after a three-run fourth to retire the next 13
batters. He struck out six and walked two in eight plus innings.
Matt Karchner came on in the ninth for his 10th save.
 &UR; Tigers 8, Cardinals 1
	   In St. Louis, Justin Thompson allowed three hits in seven
shutout innings and rookie Gabe Alvarez hit his first two homers as
Detroit ended St. Louis' five-game winning streak.
	   Alvarez, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Toledo on
Monday, homered in the second off Kent Bottenfield (2-4) and hit a
three-run shot in the seventh off Bottenfield for a 5-0 lead.
	   Thompson (6-7) allowed only three singles and and helped extend
Mark McGwire's homerless stretch to five games and 20 at-bats.
McGwire went 1-for-3 with a single.
	   Bottenfield gave up five hits and five runs in seven innings.
