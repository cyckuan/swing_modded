<HEADLINE> New Coach Brings Victory to Quanxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed coach Chi
Shangbin Sunday had the Chinese international Libing and his
injury time header to thank as Sichuan Quanxing edged Qingdao
Hainiu 1-0 at the 20th round of Chinese first division soccer
league.
</P>
<P>
Chi, ex-coach of national champions Dalian Wanda who took over
the struggling Quanxing only on three days ago, breathed a sigh
of relieve when center forward Li back-headed the goal into the
net in the dying minutes to set the winning tone for his new co
aching career.
</P>
<P>
Quanxing is now moving one step further to stand at fifth on
the table with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Hong Jilong has been keeping up its impressive
performances since the arrival of former national coach Qi
Wusheng a month ago and scored a convincing 3-1 win over
Vanguards Huandao to extend their winning streak to four games.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Guo'an continued their recent dismal form which sent
them crashing out of the FA Cup quarter-finals last week by
playing out a goalless draw with unfancied Shenyang Haishi.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Dalian Wanda again proved a class of their
own as two goals from Swede stars Stefan Lindgvist and Hans
Eklund powered them to a 2-1 away win over Guangzhou Apollo.
</P>
<P>
The result left them atop in the standings with an awesome 48
points from a 15-3-2 record, 11 points higher than second-placed
Shanhai Shenhua, who crushed Guangzhou Songri 3-0 on the home
soil.

<P>
Elsewhere, the Chinese Army nipped Shandong Taishan 1-0 at
home while Shenzhen Ping'an forced an away goaless draw with

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Party Launches New Logo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's biggest
opposition party, the National Party (NP), launched new colors
and a new policy package Sunday for next year's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The new logo, unveiled after being approved by the NP's
national caucus Saturday, consists of a golden sun on a green and
blue background, representing the "new life force and dynamism"
of the party.
</P>
<P>
It replaces the yellow and red sun logo adopted by the party
in the run-up to the 1994 elections in an effort to change its
image.
</P>
<P>
The caucus Saturday also agreed to relaunch the party with a
four-point election plan.
</P>
<P>
The NP's move came two days after the release of an opinion
poll conducted in July, which showed the support for NP had
dropped to an all-time low of nine percent and its position as
the number one opposition party was under threat.
</P>
<P>
Launching the new logo Sunday, NP leader Marthinus van
Schalkwyk said the move was part of a process of "dramatic
modernization" in the party.
</P>
<P>
He said the new policy document, which will be debated and
fleshed out at the party's provincial congresses later,
emphasizes the concepts of inclusive government and "localism".
</P>
<P>
But he dismissed the idea that the NP was considering
returning to the government of national unity. He said what the
party wanted was a system of multi-party government, in which
major parties could serve on the executive and not be muzzled.
</P>
<P>
Localism involved a radical devolution of power and funds to
local government level, van Schalkwyk said. Local communities,
rather than national government, should make decisions on
schools, policing, welfare and health centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The party also called for restructuring the National Council
of Provinces, upper house of the South African parliament, to
include not only provincial and local interests, but cultural
groups, traditional leaders and business and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The policy document, which used the phrase "new National
Party" prominently, introduced a slogan: "Let's get South Africa
working."

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Opts to Lead Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- In a significant policy
change, India's biggest opposition party decided on Sunday to keep
its option open to lead a coalition government instead of forming
an alternative administration on its own.
</P>
<P>
However, coalitions would be considered only when absolutely
necessary, the Congress party said in an 11-page declaration
adopted at the end of a three-day brainstorming session in
Panchmarhi, a hill resort in central Madhya Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
In view of opposition from its own ranks, the Congress party
said, arrangement should be made on the basis of agreed programs
which did not compromise its basic ideology, the Press Trust of
India reported.
</P>
<P>
The party considered the present difficulty in forming a
one-party government a transient phase in the evolution of its
policy, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The declaration laid to rest speculation that Congress will not
go for coalition with other parties.
</P>
<P>
It noted with serious concern the weakening of the party in
some states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu, and
decided to accord highest priority to its revival and renewal in
these states.
</P>
<P>
"In the interim, coalitions may well be needed," Congress
President Sonia Gandhi said in her concluding address. But she
also reiterated that she would not shirk from putting together an
alternative government to succeed the government led by the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if it collapses.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the politics of coalition at the national
level was a "passing phase." "We will come back again with full
force and on our own steam."
</P>
<P>
Congress also adopted an eight-point program which includes a
campaign from next Thursday to collect 10 million signatures to
press for the implementation of recommendations by the Srikrishna
Commission which probed the "communal" riots in Mumbai in 1993.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sonia Gandhi told the opening of the conclave that
Congress was ready to form an alternative government in the event
of the fall of the government. "If and when the need arises, our
party will fulfill its constitutional obligation without
hesitation and provide stability and progress."
</P>
<P>
She mounted a scathing attack on the government for its
"all-round failure," saying the economy was stagnant, inflation
was on the rise, investment was at an all-time low and foreign
policy was in tatters as the ruling coalition partners remained
embroiled in squabbles.
</P>
<P>
The Congress meeting took place against the backdrop of
repeated offers of support to Congress by several non-BJP parties
including Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha and the Communist Party of
India (Marxism) in taking the initiative to pull down the
government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and form an alternative
administration on the basis of a common minimum program.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi said the constituents of the coalition were
engaged in an internecine war, bringing to the fore contradictions
among them day after day, as they spoke in different voices on
national and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Congress leader also attacked what she termed as "confused
and unclear" foreign policy of the Vajpayee government towards
China and Pakistan, adding that it also made no effort to mend
ties with India's traditional allies who opposed its nuclear tests
in May.
</P>
<P>
"Peace with our neighbors is an essential prerequisite. But in
a matter of a few weeks, the present coalition government
destroyed what the Congress had painstakingly achieved over a
10-year period to normalize our relations with China," said Sonia
Gandhi.

second Tokyo International Conference on African development
(TICAD II) will be held in Addis Ababa from September 7 to 8,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing held here, Mulatu Teshome,
Vice-Minister of Economic Development and Cooperation, said the

launched in November, 1997, with Senegal, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia
selected to host TICAD II preparatory committee meetings.

<HEADLINE> Stroyev: Consolidation Option to Emerge at Roundtable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federation Council
Speaker Yegor Stroyev said here Sunday that a political roundtable
meeting "will result in a consolidating option that will help us
unite the nation."
</P>
<P>
"There can be peace only under one condition: if people meet
each other halfway without demonstrating ambitions," Stroyev told
reporters after meeting Miguel Martinez of the Inter-Parliamentary
Council.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable meeting, to be attended by President Boris
Yeltsin and deputies of both houses of parliament, was scheduled
for Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Martinez, the speaker of the upper house of
parliament reiterated his objection to Western loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I personally am opposed to any Russian borrowings abroad,"
Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
"They hamper us, cause contradictions between the oligarchs and
lead to everyone trying to get a bigger slice of the loan while
the people don't get anything anyway," the Interfax news agency
quoted Stroyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A country controlling 25 to 40 percent of the world's natural
resources has no right to go on begging around the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we finally give priority to domestic production, working
people, our national economy, even if it is a private economy with
banks, commercial and state, operating in the framework of
democracy and accord, I think we will get out of the
difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia now owes 130 billion U.S. dollars in foreign debt and
more than 70 billion dollars in internal debt.
</P>
<P>
"The nation should reach agreement and after that start working
and creating material values," Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
After the Monday roundtable meeting, the State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, will take a second vote on Chernomyrdin's
premiership.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin' candidacy
last Monday.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers Clear Ban on Yugoslav Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union foreign
ministers Sunday cleared the way for an agreed ban on Yugoslav
flights to come into force.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, meeting in Salzburg of Austria, removed
Greek objections to the ban on flights by Yugoslav carriers to and
from EU member states which agreed in principle in June to ban
Yugoslav flights, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The paperwork for the flight ban is expected to be completed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers also raised the possibility of
tightening the existing sanctions against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ends the
fighting by security forces in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that both Milosevic and ethnic Albanian
militants have to end hostilities in Kosovo for any effort to work
to bring peace back to the region.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union saw the ban on Yugoslav flights as a
punishment for Belgrade over its policy on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The union earlier suspended all new investment in Serbia to
force Belgrade to end its forceful action in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Prices Relatively Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Monday that the average price
of its basket of seven crudes stood at 11.99 U.S. dollars a barrel
last week, slightly less then the 12.04 dollars quoted a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The average crude oil price last month was 11.89 dollars per

still far less than last year's annual average of 18.68 dollars
and the benchmark price of 21 dollars per barrel set by OPEC.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC group is composed of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Find More Ways to Make a Good Living </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Eighty percent of the
young farmers in a remote village at Dingzhou, a city in north
China's Hebei Province, have left their hometown to take new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 of the 1,000 villages are working on contracted
building projects in foreign countries such as Singapore, Japan
and the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
This is just one case of villagers leaving home to open their
own businesses. At present 60 million farmers, 13 percent of China's
rural laborers, are working in urban areas in various sectors of
industry, commerce and catering, said an official from China's
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
When many villagers leave their hometown to find opportunities,
those who still stay in the rural areas develop farming, the
service trade and rural industries.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers in the Dingxi Prefecture in northwest China's
Gansu Province, once "the most seriously poverty-stricken area" in
China, took advantage of their mules to run tourist services. A
large number of tourists are attracted to the prefecture by its
numerous canyons, and they can earn 1,000 yuan from each mule
every year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also choose to work at rural businesses. By the end of
1997, the rural industry had absorbed 1.42 million rural laborers,
accounting for more than half of the surplus laborers in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Xie Baisan, a professor from Fudan University, said that
farmers in China have changed their ideas about how to get
affluent by freeing themselves from farmland and pursuing a
variety of professions.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges More Aid to Developing Nations  (Embargoed for Tuesday) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday attached great importance to the development in
the world at large and called for more external aid to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the appeal in his annual report to the 52nd session
of the General Assembly, which is scheduled to conclude on Tuesday
after adopting the report.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of development remains paramount in a world
where one fifth of humanity is forced to fend for itself on a
meager dollar a day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing short life expectancy and poor illiteracy in some
developing countries, Annan said, "one third of all Africans are
not expected to survive past the age of 40, nearly 40 percent of
women in developing countries are illiterate."
</P>
<P>
"More than half of South Asia's children remain underweight at
age five, while on-going Asian economic crisis may thrust some 50
million people in Indonesia alone back into poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the volume of external aid to developing
countries "has declined steadily throughout this decade, and now
stands at 0.22 percent of the GDP of the industrialized countries
-- only 0.19 percent for the group of seven major industrialized
countries, which includes the richest among them," said the U.N.
chief.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, donor countries are increasingly earmarking aid, with
no guarantee that their aid-giving preferences match the need of
the recipients, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign direct investment has not compensated for this decline
in aid; in 1997 all of sub-Saharan Africa received a mere 3
billion U.S. dollars, and South Asia 4 billion U.S. dollars," he
said, adding that "many developing countries, including some of
the poorest, remain subject to the crushing burdens of external
debt."
</P>
<P>
Since he assumed office last year, Annan, the first U.N.
secretary-general from the sub-Saharan Africa, has hammered out a
reform program which includes underlining the importance of
development on the U.N. agenda.
</P>
<P>
"My program of reform begun over the course of the past year
builds on this institutional capacity, has already yielded
practical results in the developing area," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 52nd session of the General Assembly will be followed by
the 53rd session which kicks off on Wednesday, one week earlier
than the past regular sessions, which usually begins on the third
Tuesday in September every year.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Govt Stands Firm on Introducing LPG Taxis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government's position on LPG
(liquefied petroleum gas) taxis has not changed, the Planning,
Environment and Lands Bureau said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a report by local Chinese-language press Monday
that the LPG taxi scheme may be aborted, a spokesman of the Bureau
 reiterated that the government remains firmly committed to
improving air quality and wishes to introduce LPG taxis as an
essential and effective measure to abate vehicular air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Only a substantial reduction of diesel vehicles by replacing
them with a clean alternative fuel will bring sufficient
improvements to our air quality to safeguard public health," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that LPG vehicle technology has proven to be a clean
alternative and is readily available, subject to the provision of
supporting infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government had received very useful feedback from an
ongoing one-year LPG taxi trial launched last November and was
using it to develop a clean air motor fuel strategy, he said. The
trial aims at ascertaining the reliability of LPG vehicles under
local intensive driving environment and providing necessary cost
information on fuel consumption and repair and maintenance
requirements.
</P>
<P>
"The government intends to consult the relevant trades and the
public soon on the implementation strategy. Given the health
benefits of using LPG, we are confident that this initiative will
find favor with the trades and the community," he added.

<P>
BERLIN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Berti Vogts has resigned as
German national coach, the German Football Federation (DFB)
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vogts made the decision to go following a telephone
conversation with German federation (DFB) president Egidius Braun.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old has been under fire since Germany's 3-0
quarter-final loss to Croatia in the World Cup this summer. The
criticism sharpened after his side's performances in last week's
friendlies, which saw a 2-1 win over Malta and a 1-1 draw with
Romania.
</P>
<P>
A DFB statement said a successor would be found as soon as
possible with Germany's opening Euro 2000 match against Turkey
just a month away.
</P>
<P>
Vogts replaced Franz Beckenbauer as national chief after
Germany's 1990 World Cup triumph.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Some main assailants on two
cabinet members have been identified and arrested by the security
forces, Iran's Interior Ministry announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the public relations office of the
Interior Ministry said that some others suspected of being
involved in the assaults are now being interrogated, the official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention how many people were
arrested and interrogated so far.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani and Vice President for Development and Social
Affairs Abdollah Nouri were beaten up by some assailants on Friday
while participating in the funeral procession for 700 soldiers
killed in the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret over the violence and lauded
the people for cooperation in identifying the culprits.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, President Mohammad Khatami and the supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered to identify and arrest those
involving in the assaults.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani and Nouri, two main advocates of the open-minded
policies of Khatami's government, have been under harsh criticism
of the hard-line and conservative factions during the past months.

<P>
Nouri was ousted as interior minister by the conservative
Majlis (parliament) in June. Some conservatives also warned to

<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt produced 2.6 percent less
crude oil in 1997/98 fiscal year than the year before, an annual
report by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation released on
Monday said.
</P>
<P>
Crude production for 1997/98 fiscal year (ending June 30)

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists: No Obvious Rise or Drop in Global Sea Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists claim that
global sea level will not experience an obvious rise or drop in
the next century, causing no threat to human civilization.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zichu, a famous Chinese glaciology expert attending the
ongoing Sixth International Symposium on Antarctic Glaciology in
this capital of northwest China's Gansu Province, said that the
scientific discovery challenged a popular point in world
scientific circles that warming of the world climate will result
in a rise in the global sea level.
</P>
<P>
Xie, also an academician of the International European-Asian
Academy of Sciences, said the warming will also cause a decline in
the sea level of almost the same amount, virtually canceling out
the effect of the rise.
</P>
<P>
"The change of sea level will be minor and not obvious," the
expert said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many scientists worldwide agree that the
temperature on the Earth's surface is rising owing to the
influence of atmospheric warming, which also leads to increased
melting of glaciers.
</P>
<P>
The melted water will obviously increase the sea level,
according to some foreign scientists, who predicted more than
three million cubic kilometers of glacial water will be added to
the oceans, raising the level by 5-to-6 meters in the next 100
years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists warned of a great influence on social development
and economic construction in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
But global warming also will cause a drop in the sea level,
according to Xie and Han Jiankang, another Chinese scientist in
the field.
</P>
<P>
Based on their long-term research and reliable statistics on
the subject, Xie and Han submitted evidence that climate warming
will increase evaporation from the oceans.
</P>
<P>
The water will turn into more rainfall in the areas of the
North Pole and South Pole, enlarging and thickening the ice
sheets, they said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the thickening of the glaciers in the
South Pole area over the past 40 years is much more than the
amount of melting and breaking apart of the ice sheets in the same
period, they said.
</P>
<P>
The margin between melting and thickening will result in a
dropping of the sea level, Xie said, "However, this will not add
more land to coastal countries because a Sino-Russia math system
on global water change indicates that the procedure will be very
slow."
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 trillion tons of glaciers would form in South
Pole area if global temperatures rise about five degrees Celsius,
Xie said. "This would cause a dropping of the sea level, but occur
about 30,000 years later," he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the sea level dropped by 30-to-50 centimeters over
the previous 100 years, counteracting the rise caused by the
melting of glaciers, he added.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Wu Yi met here
today with Hong Kong businessmen attending the 2nd China Fair for
International Investment Trade.
</P>
<P>
"Although Hong Kong investment in the inland areas has
decreased in the first half of this year because of the Asian
financial crisis, it still remains at a relatively high level," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, from January to July the inland areas
have used Hong Kong investment for more than 4,700 projects, with
the contractual funds reaching 8.715 billion U.S. dollars, and a
total of 10.727 billion U.S. dollars has been used, including some
pledged before.
</P>
<P>
These figures have shown Hong Kong's confidence in inland
areas' economic development, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong business people regard the market in the inland
areas as attractive and hope to gain more commercial opportunities
in this fair," said Herbert H.Y. Liang, chairman of the Chinese
Manufacturers Association of Hong Kong.

<P>
WUHAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Navigation on the Yangtze River,
which had been blocked by floods for 43 days, fully resumed today.
</P>
<P>
On July 26, the Chinese government issued an order to ban
navigation on the river in an effort to ensure the security of the
dikes.
</P>
<P>
As the water level receded, the State Flood Control
Headquarters decided to re-open the navigation route on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
By 8 p.m. today, the five warning lines in the banned areas had
been removed, and 1,238 ships that were affected by the order have
been allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the navigation authorities said that all work has
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
This was the longest time that ships were banned from sailing
on the Yangtze, the longest river in China.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Currency Depositors in Singapore Urged to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Banks in
Singapore (ABIS) Monday urged all holders of Malaysian currency to
contact their banks to settle the status of their ringgit deposits
by Tuesday so as to meet the September 9 deadline set by the
Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
Under the newly-introduced rules, Malaysia will not recognize
funds of its currency of ringgit held by non-Malaysians outside
Malaysia after September 9, 1998, the ABIS said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ABIS noted each bank in Singapore adopted its own approach
to minimize the impact to ringgit depositors as much as possible
and most banks offered extended business hours and hot-line
numbers to help customers with ringgit accounts.
</P>
<P>
All banks have agreed to allow their ringgit depositors to
convert their ringgit deposits into foreign currency at the
request of the depositors, the ABIS added.
</P>
<P>
The ABIS affirmed that many banks have decided to institute an
"auto convert" system to convert depositors' ringgit accounts into
another currency before September 9 and some others are
considering an automatic conversion if they can not contact the
depositors in time.
</P>
<P>
In all cases, the best advice is for customers to contact their
banks before the deadline so that arrangements could be made, the
ABIS stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the ABIS, local banks are seeking to ensure that
customers' interests are protected in some ways. They are helping
customers to pre-terminate their ringgit fixed deposits before
ringgit deposits outside Malaysia are no longer recognized by
Malaysia and the conversion is conducted at a spot rate of four
Malaysian ringgits to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Asset Management Ltd. of the United
Overseas Bank, one of the four biggest banks in Singapore,
announced in the evening its decision to suspend trading of the
United Malaysia Fund with immediate effect, saying "the imposition
of exchange control measures, announced by the government of
Malaysia on September 1, 1998, has made it impractical for UOB
Asset Management Ltd. to continue operating its United Malaysia
Fund as an open-ended unit trust fund."
</P>
<P>
The UOB Asset Management Ltd. said it will issue a statement in
the next seven days to inform unit-holders of the next course of
actions.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Banquet Marks DPRK Founding Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Song Pong Hwan, charge
d'affaires ad interim of DPRK embassy in Beijing, held a banquet
this evening to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao attended the banquet.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the occasion on behalf of the Communist Party of
China, Chinese government and people, Hu, who is also a member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulated Kim Jong
Il on his election of the Chairman of the National Defense
Commission (NDC) and on the 50th anniversary of the founding of
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
He said that the founding of DPRK is a major event in the
Korean history. He added that the Korean people have since then
embarked on the road of independently building a socialist country.
</P>
<P>
Hu spoke highly of the achievements that the Korean people,
under the leadership of the late President Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong
Il and the Workers' Party of Korea, have scored in both revolution
and national construction as well as in safeguarding national
sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
He also wished that the Korean people make an even greater
progress in the coming years under the leadership of the Workers'
Party of Korea headed by Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that China and DPRK are friendly neighbors linked by
mountains and rivers, and that Sino-DPRK friendship, established
and fostered by the older generations of leaders of the two
countries, has withstood the test of history and has therefore
rooted in the hearts of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Under the changing international situation, Hu added, the
further development of traditional friendship and cooperation
between the two countries accords with the fundamental interests
and aspiration of the two peoples, and will also serve regional
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party, government and people highly value
the Sino-DPRK friendship, and will continue their efforts to
further such friendship.
</P>
<P>
Song Pong Hwan highly praised DPRK-China friendship and thanked
the Chinese government, Party and people for their support for the
socialist construction of DPRK and its cause of national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Chinese foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan and the Chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fu Quanyou
were among the guests at the banquet.

<HEADLINE> Hail Storm Hits Beijing; No Damage Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A burst of hailstones fell on
the Chinese capital at about 9:30 p.m. today, but no damage was
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Beijing Meteorological Bureau said that the
hail lasted for 5-to-6 minutes. The hailstones were quite small
with a diameter of 10 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
The hailstones fell on the west area of Beijing, and many
curious citizens ran out of their houses to watch.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Beijing has been struck by hailstones several
times this year, but all the previous ones landed in mountainous
suburbs. This is the first time the hailstones found their way
into downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But this was a normal meteorological phenomena, and citizens
should not worry, sources said, adding that it is hard to predict
if more hail will fall in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> China Trying to Eliminate Leprosy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China aims to reduce the rate
of leprosy to less than 0.1 per 10,000 in 95 percent of counties
and cities by 2000 and reach that standard in all the counties and
cities by 2010, an official from the Ministry of Health said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, vice minister of health, told the 15th International
Leprosy Congress which opened here today, that more than 490,000
leprosy patients have been detected in China from 1949 to 1997,
and 4,045 patients need treatment at present.
</P>
<P>
The national average rate has been lowered from 2.4 per 10,000
in 1966 to 0.033 per 10,000, according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
He said leprosy has a history of more than 2,000 years in
China, and was regarded as incurable. The disease not only caused
disabilities but also social fears and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government pays great attention to controlling the
disease and has worked out regulations and plans regarding its
control in past decades. A national supervision and detection
system and a leprosy data bank have been established in China,
according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
He added that leprosy patients are treated free of charge in
China. The country has more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics
employing 5,700 professional doctors specializing in leprosy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, an effective measure to prevent the disease
has not been found. Every year, about 2,000 new patients are
detected in China, mainly in remote and poor regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has 120,000 persons disabled and handicapped
by the disease. "They need care and help from the society," said
Yin.
</P>
<P>
China will strengthen its leprosy education programs to let
people know the disease is curable and reducing discrimination
toward sufferers of the disease, said Yin.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also provides life subsistence to
persons affected by leprosy, and tries to offer more employment
opportunities to persons who have recovered from the disease, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Students Stage Anti-Government Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of students from
Greater Jakarta staged an anti-government rally at the House of
Representatives (DPR) here Monday to protest the price hikes of
basic commodities which have been spiraling in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, consisting of students from 46 state and
private universities, expressed their distrust over the
incapability of the government to lower the price hikes.
</P>
<P>
"There should have been a massive graft in the distribution of
nine basic necessaries and we demand accountability from the
government," field coordinator of the rally Mathias said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, he said, the price protest is triggered by a
statement by former president Soeharto Sunday night saying he had
no personal fortune stashed both overseas and at home.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's denial had made the students so furious that they
should make something, Mathias said.
</P>
<P>
Beside demanding lowering the prices of basic commodities, the
students also called for the establishment of a transitional
administration with its members coming from all walks of life and
being trusted by the people.
</P>
<P>
This is the second biggest rally at the DPR building after that
of May which forced Soeharto to step down.

<HEADLINE> Unearthed Skulls in Qinghai Show Signs of Skull Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Unearthed skulls in the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau show that craniotomy was performed by
Chinese early in the Neolithic Age 5,000 years ago, according to a
Chinese archeologist.
</P>
<P>
Han Kangxin, an archeologist of Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the latest research shows craniotomy appeared
in the Majiayao culture period (about 4,000 to 5,500 years
ago). Archeologists found that the crack in some skulls healed
very well after the operation. Craniotomy is the surgical opening
of the skull, usually for operations on the brain.
</P>
<P>
Traces of craniotomy have also been found on unearthed skulls
of the Kayue culture period (2,000-to-3,000 years ago), which
proves that the operation was used in ancient Qinghai for about
3,000 years, Han said.
</P>
<P>
Modern brain operations grew out of the ancient craniotomy, he
said, adding that craniotomy found on the unearthed skulls in
Qinghai is the earliest in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the Qinghai Archeology Institute, the remains of
the Majiayao culture was distributed in Gansu and Qinghai
provinces in the Neolithic Age and the remains of the Kayue was
that of a bronze culture in the eastern part of Qinghai Province.

<HEADLINE> Govt Planes Bomb Rebel-held Towns in East Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebel leader
Earnest Wamba Dia Wamba Monday accused government planes of
bombing two rebel-held towns in east Congo (K), a report reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
"Government planes coming from Kindu bombed Kalemie and Lubutu
and we are protesting the fact that they are now targeting
civilian populations," Wamba said in his headquarters of Goma.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said the bombs had missed their target in Kalemie, about
500 kilometers south of Goma, falling into Lake Tanganyika. But
he did not say anything about casualties or damages in Lubutu, a
village about 360 kilometers west of Goma, a town bordering
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The bombings happened at a time when peace talks were being
held at Victoria Falls grouping a rebel team with Congolese
President Laurent Kabila and leaders of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said the summit would grant the rebels recognition from
regional leaders and allow them to present their case.
</P>
<P>
"Just being there at the summit is already a recognition by
the heads of state attending the meeting, and we will use this
recognition to present our case forcefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, composed of a mixture of opposition politicians
and disgruntled soldiers allegedly backed by neighboring Rwanda,
accuse Kabila of bad governance, corruption and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
"We can't let this government continue and we appeal to all to
understand that we have a just case to fight for. We are fighting
against dictatorship and for democracy."
</P>
<P>
Kabila's forces, backed by Angola and Zimbabwe have repulsed
the rebel assault to the west of Kinshasa and have stepped up the
pressure in the rebel's eastern stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the warring sides in Congo, presidents of Zimbabwe,
Namibia, Angola, Uganda, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Zambia along
with Organization of African Unity chief Salim Ahmed Salim are in
session at Victoria Falls, a northwestern town of Zimbabwe trying
to hammer out a cease-fire in the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of Banyamulenge, or Congolese Tutsis took up arms on
August 2 in east Congo to topple President Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Plans Huge Investment for Industry Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- This economic and financial
center of China will invest 260 billion yuan in industrial
restructuring and upgrading in 1998-2000 to keep economic growth
on the fast track.
</P>
<P>
The planned investment, which is 100 billion yuan more than the
figure for the 1995-1997 period, is expected to ensure that
Shanghai's industrial output value will grow an average of
12-to-13 percent each year, to 700 billion yuan by the year 2000,
according to Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren.
</P>
<P>
"The effort to increase industrial investment is meant to
expand domestic demand, create more jobs and help to ensure a high
growth rate for the national economy," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qifan, director of the Municipal Economic Commission,
said that after years of economic restructuring since the 1980s,
Shanghai has formed six pillar industries: automobiles,
telecommunications equipment, complete power stations or plants,
petrochemicals, iron and steel, and household electrical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Last year the pillars accounted for 52 percent of Shanghai's
industrial output value and 55.4 percent of industrial gross
profits, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of hi-tech industries -- such as those
in micro-electronics and computers, modern biology and medicine,
and new materials -- accounted for 15 percent of the city's
industrial output value last year.
</P>
<P>
"With the rise of the pillar and hi-tech industries, Shanghai's
industrial structure is becoming less and less resources-based and
more and more technology- and capital-intensive," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The three years between 1998 and 2000 is a critical period for
Shanghai to complete the transformation process, he added.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Shanghai will step up its effort to expedite the
industrialization of high technologies, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"We're striving for an average annual growth rate of 25-to-30
percent for the hi-tech industries of information, modern biology
and medicine, and new materials," he said. "The combined output
value of these industries will reach 142.8 billion yuan by 2000,
or more than 20 percent of our total industrial output value by
then."
</P>
<P>
He said that Shanghai will also take measures to expand the
application of new and high technology to the pillar industries to
raise their output value to 314.4 billion yuan by 2000, which
represents an annualized growth rate of 11-to-14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to the development of medium- and
hi-grade cars, air-conditioned buses, environmental protection
equipment, digital household electrical appliances and multi-media
large-screen color TV sets, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
He also said that greater efforts will be made to develop such
sectors as clothing, foodstuffs, packaging design, printing and
publishing, computer software and fitness equipment to maintain
the average growth rate at 8 percent each year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: Turkish-Israeli Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said Monday that Turkey's growing military ties with Israel
should not be seen as a threat to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remark during a welcoming ceremony hosted in
his honor by his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu after
Yilmaz arrived here from Jordan for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the strength of our ties (with Israel) will serve
not only the interests of our respective countries, but also peace
and stability in this region," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's speech was apparently aimed at addressing the concern
of other countries in the region, particularly Syria, Egypt and
Greece, about the Turkish-Israeli security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
1996, exchanging warplanes for training, conducting naval
maneuvers and signing several defense and trade deals.
</P>
<P>
Israel army radio reported that during his visit, Yilmaz is
seeking an Israeli promise of military assistance in case of war
between Turkey and Greece in their dispute over control of
Cyprus. But Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai denied this
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the real dimensions of Turkish-Israeli
relationship are well understood. Turkish-Israeli cooperation is
not against any other country," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
For this issue, Netanyahu said "it is a cooperation barred
to none."
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the two prime ministers started their
talks inside the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz will also discuss the Middle East peace with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah
on Tuesday before his departure for Egypt.

</P>
<P>
South Korea registered a minus 3.8 percent year-on-year growth
in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of the year,
second only to Indonesia's minus 7.9 percent, said the central
bank in a report comparing the economies of the nine Asian
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The comparable economic growth rate of Hong Kong stood at minus
2 percent in the first three months of this year, followed by
Malaysia's minus 1.8 percent and Japan's minus 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In imports, South Korea saw a plunge of 36.1 percent, second

<HEADLINE> International Leprosy Conference Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 cured Chinese
and foreign leprosy sufferers are attending the 15th International
Leprosy Congress, which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
They will participate in the six-day conference as equal
partners with more than 1,000 scientists from 67 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin wrote a greeting for the conference:
"Eradicate Leprosy for the Benefit of Mankind."
</P>
<P>
"Leprosy, a disease with a sinister potential to devastate the
entire lives of affected persons without actually killing them, is
a reflection of the extreme under-development which still persists
in many parts of the world," said Dr. S.K. Noordeen, senior
adviser of the World Health Organization's Action Program for the
Elimination of Leprosy.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible today to fight the disease successfully," he
said. "It is a relatively weak enemy -- taking years to evolve,
and is only feebly infectious, and today it is highly amenable to
treatment."
</P>
<P>
Leprosy is not merely a health issue, he said, but also a human
rights issue. "Generations of leprosy-affected men and women have
been exposed to cruel stigma and ostracism, and I sincerely hope
that we shall put an end to that injustice once and for all," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China has no longer taken leprosy as a seriously infectious
disease, and has canceled leprosy's listing on the health
declaration card for people entering China, said Yin Dakui,
vice-minister of health.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven cured foreign leprosy sufferers have come to
China to attend the conference. Leprosy-affected people, who no
longer were infectious, have also come to China as tourists.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the congress is "Working Toward A World without
Leprosy," said Dr. Yo Yuasa, President of the International
Leprosy Association (ILA). He said that a large number of medical
professionals have worked to reduce the prevalent rate of leprosy
during the past century since the first international leprosy
congress was held in Berlin in 1897.
</P>
<P>
"The congress will try to explore the medical and social
aspects of the disease, both of which need a solid basis of
science and humanity," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1998, the number of registered leprosy
cases for treatment in the world was 828,000, most of which were
concentrated in 16 countries in the Asian, African and American
continents.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Enterprises Holdings
Limited, the investment arm of the Beijing Municipal Government in
Hong Kong, Monday reported a 24-percent increase of profit in the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The red-chip company announced in its interim report that its
operating profit attributable to shareholders in the first six
months amounted to 249 million HK dollars (32 million U.S.
dollars), up 24 percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share were approximately 0.4 HK dollars (five
U.S. cents). The board of directors proposed an interim dividend
of 0.1 HK dollars (1.2 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
Listed in Hong Kong in mid-1997, the conglomerate has built up
its presence in production of consumer goods, infrastructure,
technology industry, tourism and related services in Beijing,
capital of China.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhaoguang, chairman of Beijing Enterprises, told a press
conference Monday that brewery and manufacturing of telephone
switching systems contributed heavily to the satisfactory profit
growth in the first half.
</P>
<P>
An airport expressway owned by the company reported a slight
increase in earnings, but its tourism, hotel and retail
subsidiaries suffered from the Asia financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Interest income of 80 million HK dollars (10 million U.S.
dollars) from unused initial public offering proceeds made part
of the interim profit.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that the company's financial position remains
strong, with a 17-percent debt-to-equity ratio.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, Hu said that the company will continue
to tap the potential of the existing businesses, and at the same
time, explore new growth points in the high-technology sector.

<P>
SEOUL, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Monday announced that it will issue state bonds worth 13.9
trillion won (10.3 billion U.S. dollars) for institutional and
individual investors.
</P>
<P>
The funds raised by the bonds will provide unemployment
benefits, flood damage restoration, overhead costs and the
recently revised supplementary budget, said the Ministry of
Economy and Finance Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bonds are scheduled to go on sale Tuesday and be available
until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Bonds valued at five trillion won will be issued this month,
4.7 trillion won in October, 3.4 trillion won in November, and
eight trillion won in December.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be sold through 95 underwriters, including banks
and insurance companies. The ministry will decide on the coupon
rates based on prevailing market rates.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Tuesday, the public will be able to buy government
bonds at security firms, investment trust companies, merchant
banks and insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of bonds available to the public, analysts
said, may not be enough because banks and security firms are
likely to resell most of their new bond holdings to investment
trust companies.
</P>
<P>
Investment trust companies may not offer the state bonds to the
public since they usually acquire bonds as a part of a pool of
various securities, including stocks and corporate debentures, say
analysts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Hails Victory over Floods (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
urged people in the flood-affected areas to keep up their spirit
of fighting floods in rebuilding their homeland and promoting
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark during an inspection tour to Jiangxi
Province, an area that suffered heavy losses during the summer
flooding.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the great battle against heavy floods in both
northern and southern China during the past two months has aroused
common concern of the whole Party, the whole army and all the
people of China.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time I have come to the forefront of the
anti-flood fight along the Yangtze River," Jiang said. "I've sent
army troops to assist the anti-flood fight and postponed my visits
to Russia and Japan scheduled for early this month."
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River experienced an unusually big flood along the
whole stretch of the river system, the worst since 1954. Eight
flood crests surged down the Yangtze River and, as a result, the
water level at ports in the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze River all surpassed the danger mark.
</P>
<P>
Floods on the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in northeast China
were the biggest ever recorded in the region's history.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports indicate that 29 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities have been damaged by the floods in
varying degrees this year. According to official figures, the
floods were blamed for the deaths of 3,004 people, inundated 21
million hectares of farmland, destroyed nearly 5 million houses
and cost at least 166.6 billion yuan (about 20.8 billion U.S.
dollars) in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
"It is rare in China's history that a number of major rivers
flood at the same time, and that the flood crests had such a
mighty force and were sustained for such a long time," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Under the staunch leadership of the Party Central Committee,
Jiang said, the Chinese people, PLA soldiers and armed police
fought the flood with one mind and one heart.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, he said, they have defeated flood
crests one after another and succeeded in protecting the safety of
major river dikes, cities, key railway lines and people's lives
and property, winning a decisive victory.
</P>
<P>
Though this year's flooding is bigger than 1931, the losses
incurred were much smaller. This can be attributed to the
important role played by the PLA, which is worthy of the title of
"an iron and steel great wall protecting the state and the people".
</P>
<P>
China is a nation with a glorious tradition of making
unremitting efforts and having a great cohesion, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-flood battle proves that the CPC is a great, glorious
and correct Party," Jiang said. "The socialist system has great
superiority. The army is trustworthy. The Chinese people are
industrious and courageous.
</P>
<P>
"With such a good Party, army and people, all historical merits
can be created. So long as we unite more closely and work for a
common goal, we are sure to fulfill the cross-century program."

<P>
Jiang said that this year, because the affected areas were vast
and the time for the devastation was longer, the losses were quite
heavy.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces as well
as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region suffered serious losses,
Jiang said, and the need to resume production and build housing is
urgent and arduous.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, the government at various levels should pay more
attention to jobs and adopt effective measures in their work.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the favorable conditions during the final stage
of the battle against the floods such as the CPC Central Committee's
leadership, the self-reliance and joint efforts of the people in
the flood-hit areas, the aid from all over the country, and the
strong material and technical basis which has evolved during the
last 20 years of development.
</P>
<P>
He called for mobilizing people's initiative in the flood-hit
areas and the forces of all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called for vigilance as the floods recede and urged
the PLA troops to uphold their heroic and unyielding spirit to
achieve the final victory over the floods.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels face an urgent task in making
adequate arrangements for the daily life of people in the
flood-hit areas, he said. Effective measures must be adopted, he
said, to ensure that people have adequate food, clothing, clean
water, housing and medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Before winter arrives, flood victims should be moved into
houses or make-shift shelters and receive coats and quilts.
</P>
<P>
On the epidemic prevention work, Jiang said that historically
epidemics often occur after great disasters. Because of great
efforts, he said, there have been no serious epidemics in the
flood areas.
</P>
<P>
He urged the health departments to enhance supervision and
control over epidemics and ensure the supply of medicine and
medical instruments needed in the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic prevention work should be carried on for an
extensive period and long-term preparations are expected to be
made ideologically, organizationally and materially, he said.

<P>
Jiang stressed the importance of maintaining a sound public
order and construction of water conservation projects in the
flooded areas. He also encouraged people in the areas to keep
their losses to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
The final solution to the problems in the development of
production and people's life in the flooded areas lies in the
people themselves, he said, calling on relief work to be based on
self-reliance and hard work.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic situation, Jiang said the general situation in
China is sound. In the first half of this year, China's Gross
Domestic Product grew by 7 percent. The growth rate decreased
slightly from the same period last year, he said, but it was still
among the highest in the world. China's export volume rose 6.9
percent and the exchange rate for the Renminbi was stable, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it will still be arduous for China to achieve its
economic targets for this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that to promote economic growth, the CPC Central
Committee has decided to adopt more active financial measures to
enhance infrastructure construction on the basis of major measures
set at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a long-term strategy for the Chinese nation
to build water conservation projects. In the flood-control
struggle this year, the water conservation facilities built in the
past five decades, especially those built in recent years, played
an important role, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for overall planning and a long-term strategy in
water conservation construction on the basis of scientific
research and feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
A top priority is to increase investment in the projects and
accelerate the harnessing of large rivers and lakes, including the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Without its own spiritual pillar, he said, a nation will have
no vitality or cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the anti-flood struggle, he said that the Party,
the PLA and the people all demonstrated their determination to
overcome all difficulties, and that their courage with one heart
and one mind to fight against the flood was the upholding of
patriotism, collectivism and socialism advocated by the CPC.
</P>
<P>
It also demonstrates the national spirit of the Chinese nation
and the development of the spirit in contemporary China, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Proposes Trial Period for Chernomyrdin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday proposed a six to eight-month trial for acting prime
minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the suggestion in a just-ended roundtable meeting
in the Kremlin with the representatives of the State Duman in an
apparent attempt to head off a show-off with the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other candidate who, like Chernomyrdin, would have
such great experience in governing the country," said presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
The Communists, the biggest party in the Duma, rejected
Yeltsin's proposal despite long talks in the Kremlin and said they
would reject Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, voted against Chernomyrdin as prime minister in
the first round of vote on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The second vote on Chernomyrdin as prime minister by the Duma
is to be held at 17:00 Moscow time on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Windows 98 Well Received in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Residents in China's major
cities have reacted positively to the Chinese version of Windows
98, Microsoft's latest personal computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
Minutes starting at midnight of Sept. 1, six proprietary shops
in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, capital of east Fujian
Province, and Chengdu, capital of southwest Sichuan Province, sold
333 copies of the Chinese version of Windows 98, which was ushered
into China on Aug. 31. The average sales of 55.5 copies per shop
is very close to the average sales of 57 copies when the English
version was unveiled in the United States more than two months ago,
</P>
<P>
The symbolically successful initial sales indicate that, after
20 years of market economy reforms, China now has a computer
software consumer group who closely follow the latest global
developments in the field, a Shanghai-based Microsoft official
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many of China's major PC makers -- including Legend,
Founder and others -- have cooperated with Microsoft to market PCs
with preinstalled Chinese versions of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China had more than 10 million
PCs and more than five million users of Microsoft's Windows
software.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, which has a population of 13 million, some 1.5
million residents participated in computer training programs in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say that Windows 98 offers more and better
network functions than Windows 95, which was introduced in China
in 1996, as well as better integration of work and recreational
functions.

<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the Chinese government have jointly launched a
four-year project to promote employment for laid-off women workers
in China's urban areas.
</P>
<P>

re-employment for laid-off women workers by means of employment
information and consultation networks, stronger training capacity
and new-venture creation services.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be carried out in Tianjin initially, will
assist the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) and Tianjin Women's
Federation (TWF) to improve their contributions to re-employment,
self-employment and venture creation in Tianjin, where nearly 60
percent of the city's 320,000 laid-off workers are women.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, a system of regular collection and analysis
of relevant information and a computer information system for the
TWF Employment Information Center will be established to provide
an employment information network in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The project also intends to increase the fund-raising capacity
of Tianjin and the ACWF through various forms of networking.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebel Leaders Join Peace Talks With Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Congo (K) rebel leaders
arrived at Victoria Falls Monday for talks with President Laurent
Kabila on ending civil war in the former Zaire, a report from the
Zimbabwean town reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for talks, but there will no cease-fire without
a political settlement," said Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma, deputy
President of the Congolese Democratic Coalition, when arriving
for a peace summit at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to talk. We have come to listen to the leaders
here, but we are not going to talk about a cease-fire before we
have a political settlement," Ngoma said, in reply to a question
about what the rebels' negotiating position is.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader also said a political settlement should be
immediately followed by the withdrawal of Zimbabwean, Angolan and
Namibian troops propping up President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that first, we must have a political
settlement followed by the withdrawal of the occupation forces
from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwse. Only then can come to a
cease-fire," said Ngoma.
</P>
<P>
The rebel team includes Kabila's former foreign minister
turned rebel Bizima Karaha, who changed side the next day after
the rebels launched a rebellion on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and the other key players in the Congo crisis,
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Pasteur
Bizimungu of Rwanda, arrived at Victoria Falls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel team has come to northwest Zimbabwe to attend a
summit despite expressing discomfort with the venue and the
chairmanship of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, whom they say
has become an active participant in the war by deploying 2,800
troops to prop up embattled Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Also due to arrive Monday were Angolan President Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos, whose dispatch of troops to the Congo River corridor
has played a key role in reversing rebel gains, and Namibian
President Sam Nujoma, who is also supplying military logistical
help to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Two neutral players, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and
his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba, are also expected at
the summit along with Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and a special envoy of U.N.
chief Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders are in session seeking to iron out an
Africa peace formula that will lead to a cease-fire followed by
political negotiations and the formation of a broad-based
government in Congo (K), Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe began the peace initiative Sunday by conducting
bilateral consultations with Kabila, Museveni, Bizimungu and
Salim aimed at narrowing the differences between the main
parties.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers and security chiefs from Kabila's allies --
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe -- held parallel talks to chart out
a military position to be presented to their bosses ahead of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
While a cease-fire and negotiations may be very difficult to
agree upon, observers here say the stumbling blocks to peace
might be the peace keeping operation required and how to finance
it.
</P>
<P>
They say a peace-keeping force would need 20,000 troops and
more. The only country with the logistical capability and
resources to payroll such an operation would be Pretoria, but
President Nelson Mandela has already expressed his reservations
about military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had been at odds with Mugabe over Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia's military involvement in Congo till last Thursday when
he made a sudden policy u-turn.
</P>
<P>
He said he "understood" why the troika countries had
intervened only after a regional meeting on the Congo crisis held
on the fringes of a Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said he hoped this mini-summit would help bring peace
to Democratic Congo, saying, "we have to work toward democracy in
Congo because the lack of democracy is the source of this
problem."
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses former allies Rwanda and Uganda of sending
troops to back soldiers of Banyamulenge, or Congolese ethnic
Tutsi community, who took up arms against Kabila in the east of
Congo in early August.
</P>
<P>
But Uganda and Rwanda deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
The rebels made rapid gains in the east and west until Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia sent their troops to back Kabila's army.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Surplus Increases in first 7 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a
significant increase in its trade surplus in the first seven
months of this year as a result of a higher growth in exports over
imports.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus amounted to 26.2 billion ringgit (6.894
billion U.S. dollars) during the period under review against a
deficit of 3.6 billion ringgit (947.368 million U.S. dollars) in
the same period last year, according to the Statistics Department
which released Monthly External Trade Statistics here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the seven-month surplus to the 40.8
percent increase in exports to 162.7 billion ringgit (42.815
billion U.S. dollars) from 115.6 billion ringgit (30.421 billion
U.S. dollars) in the corresponding period in 1997 while imports
rose 14.6 percent to 136.5 billion ringgit (25.921 billion U.S.
dollars) from 119.1 billion ringgit (31.342 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The department said electrical and electronic products
persisted as Malaysia's largest export earner, netting receipts
amounting to 84 billion ringgit (22.105 billion U.S. dollars) or
sharing 51.7 percent of total export earnings during January-July
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil and palm-based products retained their position as the
second largest export revenue earner during the first seven months
of 1998, with a total combined value of 12.3 billion ringgit
(3.236 billion U.S. dollars), or sharing 7.6 percent of total
exports.
</P>
<P>
Other major export revenue earners included liquefied natural
gas (LNG) which accounted for 3.0 percent of total exports, and
crude petroleum, ranking as the fourth largest export earner and
comprising 2.8 percent of total exports.
</P>
<P>
Turning to imports, the department said that the major
categories of imports by end-use for the current period were
intermediate goods, sharing 69.5 percent of total imports, capital
goods 17.1 percent and consumption goods 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For July alone, the ninth consecutive month to record a surplus
since November last year, the surplus was at 4.1 billion ringgit
(1.078 billion U.S. dollars), which was lower by 2 billion ringgit
(526.315 million U.S. dollars) from the previous month, the
department said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Generate Power From Sea Waves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
plans to generate power through the use of sea waves, according to
Technology Ministry sources Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the government will launch a project to
generate power from sea waves at Rumassala in Galle city in the
deep south of the country which will be completed within an year.
</P>
<P>
The entire cost of the project is estimated at about 100,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By year 2008, Sri Lanka's total foreign exchange earnings from
tea, rubber and coconut will have to be spent on importing oil
unless alternative local energy resources are harnessed, the
sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Although there are several potential energy resources, they
said, most of them remain untapped. The sea waves project is a
contingency measure to tide over an impending power crisis.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the power plant comes in the wake of
successful experiments conducted by the Faculty of Engineering of
the University of Peradeniya, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai: Israel Not to Take Hostile Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said here Monday that Israel will not take
any hostile policy towards Cyprus because the relations between
the two countries are friendly.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with visiting European
Union's peace envoy to the Middle East Miguel Moratinos,
Mordechai said that Israel will never interfere into the affairs
of Cyprus and side with Turkey against Greece over the missile
issue in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has signed a deal with Russia to buy S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles, triggering a new round of tension on the divided
island. Turkey has threatened to use all means to block the
deployment of missiles.
</P>
<P>
Commenting the visit to Israel by Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz, Mordechai denied the Turkish Prime Minister's visit
is to seek Israel's support in the event of hostelity with
Greece over the station of missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said the missile issue in Cyprus is a sensitive one
and Israel has no intention to get itself involved.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz arrived here Monday morning for a two-day visit and
he is scheduled to hold talks with his Israeli counterpart
Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
Beside other issues, the security cooperation between Israel
and Turkey would dominate the talks between the two prime
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos is here to help push the peace process forward
and he is scheduled to hold talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Ramallah later Monday.

<HEADLINE> Multi-National Force to Be Deployed Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A multi-national force
comprising armed force and police will soon be deployed along the
border areas of Nigeria, Chad and Niger to combat the growing
menace of armed bandits, according to a military official.
</P>
<P>
The New Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted Colonel Mohammed
Bawa, military administrator of Gombe state, as saying that the
three neighbors had decided to form the multi-national force
because of the frequent cases of armed robbery on their borders.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Bawa assured local people in border areas that with
the deployment of the multi-national force, the problem of armed
banditry would be "a thing of the past."
</P>
<P>
The military administrator noted that the state anti-banditry
squad would be strengthened with necessary equipment to enable it
to carry out its duties effectively.
</P>
<P>
Last month, defense and foreign ministers of the three
countries held a meeting in Nigerian capital Abuja to discuss the
security situation along their common borders.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the meeting said that a
joint committee had been set up to combat criminal activities in
Lake Chad area where rebels, bandits and other undesirable
elements had posed a serious threat to peace, security and
stability in the border areas.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Committee of the
Cabinet of Pakistan Monday expressed the hope that the growing
tensions along the Afghanistan-Iran border will subside soon and
urged both countries to show the utmost restraint, an official
press release said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the
Defense Committee called upon Iran and Afghanistan to take
necessary steps to calm the situation, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are arising in Central Asia as Iran held military
exercises near its border with Afghanistan and announced it would
take any necessary actions if the Taliban did not free the 11
Iranian nationals.
</P>
<P>
The committee reviewed the Durban summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement, expressing satisfaction that South African President
Nelson Mandela, as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, has
invited the attention of the Movement to the need for an early
settlement of the long standing Jammu and Kashmir issue, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The committee noted that the official level meetings between
Pakistan and India at Durban have been useful in preparing the
ground for the meeting between the prime ministers of Pakistan and
India to be held in New York later this month, it said.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the
committee reiterated that a decision would be taken only in
supreme national interest and not under coercion of sanctions or
economic pressures, it added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Firmer on U.S. Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger Monday as speculation mounted over the prospect of an
official interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Comments made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan last Friday in the
U.S. were interpreted by markets as indicating the central bank
might be prepared to cut rates in the face of the turmoil in Asian
and South American markets.
</P>
<P>
As result, the U.S. dollar Monday lost ground against the
Japanese yen during Asian trading.
</P>
<P>
And the Australian dollar, which has been moving in line with
the Japanese yen recently, rose alongside its Asian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"Weakness for the U.S. (dollar) will help the Aussie," said a
foreign exchange expert.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility that the lower rates out of the U.S. will
shore up emerging markets, takes a bit of pressure off commodities
(exporting nations such as Australia), (is) more good news for the
Aussie," he added.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended the day in Sydney at 59.36 U.S. cents,
up from 59.06 U.S. cents locally last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Australian dollar Monday also was in part
due to firmer gold price. Gold closed in Sydney at 288.05 U.S.
dollars an ounce, up from 285.55 U.S. dollars last Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates the Australian dollar was at 78.37 Japanese
yen from Friday's close of 79.75 yen and 1.0236 German marks from
1.0238 marks.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebel Leaders Join Peace Talks With Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Congo (K) rebel leaders
arrived at Victoria Falls Monday for talks with President Laurent
Kabila on ending civil war in the former Zaire, a report from the
Zimbabwean town reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for talks, but there will no cease-fire without
a political settlement," said Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma, deputy
President of the Congolese Democratic Coalition, when arriving
for a peace summit at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to talk. We have come to listen to the leaders
here, but we are not going to talk about a cease-fire before we
have a political settlement," Ngoma said, in reply to a question
about what the rebels' negotiating position is.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and the other key players in the Congo crisis,
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Pasteur
Bizimungu of Rwanda, arrived at Victoria Falls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel team has come to northwest Zimbabwe to attend a
summit despite expressing discomfort with the venue and the
chairmanship of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, whom they say
has become an active participant in the war by deploying 2,800
troops to prop up embattled Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Also due to arrive Monday were Angolan President Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos, whose dispatch of troops to the Congo River corridor
has played a key role in reversing rebel gains, and Namibian
President Sam Nujoma, who is also supplying military logistical
help to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Two neutral players, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and
his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba, are also expected at
the summit along with Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and a special envoy of U.N.
chief Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders are in session seeking to iron out an
Africa peace formula that will lead to a cease-fire followed by
political negotiations and the formation of a broad-based
government in Congo (K), Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe began the peace initiative Sunday by conducting
bilateral consultations with Kabila, Museveni, Bizimungu and
Salim aimed at narrowing the differences between the main
parties.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers and security chiefs from Kabila's allies --
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe -- held parallel talks to chart out
a military position to be presented to their bosses ahead of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
While a cease-fire and negotiations may be very difficult to
agree upon, observers here say the stumbling blocks to peace
might be the peace keeping operation required and how to finance
it.
</P>
<P>
They say a peace-keeping force would need 20,000 troops and
more. The only country with the logistical capability and
resources to payroll such an operation would be Pretoria, but
President Nelson Mandela has already expressed his reservations
about military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had been at odds with Mugabe over Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia's military involvement in Congo till last Thursday when
he made a sudden policy u-turn.
</P>
<P>
He said he "understood" why the troika countries had
intervened only after a regional meeting on the Congo crisis held
on the fringes of a Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said he hoped this mini-summit would help bring peace
to Democratic Congo, saying, "we have to work toward democracy in
Congo because the lack of democracy is the source of this
problem."
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses former allies Rwanda and Uganda of sending
troops to back soldiers of Banyamulenge, or Congolese ethnic
Tutsi community, who took up arms against Kabila in the east of
Congo on August 2.
</P>
<P>
But Uganda and Rwanda deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
The rebels made rapid gains in the east and west until Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia sent their troops to back Kabila's army.

The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) shot up 57.06 points to

<HEADLINE> HK's New Measures to Strengthen Currency System Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

Kong all expressed their firm support for a package of the
government's seven technical measures to strengthen the currency
board and end manipulation of local interest rates by speculators.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported here on Sunday or Monday that bankers
broadly welcomed the new measures announced on Saturday by the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the de facto central bank in

HK dollar and make Hong Kong's financial system more stable and
sound.

The South China Morning Post said that its undertaking to
convert clearing accounts at a fixed exchange rate of 7.75 HK
dollars to 1 U.S. dollar and the rule to allow unlimited use of
the borrowing facility at the new Discount Window will "greatly
improve short-term liquidity to counteract manipulation of
interest rates."
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po described the government measures as a greatly
important and practical reform after the government summed up both
experiences and lessons.
</P>
<P>
The package of measures will create an condition to decrease
the interest rates so as to adapt Hong Kong's financial market to
the current downward economic readjustment, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in an editorial that the
new measures which become effective starting from Monday will
surely intensify the linked exchange rates and boost the Hong Kong
people's confidence in its economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the belief that the Hong Kong stock market and
foreign exchange market will give an active response to them.
</P>
<P>
Other local newspapers also published commentaries and
editorials to support the government measures. Hong Kong
entrepreneurs from property and securities sectors as well as
Legislative Council members all spoke highly of these measures.

HONG KONG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebecca Lai, acting
secretary for Financial Services, outlined a 30-point program to
tighten up the disciplines in the securities and futures markets
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lai said at a Financial Affairs Panel meeting of the
Legislative Council that the program involves a total of five
securities and futures bodies in Hong Kong and aims to strengthen
regulation and enforcement on short selling, enhance risk
management across the financial markets and step up enforcement on
T+2 settlement rules.
</P>
<P>
Under these rules, shares including those sold short must be
delivered no later than two days after the trade is executed.
</P>
<P>
The program also calls for heavier penalties on breaches of
securities legislation and market rules in relation to naked and
unreported short selling and default in settlement.
</P>
<P>
It also commissions urgent studies on regulation over
custodians and registrars as well as over stock lending and
borrowing activities, the feasibility of full investor
participation in central Clearing and Settlement System and a
scripless securities market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang stressed at the meeting that
the government is absolutely determined to protect the stability
and integrity of the currency and financial markets of Hong Kong.
</P>

PHNOM PENH, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Sam Rainsy, leader of
Cambodia's main opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), will soon be

Hun Sen also said that the government has ordered the
demonstrators gathering in front of the National Assembly to leave

<P>
The King had wished to resolve the month-long political crisis
between the Cambodian People's Party led by Hun Sen and the

<HEADLINE> DNA Tests Distinguish Blood Relations Among Lesser Pandas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Three-year-old lesser panda
Xiaoguai did not know until today that an uncle who had often
fought for food against her is her biological father
</P>
<P>
A DNA fingerprint test made by Chinese scientists, first of
its kind in the world for lesser pandas, proved Xiaoguai and her
father's blood relationship.
</P>
<P>
Another eight lesser panda cubs also found their fathers via
the DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say this finding is of great importance for
avoiding inbreeding in a group of lesser pandas.
</P>
<P>
This research program, after passing appraisal by experts,
helped established family histories for 22 lesser pandas in the
Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Center.
</P>
<P>
China started began DNA fingerprint tests for giant pandas in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Lesser pandas, who enjoy the same state protection as giant
pandas, reside mainly in mountainous and forest areas in southwest
China's Sichuan, Tibet and Yunnan provinces, as well as in few
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The number of bamboo-eating lesser pandas has been reduced by
nearly 40 percent since the 1950s because of human expansion into
their natural habitats.
</P>
<P>
To protect these endangered wild animal species, China has
strengthened its breeding of captive lesser pandas. A
630-square-meter lesser-panda farm has been built within the
Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Center.
</P>
<P>
It now 22 lesser pandas, and four females have given birth to
14 cubs since 1995. Nine of these have survived.
</P>
<P>
Senior zoologist Li Guanghan said the average life expectancy
of the lesser pandas is about 13 years, and they reach adulthood
by the age of two.

<HEADLINE> Paul Ince Faces Wrath of FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Paul Ince may be banned from
competitive internationals for six months after being sent off
against Sweden in Stockholm last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ince will be automatically suspended from England's next match,
the European Championships qualifier against Bulgaria on October
10,
but could face further disciplinary action from both the Football
Association (FA) and Europe's governing body UEFA.
</P>
<P>
After being dismissed for a second bookable offence, Ince
tried to
have words with Henrik Larsson, the victim of his foul, then
verbally
abused the referee Pierluigi Collina. He was ushered away by
teammates but still had time to flick a V-sign in the direction of
the England bench and Swedish supporters behind it before
disappearing down the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
It was the 30-year-old former England captain's first sending
off,
but 12th and 13th bookings, in his 44-match international
career. He
became the sixth England player to be dismissed in 126 years, and
the
second in as many matches since the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The FA intends to wait to see if Collina, or the match
observer,
mention Ince's behaviour in their reports to UEFA before
commenting,
but there is already a grondswell of opinion in favour of taking
action independent of UEFA.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Presents Photo Album of World War II in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese professor has
donated a photo album taken by a Japanese soldier during World War
II to the Museum of Nanjing Massacre Victims, providing new
evidence of crimes committed against China by Japanese invaders in
the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The album was donated by Professor Yoshihiko Yamamoto of
Shizuoka University last month during his visit in Nanjing,
capital of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The album contains 130 photos of battle scenes in a dozen
Chinese cities including Dalian, Changxindian, Shanghai, Suzhou,
Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Anqing, Jiujiang and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the photos are marked with an exact date and place. The
earliest one was taken on July 29, 1937, soon after the July 7
Incident of 1937.
</P>
<P>
The burned bodies of Chinese victims of the Nanjing Massacre
are shown in four photos taken in Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and
Xiaguan Port in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The album also includes five military maps. On one, titled "My
Victory," the Japanese soldier marked his army's invasion route
with a red line, passing through the seven Chinese provinces of
Liaoning, Hebei, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Hunan.
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto said that he obtained the album from the soldier's
relatives after his death in 1985, but the professor declined to
disclose the soldier's name.
</P>
<P>
According to the professor, the soldier was born in Osaka in
1911 and joined an artillery troop of the Japanese Tenth Army in
1937. After the war, he worked as an electrical engineer in
a Japanese company.

<HEADLINE> Thai Main Opposition Party Delays Censure Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Leader of New Aspiration Party
(NAP), Thailand's largest political party and leading opposition
party, has promised to delay a censure debate against the Chuan
Leekpai government from November to January, the Nation newspaper
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, also NAP leader,
said the opposition wanted to give the current government, led by
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, more time to implement its economic
measures.
</P>
<P>
However, Chavalit warned Prime Minister Chuan against trying to
avoid the debate by dissolving the House first.
</P>
<P>
The opposition was likely to censure individual ministers, not
the entire cabinet, the newspaper quoted Chavalit as saying.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the government's attempts to solve the economic
crisis, Chavalit suggested the government build a canal across the
southern peninsula for a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said the so-called Kra Canal project would draw
foreign investment into Thailand and quickly revive the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, an adviser to Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi said the project would not be able to draw foreign
investment because the investors knew the project would take a
while to finish.
</P>
<P>
The current high interest rates in world markets would make the
project not worth the investment, the adviser said.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The non-public-owned sector has
become an important pillar of the economic growth in east China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Fujian currently has more than 88,000 non-public-owned
businesses, which accounted for 37.8 percent of the provincial
gross domestic product last year, up from only 5.5 percent in
1978, the year China launched its reforms and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that overseas-funded businesses made
up 60 percent of Fujian's total exports last year.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the non-public-owned sector has helped
inject vitality and vigor into the provincial economy and has
become an important motive force for rapid economic growth," said
Chen Mingyi, leader of the province.
</P>
<P>
The non-public-owned economic sector has also become an
employment pool. Official data indicate that overseas-funded firms
in Fujian employ 1.7 million people, while private sector hires
another 3.6 million. The combined figure represents nearly
two-thirds of Fujian' s labor force in the industrial and service
sectors.

BEIRUT, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri Monday discussed with a World Bank delegation a program to
get Lebanon's secondary schools hooked to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Hariri told the delegation that he attaches great importance to
the plan, to be sponsored by the World Bank, in view of the
approach of the 21st century, which will feature advanced
technologies, the Lebanese Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank launched a World Links for Development program
last year to get 1,500 secondary schools in 40 developing nations
connected with the Internet to partner schools in Australia,
Canada, European countries, Japan and the United States over a
four-year period.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at enabling the students to cooperate in
cultural, scientific and educational projects.
</P>
<P>
Hariri described the program as an opportunity to lead Lebanon
into a regional center for education on Internet.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent reduction in subscription fees to the
Internet is part of the Lebanese government's effort to help the
program succeed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Head of the World Bank delegation Shimse Diine said the program
will be carried out in Lebanon soon after a detailed plan is
worked out.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Needs $51 Billion to Avert Reserves Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea needs to increase
its foreign exchange reserves to 51.5 U.S. dollars billion to
avert a possible foreign exchange crisis caused by abrupt outflow
of hot money and a drastic shift in inter-Korean relations, the
Bank of Korea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea should gather enough dollars equaling a combination
of its current foreign exchange payments and 25 percent of its
short-term foreign debt to prepare for a possible outflow of hot
money, said the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nation has to keep more dollars in preparation
for a possible outflow of foreign funds if the inter-Korean
relations deteriorate, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, South Korea's current foreign
exchange payments, including import settlements, interest payment
on foreign debt, remittances, royalties, and expenses for overseas
transportation and travel, amounted to 64.2 billion dollars while
its short-term foreign debt stood at 38.3 billion dollars in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also predicted that some 9.8 billion dollars
will flow out of the nation's stock and bond markets if the
inter-Korean ties are further compromised.
</P>
<P>
Because of these factors, South Korea needs to increase its
foreign exchange reserves to 51.5 billion dollars from current
41.3 billion before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world,
suffered a financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
The country signed an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund last December to borrow 58 billion dollars from it.

of this was sown in arid areas.
</P>
<P>
The local government built a number of new water conservancy
projects which added 146,000 hectares of irrigated land this year,
and farmers have begun using new techniques such as plastic
sheeting and coated seeds.
</P>
<P>
However, rainstorms during the flood season have destroyed 2
million hectares of crops, or one-third of the total cropland. The
floods have led to a loss of 2.5 billion kg of grains this year,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
People in the flooded areas have been urged to help themselves
and promote production by draining off water from farmland and
replanting fast-growing crops in the inundated areas.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Setting Up Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Science, Technology and
Environment Ministry of Thailand is planning to establish an
independent authority to control the use of nuclear power in the
country, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Pathom Yamkate, deputy secretary general of the Office
of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), the newspaper said the
independent body is part of the preparation for the future nuclear
power once studies show it is feasible to build a nuclear power
plant in the country.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet two years ago set up a committee to study the
feasibility of constructing a nuclear power plant. The study is
expected to be finished within two years.
</P>
<P>
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT),
meanwhile, has been conducting a public relations campaign in
southern provinces, which are considered appropriate sites for the
location of the planned nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Those provinces are considered suitable since there is no
active fault, a small number of inhabitants and enough water
supply for the cooling system.
</P>
<P>
EGAT earlier included the construction of a 1000-megawatt plant
beginning in 2006 at a cost of 70 billion baht (1.75 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the plan has recently been shelved. EGAT officials
predicted that the project would face more delay because of the
reduced demand for electricity as a result of the economic crisis.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat are
scheduled to travel to the United States later this month to
deliver speeches at the opening of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that a possible summit meeting among
Netanyahu, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton will be held
during that time.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu's primary economic goals for next year are

budget. He also cited lowering unemployment rates as a central
goal for 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Take Measures to Protect Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- It is necessary for the
Vietnamese government to take effective measures to combat illegal
hunting and trading of tigers and products made from their skins
and bones, said a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Van Dang, deputy minister of Agriculture and Rural
Development, also urged to educate people about the need to
preserve all wild animals and to protect forests and bio-diversity
in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports on Monday, the number of tigers
in Vietnam is diminishing due to an over-exploitation of natural
forests, the economic growth in forest areas, a decline of prey
for tigers and the increasing tiger-hunting.
</P>
<P>
Only about 150-250 tigers are estimated to be living in remote
forests in Vietnam, compared with thousands in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry is drafting regulation on wild animal
protection and management, Dang added.

<HEADLINE> Lions Club President on Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sight First China Action
project has helped 34,800 people suffering from cataracts to
regain their eyesight since it began one year ago.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty satisfied with the result," said Kajit Habanananda,
president of Lions Clubs International (LCI) which is conducting
the project with the Chinese government, during a recent interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to projected plan, between 1997 and the year 2001
some 1.75 million cataract operations will be performed, 250
medical teams will be dispatched to make rounds of villages and
remote or poor areas, 11,000 medical professionals will be
trained, 100 eye-disease departments will be set up in local
hospitals, and other technical assistance will be provided to
Chinese eye clinics.
</P>
<P>
Habanananda went on to say that to effect this plan, the LCI
has donated 15 million U.S. dollars to China, the largest sum the
country has ever received to help its disabled.
</P>
<P>
According to Habanananda, LCI's cooperation with China is the
"most pleasant and productive" among all the 50-odd countries
where Sight First Action has been conducted. "I'm sure that LCI's
cooperation with China will go ahead smoothly in the future," he
added.
</P>
<P>
China has a blind population of some nine million, the largest
in the world, and among these four million lost their eyesight to
cataracts.
</P>
<P>
Lions Clubs International, which was founded in 1917, began its
Sight First Action in 1990 with the aim of helping and assisting
the more than 40 million blind people around the world. So far,
more than one million suffering from cataracts have been lifted
out of darkness with the help of this project.

<HEADLINE> Israeli General Strike Ends, Schools Remain Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- About 300,000 Israeli public
workers ended a general strike Sunday after the main labor
federation reached an agreement over pay raises with the treasury
in the morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that representatives from both the Histadrut,
Israel's labor federation, and the Finance Ministry expressed
satisfactions over the agreement, the details of which were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut had threatened to intensify the strike Monday by
shutting down banks, the Ben-Gurion Airport and the stock
exchange, which have remained open since the general strike was
launched last Thursday, if all-night negotiations with the
treasury failed to reach a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides continued their talks in early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Government offices, railways, ports and other public services
had been closed down since the general strike began last week.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut was demanding an 8-percent wage rise for
public-sector workers, but the Finance Ministry refused to give
salary increases of more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the teachers' strike continued Monday after another
last-minute talks with the treasury broke off Sunday night,
keeping about 2 million pupils out of their schools for the sixth
straight day.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' unions demand that they get payment for the time
they spend with their students on field trips and that the wages
for school principals be raised.
</P>
<P>
But the treasury objects to the requests, saying wage hikes for
the teachers would open the door to raises for other sectors of
the civil service.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar will kick
off a two-day official meeting here later this week to discuss how
to boost trade and investment between the two sides, a Thai
Commerce Ministry official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchapakdi will lead representatives from the government and
private sector to meet a Myanmar delegation led by Trade and
Commerce Minister Maj. Gen. Kyau Than, said the official, who did
not give his name.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also focus on problems concerning border
closure which was done by Myanmar's local authorities without
notifying Thai officials in advance, a ban on some imported goods
by the two countries, inconvenient transportation routes and high
charges of import fees by Myanmar customs officials.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the trade volume between the two
countries stood at 441.54 million U.S. dollars, with Thailand
mostly enjoying a trade surplus. Myanmar had a trade surplus only
in 1993 during which Thailand's export volume was 151 million
dollars against its import volume of 154.8 million dollars,
according to statistics provided by the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During the past six months, the trade volume was 204 million
dollars, a 31.8-percent drop from last year.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Thai Tak Chamber of Commerce has
urged the Myanmar authorities to temporarily open the Thai-Burmese
Friendship Bridge at the Myanmar side on September 9 to facilitate
the transport of goods and people between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Thailand initially agreed to open the bridge on
September 9. However, the local authorities in Myanmar recently
notified Thailand that they wanted to postpone the opening until
September 17, saying they were not yet ready.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Co-Prime Minister
Hun Sen has asked Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to help
solve Cambodia's membership in the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEASN), a Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said Hun Sen has
submitted a letter to Chuan via the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh,
requesting him to ask the ASEAN foreign ministers who will meet in
New York at the end of this month to allow Cambodia to become an
ASEAN member, according to Monday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak said Cambodia wants to take part in the ASEAN foreign
ministers meeting as an observer as a first step towards full
membership.
</P>
<P>
In the letter dated August 31, Hun Sen stated that Cambodia has
taken appropriate measures to respond positively to the ASEAN's
move to become politically and economically stronger to face the
challenges of the 21st century and the trend of regionalization
and globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia has always kept a strong commitment for ASEAN
membership to achieve ASEAN's founder vision of all ASEAN nations
in one ASEAN family," the paper quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this spirit that I have the honor to request your
excellency to give a favorable consideration to the question of
Cambodia's ASEAN membership at the next meeting of ASEAN foreign
ministers," Hun Sen said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen is set to become Cambodia's next prime minister
following the victory of his ruling People's Party in the July 26
elections. The ASEAN has announced its acceptance of the election
results.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups nine countries: Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> More Jews Settle in Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of the Jewish
settlers in the Palestinian territories rose by 12.4 percent in
the 18 months ending June 30, the Israeli Interior Ministry said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The overall number of settlers rose by 8.8 percent between
during 1997, and by another 3.3 percent between the end of 1997
and June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the total 169,339 settlers, 163,173 are living in the
West Bank and 6,166 in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has yet to gather and process the data
regarding July and August, which are traditionally marked by a
higher than average increase in the number of new settlers, as
families take advantage of summer vacation to move before the
beginning of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that half of the increase is due to natural
growth and the remaining because of new residents moving to the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The figures further revealed that 86,202 settlers, slightly
more than half of the overall Jewish population in the
territories, live in only nine of the 144 settlements, including
Ma'aleh Adumim, Ariel, Givat Ze'ev, Efrat, Kiryat Sefer and
Betar.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increase in population in the past one year and a
half was registed in the ultra-Orthodox settlements of Kiryat
Sefer (55 percent) and Betar (35 percent).
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that 80,418 of the settlers live in
what is known as the "depths of the territories," areas not
adjacent to densely populated areas within the Green Line, the
demarcation between Israel and the West Bank after 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
The remaining settlers live in greater Jerusalem or in
settlements along the Green Line in the Sharon area.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that a total of 190 Jewish
settlements exist in the territories, of which 173 are located in
the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen's Residence in Phnom Penh Blasted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 7 (Xinhua) -- An explosion occurred on
Monday morning in Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's Phnom
Penh residence, which caused panic in the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that someone threw three hand-grenades into the
house, and two of them exploded.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who was in Siem Reap when the blast took place at 9:50
a.m. local time, flew back to Phnom Penh by a helicopter at noon.
</P>
<P>
Before departure from Siem Reap, he told reporters that it is
time to take actions against the organizers and leaders of the
demonstrations, which had lasted nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to murder me through terrorism and they even asked
the United States to launch a missile attack on my residence in
Takhmau," said Hun Sen, who had ordered to ban the demonstration
organizers and leaders from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Hok Lundy, national police director-general, said that the
attack was directed against Hun Sen, with an aim to end his
political life. "We are waiting for orders to take powerful
actions, but we will act in accordance with the law," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was the third explosion incident in Phnom Penh after the
National Assembly (parliament) elections were held on July 26.
</P>
<P>
The two major opposition political parties of the Funcipec led
by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the Sam Rainsy Party of Sam Rainsy
have been holding demonstrations and sits-in after the elections.
</P>
<P>
They rejected the election result, claiming that there were
many frauds and demanding Hun Sen's resignation. They also said
that they would not join the new government led by Hun Sen as
prime minister.

BEIRUT -- More than 20 Lebanese, including a woman, have been
arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel and involvement in the
recent killing by Israel of a guerrilla leader, the Daily Star

The arrests followed a security sweep carried out in the past
few days by the Lebanese army in Beirut's southern suburbs, the

<HEADLINE> First Internet Surfers Emerge in China's Poorest Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Xin Xiaodong, 34, has been
spending some of his spare time on the Internet daily just like
other surfers around the world, and is now among the first group
of 22 Internet surfers in one of China's poorest areas.
</P>
<P>
Xin became an Internet user at the end of last year. The number
of 'Net surfers in Xihaigu Prefecture in northwest China's Ningxia
Autonomous Region now accounts for 3 percent of all Internet users
in Ningxia, China's smallest autonomous region (province).
</P>
<P>
China registered about 1.1 million net surfers by the end of
June this year.
</P>
<P>
Xihaigu is an outlying mountainous area with poor roads and
communications facilities, and 500,000 of its needy inhabitants
still live below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
But as part of the rapid economic growth now taking place in
Xihaigu, state-of-the-art telephone exchanges and optic fibre
cables have been installed in the region.
</P>
<P>
A local government official said that only six years ago most
of the local residents in Xihaigu knew little about computers, but
now many households have them.
</P>
<P>
Xin Xiaodong, mathematics teacher at Guyuan Teachers College,
spent 7,600 yuan (910 U.S. dollars) to buy a Compaq computer. This
represents nearly two years' salary.
</P>
<P>
Xin said, "It is worth it to buy the computer and become a
'Net surfer, as I gain more knowledge and my vision is widened,"
adding that his students are more interested in his lessons since he
has been absorbing so much new information over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The websites Xin usually visit are those of Chinese and foreign
university libraries. In the past, he had to go to Yinchuan,
capital of the autonomous region 400 km away from his home, to
find such information.
</P>
<P>
He said, "All I need now is a few stroke on the keyboard of my
computer when I want the latest information in a certain field."
</P>
<P>
The Internet also helps boost local economic growth. The
Haiyuan County government has already begun to issue information
on agricultural cooperation via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Hongxiang Company, a privately-run venture, signed an agreement
with a Shanghai venture to sell 4,000 tons of potatos through the
Internet this past June. Ningxia is famous for its rich-starch
large potatos and Chinese wolfberry fruit.
</P>
<P>
In Guyuan County, the center of Xihaigu Prefecture, three
computer shops have opened along the two-km-long main street, and
advertisements for computer training are popular in newspapers and
in shop-window displays.
</P>
<P>
The Guyuan Daily, the prefecture's only newspaper, will go
on-line this October and is expected to be the first to do so
among the region's media.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Food Exports To Asia Rose Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The lower Australian dollar
has helped buoy Australian food exports to Asia despite lower
demand from the Asia crisis hitting some order books, the
government-funded Supermarket to Asia group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jim Kennedy, executive director of the group, said total food
exports for the financial year of 1997-1998 ending on June 30,
1998, climbed to 18 billion Australian dollars (10.8 billion U.S.
dollars) from 17.2 billion Australian dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But although exports to Asian nations rose slightly to 10.4
billion Australian dollars (5.9 billion U.S. dollars) from 10.2
billion Australian dollars, demand varied dramatically.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are seeing a very mixed response for food sales in
Asia, our figures clearly endorse the need to maintain a focus on
Asia for sales of Australian food products," Kennedy said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said exports of dairy, meat and horticultural products to
Indonesia suffered sharp falls, but demand for the same foods held
up well in nearby Malaysia and even rose in some cases in Japan
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Overall sales to Indonesia, China, Taiwan, the Philippines and
Singapore fell and Indonesia's volatile outlook meant there was
little prospect of the former lucrative market recovering in the
short-term.
</P>
<P>
But Japan remained Australia's biggest customer for a wide
range of products with Australian exports to that destination
rising 8.8 percent over the financial year of 1997-1998 to about 5
billion Australian dollars (2.95 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a further bright spot, Australia's competitiveness had
gained a 25 percent advantage over U.S. products due to the weaker
Australian currency against the U.S. dollar, providing a window of
opportunity for Australia to substantially increase its share of
that key market.
</P>
<P>
As an advisory body to the Australian government on food export
to Asia, Supermarket to Asia was formed in late 1996 to provide
strategic export direction for the food industry.

<HEADLINE> 20 Lebanese Arrested for Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 Lebanese,
including a woman, have been arrested on suspicion of spying for
Israel and involvement in the recent killing by Israel of a
guerrilla leader, the Daily Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed a security sweep carried out in the past
few days by the Lebanese army in Beirut's southern suburbs, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the network was uncovered on a tip from a
man suspected of working for Israel and helping Israeli troops in
the assassination of Hussam Amin, Lebanon's anti-Israeli Amal
Movement southern commander, near the southern city of Tyre last
month.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted security source as saying that the suspects
were said to be providing a Cyprus-based branch of the Israeli
intelligence service, Mossad, with information. But it did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
These latest arrests are considered separate from a spy ring
that the government said it uncovered last month.
</P>
<P>
In that case, 77 Lebanese were charged with passing information
to Israel on Lebanese and Syrian troop movement and activities of
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been engaged in a war of attrition in occupied south
Lebanon with resistance fighters since 1985, when it carved out a
1,200-square-kilometer, self-styled security zone there after two
invasions of Lebanon.

HANGZHOU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China will launch an
exhibition of general merchandise from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1 in Yiwu,
a city in east Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The exposition is being jointly organized by the Zhejiang
Provincial Government, the State Light Industry Bureau and the
State Internal Trade Bureau and supported by the All-China
Federation for Industry and Commerce, the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Because of the effects of economic restructuring and prevailing
global economic sentiments, China's consumer goods market is
weak. The scheduled exhibition is intended to promote sales and
activate the market, according to an official source.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that more than 600 companies and more than
2,000 trade representatives are expected to participate in the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
Yiwu is well known in China as the home of the country's
largest and most developed wholesale sundries market, whose sales
average more than 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) each
year. The market has established economic and trade contacts with
53 countries and regions.

NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland stormed into the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open her
today by beating Nathalie Dechy of France 6-4, 6-4.
</P>

at love to go up 5-4, and then broke again to take the set. Both
players were troubled by the gusting winds as Hingis committed 25
unforced errors and had seven double faults in the opening set
and Dechy made 28 unforced errors.

<P>
Hingis went down a break in the second set, then squandered a
break lead before finally putting away Dechy with a service break
in the final game.
</P>
<P>
Hingis needed one hour and 20 minutes to win the error-filled
match and hardly looked like the number one player in the world
as she bounced her racquet on the court several times in
frustration over mistakes and blasted the ball angrily into the
net after a close call went against her.
</P>
<P>
Hingis had 19 winners and 41 unforced errors while Dechy had
16 winners and 47 unforced errors. Hingis also committed one
double faults.

NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- It took a total of 10 sets
and better than 6 hours, but half of the American contingent in
the men's draw at the U.S. Open was wiped out today.

PRAGUE -- Czech Republic's balance of payments improved visibly
in the first half of the year, a national bank spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During this period, spokesman Pavel Palivec said, the country's
balance of payments deficit dropped to 15.4 billion koruny (551
million U.S. dollars), just one-fourth of the level of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Palivec attributed the improvement to the favorable trend of
foreign trade. Foreign trade deficit was only 35.7 billion koruny
(1.19 billion dollars) in the first six months as against 74.7
billion koruny (2.49 billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
At present, balance of payments deficit accounted for only 1.8
percent of the country's gross domestic product, much lower than
in Poland, Hungary and other Central and East European countries.

JAKARTA -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) hailed the
Indonesian government's efforts in improving its banking system,
IMF director for Asia Pacific Hubert Neiss was quoted by local
newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This was a significant step that has been taken by the
government in its effort to rehabilitate the banking system. I was
glad to hear it," Neiss said upon arrival at Soekarno-Hatta
International airport here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest move to restructure the banking sector, the
Indonesian government froze the operations of Bank Umum Nasional,
Bank Dagang Negara Indonesia and Bank Modern and took over the
ownership of Bank Central Asia, Bank Danamon, Bank PDFCI and Bank
Tiara.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether IMF would suggest further bank closures, Neiss
said he had not yet been informed about the next steps the
Indonesian government would take.
</P>
<P>
"But the government has to continue to improve the banking
sector because this is a prerequisite for recovery," he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai in A Bit to Lure More Overseas Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
city, plans to attract more overseas tourists through a series of
promotions to curb the downward trend of local tourism affected by
the current Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The programs include an international tourism fair, a tourism
festival, a world postal conference, a regional annual conference
on radio and television, and several sports games, according to
the Shanghai Municipal Tourism Commission.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in the first half of the year the
number of overseas tourist arrivals to Shanghai was 729,200, down
seven percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, the tourist commission has sent 100
promotion teams to many foreign countries and regions including
Australia, New Zealand, England, France, Italy and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also have issued about 900,000 tourist guide
brochures and video tapes displaying Shanghai's scenic spots to
overseas agents.
</P>
<P>
Local tourist agents have also worked out many new types of
tours like "being a Shanghainese for one day," "honeymoon in

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis May Last 5 Years: Former NZ Envoy to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis
may last five years and has proved to be more serious than some
experts expected late last year, former New Zealand Ambassador to
China Bryce Harland told a recent meeting of the New Zealand
Institute of International Affairs in Wellington.
</P>
<P>
A prevailing view in December was that the problems in Asia
were part of the trade cycle and would be over in two years or so.
But the financial crisis grew to an economic one, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The general view now is that it will last longer -- more like
five years than two -- and have more serious consequences," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Harland noted that the Asian crisis highlighted the point that
New Zealand could not afford to "have too many eggs in one
basket."
</P>
<P>
"Diversification of markets, and of products, must remain our
strategy: we must be ready to exploit opportunities wherever they
occur," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of markets was essential for the return of
prosperity in Asia and for the continued stability and security of
the Asia-Pacific region, Harland noted.
</P>
<P>
The openness of the American market had been a fundamental
condition for export-led growth in Asia and it had so far helped
limit the tensions that have arisen over trade questions between
the United States and Asian countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Conversely the greatest danger at present is that the Asian
crisis may spark off a new round of protectionism in America,"
Harland said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that trade liberalization was therefore at the heart
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's work for
both political and economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other countries such as New Zealand had
been working hard to keep up the momentum of trade liberalization,
he said, adding New Zealand had succeeded in getting forestry and
fish products included in the package of proposals for early
liberalization due to be considered at the next APEC leaders
meeting in Kuala Lumpur later this year.
</P>
<P>
Harland said it would not be surprising if there was increased
resistance from some of the countries hardest hit by the crisis,
such as Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
By the time when the APEC leaders meeting was held in Auckland
in September 1999, there might well have been some slowing in the
process of liberalization, in individual economies, if not the
membership at large, he said.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The flight data recorder of the
doomed Swissair Flight 111 that crashed off Canadian coast last
week was recovered Sunday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"It was the flight data recorder," confirmed Vic Gerden, lead
investigator for Canada's Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
The device was found about eight kilometers off the Canadian
coast, and it would be sent to Ottawa for analysis by a
multinational team of investigators, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called black box, if in good condition, will provide up
to 100 type of data that would help explain why the Swissair MD-11
jet crashed into the Atlantic, which killed all 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, divers will continue searching for the second black
box, the cockpit voice recorder that contain the last
conversations between the pilot and co-pilot as well as other
noises in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss plane, en route from New York to Geneva, crashed
about 60 kilometers southwest of Halifax, late Wednesday, about 16
minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit.

<P>
The province completed 1.96 billion U.S. dollars of imports and

<TEXT>
<P>
SALZBURG, Austria, September 6 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
foreign ministers Sunday urged Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
form a government and proceed with economic reforms as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal in a document adopted at the end of a
two-day conference in Salzburg, Austria. Russian political and
economic crisis dominated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the constitutional procedures to form a new
government will soon be completed," said the document. "This will
help to reestablish confidence among the Russian people and the
international financial community."
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Council of
Foreign Ministers of the meeting Wolfgang Schuessel said after the
meeting that the EU will continue to help Russia out of its crisis
but will not offer fresh financial aid until the situation clears
up there.
</P>
<P>
"It is our firm conviction that political stability goes hand
in hand with economic stability and constitutes a prerequisite for
economic growth in Russia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the EU will send a "Troika" mission to
Moscow to help solve the problems. The mission will comprise
delegates from Austria, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Russian crisis, which was triggered by rouble's mid-August
nosedive, became a central topic of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
In another document adopted at meeting, the foreign ministers
also agreed to appoint an EU special envoy to help secure a
political settlement to the strife-torn Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As part of the EU sanctions against Yugoslavia, planes from the
Yugoslav Airlines will be banned from landing in EU countries
starting next week, EU commission member in charge of external
affairs Van den Broek said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) not to take
violent actions in its bid to pursue independence, which he said
was against the EU's line.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Yunnan to Expand Coffee Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province will add 3,133 hectares annually to its existing
coffee-growing area within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, by year 2000 the coffee-growing
area in the province will total 1,666 hectares producing 15,000
tons of dried coffee beans annually.
</P>
<P>
About 420 million yuan of investment will be needed to realize
this plan, and local governments at various levels in the province
will also investment in water control facilities in coffee-growing
regions.
</P>
<P>
Many areas of Yunnan are tropical and subtropical, providing
suitable natural conditions for growing small coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
The province, first in China in the production and processing
of coffee beans, now sows 7,333 hectares of coffee and produces
3,500 tons of dried coffee beans annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the International Coffee Organization say that
small coffee beans grown in Yunnan are nearly the equal of the
well-known Columbia coffee beans in quality.
</P>
<P>
The coffee giants Maxwell and Nestle companies have both signed
contracts with Yunnan to provide them with 10,000 tons of beans by
the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
China now consumes about 10,000 tons of coffee beans a year, 70
percent of which are imported. This figure is expected to rise to
20,000 tons by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
While working out a plan for developing its coffee industry,
the Yunnan Provincial Government has decided to set up a center
for coffee research and related processing
technology. Preparations have been made to construct a coffee
bean-trading market, said local sources.

<HEADLINE> Linguist Calls for Intensified Courses on Old Chinese language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Guo Xiliang, a well-known
linguist, has called for further education and research on ancient
Chinese, the world's sole existing ancient language.
</P>
<P>
Guo, a professor at Beijing University, said that ancient
Chinese refers to the language used before the Opium War
(1840-1842). It was developed from ancient written language based
on oral terms in the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The language is still used, and universities re-opened courses
on ancient Chinese in the early 1980s. Students for art degrees
are required to take one-year credit course (four hours per week)
on the subject. But Guo said that is not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that youngsters should learn more about ancient
Chinese in middle school before they enter college, he said, and
being able to read ancient Chinese is very helpful to their work
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, research on ancient Chinese is important to
develop traditional Chinese culture and linguistic theory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Research and education on ancient Chinese is always on the top
of the work list for educational departments not only on Chinese
mainland but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guo, 70, has printed more than one million copies of teaching
material on ancient Chinese for use by students, teachers and
linguistic researchers.
</P>
<P>
The field has attracted the interest and concern of scholars
and experts worldwide. China has hosted dozens of international
seminars on the grammar of ancient Chinese and the relationship
between the Chinese and Tibetan languages.

<HEADLINE> Refuse from Coal Mines Fuels Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Refuse, slurry and other
byproducts of coal-mining used to be occupy thousands of hectares
of farmland, but nowadays Chinese engineers have developed a
technology to turn this waste into electricity.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's No.1 coal producer. In 1997, China turned
out 1.3 billion tons of raw coal which contained more than 100
million tons of refuse.
</P>
<P>
So far, 79 power plants with refuse and slurry as fuel have
been built in China since 1982, when the first such plant was put
into operation in the Pingxiang Coal Mine in east China's Jiangxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
With a combined capacity of 990,000 kilowatts, these power
plants are capable of generating more than 4 billion
kilowatts/hour of electricity annually, by consuming 15 million
tons of refuse and slurry.
</P>
<P>
Some refuse-fueled power stations have even been using dregs to
make cement and bricks.
</P>
<P>
China's success has drawn worldwide attention. In 1983, Chinese
scientists made public their new technology in an academic paper
delivered to a United Nations-sponsored international
symposium. Since then, more than 20 foreign experts have visited
the country to learn about the latest developments.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Save More, Invest Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Residents of this economic
and financial center of China have shown increasing interest in
saving money in their personal accounts and declining interest in
buying stocks, an official sample survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
The value of savings per household increased by 1,047 yuan in
the first seven months of this year, about 4.5 times the
corresponding figure of last year, according to the findings of
the survey, which was conducted by the municipal statistics bureau
and based on 500 urban families.
</P>
<P>
However, the investment in stocks and other securities averaged
merely 130 yuan per family in the first six months, a plunge of 55
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai families also purchased an average of 340 yuan worth
of savings-type insurance in the first half of this year, a surge
of 26 percent on a yearly basis, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Shanghai residents' change of habits in
managing money indicate that people are getting increasingly
aware of financial risks at a time when the Asian financial crisis
still lingers.
</P>
<P>
Residents with unstable incomes have saved more in anticipation
of future spending needs, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
The continued bearish stock market since this year has also
increased investment risks and resulted in many investors losing
money, adversely affecting people's enthusiasm for buying stocks,
they say.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates have put the average total savings value of
Shanghai residents at 20,000 yuan, in addition to an average of
2,000 yuan worth of stocks and securities.

MADRID, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The troops of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) "are ready to begin
intervention" in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the alliance's
secretary-general Javier Solana said in Madrid Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Solana warned that Yugoslavia must immediately stop its
military operations in Kosovo. Otherwise, NATO would intervene,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Solana believed that a diplomatic solution is still
possible. He said that a peace proposal on stabilizing the
situation in Kosovo has been drafted and new contents are expected
to be added in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Solana emphasized that the Kosovo issue must be solved by this
winter. Otherwise, he said, failing to do so will bring even more
serious consequences to the 170,000 displaced people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Yugoslav province, where ethnic Albanians make up
90 percent of the total population. More than 300 people have
been killed since the outbreak of conflict between
separatist-minded ethnic albanians and Yugoslav police.
</P>
<P>
As Yugoslavia is strongly opposed to any foreign interference
in the conflict, the U.S.-led NATO has repeatedly threatened the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Migrate for More Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- "East, west, home is
best." This old saying was deep-rooted among Chinese farmers for
generations.
</P>
<P>
But these days, migration has become such a trend that more and
more farmers are leaving their home villages to find their fortune
in other localities.
</P>
<P>
Lu Guoxin, a young farmer in North China's Hebei Province,
recently joined the growing army of migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, going to town would be a long trip for Lu's
father, but Lu and his fellow villagers decided to go to the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, thousands of miles away from his
home, to grow cotton.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the climate in Xinjiang is the best for cotton
growing and the prices of land and labor there are cheaper. "We
will go to any place where we can make more money," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Provincial Agriculture Department of Hebei
Province said thousands of Hebei farmers are now engaging in
aquaculture or vegetable growing in other provinces, and about
800,000 farmers from other provinces are working as migrant
laborers in Hebei.
</P>
<P>
Instead of blindly rushing into the cities, migrant farmers now
think more about how to give full play to their own advantages.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Dakuang, a farmer from East China's Anhui Province, gave
up his job at a company and went to farm in the suburb of Shanghai
recently.
</P>
<P>
He contracted for 26 mu (about 1.3 hectares) of land and
employed five men as helpers. His annual income has now reached
50,000 yuan, ten times more than he earned at the company.
</P>
<P>
He said, "As a skilled farmer, I can gain more benefits in the
countryside of the developed areas."
</P>
<P>
An official of the Hebei Provincial Government said migrant
work facilitates the flow of labor sources in the countryside and
helps more farmers become rich through their own sweat and toil.

<HEADLINE> Graf Upset by Schnyder in U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Patty Schnyder, the secret
weapon on the women's tour this year, registered the biggest
upset of the U.S. Open tennis championships tonight as she
stunned five-time champion Steffi Graf of Germany 6-3, 6-4 and
advanced to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Ranked 10th in the world, Schnyder took advantage of Graf's
erratic play to win the first three games of the match and held
on to take the first set. She broke Graf in the ninth game of the
second set to go up 5-4 and served it out to complete the upset
in just 59 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Schnyder, a 19-year-old left-hander from Switzerland who plays
in the shadow of countrywoman Martina Hingis, has quietly surged
to the top of the women's tour in titles this year with five. She
will play Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic, world number two
player in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous at the start but when I got early break I
settled down," Schnyder said. "I also was a little nervous at the
end but I relied on my serve to her backhand and it worked."
</P>
<P>
Graf entered the tournament seeded eighth after winning the
Pilot Pen international last week.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just disappointed with the way the match went," Graf
said. "I had been playing better but tonight was a setback. I can
do better than that. I tried to get my feet going in the second
set but I was hitting short and I just couldn't get anything
going."
</P>
<P>
Schnyder won the match on her second match point when Graf
sent a backhand service return long. Just moments before,
Schnyder blew a match point when she was wide with a forehand
down the line with Graf totally out of position.
</P>
<P>
"Your could get intimidated playing her but you have to get
that out of your mind and try to treat her like another opponent,
"Schnyder said.
</P>
<P>
Graf was wild from the outset, making an unforced errors in
losing the first three games, and never seemed to gain control of
her shots.
</P>
<P>
Graf committed 33 unforced errors with only 14 winners, while
Schnyder had 13 winners and 24 unforced errors. Graf also was
unable to capitalize on her chances, winning only one of five
break point opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who won the 1995 and 1996 Opens but missed last year's
event due to an injury, believes Schnyder has what it takes to
become a dominant player on the women's circuit.
</P>
<P>
"She's good. She has a lot of potential. I thin she can be a
top-five player within the next couple of years."

<HEADLINE> Listed Breweries Report Good Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Spirits manufacturers listed
on China's two stock exchanges -- Shanghai and Shenzhen -- have
enjoyed better performance than other listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute their performance to improved standards of
living which have bolstered development of the industry over
the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the output of spirits, including
beer, fruit and rice wines and alcohol has increased at an annual
rate of nearly 50 percent since China launched its reform and
opening drive in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 output for spirits stood at 27 million tons, and it is
expected to reach 29 million tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of April show that 13 companies,
including a rice wine producer, seven liquor distillers, four beer
breweries and a winery, had been listed at the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Annual reports for all producers recorded profits, with average
per share profits standing at 0.54 yuan, almost doubled the average
for all listed companies.
</P>
<P>
The Wuliangye Company, one of the nation's top distillers,
ranked with a profit/earnings rate of 1.42 yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
Other similar companies enjoyed a 22.37 percent increase in
total profits over the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that China's distilleries constantly have
improved products and enjoy stablized output, with the growth of
breweries showing some slowness and rice wine producers enjoying
vast potentials.
</P>
<P>
Local wineries exhibit excellent potential, but have to
undertake technical upgrades in time to face growing competitions
from foreign competitors.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Turkey Deny Building Military Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Turkey renewed their
denial Sunday that they are trying to build a military alliance to
contain other states in the Mideast region.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, and visiting Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz made the denial at a joint press
conference after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
There has never been such an initiative or mechanism of a
Jordanian-Turkish military alliance in any kind and there is no
need to discuss such an issue, said Hassan.
</P>
<P>
What Jordan and Turkey have been doing is just out of "a
concern for the region's security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been making efforts to promote dialog
among all parties concerned and finally help bring "safety and
security" for all the countries in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Turkey, together with Israel, which receive large
economic and military aid from the U.S. every year, have been long
considered as trying to build a military alliance to help the
U.S. control the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the allegation that the U.S. is behind the planned
military alliance, Hassan said that Jordan is "not to be
manipulated" by outside force.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz echoed Hassan's remarks, saying that Turkey and Jordan
share similar views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey does not want to enter any military alliance, instead,
it hopes to build a multilateral conflict-prevention system
through its contacts and cooperation with all the concerned
parties, including Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz arrived here earlier Sunday on a two-day official visit
to discuss military and economic cooperation with Hassan and his
counterpart Fayez Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to Jordan, Yilmaz will go on to the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Supports U.S. Mideast Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said here Sunday that the peace proposal put forward
by the U.S. to call for a 13.1 percent Israeli troops withdrawal
from the West Bank has been the best solution for the peace
deadlock so far.
</P>
<P>
If the peace proposal is accepted by both Israel and the
Palestinians, it will be a "very good opportunity" for both sides
to reactivate the peace process and help bring stability to the
region, said Yilmaz at a joint press conference with Jordanian
Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz added that Turkey also welcomes other peace proposals
put forward by some European countries, including those of France
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. put forward its proposal months ago in an effort to
revive the 18-month deadlock of the peace process. The
Palestinians accepted it, but Israel rejected it on security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is not an actual participant in the activities of
reviving the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, but it keeps
strong military ties with the Jewish state and receives large
military and economic aid from the U.S. annually.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz arrived here earlier Sunday on a two-day official
visit to discuss military and economic cooperation with Hassan
and his counterpart Fayez Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to visit the Palestinian self-rule
areas and Israel later.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Meetings With Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday denied reports that he had held a series
of secret meetings with Palestinians and achieved progress over
the Israeli further redeployment in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu declared as untrue
media reports that he and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker
Ahmed Queria (Abu Ala) had met three times in the last few days,
Israel Radio quoted Israeli Science Minister Silvan Shalom as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after a number of ministers, led by National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, complained that they were
not informed of the reported meetings.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Abu Ala had held 10 rounds of talks with
Israeli officials in the last two weeks, including three with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that the talks had yielded a draft
agreement on some key issues, including the scope of the second
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank, the security
cooperation, the operation of a Palestinian airport and a sea port
in Gaza, and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at the meeting that there was progress in the
negotiations several weeks ago over an Israeli proposal that it
withdraw from 10 percent of the West Bank and turn an extra 3
percent into a "nature reserve," in which Israel will retain full
security responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, nothing new had been produced, the prime
minister said, adding that Israel was now demanding that the two
sides return to the previous framework.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the coming visit to the region by U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross, Netanyahu said Ross would help classify the 3
percent of the West Bank which Israel and the Palestinians have
disputes over its nature.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have demanded that the land be designated as
"Area B" which under signed agreements will eventually become
areas fully controlled by them.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated that an agreement on the second Israeli
withdrawal depended upon the fulfillment by the Palestinians of
their security commitments and "an entire package of reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to arrive in Israel Wednesday to help bridge
the remaining gaps between Israel and the Palestinians. He will
hold separate talks with Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police arrested
eight Palestinians in the Shufat refugee camp Sunday following
Saturday's clashes between Israeli police and refugees, the Israel
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian refugee witnesses said that a large number of
policemen stormed the camp, north of Jerusalem, Sunday morning and
carried away eight young Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police have the duty to maintain order in the camp and
more arrests will be carried out, the Radio quoted Israeli police
officers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted when an Israeli ambulance, which was called
to pick up a refugee patient, refused to enter the camp without
the escort of the Israeli police and the Palestinian died of heart
attack due to the delay of treatment.
</P>
<P>
The angered Palestinians threw stones and firebombs at the
ambulance and Israeli police, and the Israeli police fired back
with rubber bullets and tear gas, in which five Israeli policemen
and 15 Palestinians were injured.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that two of the injured Palestinians
are in critical condition, with a 45-year-old woman shot in the
throat with a rubber bullet.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz arrived Sunday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for a
visit reportedly dealing with the on-going Iranian-Afghan crisis,
the Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz held a meeting shortly after his arrival with his Saudi
counterpart Prince Saud Al-Faisal on a number of regional and
international issues. He also conveyed a message to Saudi First
Deputy Prime Minister Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz from
the Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the Afghan Taliban regime in Riyadh Mawlawi
Shehab Eddine Dalawer disclosed in a statement to Kuna that Aziz's
visit concerned "understanding between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
on the recent crisis between Afghanistan and Iran."
</P>
<P>
Tension has heightened between Tehran and the Afghan Taliban
regime since Iran accused the Taliban of kidnaping 11 Iranian
diplomats and one journalist when the Taliban forces seized the
city of Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban is only recognized by Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, the Iranian government has
recently asked Saudi Arabia to play a go-between role to secure
the release of the kidnaped Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has also held Pakistan, a strong supporter of the
Taliban, responsible for the abduction of the Iranian diplomats
and asked Islamabad to use influence on the Taliban to set them
free.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which has stationed some 70,000 troops close to the
Afghan border, has notified the U.N. Security Council that it
would resort to force to secure the freedom of the diplomats in
accordance with the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating the denial that Taliban was holding any
Iranians, Dalawer said that his government welcomed any mediation
role by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan concerning the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has not officially said whether it will play any
mediation role. But Kuna quoted informed sources as saying that
the Saudi foreign minister assured his Iranian counterpart during
the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban, South Africa, that
Saudi Arabia was ready to help defuse the tension.

<HEADLINE> Opinions Differ on Censure Suggestion in Lewinsky Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Senator Joseph Lieberman,
the Democrat who last week voiced unhappiness with U.S. President
Bill Clinton's handling of the Lewinsky affair, said Sunday he
hoped Clinton would suffer no more than a congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
But Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said that was unlikely
to happen.
</P>
<P>
Another Democrat, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said Congress
should carry out its constitutional duty and decide whether
Clinton should be held accountable for impeachable offenses, but
he said he did not know how he would vote on removing the
president from office.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that he believed
Clinton could restore his credibility with the nation and
successfully finish out his term in office. Lieberman said he
hoped that some kind of "public rebuke," such as a congressional
vote of censure, "will be the maximum we will want to do to end
this sad chapter in our history."
</P>
<P>
But there were lawmakers who suggested that censure wouldn't
suffice.
</P>
<P>
Lott, who again questioned whether Clinton now had the moral
authority to lead the nation, said censure was "not likely"
because "I don't think the circumstances now call for something
that could be interpreted by anybody as nothing."
</P>
<P>
Asked on NBC about Clinton's moral authority, Lott said,"I've
to say obviously there is some doubt about that now, based on what
we already know. But I think we have to wait and see what comes
out in the (independent counsel Kenneth) Starr report."
</P>
<P>
Representative Jim Moran, a Democrat, said on "Fox News Sunday"
that Clinton would be "very fortunate" if all he got was a
congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
"I now don't think that that is really an option," Moran said.
"I think we're bound to go through with impeachment proceedings."
</P>
<P>
Moran said the president's credibility "is severely diminished"
by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican, said it was almost certain
the House of Representatives would consider articles of
impeachment. "I think we have passed the point where we might wish
this away," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
</P>
<P>
Senator Robert Torricelli, a Democrat, said on CBS' "Face the
Nation" that "at the moment" the nation was still distinguishing
between the president's personal problems and his economic and
social accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
Torricelli said a decision by Maryland Governor Parris
Glendening to cancel a fund-raiser with Clinton was "not
indicative of what is happening around the country" and that
candidates for the Senate continued to seek appearances by
Clinton.

CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic

</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The creditor banks have unanimously rejected a request
by the managers of the Jordan Tobacco and Cigarettes Company
(JTCC) for liquidation as a result of sluggish sales and ensuing
heavy debts, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting, major creditor banks, including the Arab
Bank, the Jordan Investment and Finance Bank, the Grindlays Bank,
the Jordan and Gulf Bank and the Cairo Amman Bank, voiced their
refusal of JTCC's liquidation request.
</P>
<P>
The banks are scheduled on Sunday to ask the government to

MARAKESH, MOROCCO -- A World Bank (WB) working paper submitted
to the Mediterranean Development Forum estimates the cost of
projects for the combat of poverty in the Middle East and Africa
at about 14 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday's Arab daily "Al Hayat," in the working
paper, the WB stated that providing financial services to the poor
will probably help increase family income, reduce unemployment and
create demand for goods and services particularly foodstuffs,
education and health.
</P>
<P>
The forum has examined for three consecutive days the role of
non-governmental organizations, the civil community and the
private sector in combating poverty prevailing in the Middle East
and Africa.

<HEADLINE> More Jordanians in Extreme Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanians living in extreme
poverty climbed to 8 to 11 percent of Jordan's total population in
1997, a 6.5 to 9.5 increase compared with the figures in 1986,
according to a census published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, with a population of 4.6 million, families earning
less than 106 U.S. dollars a month are classified as extreme poor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the census, conducted by the state-run Irbid
University, said that 21 to 22 percent of Jordanians, whose
families have a monthly income of below 170 dollars, lived in
absolute poverty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times has reported that almost a
third of the kingdom`s total population live under the general
poverty line, with the family income below 210 dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The census report attributed the expanded poverty to a
snail-paced regional economy, which, in fact, hindered Jordan's
economic development, incurring more unemployment and decreasing
people's income by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's annual population growth rate is 3.6 percent, among
the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The official unemployment rate in 1998 is put at 15 percent
while at 26 percent by independent sources.

<HEADLINE> Turkish-Israeli Military Cooperation Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said here Sunday that the Turkish-Israeli military
cooperation "is not directed against any country in the region,"
but only for the sake of regional "safety and security."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel expect that such cooperation will help
achieve a "comprehensive peace" in the region and then bring
about a multilateral conflict-prevention system, said Yilmaz at a
joint press conference with Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, the
Regent.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has signed two military cooperation agreements with
Israel since 1996. It allows Israeli jets to use its airspace for
training, while Israel upgrades Turkey's F-4 fighters under a
contract worth 630 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Israeli military cooperation incurred harsh
criticism from some Arab countries who insist that it harms
regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries also accused Jordan, Israel and Turkey of
trying to build a military alliance to control regional
situation. Both Jordan and Turkey rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, Israel and Turkey are usually considered as military
partners that are shouldered with the common obligation of
helping the U.S. stabilize the region. All of them receive large
quantities of economic and military aid from the U.S. on annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz arrived here earlier Sunday on a two-day official
visit to discuss military and economic cooperation with Hassan
and his counterpart Fayez Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to visit the Palestinian self-rule areas and
Israel later.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Exports to New Markets Up by 255 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's exports to its
non-traditional markets, mostly in eastern Europe and Africa,
increased by 255 percent in the first half of this year over the
same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's exports to Eritrea, Portugal, Uganda, Bosnia,
Ethiopia, Hungary, Tanzania and New Zealand reached a total of
27,548.5 million Jordanian dinars (38,910.31 million U.S. dollars)
in the first six months of this year, said the report released by
the state-owned Export Development and Commercial Centers
Corporation (JEDCCC).
</P>
<P>
The exports increased by such a large margin because many new
commodities like medicine, textiles, detergents and processed
foodstuff were added to the previous year's list which included
phosphate, potash and cement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increase could also be attributed to the efforts made by
the JEDCCC together with Jordan's private sector to tap the
potential of the relatively new markets in eastern Europe and
Africa, it added.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the kingdom's trade development strategy in the
future, the report said that Jordan will further develop the
non-traditional markets, while trying to reverse a sliding trend
of its exports to the traditional markets.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's traditional markets are mainly in the Middle East,
which include Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Syria,
Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports to its traditional markets fell by some 6
percent to 381 million dinars (538 million dollars) during the
first five months in 1998 from the same period last year, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decrease of Jordan's exports to its
traditional markets to Amman's perceived tilt over Iraq during
the 1990-91 Gulf crisis which angered Jordan's neighbors.

<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal cities are
aiming at developing their port-based economies on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
As the largest port in China, Shanghai has long handled more
than 150 million tons of freight a year.
</P>
<P>
"Without the support of sea transportation, Shanghai could
never become an economic, financial and trading center on a world
scale in the coming century," said Han Zheng, deputy mayor of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Other major ports are also developing international trade and
economic and technological cooperation. They have set up economic
developmental areas and high-technology zones near their ports.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, a major port in North China, is launching a large
project to form a new coastal area based on its port, a
development area and free trade zone, which includes some
industrial programs involving large amounts of foreign investment
from transnational companies such as Dupont.
</P>
<P>
The ports of Lianyungang and Rizhao each handle more than 20
million tons of freight a year. While expanding the size of their
ports, the two cities are accelerating the construction of the
infrastructure and some important industrial projects near the
harbor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate to Take Up Campaign Finance Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott Sunday promised to allow the Senate to take up
legislation that would change campaign finance laws, predicting
that the measure would come up for a vote as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
The bill was abandoned earlier this year by the Senate after
supporters failed to bring the issue before the full body. During
a news conference last week, Lott omitted the topic as he outlined
his priorities for the final weeks of Congress.
</P>
<P>
In August, the House of Representatives voted 252-279 to
approve a similar campaign finance bill, giving hope to the Senate
measure's two primary sponsors, Senator John McCain, a Republican,
and Senator Russell Feingold, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would ban much of the so-called "soft money" --
unregulated big donations that now flows indirectly into
campaigns. Lott said that after the Senate rejected the bill
earlier this year, McCain agreed not to resurrect the issue. Last
month's passage of the House bill, however, changed that.
</P>
<P>
"He (McCain) maintains that the House voted, circumstances have
changed and he would like another vote," Lott said on NBC's "Meet
the Press." "I think that under the circumstances we should do
that and, yes, there will be another vote, yes, probably next
week."
</P>
<P>
However, Lott cast doubt on whether there were enough votes for
the measure to pass. "I don't believe that the consensus is there
yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
During a news conference last week McCain and Feingold said
that they would force a Senate vote on their bill by attaching it
to whatever legislation lawmakers happen to be considering.
</P>
<P>
Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat and a senior member of the panel
that investigated campaign finance abuses, said that he had no
problem advocating a "dramatic, old-fashioned filibuster" if
Republicans tried to block a vote.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Northwest, Pilots Negotiators Meet Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal mediator
Sunday med separately with negotiators for Northwest Airlines
Corp. and the striking pilot union in an effort to restart
contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The 6,200 pilots from the airline went on strike on August 29
after almost two years of negotiations failed to yield a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke off over wage increases and job security. A key
difference between the two sides is that the union was asking for
the "industry leading" wages, but the company refused to accept
it, arguing that it was only the fourth major airline in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The pilots, along with five other unions negotiating with
Northwest, made concessions to pull the airline back from the
brink of bankruptcy in 1993 and now want to share in the record
profits the airline has posted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The strike affects about 150,000 passengers daily, especially
in Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis where Northwest controls 75
percent of flights.
</P>
<P>
The strike forced Northwest to cancel 1,700 daily flights
through the busy Labor Day holiday and in-bound flights from
Europe and Asia through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first strike at Northwest in 20 years, and the first
to shut down a major U.S. airline since 1993, when flight
attendants at American Airlines went on strike.

<HEADLINE> Poland Beat Bulgaria and Latvia Stun Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Poland blanked Bulgaria 3-0 to
send a warning to Group Five rivals England at their opening
qualifying match of the European Soccer Championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another match which produced astonishing result
,Latvia defeated Norway 3-1 in a Group Two match.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, like Latvia and Poland, another side who failed to
make France 98, also got off to a flying start by registering an
away win of their own, coming from a goal down to beat Hungary
3-1 in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
Poland's convincing 3-0 away defeat of new-look Bulgaria
prompted home fans to call for the resignation of coach Hristo
Bonev after the match. The Polish team took a surprise lead with
their first shot on target through Sylwester Csereszewski.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarians, captained by Hristo Stoichkov, kept up the
pressure in the group five match but again Csereszewski
capitalized on a defensive mistake.
</P>
<P>
Tomasz Iwan struck the third goal two minutes after the break,
a goal which almost paralyzed the Bulgarians for the rest of the
match despite Stoichkov's solo efforts.
</P>
<P>
In Oslo, Latvian striker Marians Pahars scored after just 11
minutes from a low cross against the run of play but Norway's
Stale Solbakken equaliszed six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Latvia restored their lead with a goal from Andrejs Stolcers
just after the break and Mihails Zemlinskis effectively settled
the outcome just after the hour with a penalty.
</P>
<P>
Defeat was especially bitter for new Norwegian coach Nils
Johan Semb in his first major test since taking over from Egil
Olsen, a national hero for leading Norway to the World Cup finals
twice in a row.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things went wrong at the wrong time," said Semb."We
made some serious errors that gave them three goal chances and
they scored from them...We should have scored a lot more than one
goal from 15 chances."
</P>
<P>
In the same group on Sunday, Greece and Slovenia drew 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, slammed by their fans in the wake of their failure
to qualify for the World Cup, had a shock in Budapest when Ferenc
Horvath scored on the half hour for Hungary.
</P>
<P>
But Ricardo Sa Pinto marked his return to international
football after a twelve month ban with the equalizer on 56
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sa Pinto, suspended from football for punching former
Portuguese coach Artur Jorge and who joined Spanish side Real
Sociedad in the summer, then cracked home a second goal in the
76th minute.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina star Rui Costa completed the scoring six minutes
from time.
</P>
<P>
Romania are Group Seven favorites, however, after opening with
a 7-0 crushing of Liechtenstein on Saturday, while Slovakia beat
Azerbaijan 3-0.
</P>
<P>
In Group Eight, where Ireland surprised World Cup
semi-finalists Croatia 2-0 on Saturday in Dublin, Macedonia
thrashed Malta 4-0.
</P>
<P>
And in Scotland's Group Nine, the Czech Republic just crept
past the Faroe Islands 1-0 with a Vladimir Smicer goal six
minutes from the end.

LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Satellite broadcaster BSkyB
confirmed on Sunday it was in discussions with Manchester United
soccer club which could lead to a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said Sky,
40 percent owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, could offer up
to 575 million pounds (about 960 million U.S. dollars) for the
most famous club in the English premier league.
</P>

"The Board of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc has noted the
recent press speculation, and confirms that it is in discussions
which may or may not lead to an offer being made for Manchester
United Plc," the brief statement said.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB has held exclusive rights to the broadcasting of the
premier league, contested by the country's leading 20 teams,
since its inaugural season in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, it paid 647 million pounds (1.10 billion
U.S.dollars) to renew those rights until 2001.

foodstuff were added to the previous year's list which included
phosphate, potash and cement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increase could also be attributed to the efforts made by
the JEDCCC together with Jordan's private sector to tap the
potential of the relatively new markets in eastern Europe and
Africa, it added.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the kingdom's trade development strategy in the
future, the report said that Jordan will further develop the
non-traditional markets, while trying to reverse a sliding trend
of its exports to the traditional markets.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's traditional markets are mainly in the Middle East,
which include Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Syria,
Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports to its traditional markets fell by some 6
percent to 381 million dinars (538 million dollars) during the
first five months in 1998 from the same period last year, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decrease of Jordan's exports to its
traditional markets to Amman's perceived tilt over Iraq during
the 1990-91 Gulf crisis which angered Jordan's neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Cast Doubt Over U.S. Envoy's Upcoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have pinned
little hope on U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross' upcoming
Mideast trip, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Qadoumi, chairman of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization Political Department Sunday cast doubt over Ross'
ability to broker a Palestinian-Israeli deal on the Israeli
reployment in the West Bank, saying "Ross is a failure."
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Ross has come to the Middle
East, but the peace process which has been stalled since March
last year, has made little progress.
</P>
<P>
The senior Palestinian official said Israel does not want peace
and keeps on raising tensions in the Mideast region, the senior
Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
Qadoumi made the remarks after a meeting with Arab League (AL)
Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Ross' new Mideast trip will begin next week with an aim to
narrow differences between the two sides on a U.S. initiative for
an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank in
exchange for Palestinian security guarantee.
</P>
<P>
If Ross secures a breakthrough, the leaders of the two sides
would meet to seal a long-delayed deal on redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Though signs of some progress emerged this week after Clinton
telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, neither
side confirmed any substantial headway.
</P>
<P>
Referring to talks with Abdel-Meguid, Qadoumi said they
discussed means of mobilizing Arab efforts to break the deadlocked
peace process, the agenda of the upcoming session of the AL
Ministerial Council scheduled for September 16 in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Qadoumi said he also briefed the secretary on the outcome of
the Non-Alignment Movement summit held recently in Durban, South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Lebanon to Set up Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Lebanon will sign an
agreement on the establishment of a free trade zone between them
this week, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be sealed when the Egyptian-Lebanese Higher
Ministerial Committee meet in Cairo on Wednesday under the
co-chairmanship of Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri and
his Lebanese counterpart Rafik al-Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili said Sunday
after being sanctioned during the Higher Committee meetings, the
agreement should be ratified by the parliaments of both states
before putting it into force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Duing the first Egyptian-Lebanese Higher Committee session in
Cairo in March 1996, two agreements on protecting and encouraging
investments and preventing dual taxation were signed. Lebanese
investments in Egypt have reached 115 projects worth 55 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese side wishes to market apples in Egyptian markets
within the framework of goods exempted from custom fees and Egypt
wants to have its potatoes treated similarly in Lebanon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to Lebanon reached 109.7 million dollars last
year, while imports stood at 59.4 million dollars, according to
Gowaili.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exports to Lebanon potatos, rice, onions, polyester and
railway roads, while Lebanon exports to Egypt apples and
publications, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has forged free trade agreements with Morocco and Tunisia
and plans to conclude similar pacts with Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain
and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the Arab common market, an Arab free trade area
has been kicked off since the beginning of this year, paving the
way for complete liberalization by the end of 2007 by eliminating
non-tariff barriers and phasing off tariffs.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor Union
reiterated on Sunday that if no progress is made in the talks with
the Finance Ministry, it will intensify the public sector strike.
</P>
<P>
Labor Union Chairman Amir Perez, who is scheduled to hold
negotiations with Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman on Sunday night,
told Israel Radio that the strike might spread to other sectors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the Finance Ministry does not make compromise,
the strike will spread to banks and electricity corporations.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Union launched the strike on Thursday in protest
against the low wage of the workers in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The strike kept 300,000 workers away from their jobs and
resulted in the closure of all government offices, post offices,
railways, ports and some hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry had agreed to a 1.4 percent wage
increase, while the Labor Union demands an 8 percent rise.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Cabinet Approves Measures on Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait decided on Sunday
to adopt DNA test as an unwavering basis to grant nationality to
illegal residents, known as Bedoun, or stateless.
</P>
<P>
This is in a four-point plan approved by Kuwait's council of
ministers to solve the outstanding Bedoun problem, said the Kuwait
News Agency (Kuna).
</P>
<P>
During its weekly session, the council also decided to
intensify the "checking and confirmation of the data, documents
and testimonials that verify applications for nationality by
resorting to all means possible."
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration of the human perspective, the
council decided to prolong the easing of facilities for those
seriously seeking to amend their legal status, Kuna said.
</P>
<P>
The Bedoun problem has been a tough issue facing the Kuwaiti
government for years. The council of ministers set the year 2000
as the deadline to issue citizenship to Bedouns.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the Kuwaiti government will punish any
violators of the nationality law after the deadline.
</P>
<P>
According to an official study submitted to the cabinet last
week, there are approximately 120,000 Bedouns residing in Kuwait
at present, or some 17 percent of Kuwaiti population. Many Bedouns
have dumped their passports in the hope of obtaining Kuwaiti
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The study divided Bedouns into several groups: Bedouns of
Kuwaiti fathers, Bedouns of Kuwaiti mothers, Bedouns with
relatives, Bedouns holding registration documents as proof and
Bedouns without documents of proof.
</P>
<P>
Since the last category of Bedouns are believed to be
concealing their original nationalities, they are subject to
deportation.

<HEADLINE> Premiership Untroubled by Murdoch Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Media giant Rupert Murdoch's
planned take-over of Manchester United is unlikely to face strong
opposition from the football authorities, according to English
Premier League chief executive Peter Leaver on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had "no real reaction at all" to Murdoch's
plans.
</P>
<P>
"That is a matter for him," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If he acquires a club which is already a member of another
club, called the FA Premier League, it will remain within that
club.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to take a look at the terms of the offer," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I can't see why there should be an objections."
</P>
<P>
The news that Murdoch may buy the club comes only one week
after Premiership clubs expressed misgivings about the proposed
European Super League.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour discussion last week the clubs - including
Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, who have already been
invited to join the Super League - agreed that all future
discussions on the subject will be conducted through the Premier
League rather than in secret by a few select clubs.
</P>
<P>
British sports minister Tony Banks said Murdoch's plans could
have serious implications for the sport as a whole and he cast
doubt on whether the deal would go through without being handed
to the Office of Fair Trading.
</P>
<P>
"Television is relying more and more on sport to sell
advertising," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you buy up the biggest football club in the country then
clearly the implications for commercial policy are fairly
profound,"he said.

<HEADLINE> Gross Said He was Sacked by Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Tottenham coach
Christian Gross has announced that he did not quit his job as
Tottenham coach,but was sacked.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference organized by Gross himself on Sunday, the
Swiss manager insisted that his nine months in English football
had been a success and said he held no grudge against the club.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go, I had to go," Gross said. "There are different
reasons but I am not the person to say why.
</P>
<P>
"Now, after three games, I think it is too short to judge me
and decide my fate. It is not a failure for me to be judged after
three games, especially after a big win at Everton.
</P>
<P>
"I am not angry, I am disappointed, and I am now looking
forward.In my managerial career I have been very successful up to
now. This is the first time results have not gone well for me but
I have to deal with this in a positive way and I will do so."
</P>
<P>
In a bizarre move, the man responsible for Gross'
departure,Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar, sat alongside the former
Grasshoppers manager to explain the club's actions.
</P>
<P>
"Christian's departure is for internal reasons," Sugar said.
</P>
<P>
"I think one has to say we were faced with an untenable
situation created, with all due respect, by the media, and we the
board felt that Christian - no matter how professional or how
good he is - had been destroyed by the media, it is as simple as
that."
</P>
<P>
Although there have been stories of unrest between Gross and
his players, he insisted he did not regret the way he had carried
out his job.
</P>
<P>
"Since I arrived I have tried to do the best I can for
Tottenham and I have always been guided by this vision to do the
best I can for the club.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I made too many mistakes and I am leaving
behind a club in an excellent mood, otherwise we wouldn't have
had such a big result at Everton, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle Deny Parma Move for Shearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle have dismissed
reports that Italian side Parma have launched a fresh bid to sign
Alan Shearer.
</P>
<P>
Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport said the Serie A club
had stepped up their attempts to reunite the England captain with
former Magpie Faustino Asprilla.
</P>
<P>
The paper claimed Parma, who reportedly had an original offer
of 15 million pounds turned down in June, reopened negotiations
after Shearer's future was thrown into doubt following the
arrival of a new manager, Ruud Gullit.
</P>
<P>
But Newcastle are insisting that Shearer is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
The club reiterated chief executive Freddie Fletcher's summer
statement that their prime asset is not for sale at any price and
refused to comment further on the reports.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, along with veteran defender Stuart Pearce and club
captain Rob Lee, is known to have met up with new boss Gullit
last week to discuss the future of the club in the wake of Kenny
Dalglish's dismissal.
