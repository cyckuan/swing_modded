<HEADLINE> Tunisia to Raise Grain Products Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tunisian government has
decided to raise the sale prices of some grain products as of
Thursday in a bid to further cut down expenditures on the Public
Fund for Compensation (PFC).
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the price of pastry will rise by 10 to 20
pennies (some 0.9 to 1.8 U.S. cents), the Tunisia Africa News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The PFC supervises the distribution of staples whose costs hit
336 million dinars (305.45 million U.S. dollars), accounting for
1.3 percent of the Gross National Product (GNP) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The PFC will continue to provide subsidy to grain products,
edible oil and milk that absorb 95 percent of PFC's expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The prices of subsidized foodstuffs, including grain products,
in Tunisia are the lowest among the Mediterranean basin
countries.

<P>
ATHENS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Health Ministry
Wednesday urged citizens to donate blood at state hospitals for
Turkish earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement, the ministry said that giving blood would be
the greatest proof of Greek humanitarian feelings towards the
sufferings of their fellow humans in neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The competent services at hospitals throughout the country had

<HEADLINE> EU Population Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
population in its 15-member region grew slightly last year to
stand at 375,329,400.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent natural increase was 285,400, considerably less
than net migration of 461,200 in EU's 15 countries, Austria,
Belgium, Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Portugal and Greece,
EU said in a report published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"All EU member states witnessed a rise in total population,
except Germany with a 19,400 fall, made up of a 70,200 drop in its
natural increase balanced by 50,800 net migrants," the EU
statistics office, Eurostat, said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many central and eastern European countries again saw
population falls, either from natural causes or net migration
outflows. For example, the Ukraine's population fell by 394,300 --
a 300,700 natural decrease with net migration outflow, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the whole of 15 EU countries accounted for only 1.0
percent of the world population increase last year. This compares
with 21.7 percent for India and 13.2 percent for China, the
Eurostat said.

CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed on
Wednesday in a road accident in southern Egypt, the country's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The deaths were caused when a tractor and two trucks collided
on a desert road near Menia, capital of the governorate of Menia,
220 kilometers south of Cairo, security sources said.

<P>
The security sources did not give the cause of the accident,
which they said is under investigation. They did not specify the
number of the people in the vehicles, either.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt due to high speed,
violation of traffic rules and regulations, and poor road
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released recently by Egypt's National Center for
Criminal and Sociological Research show that up to 6,000 people
die and 30,000 others are injured annually in traffic accidents in

NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's former Energy Minister
Chris Okemo was Wednesday appointed new head of the Finance
Ministry in a bid to pull this east African country out of an
economic morass.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Francis Masakhalia was transferred to
the Energy Ministry in the swap in a minor cabinet shake-up, which
was ordered by President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
Okemo pledged to impose fiscal discipline and curb spending so
as to reverse the current economic decline at a news conference
here shortly after his appointment.
</P>
<P>
"We have to check runaway public expenditure, live within our
means and definitely we will turn the economy around," he said.
</P>
<P>
Okemo, a 52-year-old economist, said that his priority was to
instill discipline by ensuring that the governmental ministries be
kept within their budgets.
</P>
<P>
Any ministry officials found guilty of irregular spending will
be punished, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has been in a recession since 1997 when the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) halted a loan facility in
protest against corruption and poor governance in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth dropped from 4.6 percent in 1996 to 2.3 percent
in 1997 and 1.8 percent last year. It is predicted to grow at 1.6
percent this year.

<HEADLINE> SADC Pledges Support for Angolan Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Wednesday pledged its support for the Angolan
government in dealing with the domestic affairs of the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected SADC Chairman, Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano made the pledge at a press conference here after the
closing ceremony of the 19th SADC summit in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted that the angolan government has not asked for
arms or troops from the regional organization.
</P>
<P>
But the government of President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos did ask
for moral, political, diplomatic and humanitarian support from the
SADC, Chissano noted.
</P>
<P>
The SADC support is aimed at helping the Angolan government
overcome the difficulties it is facing so that the country can
achieve peace as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian aid will include food and medicine, said the
Mozambican president.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old civil war has plunged the country into dire
difficulties, creating some 200 million refugees. According to
the World Food Program (WFP), Angola need some 13,000 tons of food
aid each month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Dos Santos said in Maputo Tuesday that his
government will not negotiate with the UNITA rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government has always following the
U.N.-brokered 1994 Lusaka peace accord while Savimbi has violated
it by renewing the war.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace agreement should be the base of any new peace
initiative for Angola, Dos Santos pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the possibility of talks with the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) at a time when the rebels
are not so strong as it was.
</P>
<P>
The president said that it is the obligation of his government
to defend its people against the rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC) Wednesday signed two
protocols on wildlife conservation, law enforcement and health
cooperation, and a declaration on promoting productivity.
</P>
<P>
The leaders signed the documents at a summit here aimed at
resolving regional conflicts and boosting economic development.
</P>
<P>
The protocol on Wildlife conservation and law enforcement is
aimed at establishing within the region and within the framework
of the respective national laws of each member state, common
approaches to the conservation and sustainable use of wildlife
resources and to assist with effective enforcement of the laws
governing those resources.
</P>
<P>
"A protocol on health could not have come at a better time"
when there are so many challenges in health sector in the region,
among which AIDS is on top of the list, a SADC official said.
</P>
<P>
The protocol deals with ways to better use of the health
resources to make a healthier population in the region.
</P>
<P>
A healthy population is critical for sustainable human
development and increased productivity in southern Africa which
continues to have high HIV prevalence rate.
</P>
<P>
The protocol on health encourages cooperation among member
states in addressing health problems and challenges facing them.
</P>
<P>
The declaration on productivity called on member states to
adopt more rational national and regional policies that will
improve productivity so as to make the region more productive and
more competitive.

<HEADLINE> Italy Offers Aid to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy has pledged to grant
three billion liras (about 1.7 million U.S. dollars) to Ethiopia
to help the country overcome food shortage, the Italian embassy
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its press statement, the embassy said the Italian government
has also decided to give one billion liras (about 560,000 U.S.
dollars) in relief assistance to the people who became displaced
as a result of 15-month Ethio- Eritrea war.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the aid will be defined in consultation with
the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission, which is
coordinating emergency relief operations in the country, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Italian embassy also announced that its government
would grant 1.6 million liras (about 890,000 U.S. dollars) to the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in support the
Somali and Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian food crisis emerged from March of this year
following months of drought in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in some parts of Ethiopia, river beds,
which normally can only be crossed by boat in June, became
completely dry, and were being used by children as make-shift
football pitches.
</P>
<P>
As most crops have been impossible to grow, some villages were
reportedly deserted by their inhabitants as they search for food.
</P>
<P>
As the number of people affected by the drought rises up to 4.6
million, different countries, including the United States,
Holland, Canada, Japan and China, have made donations to the Horn
of Africa country in the past few months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Online Ad Spending Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Online advertising is
expected to grow to 11.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2003, surpassing
dollars spent in some traditional media, according to new research
released Wednesday by an Internet commerce research firm.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter Communications said that ad spending will increase 40
percent over the next four years, with financial services,
automotive, and media ventures leading the spending.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier Jupiter report, in 1998, online
advertising increased 34 percent over 1997 to reach 1.92 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Driven by growing online population, the rise in time spent
online, and increasing digital commerce adoption, online
advertising revenues have already surpassed those for outdoor
advertising and will exceed spending for cable advertising and
equal roughly three-quarters of today's radio spending by 2003,
according to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
Car companies, media firms and financial services companies
will account for nearly half of online ad spending in 2003. But
packaged goods companies, whose ad spending will account for 18
percent of offline dollars, will only contribute seven percent of
online dollars by that time.
</P>
<P>
"Online advertising will serve as a catalyst for change in the
traditional ad business," Jupiter said. "Media integration and the
inevitable erosion of traditional markets will be more important
than the effects of online ad dollar growth."
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. research firm, Forrester Research, estimated last
week that global spending for online advertising will reach 33
billion dollars by 2004, one-third of which will be spent outside
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Forrester projected that U.S. online ad spending will hit 22
billion dollars by 2004. This figure represents 8.1 percent of
projected expenditures for traditional advertising -- exceeding
magazine, yellow pages and radio spending.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the Internet will siphon 27 billion
dollars or 10 percent of all U.S. ad spending -- away from
traditional media, according to Forrester.
</P>
<P>
Outside the United States, online ad spending will increase
from 502 million dollars in 1999 to 10.8 billion dollars in 2004,
capturing 33 percent of global spending, Forrester estimated. In
Europe, online ad will total 5.5 billion dollars in 2004,
representing 5.1 percent of Europe's ad spending. The Asia-Pacific
nations will spend an additional 3.3 billion dollars, or six
percent of traditional ad spending in the region. Latin America
will grow to 1.6 billion dollars in 2004, or 4.8 percent of
regional spending.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Health Insurance Company Founded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Health
Insurance Company (KHIC) was formed on Wednesday in preparation
for the enforcement of a government health insurance program for
the first time in the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
Fahd Al-Rajaan, the director of the Public Authority for
Social Security, said the founding of the KHIC was aimed at easing
the pressure on the state budget while improving health services.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the company would take about a year before
presenting a comprehensive health insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti parliament endorsed early this year the
government-proposed Health Insurance Scheme, which encourages the
private sector to participate in the country's health services.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, expatriates, which account for over 60
percent of Kuwait's population, will be obliged to buy health
insurance before they can obtain a resident identification card
or have it extended.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, along with Kuwaitis, were receiving free medical
services before August 17, when Kuwait began to impose symbolic
charges on expatriates visiting public clinics and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's former Health Minister Dr. Adel Al-Sabih had said
that by implementing the scheme, the government is expected to
receive a revenue of 50 million Kuwaiti dinars (165 million
U.S. dollars) a year.

MAPUTO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's President Joaquim
Chissano was elected on Wednesday as the new chairman of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Chissano takes over from South African President Thabo Mbeki to
lead the 14-member group into the 21rst century.
</P>
<P>
SADC leaders are meeting at a summit to address problems
ranging from political issues and military strifes to economic
development and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The organization, originally known as the Southern African
Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), was formed in Zambian
capital Lusaka on April 1, 1980. On August 17, 1992, the SADCC
member states signed a treaty establishing the Southern African
Development Community, which replaced the SADCC.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Chief Confident of Success in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
said Wednesday that he is confident that the Russian Armed Forces
will eliminate the gangs of Islamic extremists in Daghestan very
shortly.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev made the statement during a trip to the republic that
borders the breakaway Chechnya region to coordinate the operation
of all defense and security agencies, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have made certain that the units have sufficient strength,
training and armament to carry out the operation. The plans have
been approved. Very little time is needed to prepare for bringing
the operation to completion within a very short period," Sergeyev
said.
</P>
<P>
Numerous Daghestanis serving in the Russian army in other parts
of the country are asking their commanders to let them take part
in the fighting in their home republic, he said. This could be
allowed in the near future, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The militants commanded by Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev
infiltrated into several Daghestani villages on August 7,
intensifying tension in the region. Federal authorities launched
massive attacks on the rebels last Friday and have so far
reportedly killed 450 militants.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Denies Barak Supports Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli minister Wednesday
denied reports that Prime Minister Ehud Barak had asked
U.S. congressmen to stop pressuring President Bill Clinton to move
the U.S. embassy before the completion of Israeli-Palestinian
permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, minister at the Prime Minister's Office, told a
special parliamentary session that Barak was misquoted in an
Israel Radio report which said he told visiting U.S. Senator Jim
Bunning and Representative Frank Lobiondo Monday to back down
from pressuring Clinton to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak said moving the embassy at the current stage would
incite Palestinian violence, the report said, adding he has also
ordered an investigation over how his words had been leaked out,
Israel Radio said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a fierce debate in the Knesset (Parliament), interim leader
of the right-wing Likud party Ariel Sharon charged that the
report showed Barak was willing to partition Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A leading pro-Israel lobbyist group in the U.S. has decided
to suspend its effort to lobby for the relocation of the
embassy aimd the news, saying the Congress should not be more
aggressive than an Israeli prime minister on the issue of
Jerusalem, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan control
in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, claiming
the whole city as its "undivided and eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
The international community, however, does not recognize
Israel's claim over Jerusalem. Most countries locate their
embassies in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, the U.S. Congress approved a bill requiring
the U.S. embassy to be moved to Jerusalem by May 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has since resisted the pressure by
using waivers the bill granted the president to postpone the move
on grounds of national security.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, together with other sensitive issues
like a possible Palestinian state, is supposed to be discussed
in the final-status talks according to signed Israeli-Palestinian
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Barak has expressed hope that Israel and the Palestinians would
work out a framework of the final-status talks by February
2000. The talks, however, have yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
Although considered moderate on the Israeli-Arab peace process,
Barak sticks to hard lines on the issue of Jerusalem as
various Israeli governments have done, insisting that Jerusalem
should remain the "capital of Israel" under a permanent peace
treaty with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of an
independent Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Russia Attacks Albanian Extremists for Dishonoring  U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia Wednesday voiced
its concerns over the slow pace in disarming the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) and said that "the actions of Albanian
extremists challenge the international community and constitute a
gross violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244," which recognizes the U.N. authority and the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement, contained in a press release issued here by the
Russian Mission to the United Nations, came as the U.N. Security
Council is meeting in a closed-door session to discuss the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow is concerned about the fact that the process of
disarmament of Kosovo militants is proceeding very slowly," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"There are all grounds to believe that a considerable part of
the arms subject to surrender by the sixtieth day of the
demilitarization (August 10, 1999) will be withheld," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"There is risk that the agreement on the eventual disarmament
of Albanian extremists in Kosovo within the 90-day period will not
be implemented either, while the arms we are talking about are
being actively used by the militants to establish their own order
in that autonomous territory of Yugoslavia," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the clear demands of the Security Council, there
is continued rampant violence in Kosovo, and a growing number of
killings of civilians, arson, and looting of the property of the
non-Albanian population," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, 'ethnic cleansing' is in full swing in Kosovo," the
statement said. "This is the result of the 'policy of appeasement'
of Albanian separatism conducted by some Western countries."
</P>
<P>
"We regret to note that the international force deployed in
Kosovo is not coping with the wave of terror that has swept the
territory," the statement said. "We believe that the said Security
Council resolution provides the international force with enough
powers to take more resolute actions to restore order."
</P>
<P>
"It is also necessary to speed up the deployment of the United
Nations mission in Kosovo called upon to ensure civic law and
order and exercise main administrative functions in the territory
in the transitional period," the statement said. "It is also
surprising that the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia displays such inactivity in respect of the crimes being
perpetrated in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"The international community should take vigorous measures to
rectify the dangerous trends in the development of the situation
in Kosovo, and bring the process back into the mainstream of
political settlement with full respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia," the statement added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government are planning to enforce new rules as soon as possible
to govern the restructuring of state assets, Public Enterprises
Minister Jeff Radebe said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Framework Agreement, under which the government
must discuss any privatization plans it has with Labor, was still
in operation, but the government wanted to go further than this,
he told the National Assembly's Public Enterprises Committee in
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Radebe said that proposals on restructuring state assets had
been received from the private sector, and he planned to discuss
them with South African Chamber of Business representatives.
</P>
<P>
An audit would be conducted of all state enterprises, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state telecommunications company, Telkom, will
be listed on the stock exchange, and the issue was currently
discussed with Malaysian Telkom and U.S. telecommunications
company SBC, which hold a 30-percent stake in the parastatal
company.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Picking Up But Still Weak in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) - Sales on Britain's high streets
are picking up at their fastest rate for 18 months, official
figures released Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales volumes for the three months to the end of July
increased 1.3 percent on the previous three months, marking the
biggest rise since February 1998, the Office for National
Statistics (INS) said.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe as 1999 has progressed and the predictions
of recession have receded, High Street stores have been tempting
shoppers back by cutting prices in the increasingly competitive
market.
</P>
<P>
A variety of surveys have found that this has begun to
accelerate the increase in consumer spending. But the official ONS
figures suggest that they may have overstated the case.
</P>
<P>
The figures were not seen as strong enough to spark fears that
the economy may be heating up which would increase pressure on the
Bank of England to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Dicks, economist at NatWest Bank, said: "The figures
were pretty weak. We were misled by earlier upbeat surveys from
the likes of the Confederation of British Industry."

KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's First Deputy Premier
and Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya has dismissed before
parliament the allegations that Uganda is in the Congo for its
minerals and other natural resources, Radio Uganda reported
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government sent its troops into the Democratic
Republic of Congo to make sure its borders are free of attacks
from rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces based in the Congo, he
said, adding that Ugandan troops would remain there till this
mission was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, Uganda flew in troops to back the
Congolese rebels fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila, an
allegation Kampala has dismissed ever since it had its military
presence in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Reports here also said that some of the military officers are
smuggling gold from the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has not responded to questions as to why Ugandan troops
went so deep into the Congo if it just wants to make its borders
secure.

<HEADLINE> Construction Business Up Slightly in Italy's South, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 18 (Xinhua) -- In a small sign of hope for the
south's troubled economy, construction business rose slightly in
1998, according to a report issued Wednesday by the Bank of Italy.
</P>
<P>
But the positive numbers, mostly in the business of renovation
and reconstruction, were mixed still with troubling signs of the
effects of organized crime and a stagnant economy in the poor
regions throughout the south.
</P>
<P>
The Basilicata, one of the poorest south regions, witnessed a
doubling of bidding for public works contracts from 173 billion
lire (about 96 million U.S. dollars) to 351 billion lire (about
195 million U.S. dollars), while the entire south, including the
islands of Sicily and Sardinia rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Still the Bank of Italy report concludes that the signs of
recovery "remain weak nonetheless because of the limited number of
work sites effectively activated and the stagnant state of
residential construction and the modest effects of the fiscal
incentives for renovations."
</P>
<P>
Pointing the finger at the "weight of illegal and criminal
economy," the report estimates that 14 percent of the population
of the region of Campania, whose capital is the famous criminal
city of Naples, live in cities in which organized crime has
infiltrated local governing bodies and business.
</P>
<P>
In the region of Calabria, 1998 marked a growth of 1,000 jobs
in the construction industry over the year before. Puglia, struck
by a stalled home building market, has seen employment drop 4.5
percent in the construction business.
</P>
<P>
Sicily and Sardinia, the report concludes, are still suffering
from economic "stagnation," showing only some improvement in the
renovation sector.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges End to Bombing of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday urged the
United States and Britain to stop bombing Iraq over the so-called
no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the Foreign Ministry, Moscow urged
Washington and London to end the "lawless" air raids of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The call came amid reports that "the U.S. administration is
discussing the possibility of intensifying bomb strikes on Iraq"
and considering ways of increasing the number of targets of the
bomb attacks by adding to the air-defense facilities "more serious
targets, such as military bases and command posts."
</P>
<P>
"U.S. and British aircraft have been boosting their bombing
campaign in recent days over the so-called no-fly zones which, as
is known, were set up by Washington and London unilaterally,
without the sanction of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, such illegal moves would lead to a serious
escalation of tensions around Iraq, hampering the U.N. Security
Council's efforts to develop a coordinated approach toward the
Iraqi issue," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated Russia's stance that the Iraq problem should be
solved only by political means based on the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"An end must be put to the lawlessness towards Iraq," it said.

food, including wheat grain, lentils and vegetable oil, to 30
locations along the Sobat river corridor in the Upper Nile region
in Sudan.

<P>
WFP officials said the people in the region have been
experiencing food shortages since serious flooding last year,
destroyed their crops. Persistent insecurity and communal fighting
has also reduced the livestock population, forcing the people to
survive on fish, wild food and the barter system.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Rapists found guilty of
having infected their victims with the HIV virus could face the
death penalty once a bill becomes law in Swaziland, Deutsche Press
Agentur reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the new Public Health Bill, the death sentence
shall be given in compliance with the Criminal Procedure and

knowingly transmitted the disease to their partners.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the death penalty and life imprisonment, those
convicted of transmitting the disease could also be forced to
compensate their victims to an amount to be determined by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
This also concerns persons convicted of other sexual offenses
including sodomy, indecent assault and incest that result in the
victims contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
The act also provides fines for persons convicted of these
sexual offenses and in the process infecting others with sexually
transmitted diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, genital herpes
and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The new bill will be debated in parliament shortly.

HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) provides a fund of 210,000 U.S. dollars to Zimbabwe
for a project to find alternative ozone depletion substances,
according to an agreement signed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project would be aimed at finding alternatives of methyl
bromide which affects the ozone, Zimbabwean Permanent Secretary of
the Mines, Environment and Tourism Ministry Charles Chipato said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the implementation of the project would
significantly reduce the use of methyl bromide, which is widely
used in the tobacco industry and farming.
</P>
<P>
Chipato pointed out that as the second largest consumer of
methyl bromide in Africa, Zimbabwe consumes annually about 1,000
tons of methyl bromide, of which 83 percent is used for tobacco
seedbeds, 14 percent for things like grain, and three percent for
other uses.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Rwandan Presidents Arrive to Discuss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Uganda and Rwanda
arrived here Wednesday to join southern African leaders at a
summit aimed at promoting peace and economic development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Mozambican Prime Minister's Press Office
said the two leaders "are already here". As he spoke, the Ugandan
president was seen entering the conference room.
</P>
<P>
Jerode Nbondasi, foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), welcomed their arrival, saying that "it is a good
thing for them to come here directly".
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for them," he told reporters during a luncheon
break. He reiterated the demand that Ugandan and Rwandan troops
withdraw from the DRC. "They ought to go home," he said, while
accusing the two countries of " unfaithfully" breaching peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Nbondasi earlier categorically refused to talk with any Ugandan
and Rwandan delegations that might arrive here.
</P>
<P>
Nbondasi is representing DRC President Laurent Kabila at
Wednesday summit of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC).
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda support different factions fighting in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by dispatching troops to
the war-torn country. The Ugandan and Rwandan troops based in the
DRC fought each other on August 15.
</P>
<P>
Uganda President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan Vice President and
Minister of Defense Paul Kagame agreed to a cease-fire between
their troops on Tuesday after marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to cooperating with
the verification teams from Zambia and South Africa and seeking a
peaceful resolution of the conflict in the DRC on the basis of the
Lusaka ceasefire accord signed on July 10 by six relevant states.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are not SADC members. Their participation in
the SADC summit would show the two countries' willingness to end
fighting in the DRC, a SADC official said.
</P>
<P>
The summit was running badly behind schedule. It was supposed
to start behind closed doors at 09:00 Wednesday, but two hours
later the proceedings had not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
Kabila originally intended to head the DRC delegation, and even
flew into Maputo on Monday. But he left abruptly for home on
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The explanation offered by host president Joaquim Chissano for
Kabila's departure was the deteriorating situation in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Talks on Prisoner Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiations centering on the issue of Palestinian prisoners
broke down Wednesday evening, with the two sides disputing over
how many security prisoners jailed for anti-Israel activities
should be released.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy Gilad Sher told chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in the talks that Israel would
not change its criterion for the release of prisoners at this
stage, but would review the issue in individual bases in the
future, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's
Office after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sher also reiterated that the verbal agreement over the
prisoner issue reached at the sideline of the Wye accord last
October did not differentiate between common criminals and
security prisoners, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In their previous talks Tuesday night, the negotiators agreed
to draw up a list of 650 Palestinian prisoners for review. A joint
committee convening Wednesday did not make breakthrough after
examining the list for five hours.
</P>
<P>
No new date has been set for further negotiations, according
to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Erekat has said that he expected Israel to release the 650
security prisoners before implementation of the Wye accord begins
on September 1.
</P>
<P>
But an Israeli official involved in the talks told Israel
Radio Wednesday that Israel could only free up to 250 Palestinian
security prisoners and they would be released in two dispatches,
in September and October respectively, rather than before
September.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye accord, Israel is obligated to release 750
Palestinian prisoners in three stages. Former prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the release of 250 prisoners last
November, but most of the released were common criminals instead
of security prisoners the Palestinian National Authority had
required.
</P>
<P>
The dispute sparked weeks of bloodiest violence in years
between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
There were signs that the new moderate government of Barak
might ease the criteria for the release of security prisoners,
but it has rejected Palestinian stance that only security
prisoners should be released.
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, minister without portfolio in the prime minister's
office, denied reports in a parliamentary debate Wednesday that
Barak would agree to release prisoners with "blood on their
hands," referring to those participating in serious anti-Israel
attacks.
</P>
<P>
He told Israel Radio earlier that even if the criterion were
stretched, only 250 security prisoners could be released, not 650
as the Palestinians have demanded.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Save $400M Through Energy Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ghana can save more than 400
million U.S. dollars and reduce carbon emissions by 230,000 tons
by the year 2010 on refrigerators if energy conservation measures
are strictly adhered to, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A survey by five energy-related institutions found that
another eight million dollars could be saved from the consumption
of room air conditioners with a carbon emission reduction of
38,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The savings represent a 10 percent cut in energy consumption,
Minister of Mines and Energy Fred Ohene Kena said Wednesday at the
launch of "Energy Wise", a brochure published by the Energy
Foundation to guide consumers on efficient practices in Accra,
capital of the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Energy Foundation in
collaboration with the Alliance to Save Energy, United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory and the Ministry of Mines and Energy.
</P>
<P>
 Kena said that appropriate steps are being taken to enact
laws to ensure that energy resources are optimally utilized.
</P>
<P>
 Other measures will be to support the Energy Foundation and
the Ghana Standards Board to come out with minimum energy
efficiency standards and labels for domestic energy consuming
appliances and industrial electric motors.
</P>
<P>
 He said some industries are losing in highly competitive
international markets due to the use of inefficient technologies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes India's Drafted Nuclear Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday that India's draft nuclear doctrine was designed to
build a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"We find it a document that describes the desire to develop a
nuclear arsenal and that is something that we think is not in the
security interests of India, the subcontinent or the United States
or the world," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We don't find it an encouraging document," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Washington criticized India's
nuclear doctrine, which, drafted by the government-appointed
national Security Advisory Board, proposes a nuclear deterrent
based on aircraft, ships and mobile land-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rubin said the United States opposed India's
drafted nuclear doctrine because it was "moving in the wrong
direction."
</P>
<P>
He said the move could only create "an action-reaction cycle
that will increase the risks" to the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
Washington has consistently urged India and Pakistan, which
both carried out nuclear tests last year, to refrain from
developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Washington would continue to urge both states to
sign and ratify the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration also wanted them "to not weaponize
missiles so that they can carry nuclear weapons, to stop the
production of fissile material, and to develop an export control
system," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Reiterates Call for Political Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) ended their summit here Wednesday
after adopting a communique calling for political solutions to
regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The communique, read by SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende,
 expressed concern at the setbacks reflected in the emergence of
unrest and conflict in Angola and the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Lesotho and the recent armed confrontation in
the Caprivi region of Namibia are equally sources of serious
concern," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the SADC stands for efforts to seek a diplomatic and
political solution to the Angolan conflict, while reiterating
support for the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
"The summit expressed solidarity with the Angolan people in
their efforts to strengthen the democratic authority of the state
through the establishment of peace through political and
diplomatic means," it said.
</P>
<P>
The document said the SADC has entrusted SADC newly-elected
chairman Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and South African
President Thabo Mbeki to mediate the Angolan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders, in the statement, also renewed their
commitment to peace efforts in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning the Congo, the summit expressed satisfaction over
the initiatives launched to bring peace to the Country," the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC has undertaken measures to ensure that Congolese
rebels sign the cease-fire agreement, which would pave the way for
the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Congo, it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the governments of Uganda and Rwanda reaffirmed
their commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the
Congo and to the swift implementation of the Lusaka agreement
signed on July 10.
</P>
<P>
On the recent developments in Namibia, the summit "strongly and
 unreservedly condemned the secessionist attack on Katima Mulilo
in the Caprivi region, and reaffirmed the inviolability of the
territorial integrity of Namibia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The summit indicated its full support of the actions taken by
the government of Namibia to return the situation to normality,"
it noted.
</P>
<P>
It said the summit called upon the government and the people of
Lesotho to continue to use open dialogue and consultations in
order to deepen the democratic process which would facilitate the
holding of fresh elections in Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Inadequate World Response to Somali Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday said that despite the persistent security
threats and rising distribution costs caused by clan conflicts,
mines and other problems, U.N. agencies and their humanitarian
partners continue to deliver food aid to a high proportion of the
most affected areas, and to most settlements known to have
incorporated families.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the situation in Somalia, Annan said,
"The operational capacity of humanitarian agencies has gradually
been eroded, primarily owing to inadequate donor support for
medium-term rehabilitation measures."
</P>
<P>
"For United Nations agencies, this is shown by the weak donor
response to the 1999 Consolidated Appeal, which was severely
prioritized and focused in response to donor wishes," Annan said
in the report, presented to the U.N. Security Council Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the capacity of the agencies to provide
efficient, effective humanitarian relief has been weakened, making
response to future crises ever more difficult," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, inadequate medium-term funding reduces the ability
of humanitarian agencies to provide crucial, if more mundane,
activities related to disaster prevention and the building of
social resilience," he said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in conflict since the 1991 ouster of the late
leader Mohamed Siad Barre by a coalition of rebels.
</P>
<P>
After Siad Barre's ouster, the rebels turned against each
other, and the country disintegrated into fiefdoms protected by
clan-based militias.

<HEADLINE> European Baby Deaths Continue to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Infant mortality continues to
fall throughout Europe with a rate of fewer than five deaths of
babies under one year per 1,000 live births last year in Germany,
France, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland,
the European Union (EU) said in a report published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-country EU's average of infant mortality is 5.2 compared
to 4.1 in Japan, 6.4 in the United States, 63.1 in India and 45.5
in China, the EU statistics office, Eurostat, said in the report.
The EU's figure in 1980 stood at 12.4, it added.
</P>
<P>
The "safest place" for a baby to be born is Sweden with the
death rate of only 3.5, while the longest living in the EU are
French baby girls (82.2-year-old), the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that EU babies born in 1998 can expect to
live 80.8 years if they are girls and 74.5 if they are boys.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the average EU woman has 1.45 children with the high
of 1.94 in Ireland and the low of 1.15 in Spain. These figures
compare with 2.07 in the United States, 1.8 in China and 3.24 in
India, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, births outside marriage continue to rise everywhere in
Europe, the report said. "These amounted to one in every two
births in Sweden, Estonia and Norway and two out of three in
Iceland." In the European Union region, it is about one in four,
though nearly one in five in the 11-member euro-zone, Eurostat
said, adding that the trend "reflects the growing popularity of
cohabitation and a decline in the incidence of marriage."
</P>
<P>
Eurostat also underlined the declining popularity of marriage
and the rise in divorces in the EU. "The crude marriage rate in
1998 was five per 1,000 population compared to 6.3 in 1980. The
range last year was from 3.6 in Sweden to 6.7 in Portugal," it
said.
</P>
<P>
EU divorces are running at a crude rate of around 1.8 per 1,000
population with a high of 2.7 in Finland, the report added.

been reached following complaints from growers and parents that
the work force to harvest cloves is far from enough and there is a
danger that some of the cloves could get spoilt.
</P>
<P>
He also observed that most of the public schools in Pemba
Island, where 80 percent of Zanzibar's cloves are grown, have been
recording "poor attendance" since the picking exercise started
last month.
</P>
<P>
He added that teachers were also allowed to take up unpaid
leave in a bid to participate in clove picking exercise.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory closure of schools will end on September 20,
according to Mzee.
</P>
<P>
The principal secretary said private schools are free to make
choice on whether or not to close.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government raised producer prices for cloves in
renewed efforts to encourage growers to harvest the spice and
recover costs.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of first grade clove fetches 600 shillings (about 75
U.S. cents) instead of 450 shillings. The second grade rises to
550 shillings from 400 shillings. The third grade is 500 shillings
instead of 350 shillings and the fourth grade is 300 shillings
instead of 250 shillings.
</P>
<P>
Cloves are also grown in Indonesia, Brazil and the Indian Ocean
islands of Comoros, Mauritius and Madagascar.

<HEADLINE> W. African Leaders Urged to Pursue Stability, Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President's
representative and officials of the Economic Community of the West
Africa States (ECOWAS) Wednesday urged leaders of the west
African sub-region to help sustain the burgeoning democracy and
step up economic integration.
</P>
<P>
"This sub-region has had enough of military rule. We need
economic and political stability in order to attain the goals of
economic integration at a time when we are entering a new
millennium," Obasanjo, through his chief economic adviser, told
the opening session of the 44th Ministerial Council of the
16-nation regional organization in Nigeria's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Philip Asiodu, representing Nigeria's president said the
sub-region should work toward the elimination of all contentious
issues which may give causes for military incursion into civil
governance.
</P>
<P>
The president adviser lamented that the sub-region continue to
find itself marginalized when the gap between it and the rest of
the world is actually getting wider.
</P>
<P>
Citing the 1999 world development report, he said all but two
of the 16 member countries in the sub-region are among the poorest
34 countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
West Africa cannot stagnate when others were developing, said
Nigeria's president through his aide, adding that the three-day
council meeting should come up with far-reaching proposals for the
October ECOWAS summit.
</P>
<P>
Lack of policy harmonization is undermining the integration
process of the region, said the ECOWAS Executive Secretary lansana
kouyate at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the ECOWAS's progress was hindered by delays
in the implementation of customs union program, trade
liberalization scheme and common external tariff.
</P>
<P>
The delays have impeded free movement of people and goods
across the region, said the Executive Secretary.
</P>
<P>
It is a shame that there are still as many as 174 road blocks
for extortion along the international highways linking the
Lagos-Cotonou-Lome- Accra-Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Lome hub, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council Chairman, Togolese Economic and Finance Minister
Abdoul- Hamid Dourodjaye said in his speech that steps should be
fastened in achieving the macro-economic convergence and creation
of a single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this objective, Dourodjaye said ECOWAS member states
must ensure political stability by putting an end to coups, social
upheavals and armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The minister's meeting is responsible for, among other things,
the restructuring of the organization's Abuja-based secretariat
and its Lome- based ECOWAS fund. A communique is expected at the
end of the meeting on Friday.

LUANDA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation in

Coordination Unit (UCAH).

<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- London's leading index climbed
Wednesday, helped by strength in the electricity and
pharmaceutical sectors and Bank of England minutes.
</P>
<P>
After losing 1.2 percent over the past two session, its FTSE
100 index struggled back into positive territory and rebounded to
close 35.4 points, or 0.6 percent, higher at 6,201.8.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 350 electricity sector rose by 3.95 percent on the
back of National Power's 3 billion U.S. dollar sale of its Drax
Power Station.

Traders said both sectors are benefiting from interest rate
prospects, both here and in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index fell on the day as profit-taking set

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein to Be Kept Into Peace Process Review: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist security
spokesman Ken Maginnis said Wednesday that his party does not want
Sinn Fein to be excluded from the review of the Northern Ireland
peace process even if the Irish Republican Army is found to have
broken its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis said next month's review was "bound to indicate" Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, had not met its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Even if Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam decided the IRA
had broken its ceasefire, Maginnis said, Sinn Fein should not
"escape the inevitability" of the review.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis held an hour-long talk with Mowlam at Stormont, near
the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast Wednesday to discuss the
current political and security situation.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said earlier this week that she would make an
announcement on whether the IRA ceasefire had been broken,
following suspicion that the IRA was involved in a recent murder
and an arms smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Unionist Party and UK Unionists have called for
Sinn Fein to be excluded from the political process which restarts
in September.
</P>
<P>
But the Northern Ireland security minister, Adam Ingram, said
the British government would not accept the loyalist and
republican definitions of their own ceasefires.
</P>
<P>
He said killings which could be considered "internal" to their
communities would be considered breaches of the ceasefire, if
proven.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting with Mowlam Tuesday, Sinn Fein said there was
no reason to impose sanctions on the party.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness blamed the British
government for the failure of the political process to deliver a
devolved administration.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process is deadlocked due to a
long-running dispute between politicians from the majority
Protestant and minority Catholic communities over guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Irish Republic are currently seeking ways to
revive last year's peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Istanbul Residents Facing Aftermath of Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of women, wearing
headscarves, squated on the ground beside the debris of a toppled
six-floor building in Aucilar, Istanbul late Wednesday night,
praying for the three children being rescued by relief workers
from under the concrete.
</P>
<P>
It is still not known whether the three children are alive or
not as the three children have been trapped since the powerful
earthquake struck the area in the early hours of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the women, surnamed Aycer, told Xinhua that the
building collapsed instantly as the quake occurred. Seven bodies
have already been recovered from under the tangled steel and
concrete.
</P>
<P>
"God bless the children trapped in the building," Aycer
said. However, rescue workers conceded that the chance of
survival for the children seemed slim.
</P>
<P>
Aucilar, a scenic district in western Istanbul overseeing the
Marmara Sea, was the most seriously hit part in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 people have been killed and 700 others injured in
Aucilar alone, as the fatalities in Istanbul, with a population of
12 million, were so far put at 290.
</P>
<P>
From under a crushed 10-floor house, the tallest building
reduced to rubbles in Aucilar in the quake, rescuers pulled out
25 people, injured but alive.
</P>
<P>
Another seven people were still trapped inside, survivors
said. Rescuers doubted they could pull them out.
</P>
<P>
Rescue experts warned people against moving into the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Makeshift shelters can be seen at almost any open field in
Aucilar, like in other part of Istanbul as residents fled their
home to camp outside for fear of major aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 people have been confirmed dead and over 10,000
injured in the disastrous quake, measuring 7.4 degrees on
the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is certainly to climb as another 10,000 people
are still buried under the flattened buildings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes DPRK Statement on Missile Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
made a response to a statement on the missile program by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), seeing it as a
"window of opportunity" for better relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
DPRK party secretary Kim Yong-sun told CNN in an interview this
week that Pyongyang was considering a less volatile missile
policy, but warned that if his country detected aggression against
it, it would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the DPRK's Foreign Ministry said his country
was ready to discuss its missile program with other nations. Other
nations must however prove that they were not a threat to
Pyongyang, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the statement, the U.S. State Department said
Washington saw "a window of opportunity" for improving its
relations with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We think that there is a window of opportunity, and we
certainly hope that North Korea seizes that opportunity,"
spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said better relations could mean normalization of relations,
liaison offices, diplomatic representation and eliminating or
limiting economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the DPRK have held bilateral talks on
the DPRK's missile program since 1996.

LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nick Bourne was confirmed as the

The nine-strong Tory group in the assembly elected Bourne after

</P>
<P>
His choice of deputy leader, 29-year-old David Davies, was then
rejected by the other Tory assembly members, who thought him too
inexperienced. Following the rejection, Richards later made his
resignation permanent.

<HEADLINE> SADC Expresses Satisfaction over Macro-economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Wednesday expressed satisfaction over
sound macro-economic policies that "have brought about positive
developments".
</P>
<P>
The leaders, ending their one-day summit, said in a communique
that SADC has, for the past four years, achieved positive economic
growth rates averaging 4.1 percent in 1996, 2.2 percent in 1997
and 1.7 percent in 1998. They expected a growth rate of 3 to 3.5
percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The summit, however, expressed concern that this level of
growth "is insufficient for reducing poverty in the region, as
SADC requires a growth rate of at least 6 percent".
</P>
<P>
"Despite the far-reaching reforms the economies of the region
have undertaken to achieve macro-economic stability, the region
continues to receive low levels of foreign direct investment
compared to other regions of the world," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The summit noted that SADC cannot rely only on external sources
of capital, thus it needs to mobilize regional resources for
cross-border investments through joint venture initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed serious concern that external debt burden
remains one of the major impediments to the economic
transformation of the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
"Resources disbursed to pay external debt obligations undermine
the efforts to provide basic services to the general population,"
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The summit welcomed the ongoing initiatives aimed at addressing
the debt issue, such as the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
It voiced concern on the decision made by the Group of Seven
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell gold in large
quantities, saying " such a move will inevitably further depress
the bullion price, which will have negative effects on gold
producing countries, as well as those which supply labor to the
gold mines."
</P>
<P>
The summit called on the Group of Seven to write off the debts
of poor countries as they have the capacity to do so. It urged the
IMF to explore other possibility of dealing with the debt issue
other than only through gold sales.
</P>
<P>
In the area of food security, the Summit noted that the 1998/99
cropping season was characterized by incessant rains, which were
followed by dry spells in the latter part of the season, in some
of the southern countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
"This has, to a large extent, dampened production in most of
the countries. Thus the region is projecting a cereal deficit in
the 1999/2000 marketing year," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The summit therefore urged member states to take contingent
measures to ensure food security.
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed concern at the region's high HIV/AIDS
prevalence rates, which has far-reaching social and economic
consequences as the most affected population is the young working
age group.
</P>
<P>
The summit urged member states to put more resources in the
fight against HIV/AIDS, saying multi-sectoral approaches in
addressing the epidemic should continue to be undertaken at
national and regional levels.

BRUSSELS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Wednesday that all its people of 15 countries share 6.3 percent of
the world's population, with the figure of 375,329,400 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Locomotive Engine Derails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A locomotive engine that
carries eight empty wagons has derailed the track, causing huge
economic loss to its owner Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC), a
statement issued by the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place between Ngeta and Ruvu railway stations
in the eastern Coast Region when the locomotive engine was heading
from the capital Dar es Salaam to the Tanga Region in the north
earlier this week, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The engine derailed because a section of the railway was off
course after the bolts that hold together the tracks had been
deliberately loosened, it said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from setting the section of the track off course, unknown
people had also tried to unscrew bolts on other sections of the
railway track.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said that railways police unit has
already launched an investigation into the accident. They have
taken the accounts of the locomotive driver Mohamed Zuberi and the
police officer that was escorting the train.
</P>
<P>
According to the driver, shortly after the engine derailed he
saw three people quickly disappeared before any action could be
taken against them.
</P>
<P>
The TRC statement pointed out that the accident was planned for
the purpose of sabotaging the infrastructure of the corporation
and properties of its customers.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, TRC has suffered a great loss, as the
corporation will have to meet the expenses of repairing the
damaged railway track, the engine and four wagons.
</P>
<P>
TRC also had to hire special buses to ferry passengers who were
stranded in Ruvu because the train they were travelling in could
not pass through the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that a passenger train that was to go
to upcountry on Tuesday was forced to postpone until 11 a.m.
Wednesday. Trips to and from Dar es Salaam by cargo trains also
had to be put to a halt for more than 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
The company has appealed to all citizens to be alert on people
who intend to sabotage the infrastructure of the corporation and
has urged people to take actions against these criminals.

LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Professionals have overtaken
manual workers as the most insecure group within the workforce in
Britain, new research showed.
</P>
<P>
A study, conducted by researchers at Cambridge University,
found that despite the economic recovery and low unemployment, the
middle class are growing more fearful of redundancy, the Times
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Job insecurity among professionals has risen 28 percent since
1986, according to an index devised by the researchers that sets
people's fear of becoming unemployed against their perception of
how likely it is to happen.
</P>
<P>
On the same scale, manual workers showed a slight decrease in
job insecurity.
</P>
<P>
One of the study's most striking findings is the degree to
which job insecurity has united employees of all ranks and set
them solidly against their bosses.
</P>
<P>
The survey used government data on 5,500 adults and surveyed
300 men and women.
</P>
<P>
The study found that while many professionals were not afraid
of losing their job, they were very worried about the potential
loss of valued job features, such as their status within their
company and their opportunity for promotion.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of people surveyed said they regularly worked longer
than their basic working hours and 39 percent said that working
hours had increased over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent said the speed of work and the effort they
put into their job had increased over the past five years. But far
from motivating employees to try harder in order to ensure they
were not sacked, this merely served to demotivate most
respondents.
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that short-term improvements in efficiency
are being achieved at the cost of long-term ill-health and
destruction of the social environment.

<HEADLINE> Croatian FM Arrives in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Mate Granic arrived here Wednesday to start
his visit to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Rexhep Meidani, Prime Minister Pandeli Majko
and Foreign Minister Paskal Milo met with Granic Wednesday
respectively, stressing that the two countries should strengthen
their bilateral ties, especially in the field of trade.
</P>
<P>
Meidani said that Albania and Croatia should increase their
economic and human contacts, and build an air or sea corridor for
that purpose with the liberalization of visas between the two
countries, according to the Albanian Telegraphic Agency.
</P>
<P>
Granic agreed to Meidani's ideas on stronger ties between the
two countries, saying that his current visit to Albania is aimed
at evaluating the prospect for the cooperation between the two
countries in compliance with the Stability Pact for Southeastern
Europe signed in July in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Majko expressed, during his meeting with Granic, thanks for
Groatia's assistance to Albania during the Kosovo crisis, saying
that Croatia is an important partner of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Majko also expressed his hope that a tripartite meeting of
representatives of Albania, Croatia and Montenegro could be held.
</P>
<P>
Granic said that Croatia wishes to intensify its ties with
Albania, while indicating Croatia is interested in having good
ties with all the countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Milo confirmed the Albanian government's desire for stronger
ties with Croatia during his meeting with Granic. The two also
discussed the current situation in Kosovo and agreed that
cooperation is needed to stabilize the situation there.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Production to Remain Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- World gold production is
expected to remain flat through the next four years, the Gold
Institute reported Wednesday in its annual forecast of world gold
mine production.
</P>
<P>
Trends in declining exploration expenditure and the closure of
high cost mines are beginning to lower projections for future gold
production, said the international industry association in a
report.
</P>
<P>
World gold mine production grew 3 percent in 1998 to reach 82
million ounces, despite gold prices that averaged 37 U.S. dollars
per ounce less than those in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Gold Institute's new forecast for 2002, at 83 million
ounces, shows 1 percent growth from 1998. However, the report
said, those projections were made when gold was at 285 dollars per
ounce. It is likely that if the current 255-dollar price had been
taken into consideration, some forecasts would have been lower.
Unless prices recover, instead of growing 1 percent, it is more
likely that production will decline 1.5 percent to 2 percent per
year for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
On a regional basis, the report said that the trends identified
last year are continuing. Twelve percent growth in Latin America
and 7 percent in Asia are offset by declines of 11 percent in
Oceania and 7 percent in North America.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the world's largest gold producer, produced 15
million ounces in 1998, down 5 percent from 1997. If production
continues to decline at the rate it has for the past five year,
the report said, South Africa will produce only a little over 12
million ounces in 2002.
</P>
<P>
U.S. production is expected to decline 6 percent to just over
11 million ounces in 2002.
</P>
<P>
A reduction totaling 1.2 million ounces or 12 percent is
expected to bring production in Australia down to 8.8 million
ounces in 2002.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, gold production of 5.3 million ounces in 1998 is
forecast to decline to 4.8 million ounces in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has experienced tremendous growth since 1990, and is
expected to overtake both China and Canada in the next three years
with projected growth of 11 percent to 5.2 million ounces in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Gold Institute compiled the study with the participation of
more than 100 mining entities from 70 countries supplying actual
production data and projections.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Promises to Help Turkey Reconstruct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn Wednesday expressed his deep sympathy to the government
and people of Turkey after the massive earthquake that struck
Monday, and promised to reallocate substantial funds and mobilize
further assistance to help the country.
</P>
<P>
"Within 36 hours of the earthquake, we reallocated around 100
million U.S. dollars out of existing loans and have already
identified another 120 million dollars in new loans to be
available for reconstruction needs," Wolfensohn said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"With our government counterparts, we have begun rapid work to
assess all those needs and the associated costs, and together we
will design smooth mechanisms for getting the necessary funding to
most vital rebuilding and future human needs," he added.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has helped with the recovery from past natural
disasters in Turkey -- including the Erzincan and Adana
earthquakes -- and is committed to helping the country with
reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved lower
Wednesday as investors were waiting for a decision by the Federal
Reserve on the possibility of higher interest rates to preempt
inflation from the U.S. economy next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 125.70 at
10,991.38 for profit taking after the blue chip index rose 461
points in the five previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 11.32 at 1,332.84 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq index fell 13.49 at 2,657.73.
</P>
<P>
Investors' concerns about higher interest rates have hit the
market, dragging the stock indexes well below their closing
records set on July 16. But most indexes rebounded in the past few
days as investors absorbed the possibility of higher rates in
belief that the Federal Reserve would take a moderate action.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the market may not be able to sustain any new
rallies until after August 24, when the Federal Reserve announces
its decision on the rates.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 5.06 at 623.65 and the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.90 at 433.10. But the
American Stock Exchange index rose 1.41 at 783.92.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,801 down, 1,196 up and 539
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 676.73 million shares from 689.89
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Reaffirm Their Support to Osama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the First
anniversary of the U.S. missile attack against Afghanistan, the
ruling Taliban Thursday reiterated that they will not hand over
the alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden to the United Stated, news
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the United States of conducting international
terrorism, Mulla Mohammad Rabbani, the second senior Taliban
leader, said that the United States was using the Osama issue as a
means to pressure the Taliban regime to yield to U.S. demands.
</P>
<P>
"Osama is our guest and it is the custom of Afghans and Muslims
to respect and care for the guest," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States accused Osama of masterminding the bomb
blasts in U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August and
repeatedly demanded the Taliban extradite the Saudi dissident.
</P>
<P>
It attacked the claimed bases of Osama in Afghanistan and Sudan
with cruise missiles on August 20 last year and imposed economic
sanctions on the Taliban this July.
</P>
<P>
"America itself conducts acts of global terrorism by launching
missile attacks against Afghanistan and Sudan. Who is going to
compensate for this?" Rabbani questioned.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban leader vowed that Osama was not allowed to
use Afghanistan to launch activities against other countries and
called for a negotiated settlement of the issue concerning him.

<HEADLINE> Gold Futures Trading Allowed in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Thursday
issued a notification allowing the Reserve Bank of India and its
authorized banks to deal in futures trading of gold within the
country.
</P>
<P>
This paved the way for activating the Gold Deposit Scheme,
which had been planned for years in India.
</P>
<P>
The Gold Deposit Scheme also envisages exemption of interest on
the gold deposit bonds from income tax and the value of assets
deposited in the scheme from wealth tax.
</P>
<P>
Any capital gains made on these bonds through trading or at
redemption would be eligible for exemption from capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the minimum gold deposit would be 500 grams
and further deposits would be in multiples of 50 grams.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the process of putting in place the
guidelines and required logistics could take at least six months.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Construction Yu
Zhengsheng said here today that 85 percent of the prefecture-level
cities in China have set up trading centers for opening bidding
on construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The trading centers are aimed at ensuring fair and open
competition between contractors, which could resulted in effective
and clean operations in this field, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the government has stepped up its efforts to
battle corruption in the construction sector by encouraging open
bids to avoid under-the-table activities.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, 37,519 projects were contracted,
of which 97.83 percent were contracted through opening bidding,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Minister Yu said that by October 1, all prefecture-level cities
will have their own construction-project trading centers. He
disclosed that related departments are working hard to create the
country's first laws on tendering and bidding.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Supervision He Yong told Xinhua that the number of
corruption cases involving the construction industry continues to
decline. In 1995, authorities uncovered 4,076 such cases, compared
with 1,052 in 1998, and 270 in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> China Insurance Co. Ltd. Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong-Kong based China
Insurance Company Limited today announced its new leadership,
marking the end of its 10-month restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The restructured company, to be headed by Wang Xianzhang, now
becomes the holding company of all the overseas ventures of the
former People's Insurance Company of China (Group).
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1937 in Shanghai, the China Insurance Co. Ltd. is
one of the oldest insurance companies in China.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
it was taken over by the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC)
, later known as the PICC (Group).
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, according to an instruction from the State
Council, the PICC (Group) was broken into four companies, namely,
the China Life Insurance Company, the China Reinsurance Company,
the new PICC, which specializes in property insurance, and the
China Insurance Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The restructured China Insurance Co. Ltd. now has approximately
30 operational entities in Hong Kong, Macao, England, Germany, the
United States, and many other regions and countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Its business ranges from life and property insurance,
international reinsurance, and fund management, to securities and
investment, among others.
</P>
<P>
The company has total assets of 18 billion Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, newly appointed
general manager Wang Xianzhang said the restructuring was a result
of major reforms in China's insurance regulatory system, and a
strategic step taken by the Chinese government to promote
multinational operations by Chinese insurers.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong competition in the international insurance
market, he pledged that the new company will seek more diversified
operations while remaining with its traditional core business, in
order to make greater contributions to China's overseas insurance
business.

Turkish press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign units were in possession of sniffer dogs
trained to locate living people trapped inside the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The largest foreign assistance team was sent by Israel,
Turkey's close ally in the region. A 200-member team of military
rescuers and medical experts arrived in Turkey on Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli court Thursday
sentenced a German citizen to 10 years in jail for aiding
the militant group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The judges of Tel Aviv District Court said that the
sentence would prevent the similar cases from happening in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Stephan Smyrek, 26, was arrested in November 1997 when he
arrived in Israel. The court was told that he had taken part in a
training course with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Smyrek was convicted early this week by the court of
aiding Hezbollah, being a member of it and trying to pass
information to it.
</P>
<P>
But the court dismissed allegations by Israel's General
Security Service that Smyrek was planning to carry out a
suicide bomb attack in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Avigdor Feldman, Smyrek's lawyer, had said that Smyrek came to
Israel only to take picture of Israeli public place and send them
to Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Two Men Rewarded for Capturing Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua)-- Chinese police have rewarded two
ordinary citizens who helped them capture a fugitive homicide
suspect, the Ministry of Public Security said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yongqiang, public security bureau director of the city of
Shenzhen in south China, awarded 10,000 yuan, equivalent to twice
the average annual income of a Chinese citizen, to Ao Longhua and
Deng Shibibg, two grass-growing company employees, yesterday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time a public security bureau gave such
large reward to citizens who voluntarily helped catch a major
fugitive since the ongoing nationwide campaign against fugitives
began on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Ao and Deng caught Yang Guangming on April 4 as he was stealing
a roadlamp of an overpass. Police interrogated Yang, and found his
personal data in the National Fugitive Information Network, which
was established by the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Yang broke into a house and
committed homicide in Shaowu County in east China's Fujian
Province on July 21, before he became a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
Yang had been listed among the 1,000 most-wanted fugitives in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since July 1, more than 60,000 fugitives
have been caught nationwide, including 183 of the most-wanted ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has stressed
the need for the capital market to offer innovative investment
opportunities if it has to become meaningful to the private sector
and ordinary Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Katele Kalumba, minister of Finance and Economic Development,
said that more Zambians should be given a chance to participate in
the capital market.
</P>
<P>
He said this when he opened the first national workshop on
collective investment schemes here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that LUSE would fail to live up to its aspirations as a
national stock exchange if its services were not made widely
available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Swedish ambassador to Zambia Kristina Svensson noted
that very few companies were listed on LUSE to date and that their
turn-over was still low.
</P>
<P>
Svensson said this could only be redressed if LUSE increased
participation and the supply of shares offered on the market.
</P>
<P>
To increase participation of more companies in the financial
market was necessary in order to raise liquidity levels and hence
reduce vulnerability to external stocks, she said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of knowledge about the importance of a capital market had
limited the number of Zambians participating in the market, she
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Soars to Monthly Record in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. trade deficit soared to
an all-time monthly high in June because the recorded imports
overwhelmed a modest increase in exports, the Commerce Department
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that the trade deficit jumped to 24.6
billion dollars in June, a 16.3 percent increase from the 21.2
billion dollars deficit in May.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, imports of goods and services rose a
solid 3.9 percent in June to a record 103 billion dollars while
exports managed a 0.5 percent gain to 78.3 billion dollars, only
the second increase this year.
</P>
<P>
So in the first half of this year, the U.S. trade deficit was
running at an annual rate of 236 billion dollars, 44 percent above
last year's 164.3 billion dollars, which had been a record high.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit set records in five of the last six
months. The manufacturers and farmers are struggling to cope with
the loss of markets caused by the world financial crisis while the
consumers, bolstered by the lowest unemployment levels in three
decades, have been snapping up foreign products.
</P>
<P>
The big jump in June's deficit caught analysts by surprise.
Many had been forecasting a slight narrowing on the belief that
U.S. exporters were finally seeing some improvement as Asian
economies began to recover from steep recessions.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration in U.S. trade deficit last month reflected
widening trade gaps with most of the world.
</P>
<P>
U.S. politically sensitive deficit with Japan soared by 19.3
percent in June to 6.3 billion dollars for the month.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Mexico, one of the U.S. partners in the North
American Free Trade Agreement, swelled 9.4 percent in June to 2.5
billion dollars as imports from that country climbed to an
all-time high.
</P>
<P>
U.S. deficit with West Europe jumped 39 percent to 4.9 billion
dollars as imports from that region also set a record high.
</P>
<P>
The report showed the 3.9 percent increase in imports was led
by a jump of 874 million dollars in shipments of foreign cars and
parts. Other big gains were registered by clothing, which climbed
by 282 million dollars; computers up 422 million dollars; and
telecommunications equipment, up 254 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. foreign oil bill increased 3.7 percent in June to 5.5
billion dollars as crude oil imports climbed to the highest level
since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
June's report also showed the the rise in exports was led by a
424 million dollars jump in sales of U.S. autos and parts, which
climbed to 6.5 billion dollars, their highest level since July
1977.
</P>
<P>
Sales of U.S. farm products, led by gains in corn and beef
sales, were up 135 million to 3.9 billion dollars, but for the
year were still 7 percent behind 1998.

Office.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Hints not to Sign CTBT by September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Thursday said the
question of its signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
remains open.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had promised to sign the
CTBT by September this year "in an atmosphere free of coercion"
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad told a briefing here
that India's nuclear doctrine it recently raised is serious enough
to make it unavoidable for Islamabad to keep the question of
signing the CTBT open.
</P>
<P>
"We will, of course, be forced to take a final decision (with
regard to CTBT) keeping in view what is happening in our
neighborhood," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said that Pakistan has been closely
monitoring the situation "because we had undertaken to sign the
CTBT in an atmosphere free of coercion."
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no progress vis a vis the removal of the
coercive atmosphere, he observed.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he pointed out, there has been the
aggravation of the situation.
</P>
<P>
"India's nuclear doctrine itself is a development serious
enough to make it absolutely unavoidable for us to keep the
question of signing the CTBT open until we can be fully assured
that there is no threat to Pakistan's security and if there is
progress towards the removal of atmosphere of coercion we would
like to honor the commitment we had made."
</P>
<P>
India had also said it would sign the treaty by September, but
it recently made it clear that it would not do so before the
upcoming general election is finished.
</P>
<P>
"So we will have to evaluate the implications of all these
developments before we reach the final decision," Shamshad said.

<HEADLINE> Billions Thought to Be Laundered Through Bank of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- As much as 10 billion U.S.
dollars have been laundered through the Bank of New York in what
is believed to be a major money laundering operation by Russian
organized crime, The New York Times said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in a report that from last October through March
this year, some 4.2 billion dollars, in more than 10,000
transactions, passed through one account, and investigators
estimate that as much as 10 billion dollars may have flowed
through the bank in that account and related ones since early last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of New York has suspended two employees whose names
had surfaced in the investigation. The two suspects, Natasha
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky and Lucy Edwards, are senior officers in the
Bank's Eastern European division and are married to Russian
businessmen, one of whom is believed by investigators to have
controlled one of the accounts.
</P>
<P>
The report said the accounts under scrutiny at the Bank of New
York have been linked by investigators to a man who is a major
figure in Russian organized crime, Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich. The
suspect is involved in a wide range of activities from arms
trafficking and extortion to prostitution, the report quoted
American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies as
saying.

between June and July, the European Union (EU) statistics office,
Eurostat, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rate was 1.3 percent in July 1998, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation in the whole of the 15-country EU was up
from 1.0 percent in June to 1.1 percent in July while the rate in
July last year was 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spain registered the highest rate of 2.1 percent, followed by
Denmark with 2.0 percent, and Ireland and Portugal, both with 1.9
percent, Eurostat reported referring to all 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The lowest rate was in Luxembourg, with -0.3 percent, followed
by Sweden with 0.2 percent, and Austria, with 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with June, annual inflation fell in six EU member

the highest in Greece, 3.3 percent, Portugal, 2.4 percent, and
Ireland, 2.3 percent, the Eurostat said.

the economies are showing recovery from relative recession in the
EU region.

TOKYO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka met on Thursday with a group of Chinese high school
students at the Japanese prime minister's official residence,
encouraging them to make contributions to the development of Sino-
Japanese bilateral friendly ties into the next century.
</P>

century, Nonaka said during the meeting, adding that leaders and
peoples of the two countries should make unremitting efforts to
strengthen bilateral ties.

The students were representatives of a 100-member Chinese high
school student delegation which arrived here Tuesday for a week-
long visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka expressed the hope that the delegation could get to know
more about Japanese culture and history, and make more contacts

<P>
Besides Tokyo and Yokohama, these Chinese students are
scheduled to visit Kyoto, Okayama and Osaka in western Japan.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects U.S. Concerns of Indo-Pak Nuke Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19, (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh Thursday rejected U.S. concerns of a
possible Indo-Pak nuclear conflict.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who will lead the Indian delegation at the United
Nations General Assembly session in New York next month, said he
is willing to discuss the draft nuclear doctrine with Washington.
</P>
<P>
The draft nuclear doctrine, prepared by the National Security
Advisory Board of India, was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Washington's comment that a nuclear conflict was
possible if tensions continued between India and Pakistan, he
said, "I refute suggestions of that possibility."
</P>
<P>
"As far as restraint is concerned, India has been consistently
observing restraint," he said, adding " It is the hall mark of our
international conduct."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the draft nuclear doctrine, he said it was not a
National Security Council doctrine but a document of National
Security Advisory Board. In this document nothing has been said
has not been said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects of resumption of the stalled
bilateral dialogue with Pakistan, he said that Islamabad's
continued assistance and abatement to cross-border terrorism were
not the "best encouragement" for talks.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that there was no place for third party
mediation on Indo-Pak issues as mediators on any sensitive issue
would come forward with their own agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We both do speak the same language and we do not need
interpreters," he said.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Bars Coup Makers From Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Any country where political power
is usurped through a coup will henceforth earn instant suspension
from the Commonwealth of Nations, Emeka Anyaoku,
secretary-general of the organization, said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Thursday quoted the
Nigeria- born secretary-general as saying that the 53-nation
organization would offer necessary support to any country willing
to repatriate public funds looted by corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku, who is expected to return to London Thursday after a
three-day visit to Nigeria, said the multinational body fully
backed a recent decision by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) that coup makers would no longer be welcome in its fold.
</P>
<P>
In a draft resolution at the end of the 35th summit of the OAU
in Algiers on July 14, more than 50 African leaders resolved to
banish coup makers from their midst and outlaw military rule
anywhere on the continent.
</P>

<HEADLINE>   Philippine Fans Raring to Watch Volleyball GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine fans are very glad
that they get the rare chance to see the world best women
volleyballers in the flesh this time when the World Grand Prix
Women's Volleyball Championship kicks off Friday in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Brazil and three other elite teams, Cuba,
Italy and South Korea will test each other's wits in the event's
Manila leg over the coming weekend.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will be first on line for the Cubans with the two
teams clashing in the curtain-raiser at 5:30 p.m. at the
PhilSports Area after the brief ceremonials.
</P>
<P>
The Italians play the Brazilians at 7:30 p.m. in the other game
of the exciting double-header expected to draw a huge crowd.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is expected to redeem itself from its lackluster showing
in the first leg of the 1-million-U.S.-dollar series in Macao
where it lost all of its three games in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to come out of this leg on top," Cuba's coach
Antonio Perdomo said earlier in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Rocha de Resende, the coach of Brazil which had just
topped the Pan-American Games and won the Macao stop via a sweep,
is not just about to count the Cubans out.
</P>
<P>
"Cuban has been the best in the world for a long time," Resende
said, "Besides, we also lost our first three matches last year. We
won two tournaments and we are champions."
</P>
<P>
The Italians are expected to ride on the tremendous gains they
made in Macao where they won two games while South Korea goes into
the Manila meet with its confidence boosted no end by a big
victory over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The four teams are actually going for crucial points that will
get them entry into the crossover semifinals where a 370,000-
dollar pot topped by a 200,000-dollar champion's prize is on offer.
</P>
<P>
Competing in the other group in Chinese Taipei are Russia,
Japan, China and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The GP finals will be staged in Yunnan province, China on
August 28-29.

<HEADLINE> Medical Experts Discover Antitumor Effect of Mushrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts have
discovered that medical mushrooms such as Ganoderma (Ling Zhi) and
Coriolus (Yun Zhi) contain important components of increasing the
activity of the immune systems and stimulating the antitumor
effect of the body.
</P>
<P>
Clinical study in 485 cancer patients in Shanghai hospitals
shows that PSP, a derivative of Ganoderma, obviously improved
their symptoms such as poor appetite, tiredness and pain.
</P>
<P>
It also diminished the side effects of radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, according to the 8th International Symposium of
Society of Chinese Bioscientists in America (SCBA) that closed
Thursday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts attending the SCBA elaborated on their clinical
trials of derivatives of medical mushrooms in animals and cancer
patients, and said all the results are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
As adjuvant treatment, administration of PSK, a derivative of
Coriolus, increased the survival rate of some 185 lung cancer
patients who underwent radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
It also improved the 5-year disease-free rate and survival rate
in 262 gastric cancer patients with gastrectomy.
</P>
<P>
Ganoderma and Coriolus have been known for thousands of years
as medical mushrooms used to treat diseases, retard aging and to
prolong life for thousands of years in China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
During the last decade the medical effects of their main
components and their mechanism have been widely studied with
modern scientific methods.

<HEADLINE> Book On Xinhua Journalists Killed in Past 68 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 journalists from
the Xinhua News Agency have lost their lives in the line of duty
since Xinhua was founded in 1931, a recently published book
reveals.
</P>
<P>
Shao Yunhuan, a female reporter who was killed during the U.S.-
led NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 8 was
the latest to lose her life.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the journalists were killed during the War
of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945), but 17 lost their lives
after New China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The book is entitled "A Record of Deeds of Xinhua Martyrs". It
was compiled by Xinhua's Journalism Research Institute and
published by the Xinhua Publishing House and provides the first
look at many of the journalists' lives.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua was formerly known as the Red China News Agency. It was
founded in Ruijin County of Jiangxi Province in 1931.

<P>
ISTANBUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Tuesday's
strong earthquake in Turkey has exceeded 5,000, a Turkish source,
who asked no to be named, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was later confirmed by Turkish television reports
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Around 20,000 people were reported to have been injured in the
quake, which struck northwestern Turkey early Tuesday morning, the
source said, adding that another 10,000 people were still missing.
</P>
<P>
As rescue teams reach villages and towns which were initially
cut off from communications with outside, the number of casualties
and injuries may jump dramatically in the coming days, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A powerful earthquake struck northwestern Turkish provinces of
Sakarya, Izmit, Istanbul, Yalova, Bolu, Bursa, Zoguldak, Tekirdag
and Eskisehir at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the quake was 7.4 degrees on the Richter
scale, said Ahmed Mete Isikara, the head of Istanbul's Kandilli
Observatory, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had put the magnitude at 6.7 to 7.8 degrees,
depending on where the measurements were taken.

<HEADLINE> Senior Trade Official Calls for Closer HK-Israel Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong trade and
industrial official Thursday called for more efforts to strengthen
business ties between Hong Kong and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to closer and more fruitful collaboration
between Hong Kong and Israeli businesses in the year to come,"
Chau Tak Hay, secretary for Trade and Industry, said at a luncheon
given by the Israeli Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Chau hailed the good progress the chamber has made in
strengthening links between Hong Kong and Israel at various levels
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
At the governmental level, Hong Kong, a Special Administrative
Region of China, is working on a Memorandum of Understanding with
the Israeli government to further the development of Hong Kong's
information and communications technology industries, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
On the academic front, Chau said some of the universities have
already established useful links with their Israeli counterparts
through visiting professorship, joint research projects and co-
sponsorship of symposia.
</P>
<P>
Chau said that at the business level, there is much scope for
Hong Kong and Israel to deepen the bilateral trade and investment
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Being the gateway to the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong can serve
as a useful foothold for Israeli business people who wish to do
business with the Chinese mainland," Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Chau also briefed the chamber about Hong Kong's plan for the
future development in the information industry, and the region's
present economic situation.

<HEADLINE> Pak Vows to Follow Suit if India Operationalizes Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday warned India
not to further develop, deploy and operationalize its nuclear
weapons, saying otherwise Pakistan will definitely be forced to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed Khan called on the international community to press India to
stop its "nuclear escalation."
</P>
<P>
The Indian assertion of capability for manufacturing the
neutron bomb and "India's Nuclear Doctrine" recommended by its
National Security Board indicates that India is about to embark on
"a further and even more dangerous escalation in the nuclear and
conventional arms build-up," Shamshad observed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is "seriously concerned" over these developments which
pose an intensified threat to the peace and stability of the
region and the entire world at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan does not want a nuclear arms race in South Asia, said
the foreign secretary, but it cannot afford to ignore the security
implications of India's new doctrine and its ambitious plan of
nuclear weapons development including thermonuclear and neutron
bombs.
</P>
<P>
"The development of our nuclear program will be determined
solely by the requirements of our nuclear deterrence capability,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
If India does something in the nuclear field, "we will no doubt
follow suit," he explained, adding that "we will never compromise
on the national security."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad noted that Pakistan offered to India a strategic
restraint regime to prevent nuclear arms race and maintain nuclear
deterrence at the minimum levels after the nuclear tests by the
two countries in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The best option for Pakistan and India today is still to
promote the strategic restraint regime envisaging mutual and
reciprocal moderation in the nuclear, missile and conventional
fields, and a serious endeavor to resolve underlying disputes,
specially the Jammu and Kashmir conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to exert their influence
on India for the peace and security of the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is time now for the international community to eliminate
the threat and danger to regional and global security and
stability posed by India," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bioscientists Find New Ways of Quick Diagnosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese
bioscientists have presented their recent studies on new disease
diagnostic technology at an international symposium held here.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 Chinese bioscientists from all over the world attended
the Eighth International Symposium of Society of Chinese
Bioscientists in America, which was held from August 14 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Among these new diagnostic approaches was the gene-chip
technology recently developed by Jing-Shan Hu and his colleagues
from Affymetrix Pharmaceutical Inc.
</P>
<P>
"It is a revolutionary progress in the development of
diagnostic technology," said Chan King Ming, associate professor
of the Department of Biochemistry of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Gene-chip technology is an approach to design, based on DNA
sequence information, and produce miniature gene-chip probe arrays,
using spatially patterned, light-directed combinatorial chemical
synthesis and containing up to hundreds of thousands of different
oligonucleotides at high density.
</P>
<P>
With these arrays and gene expression profiles, doctors can
accurately identify gene expression events in a very short period
of time, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
David Ho, a Chinese professor, who is also director of the
Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in the United States, also
reported his latest research on AIDS therapies.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 Chinese bioscientists from the United States and
Canada displayed their achievements in biotechnology. Nobel
Laureate Stanley B. Prusiner, Donnall Thomas and Paul Berg also
gave lectures at the symposium and shared their life experiences
in science with local students and teachers during the symposium.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Crime in northeast Nigeria has
assumed a new dimension as Nigerian citizens are being recruited
by foreign robbers, a Nigerian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, quoted Nigeria's
Bauchi State Governor Ahmed Mu'azu as saying that the northeast
zone of Nigeria had been placed under siege by armed bandits from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking recently at a meeting of governors from the zone to
discuss armed banditry in Bauchi State, Mu'azu urged the
government to enlist cooperation and assistance of the governments
of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Mu'azu stressed that the meeting is designed to review the
special anti- banditry operations in the area and adopt new
measures so as to achieve good results.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate aim is to eliminate violent crimes in our states
and establish an environment in which our people would conduct
their legitimate activities without fear or hindrance," Mu'azu
said.
</P>
<P>
Only through concerted efforts, would the goal be achieved,
Mu'azu added.
</P>
<P>
Mu'azu noted that some local governments in the state were
engaging the services of local hunters and members of vigilante
groups to detect the criminals' hideouts.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts have started yielding results, as some of the
armed bandits had been arrested while five of them were killed.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of Canadian adults
are overweight, with New Brunswickers being the fattest in the
east while British Columbians the skinniest in the west, according
to Statistics Canada Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said 34 percent of Canadians are overweight while
another 12 percent considered obese.
</P>
<P>
The finding is based on a national population health survey
conducted between 1996 and 1997 among 50,347 residents aged 20 to
64.
</P>
<P>
Only 48 percent of the population tips the scales at a healthy
weight while two percent are considered underweight, the agency
indicated.
</P>
<P>
New Brunswickers ranked at the top of the fat list, where 20
percent of the surveyed population were judged obese and another
40 percent overweight. British Columbians are the most slender,
with 12 percent and 10 percent respectively, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Being heavy could be "a ticking time bomb" triggering off a
series of illness including asthma, arthritis, back problems, high
blood pressure, diabetes and thyroid disorders, a Statistics

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel Thursday opened a
major thoroughfare in the West Bank city of Hebron to Palestinian
traffic.
</P>
<P>
The thoroughfare was closed more than five years ago after the
massacre of 29 Arabs by a Jewish settler.
</P>
<P>
Peter Lerner, spokesman for Israel's civil administration, said
the majority of Shuhada Street, or Martyrs Street, was opened to
all Palestinian vehicles, except trucks, in both directions.
</P>
<P>
In response, Jewish settlers living in the city said that the
road's opening endangered them and they planned to march to
protest the move.
</P>
<P>
Shuhada Street runs through downtown Hebron, which is still
under Israeli occupation. It links two Jewish enclaves in the
city, where some 450 Jewish settlers live or study.
</P>
<P>
In February 1994, Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein gunned down
29 Muslim worshippers in a Hebron mosque. Since then, Shuhada
Street had been closed by Israel to Palestinian traffic to
prevent friction with settlers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have been demanding that the road be opened in
accordance with the signed peace deals with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Any U.S. Attack on Afghanistan Is a Big Mistake: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia has
said that it will be a big mistake for the United States if it
launches any attack on Afghanistan under the excuse of Osama
issue.
</P>
<P>
"The last year cruise missile attack on Afghanistan was an
unjustified action. It was an aggression against Afghanistan. I do
not think that the U.S. government would again take such unwise
action," the Islamabad-based News Network International (NNI)
quoted Taliban spokesman Amir Khan Mutaqqi as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mutaqqi stressed in Kabul during an interview with NNI that
differences between the Taliban and the United States should be
resolved through talks.
</P>
<P>
Problems could not be solved through force, Mutaqqi said,
adding that the Taliban are ready to settle issues with Washington
through talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched Tomahawk missile attack on the
southern Afghan province of Khost last August in a bid to
eliminate the alleged terrorist bases run by Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden. However, Osama remained unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Washington accuses Osama of masterminding the bombing of the
American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on August 7 last year,
which killed more than 220 people including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban supreme leader, Mulla Mohammad Omar, has asked the
world community to provide evidence against Osama for his
involvement in the alleged terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
However, no country, including the United States, has so far
provided any proof.
</P>
<P>
"We are very surprised that why the United States is so worried
about Osama, who is unable to operate against any country from
Afghan soil," Mutaqqi said.
</P>
<P>
"Exploitation of the Osama issue is not in the interests of
both Afghanistan and the United States," said Mutaqqi.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban have not invited Osama to Afghanistan
and he has been living in the country before the Taliban captured
Jalalabad and Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"It is Afghanistan's tradition that we protect the person who
takes shelter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Osama is guest and we will never allow Osama to use Afghan
soil against anybody. When Osama can not operate from Afghanistan
so the United States should not spoil relations with the Taliban
because of Osama," the Taliban spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions have been imposed on Osama and he can not operate
against anyone from Afghan soil, the Taliban official said.

<HEADLINE> Hazardous Waste Classifications Need to Be Harmonized, EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said on
Thursday that many of the current international and national
classifications over hazardous waste are not harmonized and it is
complicating data situation in the 15-country EU.
</P>
<P>
"To support politicians in their decisions, there is a clear
need for more precise and reliable statistics based on harmonized
definitions," the EU statistical office, Eurostat, said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
The EU region generated about 27 million tons of hazardous
waste in the mid-1990s and the amount is increasing, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Comparisons between countries can only be indicative due to
different classifications and definitions used by each country,"
it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The report said that hazardous waste is a very sensitive topic
for different sectors in European society.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, politicians and the public have become aware
of the dangers of hazardous waste to the environment and to the
population, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat, which analyzes the situation on hazardous waste
every two years, said last two years saw falls of hazardous waste
in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain, but increasing tendencies
in Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Austria and Norway.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy to See a Bright Future: Vice Premier Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that on the whole, the Chinese economy has
maintained a good momentum of development this year.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the Third Malaysia-China Forum on recovery and
cooperation after the financial crisis, Li said that "We are
convinced that so long as we press ahead with the basic policy of
reform and opening-up, the Chinese economy will have a bright
future."
</P>
<P>
During the one-day gathering co-sponsored by the Asian Strategy
and Leadership Institute of Malaysia and the China National
Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation, participants from
governments and business communities discussed ways to increase
Sino-Malaysian cooperation in financial, trade, scientific,
technological and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Li said on the occasion that this year, in the final run-up to
the new century, the two governments signed the Joint Statement on
Framework for Future Bilateral Cooperation, which mapped out
blueprint and charts the course for the future development of
bilateral ties, adding that the course bilateral relationship has
traversed in the past quarter of a century also shows that the
growing trade and economic cooperation have become the main
driving force of such a relationship.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that with the concerted efforts of
the two governments and peoples, China-Malaysia ties will have
greater vigor and vitality in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Forum has made important contributions to promoting
exchanges and cooperation between the Chinese and Malaysian
business communities since its establishment more than four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the participants on measures China has been
taking to boost its economy, saying that in order to maintain the
momentum of sustainable, rapid and healthy economic growth, the
Chinese government is stepping up macro management.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is imperative to continuously implement the pro-
active fiscal policy and appropriately increase government direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to give full play to the role of monetary
policy and improve the financial supervision mechanism, and to
make efforts to increase the income of medium- and low- income
families in urban areas and that of farmers, and boost household
consumption, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Visit by Americans to Chinese End-Users Resumed: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Visits by Americans to end-users
of U.S. technical exports to China that were suspended after May
have been resumed, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC spokesman Hu Chusheng told reporters at a press
conference organized by the Information Office of the State
Council that MOFTEC has arranged visits by the U.S. side to some
end-users in Beijing this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOFTEC arrangement, the U.S. side has visited end-
users at the China Meteorological Administration and with the
Beijing Municipal Traffic Control Administration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since China and the United States reached an understanding on
visits to end-users in June last year, China arranged six such
visits in 1998, rather than "one visit" as claimed by the Cox
report, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
This year, the U.S. side has so far put forward more than 40
requests to visit Chinese end-users, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO missile attack against the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade last May severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people, and therefore the arrangements of such visits were
suspended thereafter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said China resumed the arrangement of visits in August to
show its "sincerity in cooperation." He said the U.S. side voiced
no objection to those arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that visits to end-users can effectively loosen the
restriction the U.S. side has imposed on export of hi-tech
products to China, thus helping the smooth growth of hi-tech trade
between the two countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Prince Ranariddh Supports PM's Stance on KR Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
President Prince Ranariddh expressed Thursday his support to Prime
Minister Hun Sen's stance that foreign judges should not have a
majority in any joint tribunal with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh made the remarks upon his return from
Indonesia after a three-day visit at the invitation of his
Indonesian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
He told the reporters at the airport that it is a Cambodian
tribunal, so foreign countries must respect the sovereignty of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing for Cambodia is to maintain the
national reconciliation and country's peace and stability, so we
must treat it (trial of Khmer Rouge leaders) properly and
seriously," Ranariddh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen Tuesday clearly rejected a
U.N. proposal for foreign judges to outnumber Cambodian judges in
any joint tribunal with the United Nations to try Khmer Rouge
leaders for genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. plan, which is to be presented to the Cambodian
government next week by U.N. legal experts, the court would have
either five or seven judges, but Cambodia's judges will be in a
minority.

<P>
Li went on to say that it is essential to vigorously develop
education as desired by consumers and required by the strategy of
revitalizing the country through science and education, so as to
make it a contributing factor to the national economy, adding that
it is necessary to adopt effective measures and more preferential
policies towards export-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is imperative to speed up the implementation of a
new housing distribution system by which all relevant factors are
calculated in and based on monetary terms and turn the housing
sector into a new growth point, the Chinese vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is also important to continuously strengthen
infrastructure, give priority to hi-tech industry, and promote the
upgrading and optimization of the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Judging by their present results, the above-mentioned policy
measures have already played a positive role in promoting economic
growth, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir bin Mohamad said
on the occasion in a speech entitled "Malaysia and China Relations:
Challenges and Opportunities in the 21st century" that both sides
have maintained very good ties since the establishment of
diplomatic relations 25 years ago, and cooperation in trade,
investment, science, technology and education has been progressing.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Malaysian mutually-beneficial ties have
convinced both sides of the need and desirability to forge ahead
for an even closer relationship into the new century, adding that
China's actions for the well-being of east Asia in the Asian
financial crisis has been most laudable, and the regional
economies and the international community at large greatly
appreciated China's decision -- not to devalue RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing's cooperation and high sense of responsibility has
spared the region of a much worse consequence," the Malaysian
prime minister said, adding that the price China has to pay to
help east Asia is high, and Malaysian people truly appreciate
China's stand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met with a
delegation of Japanese desert afforestation experts here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Masayoshi Takemura, a member of the
House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, is scheduled to
plant trees in the deserts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
together with Chinese volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of this symbolic act to be carried out by the
Japanese delegation and Chinese youth.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has paid much attention to
the environmental protection, established the sustainable
development strategy and listed environmental protection as an
important part of its long-term strategy for the economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the environmental problem is common among all
countries, and the people of all nations should work cooperatively
to promote environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Masayoshi Takemura and his delegation's
involvement in afforestation efforts in China's deserts creates a
new avenue for Sino-Japanese cooperation, adding that this will
inspire more to work for the afforestation of the country.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that both China and Japan are important
countries, and a sound and healthy relationship between them will

<HEADLINE> Risk Investment Needed to Promote Industrialization of High-Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The development of risk
investment in China can help promote the industrialization of high
technology, said Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, today.
</P>
<P>
We are hopeful that China can build up an improved risk
investment system within five to ten years by establishing
consultative and management companies and setting up funds for
risk investment, Cheng told the ongoing symposium "Invigorating
China Through Science and Education" in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since risk investment goes mainly into the development of new
technology and products, it involves fairly large risks, Cheng
said, and the successful rate for such investment is only about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
To disperse risks, this investment usually goes to a group of
more than ten projects so that money earned from the successful
projects can be used to make up for the losses of the unsuccessful
ones, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Cheng pointed out that to promote the development of risk
investment in China, problems such as the selection of promising
projects and the accumulation of necessary funds must be solved.
</P>
<P>
China must establish risk investment consulting and management
companies to assess and recommend risk investment projects to
domestic and overseas investors and manage these projects as
mandated by the investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, risk investment funds should be set up and corresponding
laws, regulations, and management rules formulated to absorb funds
from both home and broad.
</P>
<P>
The practice of risk investment began in China in 1985 with the
establishment of the China New Technology Development and
Investment Corporation. Scientific and technological development
and investment companies and relevant funds were set up in some
areas later on, and risk investment funds based on overseas
capital began to enter China in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
These companies and funds have made a variety of contributions
to the development of high technology in China.

<HEADLINE> Expert Suggests Increased Fund for Basic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China should increase spending
on basic research projects, especially those which are related to
national scientific and technological development goals, a Chinese
scientist suggested here today.
</P>
<P>
The fund for research and development (R&AMP;D) should be raised
from the current 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product to 1.5
percent, said Zhang Cunhao, president of the National Natural
Science Foundation of China.
</P>
<P>
As a major source of innovation, basic research is, directly or
indirectly, giving impetus to economic growth and social progress,
Zhang told the ongoing symposium "Invigorating China Through
Science and Education" in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that basic research is providing an important basis for
reforming and upgrading traditional industries in China, and noted
that a portion of basic research should be geared to new and high
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the National Natural Science Foundation of China
has decided to raise the percentage for pure research to 42.5
percent of the total investment in both pure and applied research,
compared with only 30 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Export Growth Rate Picking Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The declining rate of China's
exports has been narrowing from January to July this year,
according to Hu Chusheng, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Hu briefed the Chinese and foreign press on China's foreign
trade development here today, saying China's export growth rate is
picking up and the decline will be reversed.
</P>
<P>
China reported a total trade volume of 189.11 billion U.S.
dollars in the first seven months this year, up 5.4 percent.
Exports dropped 2.8 percent to 100.2 billion U.S. dollars while
import increased 16.6 percent to 88.91 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that export went up 7.5 percent to 17.34
billion U.S. dollars in July, the highest monthly volume and the
second monthly increase in the past three months this year.
</P>
<P>
China's decrease rate of exports has been narrowing during the
past seven months, which proves that the measures taken by the
government have won initial success, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Exports will remain difficult in the following months; however,
more positive factors have appeared since those countries hit by
the Asian financial crisis have been recovering, he said.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC is confident of meeting the goal of expanding exports,
he said, adding that total trade volume this year is expected to
exceed that of last year, and there are hopeful signs that exports
will also continue to increase.

<HEADLINE> APT, LORAL Sign Long-term Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- APT Satellite Holdings Limited,
a Hong Kong-based satellite service provider, and Loral Space and
Communications Limited have agreed to lease substantially all of
APT's APSTAR-IIR transponders for the remaining life of the
satellite.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the total utilization of the satellite close to
its full capacity.
</P>
<P>
With this contract, APT will receive a satisfactory and stable
revenue of 304 million U.S. dollars over the coming years. And
LORAL, in turn, will significantly increase its transponder
capacity in the Asia Pacific region, establishing a solid foothold
in the broadcasting and telecommunications business in the region
and further enhancing its global satellite network.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the lease rental will be settled over 18
installments within a period of four years. With this substantial
income, APT will further strengthen its financial position and
will be able to re-allocate its efforts and capital resources in
developing, as planned, additional high-power satellites, such as
APSTAR-III and APSTAR-IV as well as APSTAR-V (a replacement
satellite for APSTAR-I).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerian New Government Inherits 2.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new civilian
administration inherited a budget deficit of more than 256
billion naira (about 2.7 billion U.S. dollars) on resumption of
office on May 29, reported a Nigerian newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Minister of Finance Mallam Ciroma, said in Abuja on
Wednesday that the government had been financing the deficit by
borrowing from the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Government was compelled to take this precautionary measure to
avoid destabilizing the macro-economic stability of the nation,
though the borrowings from the central bank led to an increase in
inflation rate from eight percent to 12 percent, the Guardian, a
major Nigerian newspaper Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on factors that necessitated the supplementary
budget, which was recently presented to the National Assembly as
a draft bill, Ciroma further explained that increase in the wages
and salaries of workers showed and the 1999 budget could no
longer finance government's commitment.
</P>
<P>
He added that the advent of a new government and the
establishment of new ministries and parastatals also indicated
that the 1999 budget needed to be revised.

BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar are forging
closer ties and strengthening cooperation as the two countries are
planning to sign agreements on cultural exchange and visa
exemption for diplomats and officials, the official Thai News
Agency (TNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony will be held in the Rangoon, capital of
Myanmar, at the Fifth Joint Commission meeting between the two
countries to be held from August 23 to 25, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
The agreements followed an accord on cooperation in the
suppression of drug trafficking along the border, which was
reached at a meeting of senior Thai and Myanmar officials held in
Thailand's southern province of Ranong this week.
</P>
<P>
At the Joint Commission meeting, Thai Foreign Minister Surin

OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A forest fire which erupted
Tuesday around the northern community of Edzo in Canada's
Northwest Territory "is still out of control," said the police
Wednesday.

The fire spread to five square kilometers within hours of
eruption and further grew to eight square kilometers Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Accepting The Idea Of A "Tree Burial" For Their Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- More of the Chinese elderly here
are getting used to the idea of having their ashes buried under a
trees after they die instead of in a graveyard.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yuhuan, a 78-year-old retired construction worker, is one
advocate of the method and says that it's the best reform since
the 10 million babies born in China every year and the water and
soil erosion, desertification, and construction are causing a
rapid decrease in the amount of land.
</P>
<P>
The tree burial saves land resources and contributes to
afforestation say civil affairs department officials. Most of the
ashes of deceased people are now put in graveyards in Taiyuan, the
capital of Shanxi Province, where there are 7 cemeteries. Yong'an
Yuan (Eternal Peace Garden) is one example. A 1.5-sq.m. plot there
costs as much as 4,200 yuan (about 500 U.S. dollars), and a 2-sq.m.
plot for a couple goes for 6,000 to as much as 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tree burial is comparatively economical and trouble-free. All
that is needed is a hole in the ground where the ashes of the dead
are put and a tree planted. The cost is about 200 to 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in rebirth, I just want my burial to be simple
and not too much of a financial burden for my children," says Wang
Xiaoban, a retired worker, who adds that pines are evergreens and
represent eternity, so a tree burial is the best way to keep the
elderly "safe and happy until they return to the earth" and the
need to commemorate the dead.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and
Shenyang are all pushing tree burials and sea burials. Nanjing,
one of the first to advocate tree burials, recently issued a
notice that the local government will not allow any more land to
be used for graveyards, with the final goal of saving no ashes and
occupying no land.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Raise Thai Export Forecast to 3.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supachai, also Commerce Minister, was quoted by Thailand News
Agency as saying that the expected upward revision was based on
three reasons, including a steadily upward trend of Thai exports
over the past four months, stabilization of prices level and
stable exchange rates of Thai currency baht.
</P>
<P>
IMF informed the Thai government that given the positive
factors it would revise growth forecast of Thai Exports this year
from the previous figure of 2 percent to a revised 3.5 percent,
Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the IMF new projection, the Thai economy could grow by
as much as 3 percent this year, from the government's earlier
forecast of 1 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Supachai also said that he still believed the country's exports
this year could achieve the government's target of 4 percent,
citing that a latest report by the Board of Investment (BOI)
showed that production and export of locally-made products in key
industries under its supervision grew by 8 percent in the first
seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
BOI oversees 46 percent of the country's overall exports.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister earlier projected that Thai exports
next year could grow by 5 percent as the Thai economy was steadily
recovering from its worst crisis in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry announced earlier this week that overall
Thai exports in the January-July period accounted for 32.21
billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 592 million dollars or 1.9
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government and the IMF are expected to complete a
quarterly review of the Thai economy this week. They are expected
to give an upbeat assessment of Thailand's recovery prospects in
the report likely to be announced by the government late this
month.

<HEADLINE> China Optimistic About Attracting Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China can still attract a
relatively large sum of overseas investment this year despite the
fact that overseas investments in China declined in the January-
July period, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here Today.
</P>
<P>
China approved a total of 9,368 new overseas-funded enterprises
between January and July this year, involving contractual overseas
investment of 22.28 billion US dollars, down 20.5 percent from the
same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
The amount of actual overseas investments arrived was 21.49
billion US dollars, down 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chusheng, spokesman for MOFTEC, called the declining of
investments mainly a result of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Nations affected by the crisis in Asia lack the ability to
invest abroad," he said during a press conference here Thursday. "
But Asia remains the biggest source of overseas investments for
China."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said China has been left out of international
capital flow for the past several years, and that these funds are
going mainly to developed countries in America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, China has witnessed a sluggish market this year,
which in turn has dampened the enthusiasm of some overseas
investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that MOFTEC is still optimistic about the amount of
overseas investment China will attract this year.
</P>
<P>
The government is making active efforts to expand the areas
opened to overseas investors, and to improve the investment
environment, he said. China is also seeking more overseas capital
to help the reform of State-owned enterprises and the
restructuring of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that the amount of overseas investment this year
will still be a relatively large sum," he concluded.

MACAO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department will issue a set of stamps featuring
dainty foods on August 21.
</P>
<P>
The set consists of four stamps with each having a face value
of 2.5 patacas (31 U.S. cents). A total of 1.25 million sets will
be issued, sources with the department said at a press conference
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some relevant products such as souvenir sheets,

even promote social contacts.
</P>
<P>
The set of stamps will be the ninth issued by the department
this year. Local stamps are valued by some collectors for Macao is
a place blending Chinese and Western cultures. Macao stamps tend

Reunification will make China much stronger, inject new energy
into Taiwan's economy, and bring prosperity to both sides of the
Taiwan Straits. It will also allow the Taiwanese to enjoy the
glory of China as a large country and save Taiwan huge military
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Reunification will bring benefit and no harm, and accords with
the fundamental interests and general aspiration of the Chinese
nation, including compatriots in Taiwan, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese history shows that begging for peace, giving up
territory, and paying compensations have deeply hurt all the
Chinese people and Lee's "two states" remark baldly advocated
breaking China into 7 regions. From his "one China, two states"
proposal to his "Republic of China as an independent sovereign
country", "seven regions" and "two states" statements, Lee Teng-

says.
</P>

Lee has undermined the national sovereignty and territorial
integrity, betrayed the supreme interests of the nation, and stung
the hearts of the Chinese people, it says.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he can be called the number one filth of the
nation, but those who uphold unity and oppose divisiveness will
prosper and those who resist this historic trend will perish.

HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong manufacturers
generally anticipate little changes in the volume of orders in the
second half of 1999 compared with the same period of last year,
according to a survey released Thursday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by the manufacturing industry, manufacturers in the
wearing apparel industry generally anticipate some drops in the
volume of orders in the second half of 1999 as compared with the
same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, most of the manufacturers in the
textiles, printing and fabricated metal products industries
anticipate a fairly stable volume of orders.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the manufacturers in the electronic and
electrical products and electrical machinery industry expect a
mild increase in the volume of orders.
</P>
<P>
In general, manufacturers expect capacity utilization to remain
stable in the second half compared with the first half. Profit
margins are however forecast to be lower in the second half
compared with the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
On export performance, exporters generally anticipate little
change to some decreases in the value of both domestic exports and
re-exports in the second half of 1999 compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, these expectations made in the middle of 1999 are
more optimistic than those made at the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the bankers also anticipate little change to
some declines in the value of total exports.

NANNING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The city of Beihai on the south
China coast in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region used 21.54
million U.S. dollars worth of foreign direct investment in the
first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
This was an increase of 69.34 percent over the same period last
year. Beihai also had increases in foreign trade from January to
June. Mayor Jin Renshou says that the city's efforts to improve
the database and management of projects and to promote investment
in the first half of the year paid off.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have shown strong interest in the city's
sectors of tourism, technology, marine resources, and agriculture
and 12 overseas-financed projects with 15.63 million U.S. dollars
were approved.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade departments have explored new markets while
solidifying traditional export markets. The city increased exports
of fireworks, farm pesticides, and leather products from January
to June.
</P>
<P>
The city is on a 107-kilometer coastline with a 2,000-year
history of merchant vessels sailing west to the Indian Ocean,
through the Malay Peninsula, and up along Myanmar's coast. With
Southeast Asia just across the bay and Hong Kong and Macao close,
Beihai is a natural exit for parts of China farther inland. Its
geographical position, infrastructure, and improved "software"
environment have made it more appealing to domestic businessmen.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Of Japanese Use Of "Comfort Women" In Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's historians have
discovered new evidence in the city of Tianjin on the use of "
comfort women", or women who were forced to provide sexual
services to Japanese troops during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Many original documents have been found, including orders from
the Japanese military and the numbers and names of some of
comfort women.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hongxiang, a scholar of the anti-Japanese war, says that
these archives are merely the tip of the iceberg. Tianjin was a
military base for the Japanese invaders and a major area for the
forceful recruiting of such women. Zhang estimates that there must
have been more than 1,000 "comfort women" taken in Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> APEC Members Won't Accept Two-States Theory: Thai Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Lee Teng-hui's so-called
"two-states theory" will not be accepted by members of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a senior Thai Foreign
Ministry official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak Chutikul, director of the Thai Foreign Ministry's
Economic Department, made the remark in the ministry when asked
about the upcoming APEC informal leadership conference in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
APEC members, which abide by the one-China policy, hold that
Taiwan attends the APEC meetings as an economic entity within
China and that the "two-states" theory is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui said in early July that Taiwan should handle its
relations with mainland China on a "state-to-state" basis.
</P>
<P>
Several members of the APEC have sent messages to Taiwan,
warning the island that it will not get support if it raises the
"two-states" issue at the APEC informal leadership conference,
scheduled in mid-September, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand's stance has always been clear that Taiwan is not a
state, not a sovereign state at all," Kobsak said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Will Not Allow Aceh Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government would
not allow Aceh independence, Minister of Defense and
Security/Indonesian Military (TNI) Commander Gen. Wiranto said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said any rational aspirations of the Acehnese could be
discussed with the government.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto urged the separatist Free Aceh Movement (GAM) not to
raise its flag in the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
"Don't kill people, don't terrorize and pressure people, don't
kill security officers and don't destroy government and public
facilities and also don't raise GAM flag. If they surrender their
weapons, then we discuss what the Acehnese want. We talk," Wiranto
told reporters after a session with the House of Representatives
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of some 300 local political, social,
religious and youth leaders in Banda Aceh, capital of Aceh on
Wednesday, Wiranto said the military will declare a state of
emergency in Aceh if separatist rebels continue employing violence
and the situation becomes uncontrollable, he was quoted by
national newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto's visit to Aceh came amid escalating clashes between
the military and the separatists, which have claimed hundreds of
lives on both sides this year and forced about 150,000 residents
to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The military has drawn fire for atrocities in the province,
especially during the Military Operation (DOM) period in
1989-1999.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie, who revoked the DOM status early this
year, has apologized for the military's brutality in the region.

<P>
TOKYO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of Japanese women Thursday
called on the Japanese government to lift sanctions against the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and resume dialogue
with it to normalize diplomatic relations, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a petition submitted to Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hiromu Nonaka by Sumiko Shimizu, a House of Councillors
member from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and leader of the
Japan Women's Federation of Associations for Solidarity with
Korean Women, and three other members of the group.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese women said the government should resume offering
humanitarian aid to the DPRK and holding dialogue with the country
to respond to a statement released by Pyongyang on August 10.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK statement said, "If Japan opts to open good-neighborly
relations through liquidation of the past, the DPRK will welcome
it with pleasure."
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on Japan to apologize and provide
compensations for "all its past crimes."
</P>
<P>
Japan imposed the sanctions, including freezing food aid and
suspending talks for normalizing diplomatic ties, following DPRK's
launch on August 31 last year of a three-stage rocket, part of
which flew over Japan before splashing into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang said the rocket was for sending a satellite into
orbit, but Japan has maintained it was the test launch of a

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The residence of Cao Xueqin, who
wrote the classical Chinese novel "Dream of Red Mansions" in the
mid-18th century, was discovered in Beijing recently.
</P>
<P>
The 17-room compound with a courtyard is located on Guangqumen
Street in the southeastern part of Beijing. It had been broken up
for 20-some households.
</P>
<P>
Cao's great grandfather, grandfather, father, and uncle all
held administrative posts in Jiangning Prefecture (present-day
Nanjing and surrounding counties) and his great grandmother helped
nurse Emperor Kangxi.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth year of the Emperor Yongzheng reign (1727), the
Cao family who had been favored by the previous emperor, were
accused of embezzling funds and their estates were confiscated and
they fell into disgrace and moved from Jiangning to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars and members of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing recently met twice at
Cao's former residence and said that the number of rooms and the
layout of the compound tally exactly with the description in a
document from Chinese historical archives.
</P>
<P>
One scholar said that the characters for "dignified and upright
" on screens in the eastern part of the courtyard appeared in "
Dream of Red Mansions".
</P>
<P>
Feng Qiyong, the director of the "Dream of Red Mansions"
Research Institute, asked for the restoration of the compound to
make it a popular site for visitors.

below 30 percent, compared with 80 percent in developed countries.
Some analysts say that this wide gap is primarily the result of
insufficient funds and an unreasonable funding-raising system.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an has been seen as a potential "Silicon Valley" in western
China because of its concentration of universities, key state
research institutes, and industrial companies. The Xi'an New and
High-tech Development Zone had more than 2,000 high-tech
enterprises added over the past 7 years with combined earnings
from scientific, industrial and trade development this year of 20
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jing Junhai, head of the zone's management committee, says that
the governments of Xi'an and various western provinces have been
doing their best to provide funds for high-tech development, but
companies still have difficulties getting adequate funds for
expansion.

<HEADLINE> Nature Reserve Being Sealed Off For Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'NING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of northwest
China's Qinghai Province has decided to close the Hol Xil Nature
Reserve to livestock grazing and wild animal hunting by early next
year to help its afforestation drive, a government official
announced here recently.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to protect the rare wildlife and plants in
the region and to preserve the ecology, according to Lu Wenzheng,
a provincial government official in charge of the program.
</P>
<P>
Hol Xil is the largest wildlife zone in China. It has 250 types
of wild animals and plants including the Tibetan antelope, wild
yak, and snow leopard, living at an average elevation of 5,000
meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
There have been at least 60,000 people in Hol Xil this year
digging up medicinal herbs, prospecting for gold, or hunting rare
animals, Lu said. China has cracked down on poaching Tibetan
antelope and other rare animals there on many occasions. A major
raid earlier this year netted 13 groups of poachers and 388
Tibetan antelope hides.

<HEADLINE> World's First Giant Panda Triplets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda at the Chengdu
Giant Panda Breeding Research Center in southwest China's Sichuan
Province has given birth to three cubs, the first recorded birth
of giant panda triplets.
</P>
<P>
The center's director, Zhang Hemin, said today that the cubs
weighed around 140 g. each at birth on Wednesday. The mother and
the cubs are in good condition. Two are now with the mother and
the third is being taken care of by staff members.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old mother had had six cubs, four of which survived.
She was artificially inseminated last April. China used artificial
insemination to produce the first giant panda cub in 1963. Fewer
than 10 percent of the center's males and 24 percent of its
females are able to mate by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The 30-hectare center, located at the Wolong Nature Reserve in
the northern suburbs of Chengdu, was developed by the Chinese
government and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in 1980 and has
successfully bred 24 giant pandas since 1991, of which 15 survived.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas have one or two cubs each time. A new giant panda
cub was born at the Chongqing Zoo in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality earlier this month. There are only about 1,000 giant
pandas both in captivity and in the wild across the world, 80
percent of them in Sichuan.

The Chinese government set aside 1 billion yuan for a technical

prepared to get involved in China's risky investment development.
In the past one and a half year, 20 overseas companies have come

Co. and Vertex Management (II) of Singapore are experimenting with
venture capital in two high-tech enterprises of the zone.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Communities to Back Anti-Drug Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
voiced the hope that communities would help anti-drug operatives
to crack down drug traffickers following the launching of
village-based strike operations.
</P>
<P>
The operations, aimed at combatting narcotic abusers and
traffickers, are now being carried out by the Village Anti-Drug
Abuse Councils, Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Jewel Canso, head of the National Drug Law
Enforcement Prevention Coordinating Center, as saying that
villages nationwide are preparing for the anti-drug operations by
providing his office with a list of suspected drug pushers in the
community.
</P>
<P>
Canso said these watch lists also include known drug users with
connections to drug traffickers operating outside the community as
well.
</P>
<P>
"These will also be the subjects of preventive operations," he
said, adding that coordination will be enhanced between the
village councils and his center.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is now in the middle stage of a war
against the drug trade, which is deemed as a major threat to the
youth and a major cause of heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has vowed to impose the
full force of the law against drug traffickers, ruling out
granting pardon to anyone sentenced to death for drug trafficking.

<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese volunteers plan to
spend 72 hours in closely-monitored conditions with an electronic
network as their sole connection with the outside world in the
first experiment of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
It is being sponsored by the Ministry of Information Industry
and other organizations to examine living with the country's
electronic network and domestic networking.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers will come from Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou
and are being chosen without regard to gender or age. They are
applying via the net and will be voted on by net-users, with the
final decision made by psychologists.
</P>
<P>
For the 72-hour period they will have to try to survive via the
net using 1,500 yuan in cash and 1,500 yuan in electronic currency
which is being provided by the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry, China's networks have been
developing at a surprisingly rapid pace. In 1998, it had 2.1
million net users and that figure went to more than 4 million by
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry is eager to learn how the network will affect
people's lives in the future.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Fight in Kenyan Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Fighting has broken out between
Oromo Liberation Front militiamen and Ethiopian troops in Taki and
Githeer areas of Mandera District in Kenya's North Eastern
Province, bordering Ethiopia and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Sounds of heavy artillery and bombardment could be heard from
Takaha Town, 30 kilometers from Taki, where the battle has been
raging since Monday, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported last weekend that about 300 rebels from
the Oromo Liberation Front of Ethiopia had been spotted in the
Malaba hills of northern part of North Eastern Province, who were
forced out of their camps in Somalia by the Ethiopian troops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenyan security forces are closing in the remote
hills along the Ethiopian border where the armed Ethiopian rebels
are hiding themselves there.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan villagers have moved from Taki and Githeer to Takaba
Town where residents expressed fear that the fighting could
extend to the area as defeated Oromo rebels are said to be
retreating toward the town.
</P>
<P>
Mandera District Commissioner James Seriani said he had
dispatched a contingent of security personnel to the scene for
getting information of the fighting, and the provincial
administration also launched an operation to flush out the rebels
from the hills.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the Ethiopian government claimed
last Thursday its army had killed more than 700 Oromo Liberation
Front rebels in the east of the country over the past two months
and a half, while the rebel front said last Friday its soldiers
had put 1,500 Ethiopian government forces out of action during
the same period.

items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.

<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Talks with the Palestinian National Authority broke down
Wednesday night over the issue of prisoner release. The meeting
was broke up after the government's negotiator, Gilad Sher, told
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat that the security cabinet
decided not to change criteria for releasing prisoners set by the
previous government, and would therefore only be letting out a
limited number of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Osama El Baz, one of President Hosni Mubarak's most senior
advisors, earlier this week demanded that Israel agree to nuclear
disarmament under the supervision of the International Atomic
Energy Agency. He called for the entire region to become a
nuclear-free zone within five to seven years. He said if Israel
did not agree to dismantle its nuclear program, the Arabs would
feel threatened, and would develop non-conventional weapons
systems of their own, based on chemical and biological
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- In a conciliatory gesture to PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat,
the government Wednesday released one long-term prisoner Khalil

sentenced to life imprisonment in 1974 for the murder of an
Israeli police officer.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot:
</P>
<P>
-- An Israeli military rescue team set out Wednesday night

missing. The Israel Police representative in Istanbul told the
Israeli news agency Itim that three Israeli families had turned
to the Israeli consulate for help after their relatives in the
resort could not be located.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Rural Power Grid to Help Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase
construction work and improvements on power grids in rural areas
to help rural economic growth by stimulating consumer demand,
according to the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun, of the SDPC, said here today that the government will
spend 65 billion yuan on the work this year, 13 billion yuan of
which will come from treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a pro-active fiscal policy since the second
half of 1998 and rural power grids are one of six top-priority
items in infrastructure, whose purpose is to stimulate consumer
demand. By the year 2000, China will have completed these projects
in 2,400 counties at a cost of 180 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The rural power supply projects are expected to help the growth
of a number of related industries like building materials,
machinery and telecommunications because the construction work
will mean a need for equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
The new power grids will also cut electricity losses by a great
deal, which will in turn bring down the price of electricity. As a
result, spending on TVs, washing machines, refrigerators, and
other household appliances will increase rapidly in China's vast
rural areas, where 70 percent of its people live.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Move Lower in Tokyo on Weak Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower in Tokyo
Thursday, with export-oriented issues dampened by the U.S. dollar'
s weakness against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped 12.52 points, or 0.07
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at to 17,879.74. The index
marked its first fall in nine trading day's.

sharply down from 113.07-09 yen late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Rallies to Be Staged Against Charter Change in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people from
different sectors in the Philippines are expected to join a
protest rally set for Friday to force the government to drop its
Charter change agenda.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the number of the people to attend the
August 20 rally led by former president Crazon Aquino and Manila
Archbishop Jaime Sin will range from 10,000 to half a million.
</P>
<P>
The protest-rally reports came amid the government's proposal
to revise some provisions of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Charter revision or amendment is said to involve political
changes as well as economic reform, both of which seem to be
intolerable moves to the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said groups opposing the charter changes have
planned simultaneous protest rallies in at least nine major cities
all over the country on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nine nongovernmental groups are also reportedly joining hands
to lend support to the Friday rally in Makati, Manila.
</P>
<P>
Threats from the New People's Army to bomb the rally and
assassinate rally organizers, Aquino and Cardinal Sin, have
prompted police and military officials to put their troops on
alert around Manila.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is giving heads of schools and
private offices directions to suspend classes and work in Manila
on Friday in anticipation of the mass rallies.

<HEADLINE> Booming Development Zone In Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing Economic and
Technological Development Zone in southwest China reported rapid
development in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The zone's gross domestic product increased a year-on-year 41.
23 percent and its industrial added value surged 47.8 percent
during the period. Financial revenue and trade volume of the
development zone soared 51.5 percent and 37.2 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1990, the zone, which was approved as a
state-level one in 1993, has invested a total of 900 million yuan
to build infrastructure facilities and develop 32,000 sq. km. of
land.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1998, the zone's gross domestic product
totaled 6.22 billion yuan and its industrial added value stood at
13.5 billion yuan, registering an annual increase of 25.8 percent
and 49.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in the zone has reached 1.13 billion U.S.
dollars, with investors coming from 23 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government Urged to Further Curb Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A Kenya's major newspaper
Thursday urged the government to take tough measures to curb bank
robberies.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation mentioned in a commentary that recently six
robbers singing hymns took over a bank for three hours, robbing a
total of nine million shillings (about 121,000 U.S. dollars) from
bank workers and customers.
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst ridicule of our security apparatus in recent
times," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It said that the recent spate of bank robberies, two of which
had occurred in broad daylight on Kenyatta Avenue, with the
criminals displaying an aura of calmness and bravado, had not
done the police image any good, noting that similar robberies had
also happened in other towns.
</P>
<P>
Until the police keep the criminals at bay, there will be
widespread panic among the public and law and order will break
down, the article warns.
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary admits that police alone could not
eliminate crime and called on the public to provide tips to the
police.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyan Police, crime cases in the first half of
this year were on a decline compared to those in the same period
of last year.

The government has promised to provide substantial manpower,

China has increased efforts to combat narcotics since 1997 and

drug dealers still pose a serious threat to social security and to
people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Regional Recovery Benefits HK Electronics Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The gradual revival of
electronics production in Southeast Asian economies in recent
months should bode well for Hong Kong's electronics industry,
according to a report just published by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
The report said that as Singapore and Taiwan's electronics
exports have started to pick up, demand for Hong Kong's parts and
components will increase.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's exports of parts and components to Singapore were
up seven percent in 1998 to 2,061 million U.S. dollars compared
with 1997. The exports grew by a further two percent in the first
quarter of 1999. Though total exports of electronics products to
China's Taiwan remain uninspiring in the first quarter, the report
expects orders from the island's electronics industry to pick up.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Hong Kong and the two economies have
different product mixes, with only very few items overlapping. The
differences in product assortment and industry nature have
resulted in limited competition.
</P>
<P>
The picture is quite contrary to an earlier perception that
Hong Kong would be threatened by price competition of electronics
products from Singapore and Taiwan due to currency depreciation in
the two economies.
</P>
<P>
The two economies are indeed niche markets for local
electronics exporters, says the report, adding that both of them
have a strong base of manufacturing, creating demand for certain
electronics parts and components for their export production.
</P>
<P>
Singapore needs to source a wide range of parts and components,
particularly the low-to-medium-range items from Hong Kong for
manufacturing finished and semi-finished electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
Also, Singapore has to import a wide range of consumer
electronics due to a narrow scope of its finished goods for local
consumption, thus creating a niche for Hong Kong exporters.
</P>
<P>
To tap the Singapore market, the report suggests that local
exporters of simple consumer electronics consider direct sales to
respective manufacturers and larger retailers in Singapore, saying
that these items have standard specifications, and less reliance
on technical support and after-sales service.
</P>
<P>
For the sales of electronics products to China's Taiwan, the
report says that a marketing network is required as Taiwan is much
larger than Singapore. Selling to trading companies, which can
usually promote sales on their own account in most parts of the
island, is one of the viable options for Hong Kong exporters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to market analysis, entry strategies, distribution
channels and latest development of the industry in Singapore and
Taiwan, the report also provides useful information on the
Singapore Science Park, Taiwan's Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park, trade events and exhibitions, contacts of government
departments, agencies and business associations of the two places
for handy reference.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Singapore and Taiwan were respectively the fourth and
sixth largest markets of Hong Kong for electronics products. The
two economies together absorb around 10 percent of Hong Kong's
total electronics exports.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Minister Speaks About International Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan,
in a report on the international situation and China's diplomatic
work to senior Party and government officials and military
officers here today, said that the trend toward relaxation in
international affairs has not changed and that peace and
development are the two main topics now.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting organized by the Publicity Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and other departments,
Tang said that there have been important changes in the
international situation and international relations this year and
today's world is still not peaceful and tranquil and that factors
of instability, uncertainty, and unrest in politics and the
economy and the number of regional ethnic and religious conflicts
and territorial disputes have been increasing. Hegemonism and
power politics are having new development and the issue of
military security is still conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
But, Tang said, there are more opportunities and hopes rather
than challenges and difficulties in the international situation
China is getting involved. He said that the powerfulness and
prosperity of the country provides strong backing for diplomacy
and to maintain social and political stability and develop the
economy in a sustainable, fast and healthy way is the fundamental
guarantee for diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
In the complicated international situation, he said, China will,
under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party with Jiang Zemin at the core, adhere to Deng Xiaoping's
ideas on diplomacy, firmly implement its independent foreign
policy of peace, safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
national dignity, and oppose hegemonism and safeguard world peace
to promote the common development of human beings.

<HEADLINE> Ancient City in East China Becomes Industrial Powerhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A high and new-tech zone is
making the ancient Chinese city of Suzhou, eastern Jiangsu
Province, an industrial powerhouse. Today, Suzhou New District (
SND), seven years in existence, contributes more than half of the
city's total industrial output value and exports.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of this year, SND exported 690
million U.S. dollars worth of goods and produced an industrial
output value of 13.34 billion yuan (1.6 billion U.S. dollars), up
42 percent and 66.4 percent respectively from the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
SND, located on the western outskirts of Suzhou, covers 52 sq.
km. It was established in 1992 to attract high-tech investment
from both foreign and Chinese businesses. its location at the
center of the southern jiangsu industrial belt with Shanghai a
mere 80 km to the east and its superior transport conditions give
it all the attractiveness it is expected to have.
</P>
<P>
A rapid development of high-tech industries has contributed to
SND's impressive performance. The number of high-tech enterprises
in the district recognized as such by the state has increased to
107. A growing number of them are beginning to enjoy the benefit
of economies of scale. Annually, for example, the district
produces 50 million computer mice, 14 million liquid crystal
display boards, six million color monitors, 400,000 scanners and
two million computer motherboards. Close to 30 enterprises in the
district export more than 10 million U.S. dollars each annually.
</P>
<P>
So far, total investment in the district has exceeded four
billion U.S. dollars, with most of it going into Chinese-foreign
joint ventures. Of more than 340 such firms and over 2,000
domestic operations in the district, 70 percent have been put into
production. The annual output value of 34 of them has exceeded 100
million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Good economic performance has benefited both Chinese and
foreign partners. Suzhou Philips Consumer Electronics Co., a joint
venture between Suzhou's phoenix TV Factory and Philips of the
Netherlands, became profitable two years after it went into
operation. In 1998, its profit exceeded 170 million yuan. Suzhou
No. 3 Optical Instrument Factory has established in the district
four joint ventures with Japanese and Hong Kong businesses. Its
assets have since increased by close to 30 times.
</P>
<P>
"Given the development momentum, Suzhou New District's economic
growth for the whole of this year is expected to exceed 40 percent,
" said Zhou Yi, an official of the district's Information Office.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Couple at Top of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang and Duoji Zhandui
</P>
<P>
LHASA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The holy flame of the sixth
national ethnic games, which was collected from the "top of the
world" Mountain Qomolangma, lit up the whole stadium and the faces
of RigNa and GiGi.
</P>
<P>
After becoming one of the three Chinese climbers who conquered
10 mountains standing over 8,000 meters high, RigNa made his mark
again with his wife by becoming the first couple to scale the
seemingly invincible Mt. Qomolangma.
</P>
<P>
The couple, together with the other 8 members including another
female climber, have completed the feat of gathering the tinder
from Mt. Qomolangma for the sixth national ethnic games which
kicked off on Wednesday here.
</P>
<P>
The suffering during his odyssey was indelible in RigNa's
memory although he has been an old mariner since he begun his
climbing career 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The life out there was hard. Our dinner time was very casual
and we often trekked for seven or eight hours running. We can only
feed ourselves with chocolate and biscuit."
</P>
<P>
"We will also be liable to altitude illness and felt sick to
anything edible. But we had to take in food no matter how much
antipathy we had to food."
</P>
<P>
"When we arrived at the 6,500 meters line, the most serious
altitude sickness often happened, such as a very bad headache and
the state of being dog exhausted."
</P>
<P>
"But we could not sit or lie down, for this would further
consume our physical power and made us going forward more
difficult. So we just rested our head on the walking stick while
keeping standing poise. "
</P>
<P>
"Our brain will be in a mess and lost sleep at the 7,900 meter
line, and beyond that it would be counted as a great feat if we
managed ten straight steps in one breath."
</P>
<P>
Dangerous and hard as the climb was, RigNa did not beat the
retreat drum.
</P>
<P>
"I just tried something that has not been tested." said the 32-
year-old Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
GiGi, 29, who was the first time to climb Mt. Qomolangma,
talked as if it just happened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"Mountain climbing is very hard. After arriving at the climax
my excitedness was temporary and we were soon preoccupied with
solitude on how to get down in safety."
</P>
<P>
"But I still felt quite honored to shoulder the significant
task of climbing Mt. Qomolangma for kindling material." said GiGi
who escorted the flame torch on the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"This time though we could not take part in the national ethnic
games competition, but I still feel quite honored to attend the
opening ceremony." said GiGi. "In the future if there are chances
I will continue to climb and climb."
</P>
<P>
GiGi lost her sleep on the eve of a 17-hour non-stop trekking
during which she eat nothing and crossed over the climax before
they got down to the ABC (advance Base Camp) at the 6500 meters
line.
</P>
<P>
RigNa gave his wife encouragement while the difficulty had
hardly knock down Gigi, who was the youngest female athlete in the
Tibetan mountain climbing team.
</P>
<P>
"When she suffered altitude illness and felt sick to food, I
required her to eat, otherwise she could not reach the top. And I
tried to care about her on the way for I am much experienced,
knowing how to make precautionary measures against the accidents,
and I am much stronger so that I can recover my physical power
faster than her."
</P>
<P>
To RigNa's great comfort was the strong will of GiGi who was a
long and middle distance runner before she joined the Tibetan
mountain climbing team in 1989.
</P>
<P>
RigNa said that no matter how hard the conditions were, she had
never kneel down before the hardship even when they got a piece of
bad news that three foreign expedition teams, who started in
advance, suffered one death and one serious injury respectively.
</P>
<P>
The couple have never flinched in their expedition but they
showed their paternal side when saying goodbye to their five-year-
old daughter Lhamo Yangchen.
</P>
<P>
GiGi said that at the farewell ceremony to the Mt. Qomolangma
expedition she hid herself inside the crossfield car for she had
no guts to face her daughter and feared seeing the tears on her
face.
</P>
<P>
Crying Lhamo Yangchen broke away from the relatives to hug
tight his father whose tears trickled down the face of Lhamo
Yangchen.
</P>
<P>
During the trekking, GiGi heard the sweet and crisp voice of
Lhamo Yangchen through the satellite telephone but she could not
utter one word before RigNa picked up the call.
</P>
<P>
"Is mother crying? why did she not talk with me?" the innocent
Lhamo Yangchen asked on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
"No, No, she is quite well, " RigNa tried to paper it over
although his eyes had been teary.
</P>
<P>
Both RigNa and GiGi are reluctant to let their daughter to
follow their footsteps for "the mountain climbing is too hard and
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
"But if she is persistent in taking upon the enterprise, we
would not stop her." said the parents.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Boost Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided to encourage domestic economic sectors to boost cotton
production in order to reduce cotton imports, Vietnam news agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a decision issued Tuesday, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said
that establishments and individuals of all economic sectors are
encouraged to develop production of cotton in areas where there
are favorable conditions in terms of soil, climate and labor.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam imports 50,000-60,000 tons of cotton fiber a year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will
coordinate with the People's Committees of cotton-growing
provinces and the Vietnam Garments and Textiles Corporation in
forming concentrated cotton-growing areas, applying intensive
farming technique.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam expanded cotton-growing areas to 24,000 hectares in
1998 with an average yield of 890 kg per hectare. It plans to
further expand the areas to 100,000 hectare by 2010 with an
estimated yield of 1.8 tons per hectare, thus meeting some 25
percent of its textile industry's needs.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Water Supplies Still in Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot water storage in
reservoirs nearly doubled in August compared with the
corresponding period last year, but still fell far short of the
needed volume.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the Cypriot Water Development Department
(WDD) showed that there are 47.1 million cubic meters of water
behind the dams, 20.7 million cubic meters more than in August
1998, the Cyprus Mail newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to WDD, Cyprus needs 57 million cubic meters of water
for domestic use every year and 81 million cubic meters more for
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Last year's drought has prompted the government to announce
that three more desalination plants were on the way to ease the
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
But the arrival of winter rains convinced the government that
maybe there was no need to rush ahead with the costly desalination
plants.
</P>
<P>
Besides, repeated protests of local residents who were unhappy
with the idea of building desalination plants in their
neighborhoods also played a part in government's change of its
mind.
</P>
<P>
The contract for a second permanent desalination plant in
Larnaca area has been signed. But the future of the two proposed
mobile desalination plants remains uncertain.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is expecting a better
holiday season this year, with the latest figure projecting a new
record income of 1 billion Cyprus pounds (2 billion U.S. dollars)
from tourism for 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO), arrivals
in the first six months of this year have increased by 10 percent
from last year's record number in the same period, the Cyprus Mail
newspaper reported Thursday. The per capita spending is also up by
7 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cyprus earned record 880 million pounds (1,760
million dollars) from tourism and this year the receipts are
expected to reach 1 billion pounds (2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The income from tourism has increased by a total 17 percent

per head. "The amount spent per day per person has risen by 1.2
percent," Katsouris said.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Reforms At Money-Losing State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, one of China
's oldest industrial bases, has concrete goals for its state-owned
enterprise reform for the second half of the year, local officials
say.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will help 244 enterprises increase
sales, profits, and taxes by 10 percent by the end of the year and
help half of the 200 enterprises that are suffering losses to make
a profit. It will also help others cut their losses.
</P>
<P>
It will accelerate the pace of modernizing 60 key firms and
change credits to stock in 7 key enterprises like the Anshan Iron
and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has taken steps nationwide to help money-
losing large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises since 1998,
which account for about 30 percent of the 7,680 large and medium-
sized state-owned enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, the minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, says that 1999 is a crucial year for the three-
year reform of state-owned enterprises and the Central Government
will try to hold losses to within 15 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning contributed a great deal to China's economic
development and it will have a positive effect on the whole
country if its reforms go smoothly, according to Vice-premier Wu
Bangguo.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning will stick to its policy of closing down resource-
wasting and ecologically-unsound small coal mines, cement plants,
oil refineries, steel factories, and thermal power plants and will
restructure the oil, chemical, and metallurgy industries.
</P>
<P>
It will also improve macro-economic controls in small and
medium-sized enterprises and get more people with technical and
management skills to come to these enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Be Oil Exporter in 10 Years: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has attracted local and
foreign investments in billions of dollars for oil and energy
development and will be an oil exporter in 10 years, ending
decades of oil imports from neighbor countries.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made by Energy Minister Suleiman Abu Ileim
in an interview with the Jordanian weekly newspaper Star which was
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Suleiman said after years of exploration, shale oil has been
found in southeastern and central Jordan, which holds about 40
billion tons of shale oil that is capable of producing 20 billion
tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan hoped to produce 250,000 tons of shale oil
annually by the year 2007 and the kingdom will be oil
self-sufficient before it becomes an oil exporter within the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Suleiman said local and foreign investments in shale oil
exploration and production have reached 2.4 billion dollars under
his ministry`s ambitious strategy to find out new energy
resources.
</P>
<P>
Another 1 billion dollars of foreign investments were attracted
to boost gas production of the kingdom, he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan totally depends on Iraq for crude oil,
importing 70,000 tons from each day from Baghdad under the
U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Jordan produces 15,000 tons of oil products every day from the
crude oil imports from Iraq, and 40 percent of the products were
used for generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia suspended its oil supply to Jordan after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 because Amman sided with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: South Korea to Cut Military Size by 2015 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will phase its
reductions in armed forces from the current 690,000 to 400,000-500,
000 by the year 2015 in the hope of the peninsula's peaceful
reunification, the local newspaper Dong-A Ilbo reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The defense authority plans to cut the size of the military on
long-term expectations of the unification of the Korean peninsula
and "an atmosphere of peaceful co-existence," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A defense ministry spokesman confirmed to Xinhua Thursday that
the ministry does have a disarmament plan, but giving no specific
figures.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report said the proportion of officers would be
raised from the present 24 percent to over 30 percent by 2015,
while the ratio of the army to the entire military force would be
reduced from 81.2 percent to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the defense ministry would strengthen military
intelligence and precision attack power as it believes security in
northeast Asia will still be affected by uncertain factors in the
21st century, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India to Carry Cargo on 50-50 Basis in Riverine Transit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India have agreed
to carry cargo by the vessels of the two countries on a 50-50
basis in the riverine transit provided by Dhaka, The Independent
daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides singed an agreed minute here on Wednesday at the
end of a two-day meeting of a joint working group of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The working group, comprising officials of both sides at the
level of the joint secretary, was formed in 1997 to find out
modalities for rational implementation of the riverine transit
protocol, which was singed in 1947 between India and then Pakistan
and is being renewed every two years.
</P>
<P>
The agreed minute on the transportation of cargo by vessels of
the two countries would be included in the riverine transit
protocol to be renewed at a scheduled meeting in Dhaka on
September 15 after the approval by the two governments, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The new arrangement would enable Bangladesh to earn from the
cargo transportation business instead of India's one-sided
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Joint Secretary of the Shipping Ministry M. Abdul Huq said the
meeting was held in a "cordial and friendly atmosphere" and the
two sides agreed to find out modalities on the transportation of
cargo by the vessels of the two countries on a 50-50 basis.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Bangladesh and India would undertake quarterly
review and monitoring on the carrying of cargo by the vessels of
both countries on a 50-50 basis, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A report in The Financial Express daily said that under the
provision of the riverine transit protocol, both inter-country and
transit cargoes are to be carried by vessels of the two countries
on a 50-50 basis, but this could not be implemented due to
indifferent attitude of the Indian port authorities.

<HEADLINE> Forest Cover Lowers in Nepal: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A study conducted by the
government says Nepal's forest area has come down to 29 percent
from 37.4 percent in the 1980's, The Kathmandu Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, is yet to be adopted, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation (MFSC)
said there has been a 10 percent rise in the country's shrubland
area, indicating that forest cover has dwindled significantly.
Shrubland area was five percent 10 year ago.
</P>
<P>
It may be said that densely forested areas with over 10 percent
crown cover are categorized as forests while those with less than
10 percent crown cover are considered as shrubland.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted in the 1980's had put Nepal's forest,
grassland and shrubland areas at 37.4, 12 and 5 percent
respectively, while the average annual deforestation rate stood at
1.1 percent. Deforestation rate in the Terai Plain in southern
Nepal was 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts have predicted desertification and unprecedented
environmental disaster if the present trend is not curbed on time.
They said forest cover should occupy at least 43 percent of land
area to maintain environmental balance.
</P>
<P>
Forest cover in Nepal stood at 45 percent until the late
sixties when the tract of land separating the Terai Plain and the
hills was not cleared by settlers from the hilly regions.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the deforestation are attributed to the negligence
of the government over forest conservation and rampant logging
along with population boom.

<HEADLINE> China Urges U.S. to Take Concrete Actions Before Resuming WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China urges the United States to
take more concrete actions to improve bilateral relations and pave
the way for a resumption of negotiations in China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO), a spokesman said here Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chusheng, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said at a press conference that the
current standstill in WTO talks is "totally because of reasons of
the U.S. side."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the U.S. side would take more concrete actions to
improve Sino-US relations, so that conditions would be created for
a resumption of the talks in China's entry into the WTO."
</P>
<P>
He said that important progress was scored during the latest
round of bilateral talks with a dozen countries in Geneva not long
ago. He described the talks as "constructive."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that China has never changed its
attitude and stance in its bid to enter the multilateral trade
body, and the negotiation process has never been suspended.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to join WTO and its predecessor has lasted for
13 years. Important progress was achieved during Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States in the bilateral talks
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations between China and the United States virtually
stopped following the U.S.-led NATO's missile attack on Chinese
embassy in Belgrade last May.
</P>
<P>
Last month, China and Japan, Australia announced respectively
that they have completed bilateral talks on China's WTO entry.

Petritsch, quoted by reports reaching here, said that Bosnian
leaders should make serious efforts so that the goals of the
accord are fully achieved. The accord was signed four years ago to
end the four-year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian diplomat said he will not tolerate extremists and
nationalists and that if necessary, he will use various powers
granted him, including the power to remove Bosnian officials.
</P>
<P>
As for corruption, Petritsch said corruption was an important
topic during his first meeting with Alijia Izetbegovic, member of
Bosnia-Herzegovina's presidency, since he took the post.
</P>
<P>
Graft, bribery and embezzlement of public funds are a realistic
problem in Bosnia, which is distancing the country from the
European Union (EU), Petritsch said.
</P>
<P>
Wiping out corruption in Bosnia is a top priority for the
Office of the High Representative, he said.

Petritsch has served as Austria's ambassador to Belgrade and as

<HEADLINE> Tianjin, Dalian Ports Report Record Cargo Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin port, the largest in
north China, handled 41.29 million tons of cargo and 708,000 TEUs
in the first seven months this year, a record high that was 4.5
and 30.6 percent more than the same period last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China, Dalian port also reported an all-time high
in cargo it handled during the first half of this year. The port
handled 41.07 million tons of goods in the six months, an increase
of 16 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total cargo handled by Tianjin port, import and export
goods increased by 805,000 tons, or 3.91 percent, compared with a
year earlier, while goods for domestic trade rose by 981,000 tons,
or 5.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the increase indicated a recovery of
China's trade with other parts of the world and of its domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Tianjin port administration show
that the goods handled in the seven months included 835,000 tons
of refined oil, up 51.5 percent year on year; 2.54 million tons of
crude oil, up 33.6 percent; and 1.05 million tons of imported
fertilizer, up 24.3 percent. Meanwhile coke and coal handled by
the port decreased by a big margin, with imported grain down 14.4
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
To expand its handling capacity, Tianjin port invested in the
past seven months nearly 300 million yuan (36 million U.S. dollars)
in infrastructure construction, and total investment is expected
to top 900 million yuan for the year.
</P>
<P>
According to port officials, a 35,000-ton dock for nonmetal
minerals will be put into operation by the end of this year at
Tianjin port, while a 50,000-ton coke dock and a 35,000-ton dock
and another 50,000-ton coal dock are expected to go into operation
next June.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Ministers Call For Implementation Of Existing Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- G-15 countries Wednesday
rejected attempts by industrialized nations to erect non-trade
barriers under the garb of new trade issues and resolved to press
for implementation of existing agreements of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day conference in Bangalore, south India,
trade ministers of the G-15 developing countries unanimously
opposed linkage of social clauses with trade and registered a
protest against moves by developed countries to bring in anything
that would result in prevent market access to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Trust of India (PTI), the ministers
recognized three facets of implementation issues and concerns
relating to removal of inequities in the existing agreements,
non-realization of benefits by several developing nations and
special and differential provisions in the Uruguay Round
agreements that have remained unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press in Bangalore on Wednesday, Indian Commerce
Minister Ramakrishna Hedge said that there was a sense of unity
among the member states and a new awareness of the pitfalls ahead
if developing countries rushed in for fresh trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Hedge said that there was a need for G-15 countries to adopt a
mutually-supported position through their permanent
representatives in Geneva to ensure that corrective measures were
taken by the scheduled WTO ministerial meeting in November in
Seattle, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister said that all the delegations disfavored
overloading of the Seattle agenda and many felt that mandated
negotiations and reviews must constitute the core agenda, though
some were prepared for limited add-ones like tariff negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in accordance with the decision of the
trade ministers of the group last February at Montego Bay,
Jamaica, to evolve a coordinated approach to issues likely to come
up at the Seattle conference.
</P>
<P>
However, there are signs of differences among member countries
at the meeting, which issued only a chairman's summary.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying that the summary was not in the form of a
resolution, Hedge said that it reflected the views of the member
states and the kind of consensus that was reached among the 17
countries presented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reaffirmed its commitment to rule-based and
equitable multilateral trading systems resulting in the full
integration of developing countries into the systems for their
economic development and global trade expansion.
</P>
<P>
The delegates noted the need for institutional reforms and
greater transparency in the dispute settlement proceedings of the
WTO and observed that dispute settlement was a process undertaken
between two governments and therefore required very strict
confidentiality at all stages.
</P>
<P>
They urged the ministers at Seattle to clearly recognize that
environmental standards differed from nation to nation and that
the solution lay in mutual recognition of only product-related
standards rather than harmonization of environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Egypt, the current G-15 chairman, asked developing
countries not to allow their differing interests to "obscure"
their vision during the forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting in
which developed nations were expected to attempt to erect
non-trade barriers by raising new issues.
</P>
<P>
Hedge admitted Tuesday that G-15 members might differ on issues
as they were at various stages of development.
</P>
<P>
G-15 came into being during the 9he Non-Aligned Summit in
Belgrade in September 1989, with the intention to create a
functional and compact group of developing countries that could
focus on South-South economic cooperation supported by political
engagement at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
With a combined gross domestic product of over two trillion
U.S. dollars and a trade turnover of 600 billion U.S. dollars,
annual export growth in these countries continued to linger around
4.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Funds Injected into Rural Infrastructure In Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2.16 billion pesos
(54 million U.S. dollars) in funds sourced from foreign donors has
been invested in various rural infrastructure projects by the
Philippine government for the first quarter of 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Horacio Morales, Jr. of the Department of Agrarian
Reform (DAR) said the amount represents more than half of the 3.76
billion pesos (94 million dollars) of the DAR's foreign assisted
physical infrastructure fund for the year.
</P>
<P>
The DAR hopes to provide infrastructure and support services to
710 regions, benefiting close to 600,000 farmer beneficiaries,
Philippine News Agency quoted Morales as saying.
</P>
<P>
The completed projects include irrigation servicing an area of
more than 2,000 hectares, 229 kilometers of farm-to-market roads,
108 linear meters of bridges, 90 water systems, 47
pre-and-post-harvest facilities, and 20.7 kilometers of rural
electrification. Beneficiaries to these projects are 158 regions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 396 other infrastructure projects would be
implemented this year in support of the agricultural modernization
and food security, Morales added.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Myanmar Encounters Sharp Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar absorbed only 619 million
U.S. dollars of foreign investment up to the end of April this
year since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Economic Indicators issued by the
country's Central Statistical Organization, the amount of foreign
investment brought in during the nearly two-year period did not
come up to the amount drawn in the first half of 1997 before the
outbreak of the crisis which reached as high as 892 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the indicators, foreign investment in Myanmar in
fiscal 1998-99 dropped to the lowest level as compared with the
past five fiscal years. The foreign investment hit a peak in
1996-97 with 2.814 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier-General Abel, Myanmar Minister at the Office of the
Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council, admitted at a
business forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) held in Yangon in May this year that ASEAN investment
accounted for almost 60 percent of the total prior to the crisis,
adding that ASEAN investment fell by 70 percent in 1998 after the
outbreak of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the steep drop in Myanmar's foreign
investment, he said, is the impact of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to cope with the problem, Myanmar
promulgated the 1999 State Budget Law in March this year,
declaring to restrict expenditure from the state reserve fund and
the taking of loans and levy a commercial tax of 8 percent on
foreign currency if included in the proceeds of sale.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar had drawn a total of 7.108 billion dollars of foreign
investment from 24 countries and regions up to the end of April
this year since the country opened to foreign investment and
adopted a market- oriented economic policy in late 1988.

<HEADLINE> Heat Coach Pat Riley Agrees to Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Miami Heat coach Pat Riley
Wednesday reached a mutual agreement with owner Micky Arison to
trigger an extension clause in his contract that will keep him
with the team into the 21st century," according to a local report.
</P>
<P>
No terms were disclosed. Riley was entering the final year of a
five-year, $40 million contract he signed in 1995, when he left
the New York Knicks under unpleasant circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Riley, 54, is second on the NBA's all-time coaching wins list
and first in playoff wins. He won four championships as coach of
the Los Angeles Lakers, guided the Knicks to an appearance in the
NBA Finals and has turned Miami into a perennial contender.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank Micky Arison for his support and belief that I
can get the job done," Riley said. "We have much to do in the
coming years, with our main objective forever and always being the
building of a championship team.
</P>
<P>
"My family and I have fallen in love with Miami and we hope
that this will be the final destination of a long coaching journey,
" Riley added.
</P>
<P>
Riley is 191-105 since taking over the Heat. He has guided the
team to three Atlantic Division titles and a trip to the Eastern
Conference finals in 1997. However, Miami has been eliminated by
New York in the first round of the playoffs in each of the last
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
As the executive with final say on all personnel moves, Riley
has swung deals for All-Stars Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway.
This offseason, he signed forward Otis Thorpe away from the
Washington Wizzards and re-signed swingman Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
Riley never has missed the playoffs in 17 years as a coach. He
won NBA titles with the Lakers in 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988. He
spent a one-season hiatus as a TV analyst and returned to coaching
with the Knicks in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Under Riley, New York lost to Houston in the 1994 NBA Finals.
The following year, the Knicks lost in the conference semifinals
and Riley was vilified by the New York media for resigning his
post via fax. He still draws among the loudest boos of any visitor
to Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
With an all-time record of 947-404, Riley trails only Atlanta
coach Lenny Wilkens on the all-time wins list. His 149 playoff
wins are unsurpassed.

<HEADLINE> Argentine, Chilean Presidents to Inaugurate Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo
Frei will travel to Argentina on Thursday to join his host
President Carlos Menem at the inauguration of a gas pipeline that
will transport gas from Argentina to Chile.
</P>
<P>
It cost 850 million U.S. dollars to build the 941-kilometer gas
pipeline, which has the capacity to carry 8.5 million cubic meters
of gas per day.
</P>
<P>
Both countries regard the joint project as important to their
economies. Argentina will use the gas for the development of its
mining and industrial zone in addition to home gas supply, while
Chile will use the gas in thermal power plants to generate
electricity. Chile also has plans to extend the pipeline to other
cities in the north.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural ceremony will be held first in the Argentine
province of Jujuy and then in Mejillones, Chile. The two
presidents will afterwards travel to Santiago of Chile, where
President Menem is expected to stay until Friday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Allocate Bonuses for SEA Games Athletes, Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite a poor performance in
Brunei's 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, the Indonesian Sports
Council (KONI) still intends to keep its promise to allocate
bonuses for its high achieving athletes and coaches.
</P>
<P>
KONI Secretary General Rudolf Warouw confirmed the plan. He
said the federation had previously set aside funds in its budget
for the country's sporting ambassadors who are able to bring home
medals.
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, all participants will receive an
insurance package, he was quoted by The Indonesian Observer
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Warouw however declined to mention details, including the exact
figure, saying that the matter is still being assessed by the
federation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia went through a bad spell in last week's sporting
showcase, not only failing to retain the overall trophy, but also
contending with its worst case scenario becoming a reality, that
is, being surpassed by Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia pocketed an overall 44 gold medals -- which is a far
cry from the haul of 194 bagged by Indonesia in the 1997 SEA Games
-- to end the nightmare in third spot.
</P>
<P>
It was Indonesia's worst feat ever in 22 years of participation
in the biennial tournament.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the Indonesian contingent was reported to the
president during a limited cabinet meeting here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Sport and Youth Affairs Minister Agung Laksono reported to
President B.J. Habibie that Indonesia managed to grab only 44
golds, which are below the projected to 70-75 golds," Information
Minister Muhammad Yunus said.
</P>
<P>
However, several Indonesian athletes broke SEA Games records in
track and field and swimming, Yunus said.
</P>
<P>
The current prolonged economic crisis is seen as a factor
behind the country's breakdown in the 1999 SEA Games in Brunei
Darussalam, Yunus said, adding that the crisis curbed the
government's capacity to fund the development of sports in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The economic problems had also forced private companies to
reduce their financial support," he was quoted by the Antara News
Agency Thursday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Elliott Family Meets Media for First time Since Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Two days after transplant
recipient Sean Elliott received his brother's kidney, the family
of the San Antonio Spurs forward met the media today at the
Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Noel Elliott, who donated the kidney to his brother, reported
he was feeling good, although suffering through occasional
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
"I've been hanging out, trying to get up and walk around," he
said. "That's the hardest part so far."
</P>
<P>
What was never hard was the decision to help his brother. Upon
learning he was a viable donor, Noel Elliott never hesitated to
offer the life-saving organ.
</P>
<P>
"It's something I would have done for either of my brothers,"
Noel Elliott said. "For Sean and myself, I was a good match. My
other brother was ruled out as a match.
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of an instant celebrity. I want to encourage anyone
who's on the edge of being a donor to seriously consider donating
an organ or bone marrow or anything they can donate, whether it's
blood or organs."
</P>
<P>
An outpouring of support prompted Sean Elliott to complain
about his lack of access to the Internet in order to sift through
the well wishes of supporter. He could check no e-mail while in
the intensive care until Monday but was transferred to a regular
room on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His mother, Odiemae, thanked all of those who called, prayed
and wished her sons well, adding she could never manage to
acknowledge all the supporters.
</P>
<P>
"I had two sons in the operating room at one time," she said. "
Are you looking for the tears? It's been a long journey. It's been
seven years for Sean that we've known he was as well as he could
be. This summer, I had to face reality and there could be no more
denial.
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott has been taking heavy doses of medicine to limit
the chances of rejection of the organ by his body.
</P>
<P>
Noel Elliott had a donor procedure that now is less intrusive
than such operations in the past. A smaller incision is made in
extracting the kidney, thus speeding the healing process,
particularly after a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Francis Wright, who was the surgeon on the transplant, said
Sean Elliott's activity has been limited, but the prognosis
continues to be good.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the surgery, Wright never ruled out the
possibility the player might return to the NBA. Today, Noel
Elliott concurred with Wright's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
"I hope he will be able to get back to where he wants to be,"
Noel Elliott said. "If he wants to play next season."
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott, 31, played with kidney disease for the last few
years but significant deterioration of the renal function over the
last 12 months led to Monday's surgery. He has indicated no
retirement plans, although his return for the 1999-2000 season
still is considered highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Elliott played in all of San Antonio's 17 playoff games this
year and averaged 11.9 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists in a
15-2 postseason run.

</P>
<P>
"I tried to contact the Badminton Association of China but the

Last year, the China's shuttlers canceled their participation
in the event due to the political situation in the capital.
</P>
<P>
This year, PBSI has chosen Bali as an alternative venue for the
five-star tournament, because Bali is known as the safest island
in the country. The championships will take place in the Yuwana
Mandala and the Ngurah Rai halls.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Urged to Step Up Implementation of Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The international community's new
high representative to Bosnia Wednesday urged Bosnian leaders to
step up the implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord and to fight
the reportedly-rampant corruption among government officials.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Petritsch made the call at his first press conference
in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo after he succeeded Spanish
diplomat Carlos Westendorp as the international community's new
envoy to Bosnia earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Petritsch, quoted by reports reaching here, said that Bosnian
leaders should make serious efforts to implement the Dayton accord
since Bosnia was already half-way to implementing the agreement.
The accord was signed four years ago to end the four-year Bosnian
war.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian diplomat said he will not tolerate extremists and
nationalists and that if necessary, he will use various powers
granted him, including the power to remove Bosnian officials.
</P>
<P>
As for corruption, Petritsch said corruption was an important
topic during his first meeting with Alijia Izetbegovic, member of
Bosnia-Herzegovina's presidency, since he took the post.
</P>
<P>
Graft, bribery and embezzlement of public funds are a realistic
problem in Bosnia, which is distancing the country from the
European Union (EU), Petritsch said.
</P>
<P>
Wiping out corruption in Bosnia is a top priority for the
Office of the High Representative, he said.
</P>
<P>
Petritsch has served as Austria's ambassador to Belgrade and as
the EU's special representative for Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Violence is increasing
in Colombia as suspected right-wing paramilitary gunmen on
Wednesday killed eight more villagers in the Curumani region,
north of the country.
</P>
<P>
Local radio quoted the witnesses as saying that the assassins
described the victims as collaborators of the left-wing guerrillas,
warning others of "the same fate" if they support the leftists.
</P>
<P>
The atrocity occurred several hours after gunmen killed at
least 13 people late Tuesday and dumped their bodies along a
highway.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Wednesday, a bomb exploded in the
entrance of a bakery in the northeastern city of Cucuta, leaving
two people wounded. No group has yet claimed responsibility for
the incident.
</P>
<P>
In the province of Norte de Santander, authorities meanwhile
deactivated a car bomb for which they blamed the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
According to Colombia's federal human rights ombudsman, 847
civilians have died in massacres so far this year, up 44 percent
from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Majority of the dead have been killed as suspected leftist
sympathizers. The gunmen are reported to be financed by drug
traffickers and wealthy landowners.

<P>
PRAGUE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 45 million foreigners
traveled to the Czech republic in the first six months of 1999,
which is 6.4 percent fewer compared with the same period in 1998,
Czech's State Statistics Bureau reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 20 percent fewer foreign tourists arrived
in April compared to the same period in the previous year. In the
meantime, Czech's domestic travelers going abroad reached 17.9
million, a 10.4 percent decrease compared with the same period
during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the tourism sector attribute the decline to NATO's
78-day bombing of Yugoslavia. They said that since the end of
NATO's war against Serbians in Kosovo, a great number of foreign
tourists, fearing the danger of war, have canceled their programs
to visit the country.

OTTAWA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The 17-year-old Serena Williams
turned out the fourth major dropout Wednesday after injuring her
shoulder earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The eighth seed of the United States defaulted in her second-

Last week, Germany's Steffi Graf announced her retirement to be

shoulder injury. The other dropout is Russia's Anna Kournikova,
who withdrew because of a stress fracture in her right foot.

<P>
VIENNA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Austrians insist
that their country stay neutral in world affairs and stay away
from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), according to a
survey released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over two thirds of Austrians believe "keeping neutral is still
an integral part of Austria's foreign and security policy," and 54
percent think that Austria should remain neutral, not join NATO
or any other European security alliance.
</P>
<P>
Only 16 percent support Austria's NATO membership, according to
polls sponsored by the European Policy Association of Austria.
</P>
<P>
Around 71 percent of Austrians believe their country will not
be threatened by any other country's military force in the near
future, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The polls also found that many Austrians, especially the under-
educated, do not care about their country's security policy and do
not know the pros and cons of joining NATO. However, they think
Austria should remain neutral because the Constitution stipulates
permanent neutrality.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Over 100,000 Sri Lankan garment
factory workers will face unemployment, according to reports of
the Island newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They are employees of factories set up under the 200 Garment
Factory Program located outside the investment promotion zones,
which the Board of Investment (BOI) has decided not to service.
</P>
<P>
Recently the BOI informed them of the decision and has asked
them to obtain facilities from the Customs department.
</P>
<P>
The affected investors claim that this is in violation of the
agreements reached by them at the time of investment and for
taking resources into remote areas, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Investors say that the recent negative growth of the industry
was as a result of obstacles such as this that they had to face.
They add that government has promised them a "one stop shop" to
encourage them to go to the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
If government was not interested in developing the rural areas
they could operate more comfortably in the Zones.
</P>
<P>
They have described the new directive as outright
discrimination against investors who have gone to the rural areas
for the sake of rural development.
</P>
<P>
Nearly fifty investors, affected by the new decision, have
challenged the BOI ruling not to service them, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Mia to Miss Singapore, Indonesia Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's former starlet Mia
Audina will miss the 1999 Singapore Open and the Indonesian Open
badminton championships due to her dual jurisdiction problem, The
Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the Badminton Association of Indonesia
(PBSI) Leo Chandra Wiranata said that Mia's entry to the annual
tournament, which offers 150,000 U.S. dollars in prize money, was
not accepted by the organizing committee or the International
Badminton Federation (IBF).
</P>
<P>
"The IBF has stated that the Badminton Association of the
Netherlands has registered her to compete in the Singapore Open,
one week prior to the Indonesian Open, but she just resigned from
PBSI on August 7," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Based on IBF rules, a player can represent another country if
he or she has resided there for three months. But if we count from
August 7, she fails to fulfill the requirement. IBF sent a fax on
Tuesday saying that Mia's participation in the two events has not
been accepted," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mia sparked controversy when she said she wanted to move to
Rotterdam to live with Surinamese husband Tylio Lobman, who also
holds Dutch citizenship, but said she still wanted to represent
Indonesia in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
She trained in the Indonesia Badminton Center in Cipayung,
Jakarta, until PBSI officially issued a letter confirming her
resignation on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Leo said Mia would not be able to compete in the 2000 Olympics
because, according to IBF rules, Mia would be able to represent
another country only after two years had lapsed since she last
played for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Her last appearance for Indonesia was in the 1998 Asian Games
in Bangkok in December. She will be able to represent the
Netherlands in a multi sports event in December 2000. She won't be
able to qualify for the Olympics as the qualification period will
end in April 2000," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Agree to Terms with Mitch Richmond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Washington Wizards
Wednesday agreed in principle to a contract with All-Star guard
Mitch Richmond, who was the team's leading scorer during the
abbreviated 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
No financial terms or length of the deal were disclosed, but
ESPN, citing no official sources, reported on Tuesday that the
contract is for four years at $40 million.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, citing an unidentified source close to the
negotiations, has reported the Wizards can buy out the six-time
All-Star for $10 million after two years and $5 million after
three years.
</P>
<P>
With an annual average of $10 million, the contract makes the
34-year-old Richmond the NBA's highest-paid shooting guard. Guards
Latrell Sprewell, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant and Reggie Miller all
have deals paying them in the $9 million range next season.
</P>
<P>
Richmond led the Wizards with 19.7 points per game last season,
it was the lowest average of his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
The reported deal is similar to the one the Wizards struck
prior to last season with Rod Strickland. The point guard signed a
four-year, $40 million deal which has a $5 million buyout after
the third season.
</P>
<P>
Richmond was a 1988 first-round pick of the Golden State
Warriors. In May 1998, he was acquired with Otis Thorpe for Chris
Webber from the Sacramento Kings, for whom he spent seven seasons.
He has played in only 21 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
Richmond was the 1989 Rookie of the Year and 1995 All-Star Game
Most Valuable Player. Prior to last season, he never averaged less
than 21.9 points per game, with a high of 25.9 in 1996-97.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
Wednesday announced the seizure of 8.6 tons of cocaine in
international waters, with the help of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mexican General Attorney Jorge Madrazo said that the
confiscation of the cocaine, the largest amount this decade,
occurred on Saturday aboard a fishing boat carrying the Mexican
flag after an alert was received from the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the boat and 15 crew members were detained at
the Mexican port of Lazaro Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo said that after reinforcing the border patrol, 25 tons
of cocaine, 850 tons of marijuana and 671 tons of opium gum have
been seized during the past 8 months.
</P>
<P>
The drug, which is believed to have come from Colombia, will be
destroyed in the next few hours, authorities said. It is not known
which of the drug "Cartels" was behind this shipment.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo also said that in the campaign against drug trafficking,
in cooperation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), they have delivered strong

<HEADLINE> Australia's One Nation Party Leaders Face Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 19 (Xinhua) --A court ruling pushes Australian
notorious One Nation party into its downhill path.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Canberra Times Thursday, the
party's registration in Queensland state was sentenced Wednesday
to be invalid.
</P>
<P>
It was found in the supreme court that One Nation's
registration as a political party in Queensland had been induced
by fraud and misrepresentation because the party did not have as
many members as it professed to.
</P>
<P>
A Sydney businessman Chuck Hong was quoted as saying Wednesday
that he would launch similar court action against the party in the
New South Wales state believing there had been electoral fraud
also.
</P>
<P>
The party's leadership team, including Pauline Hanson, may face
fraud charges as a result of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The penalty for electoral fraud is up to six months' jail in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
One Nation party, established in 1997, is believed widely to be
hostile to the Australian Aboriginals and Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Upholding its nationalist, if not racist flag, the party won a
shining victory in Queensland in last year's general election by
taking 11 seats in the state parliament. However, the numbers have
dwindled to just five since the election and in January, five
resigned to sit as independents.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's economy will grow 3.
6 percent in the third quarter of the year and 3.9 percent in the
final quarter, forecasts a U.S. financial analysis company, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
A 3.2 percent growth in the second quarter in Mexico "created a
solid base for a second semester even more prosperous," said the
company in a statement published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The stability of Mexico's exports to the United States, the
rise in petroleum prices which strengthens Mexico's finance and
the recovery of internal consumption contributed to the growth of
Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP), added the company.
</P>
<P>
The financial authorities in Mexico forecast that the country
will close the year with a growth of 3 percent and an inflation
rate of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts said Mexico will also see an
increasingly uneven distribution of income, because growth will be
insufficient to eliminate the problem of high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of Mexicans currently control 34 percent of the
country's wealth. By 2025, the top 10 percent will control half of
the nation's wealth.

LOS ANGELES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A majority of World Wide Web
users in the United States do not trust the sites they visit,
according to a report released Wednesday by an Internet market

The report said that 64 percent of on-line consumers surveyed
do not think Web sites are trustworthy enough in following privacy
practices, including not passing user information on to third

</P>
<P>
Consumers' fears are fueled by government and media warnings
about the abuse of personal information passing over the Internet,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The consumers' fears are not easily assuaged despite the
majority of Web sites post some form of privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
Unless sites take action and educate and communicate with on-
line consumers, the research firm said, the fears will affect both
on-line advertising and digital commerce revenue.

<P>
TAIYUAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought hits north China'
s Shanxi Province this year, affecting large area of crops and
leaving many people and domestic animals in a serious shortage of
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive year that Shanxi is stricken by
severe drought and autumn grain output this year is to drop, local
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the province have been suffering from drought or
severe drought since the beginning of this year due to scant rain
water.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, heat wave hit the province in August,
leaving more than three million people and 460,000 heads of
livestock in serious lack of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the drought affected 1.6 million
hectares of crops, which account for 68 percent of the province's
total planted area, with 210,000 hectares of crops completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, major water conservation projects across the
province have only 414 million cubic meters of water in storage,
less than that in the drought-hit years of 1997 and 1998. Of the
province's small reservoirs, 60 percent are already dried up and
nearly 20,000 wells are reported to be in lack of water.
</P>
<P>
The city of Datong in northern Shanxi is the hardest-hit area
with 90 percent of its farmland affected by drought, the severest
in 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Declares War on Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso
declared a war against drug traffickers on Wednesday after
disclosing that elementary school pupils were increasingly being
targeted by drug pushers.
</P>
<P>
"Those in the drug ring should be punished. This nation could
be destroyed by drugs if they start selling them to elementary
school pupils," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He called on law enforcement agencies to administer tougher
punishments against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Although drug trafficking carries the death penalty, the
maximum sentence is rarely imposed.
</P>
<P>
Sutiyoso said he would summon education officials to clamp down
against drug using students.
</P>
<P>
The administration planned a massive TV campaign to warn young
people of the dangers of drugs, he said, adding that he had yet to
solve the problem of funding the campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected parents and teachers to play their part in
preventing children and young people from falling into the drug
trap.
</P>
<P>
The head of the city's education and teaching agency Masrul Nim
said that at least 20 pupils of an elementary school in Tanah
Abang, Central Jakarta, had been found to be using barbiturate
pills.
</P>
<P>
The children, aged between 10 and 12 years old, bought the
pills from an unidentified woman.
</P>
<P>
The same woman was believed to have operated at a junior high
school in Cikini, Central Jakarta, said Masrul.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the distribution of illegal drugs has
reached a favorite elementary school in Kebayoran, South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Minister of Justice/State Secretary Muladi, while
deploring the sales of drugs to children, said he did not rule out
the possibility of military or police personnel being involved, or
of providing backing to drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Success in handling the drug problem ultimately depended on the
attitude of the security apparatus, Muladi added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian experts had raised alarm due to the rapid increase
in total number of addicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts said some 1.3 million Indonesians are drug abusers and
addicts, inflicting a heavy social and economic burden on the
crisis-stricken country.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 45 million foreigners
traveled to the Czech republic in the first six months of 1999,
which is 6.4 percent fewer compared with the same period in 1998,
Czech's State Statistics Bureau reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 20 percent fewer foreign tourists arrived
in April compared to the same period in the previous year. In the
meantime, Czech's domestic travelers going abroad reached 17.9
million, a 10.4 percent decrease compared with the same period
during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the tourism sector attribute the decline to NATO's
78-day bombing of Yugoslavia. They said that since the end of
NATO's war against Serbians in Kosovo, a great number of foreign
tourists, fearing the danger of war, have canceled their programs
to visit the country.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Survives at RCA Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Patrick Rafter
contemplated pulling out of this week's RCA Championships with a
nagging right shoulder injury in Indianapolis, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Seeded second, Rafter was pushed to the limit by 105th-ranked
Anthony Dupuis of France before gutting out a 2-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1)
second-round victory Wednesday at the $745,000 hardcourt event.
</P>
<P>
Coming off a victory over Rafter in the final of the ATP
Championship in Cincinnati, world No.1 and top seed Pete Sampras
of the United States puts his 22-match winning streak on the line
tonight against Frenchman Guillaume Raoux.
</P>
<P>
The two-time defending U.S. Open champion, Rafter decided to
test his ailing shoulder rather than take a week off to rest it
before the final grand slam event of the year begins in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
But Rafter struggled early on against Dupuis, losing his serve
twice in the opening set before buckling down. The Australian
never faced a break point in the final two sets as he pulled out
the victory in just over two hours.
</P>
<P>
In other second-round action, sixth seed Marcelo Rios of Chile
was victorious in his return from injury as he struggled past
Israeli qualifier Harel Levy 6-2, 7-6 (7-5). A former world No. 1,
Rios missed three straight tournaments after a bout with groin and
hip tendon.
</P>
<P>
Also, Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands surprised seventh seed
Tommy Haas of Germany 6-3, 7-5; No. 11 Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador
stormed past American qualifier Jared Palmer 6-2, 6-2; Sebastien
Grosjean of France edged No. 12 Albert Costa of Spain 6-7 (0-7), 6-
2, 7-5; and No. 14 Cedric Pioline of France crushed Alberto Martin
of Spain 6-0, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Alex Corretja of Spain, who dropped a second-
round match to Michael Chang last week in Cincinnati, is playing
at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington. Andre Agassi, last
year's runner-up, also is in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Croatia had a
goalless draw in a European 2000 qualifier here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The result leaves Yugoslavia top of group eight with 10 points
from four games, one point ahead of Ireland. Croatia are third
with eight points from five matches and next takes on Malta on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Croatia will play in Dublin on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Predrag Mijatovic almost gave Yugoslavia the lead in the
opening minute when he hit the post from close range, but the
visitors settled down mid-way through the first half and were
denied by the woodwork themselves twice before the interval.
</P>
<P>
Striker Davor Suker hit the upright from a narrow angle after a
quick breakaway and Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic was spared
an own goal when he deflected the ball past his own keeper
Aleksandar Kocic in the 31st minute but saw it come back off the
bar.
</P>
<P>
Dejan Stankovic also came close for Yugoslavia when he forced a
brilliant save from Croatian keeper Drazen Ladic with a 25-yard
scorcher.
</P>
<P>
Aljosa Asanovic and Robert Jarni nearly gave Croatia a win
which would have put them top of group eight but Kocic blocked two
shots with the Yugoslav defence well beaten.

<HEADLINE> Opening Ceremony Boosts Tibetan Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- No sophisticated technology, no
dazzling audio-visual effects, but the opening ceremony of the
sixth national ethnic games impressed the spectators to the same
effect.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibet Autonomous Region (TAG) is incompatible with the
inland provinces as far as the finance is concerned, we cannot
afford the big-spending hi-tech devices, so we need to give full
display to the Tibetan culture to our advantage." said Danzeng
Gongbu, the general masterminder of the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony has been hailed as the showwindow of the
Tibetan culture as a large diversity of folksongs and dances,
hairstyles, dress designs impressed both the locals and the
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first spectacular scene I have ever seen, even we
locals have not expected such a depth of folk dances with strong
flavor of Tibetan culture." said Duoji Cairang, who works in the
TAG Theatrical Company. "It has become the town's talk since the
opening ceremony rehearsal was held three days in advance."
</P>
<P>
"The ceremony was wonderful, fantastic, for the variety of folk
dances and songs." said Larry Nielsen, an ex-professor from the
United States who have toured a total of 56 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The deep impression on the spectators has made Danzen Gongbu
more confident of his road to boost the Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many folk dances that even the locals have not
expected to watch. So this opening ceremony will be helpful to
give second thought to the Tibetan culture. "
</P>
<P>
Danzeng Gongbu, who began dancing at the age of 13 and has made
his mark in the research of Tibetan culture, said that for some
time the Tibetan culture has come to a crossroad where it faces
three choices.
</P>
<P>
"One is to remodel the local culture with the foreign school of
thought, secondly is to inherit the legacy without any change, the
last is to keep injecting new breath as remaining loyal to the
tradition."
</P>
<P>
"I keep to the last path which has been tested right in the
opening ceremony." said the official with the Culture Department
of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He was confident the opening ceremony has been a auspicious
omen to the Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
"It will help further protect and develop the ethnic culture
and provide an unprecedented window of opportunity for the
folklore."

<HEADLINE> Italy's Prosecutors Find No Charges Against Prodi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian judicial sources confirmed
Wednesday that the prosecutor's office of the Italian central city
of Bologna has so far found no misdeeds in inquiries into the
British Daily Telegraph's allegations that former Italian Premier
Romano Prodi failed to declare income from a series of consultancy
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The conservative British newspaper started the barrage of
charges against Prodi, a center-leftist, in May, when he was named
as the president-designate of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency Ansa, the judicial sources
said the inquiry, which is currently of a purely informative
nature with no list of suspects, began a couple of months ago, in
mid-June, as a "due act" required by law when allegations of a
certain gravity are advanced in a public form.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper attacked Prodi in connection with the
consultancy company Analisi e Studi Economici s.r.l (ASE) owned by
him and his wife, and claimed in mid-June that he failed to
declare income received by ASE from consultancies in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, the Daily Telegraph also claimed he had not
declared consultancy fees from the merchant bankers, Goldman
Sachs, and Unilever. The fees were allegedly paid into a Bologna
bank account held by ASE.
</P>
<P>
In 1996-97, the prosecutor's office investigated allegations
that Prodi had failed to declare profits from ASE, but the case
was shelved.
</P>
<P>
The latest inquiry has reportedly covered the same ground so
far and come up with the "no crime" answer.
</P>
<P>
The sources said investigation into the allegedly undeclared
sums from Goldman Sachs and Unilever should be complete by
mid-September by which time the European parliament is expected to
have voted its confidence in Prodi and the new European
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Coventry to Clinch Keane Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Robbie Keane is expected to
clinch a move to Coventry on Thursday for a fee in the region of
six million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Wolves and Coventry agreed a fee for the 19-year-old Republic
of Ireland striker and the Sky Blues have met Keane's personal
terms.
</P>
<P>
Now Keane is set to sign a five-year contract, subject to a
medical at Coventry's training ground.
</P>
<P>
Keane has been the subject of speculation throughout the summer
with Middlesbrough and Aston Villa leading the chase for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
But Middlesbrough could not agree personal terms with Keane and
Villa refused to meet Wolves' 6 million asking price.
</P>
<P>
Now Coventry are set to boost their firepower in the wake of
Darren Huckerby's departure to Leeds by capturing Keane.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed a fee with Wolves. The transfer terms have also
been agreed," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently meeting his representative about personal
terms to try to bring him to Highfield Road," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wales Bid for FA Cup Is On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Welsh rugby boss Glanmor
Griffiths claimed Wednesday that he would "compete aggressively"
to bring the FA Cup final to Cardiff in two years.
</P>
<P>
Griffiths, also Welsh Rugby Union chairman, believes major
showpiece events will find a place at the new 72,000 all-seater
Millennium Stadium in years to come.
</P>
<P>
Wembley is being knocked down and rebuilt next year and
Griffiths will meet with Football Association commercial director
Philip Carling on Thursday to push his bid for the 2001 FA Cup
Final.
</P>
<P>
And, as Wales played their 'home' rugby internationals at
Wembley over the two years it has taken for the Millennium Stadium
to be completed, Griffiths claimed it is time to return the favour.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have an infrastructure in Cardiff to stage such
events. We are also looking to get the European Cup Final in this
stadium.
</P>
<P>
"I am meeting with Philip Carling of the Football Association
tomorrow to talk about the terms and conditions of bringing the FA
Cup final here.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we do for the FA Cup final, we will work closely with
the Football Association of Wales to get this event here.
</P>
<P>
"We will want to see what deal we can get from the FA but we
will bid aggressively for this."
</P>
<P>
Griffiths also wants other major sporting and entertainment
events switched to Cardiff and has targeted the rugby league cup
final, major world boxing championships and rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
The WRU allowed the old National Stadium to host events like
Wales' international football matches, soccer's Welsh Cup final
plus concerts including Michael Jackson and David Bowie.

<HEADLINE> Johnsen Sidelined by Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United defender Ronny
Johnsen could be out of action for the rest of the year if he has
surgery on both his knees.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian utility man has been sidelined all summer with a
condition known as "jumper's knee", which mainly affects
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
He spent the last three months at home on a rehabilitation
programme under the guidance of Norwegian FA team doctor Lars
Ingebretsen, but is now back in Manchester and says he is still in
pain.
</P>
<P>
He flew back to Norway at the weekend for another examination
and now United's club doctor Mike Stone is discussing the
situation with the Norwegian camp.
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for Ronny to come back and see where we go from
there," said Sir Alex Ferguson. It is a dilemma."
</P>
<P>
Ingebretsen says: "United and Ronny will have to discuss the
possibility of an operation between themselves.
</P>
<P>
"He's worked hard during the summer and would like to get by
without an operation but he's still in pain while he's playing. I
don't know whether he has made his mind up yet whether to have
surgery."
</P>
<P>
Johnsen figured prominently in United's run-in to the Treble
last season when he took over from international teammate Henning
Berg at the center of the defence.
</P>
<P>
Signed from Turkish club Besiktas in the summer of 1996, he has
played in several positions for United specialising in midfield
and as partner to defender Jaap Stam.

<HEADLINE> English F.A. Plays Down Reports on Final Venue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The English Football Association
said on Wednesday that there is still a wide option on the F.A.
Cup final venue from 2001 while Wembley is being built.
</P>
<P>
There has been reports that Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium
will stage the game in the year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
F.A. spokesman Adrian Bevington said: "We could consider
Cardiff as an option but there is still a long period of time
before a decision has to be made."
</P>
<P>
Old Trafford, Villa Park, the Stadium of Light in Sunderland
and Twickenham, headquarters of English rugby union, are also
being considered as possible replacement venues.
</P>
<P>
Wembley has staged the F.A. Cup final since it was built in
1923. It is being demolished in the summer of 2000 and due to re-
open late in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Although not yet finished, the Millennium Stadium has already
staged rugby internationals and in October, for the start of the
rugby World Cup, it will have an all-seater capacity of 72,000
with a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
Glanmor Griffiths, chairman of the Welsh rugby union and an
executive of the Millennium Stadium, said he would "compete
aggressively" to bring the F.A. Cup to Wales.
</P>
<P>
"We have an infrastructure in Cardiff to stage such events.We
are also looking to get the European Cup final in this stadium.
</P>
<P>
"We have the finest stadium in the world - there is no doubt
about that - and the F.A. Cup is not just for English clubs -three
teams from Wales compete in it, Cardiff City, Swansea City and
Wrexham.
</P>
<P>
"While our stadium was being built we staged six rugby
internationals at Wembley. We used their facilities -- now it's
time to reciprocate."
</P>
<P>
Cardiff City became the only Welsh club to win the F.A. Cup
when they beat Arsenal 1-0 at Wembley in 1927. They were also
beaten finalists in 1925.
</P>
<P>
The English League have also spoken to Welsh F.A. officials
about staging the League Cup final and the divisional promotion
play-offs at the Cardiff stadium.
