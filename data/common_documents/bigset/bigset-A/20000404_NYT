NASCAR DRIVERS, CREW CHIEFS PRAISE TMS, DEBATE GROOVES

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The DirecTV 500 brought out a record 12
cautions Sunday, but, for a change, no one left Texas Motor
Speedway blaming the track design.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good racetrack,'' said Larry McReynolds, crew chief
for the No. 31 Lowe's Chevrolet driven by Mike Skinner. ``It caught
a lot of slack the first couple of years, but the good thing about
it is those guys \RTMS officials\S responded to everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at this racetrack, as much as it is a little ways
away from home \RNorth Carolina\S, we need to be here two times a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race that lasted 3 hours, 49 minutes, accidents eliminated
six cars and hobbled several others running at the end, including
those of Dale Jarrett and Jeff Gordon. But the track escaped
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers were unanimous in attributing the dozen yellow flags, a
NASCAR Winston Cup season high, to ``one of those racin' deals.''
In other words, wrecks happen.
</P>
<P>
   TMS requires white-knuckle driving. Speeds at the 1.5-mile
superspeedway top 190 mph, leaving little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of aggressive driving,'' said Jimmy Makar,
crew chief for the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac driven by
Bobby Labonte. ``Track position was so important that you couldn't
really give up anything, and I think people were just taking a
little more than they were giving. You can't do that here. It
doesn't take much to get yourself in trouble here, because you're
running so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are split on whether TMS has created a second groove.
</P>
<P>
   The race set a track record with 29 lead changes among 17
drivers. Last year, there were 24 lead changes involving 11
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could run high or low and pass people on the outside. We've
never really been able to do that here before,'' said Terry
Labonte, driver of the No. 5 Kellogg's Chevrolet. ``It was pretty
much two grooves. The pavement is a little bit older, and it kind
of lets you have two lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But with only one Busch Grand National/Winston Cup weekend a
year, drivers said it will take some time before the pavement will
be broken in enough to allow passing on the outside, especially
between turns 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a one-groove track, but it's getting better,'' said
Todd Bodine, who drives the No. 66 Phillips 66 Chevrolet in the
Busch Series. ``It's going to take five or six years ... for this
place to get the groove more out to where the other grooves can
come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers were ready to raise the white flag on TMS after the
first two years. They complained of dangerous turns and a slippery
surface.
</P>
<P>
   A $3 million makeover, which included repaving and redesigns of
Turns 1 and 4, has allowed drivers to shut up and race the past two
years. Owner Jack Roush, who has won two of the four Winston Cup
races at TMS, calls the track ``friendlier'' now.
</P>
<P>
   It also is faster.
</P>
<P>
   During the final few laps Sunday, race winner Dale Earnhardt Jr.
was running lap times that would have qualified him in the top 15.
That has prompted some to call for a slow down.
</P>
<P>
   At the sport's fastest tracks, Daytona and Talladega, NASCAR
mandates speed-reducing restrictor plates, which impede the flow of
air and fuel from the carburetor to the combustion chambers. Speeds
at TMS, Atlanta and Charlotte now rival those at Daytona and
Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to the point now, even with the increased speeds,
that we can race here, and that's a much better feeling from a
driver's perspective,'' said Jarrett, the defending points champion
who finished 33rd Sunday. ``But I still say that here, as at a
number of other places, if we could somehow figure out how to slow
the cars down that we'll see even better racing yet.'' nn

LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT FOR FANS, KAPLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Gabe Kapler made connections Monday, some of
which went far beyond him putting wood to horsehide. By the fourth
inning, fans sitting in Home Run Porch were chanting, ``Juan Who.''
By the next inning, female fans were appreciative of Kapler for
something else. ``Nice butt,'' was their chant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances _ replacing Juan, and all _ the heir
apparent right fielder had the greatest debut in Texas Rangers
history, but as the legacy of Mr. Gonzalez tells us, there's more
to it than just crunching numbers or having masculine appeal.
</P>
<P>
   One game in a Rangers uniform and the 24-year-old Kapler opened
not only a new season but also a new era in Arlington by
immediately achieving something that eluded Gonzalez for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe is loved by all.
</P>
<P>
   Introduce yourself with back-to-back home runs on the first
three pitches you see, and what else would you expect? OK, fine _
that's a natural response for those doubters who want to remind all
honeymooners that it's a long, long season.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, a refresher course in Gonzalez history should
not be necessary. For 10 years, Juan did what Kapler did Monday,
but at no time did he ever make an emotional connection with fans
at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The same paying customers who worship at the shin guards of a
Pudge Rodriguez treated Gonzalez like a beached jellyfish. They
poked at him with a stick. And Juan poked back. Ten years of this
made for a rather curious and uncomfortable relationship, almost
unheard of for a player of superstar status.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the way it was with Juan. And why over the long
haul it might be different with Kapler, even if his offensive
production is merely average, as opposed to the eruption Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry that much about expectations because I think I
know what the fans expect,'' said Kapler, following the Rangers'
10-4 victory against the White Sox before an announced Opening Day
house of 49,332. ``The fans come to see someone who plays hard, who
hustles, and who does little things to help the team win. I can
promise them that every game. That's one area where I will never
let down the team or the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Kapler had given some thought to a two-home run,
three-hit, three-RBI kind of debut for the Rangers and a standing
ovation almost every time he turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dream I thought about it,'' said Kapler,
smiling. But he also added, ``Maybe I didn't necessarily expect
this, but I do expect special things from myself. I have those kind
of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates had witnessed that throughout spring training. As
had Rudy Jaramillo, the Rangers' hitting coach. Oates pulled aside
Kapler before Monday's opener to remind the newcomer that he could
``own'' all of right field at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Gabe that the way he plays the game, they will love him
out there,'' Oates said. ``He's just so gung-ho about everything.
I'm not so sure a bad day would have hurt him with the fans because
they could still see what he was all about. But to have this kind
of day, it will do nothing but boost Gabe.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks of spring training, Kapler had been on
an offensive tear in Florida after a month and a half of extensive
bat instruction from Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Gabe did last season (in Detroit) he now does just
the opposite,'' Jaramillo said. ``We tore down his swing and his
mental approach to hitting, and started all over. That shows you
what kind of kid he is, that he immediately trusted me enough to
let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's workload in Florida became immense because of the extra
hours put in with Jaramillo. ``But you can't ever give him too
much,'' Jaramillo said. ``He always wants more. He's a worker and a
hustler, and I really liked the way the fans fell in love with him
today. They saw the Gabe Kapler we've been seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   One press-box joke Monday centered on Kapler being part of the
Gonzalez trade with Detroit last November. ``Do you mean the
Rangers got five other players, too?'' But while pitchers Justin
Thompson and Francisco Cordero were listed as the key acquisitions,
it was Kapler who would be coming in to play the same position as
Gonzalez. And this after a somewhat disappointing rookie season
with the Tigers _ a .245 average with 18 homers and 49 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today's game, to open this way, was huge for the
team,'' Kapler said, ``and Juan Gonzalez himself didn't have that
much to do with it. But there are the questions floating around out
there about how much offense we lost since last season, and how
much we could make up. So to come out today, and do this, that's
very motivational, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like old times _ four home-run balls divided between
Kapler and Rodriguez accounted for seven of the runs. Pudge got
another MVP campaign started with a bang, while Kapler got a new
start in a new town after making a very positive impression in
spring training with everyone, particularly his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was curious how long it would take the fans to react to
Gabe,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said. ``As it turned out, the wait
wasn't long, was it?'' nn

MAVERICKS' LATE-SEASON BLOOM TOO LATE FOR PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If this is the second half of the season, then it comes
as no surprise that the Dallas Mavericks are making a mad dash
toward next season.
</P>
<P>
   In six of the past eight seasons, the Mavericks have posted a
better record in the second half of the season than they did in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will carry a 17-15 record in the second half of
the season into Tuesday's 7:30 p.m. tilt against the Sacramento
Kings at Reunion Arena. By contrast, the Mavericks were 15-26 at
the midway point of this season. The Mavericks won't be going to
the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's lockout-shortened season the pattern was
similar _ a slow start and a fast finish that ultimately gave
Mavericks fans false hopes going into the off-season. That includes
a 9-9 record after April 1 of a season that ultimately ended with a
19-31 record.
</P>
<P>
   This year five of the Mavericks' final nine games are against
teams that have qualified for the playoffs _ Sacramento, Portland,
Seattle, Minnesota and the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The other four games are against Denver, Vancouver, Houston and
the Los Angeles Clippers _ teams that have been eliminated from
playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their seemingly annual reservations in the NBA Draft
Lottery, the Mavericks still have goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five-plus wins would be a good goal,'' guard Erick
Strickland said. ``Hopefully you'd like to win the rest of them,
but we got some tough games, so we've just got to stay mentally
tough.'' SWEET 16
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has never had a winning record on the road, the
Mavericks appear comfortable playing away from Reunion Arena this
season.
</P>
<P>
   With three road games remaining, the Mavericks have a 16-22 road
record, sixth-best in team history, and two victories away from
ranking fourth all-time.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 victories also is as many games as the Mavericks have won
on their own court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's different, but we play well on the road,'' guard Erick
Strickland said. ``But even in the past we were in a lot of the
games on the road; we just couldn't win them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year we've been able to close a little more than we
have in past and learn how to win through adversity. We know we're
not going to get many calls, but we've fought through that and just
found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And about those 19 home losses?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Strickland said. ``But hey, that's just how it
is. Hopefully we can do better about that and finish the season off
strong.'' DAVIS PURSUES RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Davis said he doesn't care much about records, but he is
close to owning one.
</P>
<P>
   With nine games remaining, Davis leads the NBA in 3-point
shooting at 51 percent. The NBA single-season record is 52.4
percent, set during the 1994-'95 season by Steve Kerr of the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has made 79 of 155 3-pointers this season. If the
eight-year veteran hits 16 of 26 3-pointers or better, he will
break Kerr's record. nn

MILTON BRUTTEN, AN AUTHORITY ON DYSLEXIA, 77 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (ms) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Milton Brutten, a clinical psychologist and an early leader
in the field of special education who also collected contemporary
art, died on March 16 at an assisted-living center in Devon, Pa. He
was 77 and lived in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, said his wife, Dr.
Helen M. Herrick.
</P>
<P>
   Brutten was born in Manhattan and grew up in Brooklyn, where he
graduated from Brooklyn College. He did graduate work in Spanish
literature at Princeton University until he was drafted into the
Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he earned a doctorate in speech and language
audiology from Northwestern University. Pooling course work from
Northwestern, Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania,
he also earned a degree in clinical psychology and became a
certified school psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Brutten was an expert in dyslexia who frequently consulted with
public and private schools and with families trying to obtain
appropriate educational services and placement for their children.
In 1960 he and Henry Evans, an educator, founded the Vanguard
School, one of the first private schools in the country for
children with learning disabilities, in the Philadelphia suburb of
Paoli.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ``Something's Wrong With My Child,'' published in 1973
and written with Charles Mangel and Dr. Sylvia Richardson, was
widely considered one of the premier books on learning disabilities
of its time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Brutten founded the Crossroad School for dyslexic
students, also in Paoli. Over the years he served on the boards of
many professional organizations, taught at Bryn Mawr College and
Temple and directed the Commonwealth Hearing and Speech Center at
St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. Until his retirement three
years ago, he also had a private practice in Radnor, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a lifelong interest in art, Dr. Brutten and his wife
collected during the 1970s, '80s and early '90s. They bought work
by a wide range of artists, including Joel Shapiro, Katherine
Porter, Robert Smithson, Christopher Wilmarth, Cynthia Carlson,
Bill Jensen and Jene Highstein.
</P>
<P>
   Brutten served on the boards of the Morris Gallery of the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Institute of Contemporary
Art at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, a retired teacher of hearing-impaired
children, Brutten is survived by three children from his first
marriage: two sons, Eric, of Stamford, Conn., and Marc, of Rancho
Sante Fe, Calif.; a daughter, Dr. Maya Paul of Churchville, Md.,
and four grandchildren.

DODGERS ROUT EXPOS IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL -- The first thing the Dodgers did in the offseason was
create balance in the lineup. Lefty hitting Shawn Green fit the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   And the first thing the Dodgers did this season is show off that
balance.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dodgers' inaugural game under Bob Daly's watch, Kevin
Brown pitched six effective innings and the middle of the order
drove in eight runs as the Dodgers opened the season with a 10-4
beating of the Montreal Expos in front of a soldout crowd of 51,249
at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros led the offensive assault with his second career
grand slam, which highlighted a five-run seventh inning. Gary
Sheffield had two hits, including a two-run triple, and Todd
Hundley homered and had three hits. Shawn Green's lone RBI came on
a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have guys on base it makes your job a lot easier,''
Sheffield said. ``When you start doing that right off the bat, it
relaxes you for later on in the season. It was a great game for us,
and I hope the cycle of not scoring runs for Kevin is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson wanted to jump into his newfound deep
bullpen, and he plucked out newcomer Terry Adams to pitch the final
three innings and record the save. Dustin Hermanson took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like when a plan comes together,'' Johnson said with a wide
grin. ``(Brown) wanted to go back out there and kind of fought me
on it, but I had a fresh pen. It made it easier when we added (five
runs) on. He said, `You got the right guy out of there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there were handshakes and congratulations in the
manager's office from Daly. And not many were thinking about
Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero, who had a pair of homers and four
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep him happy,'' Johnson said. ``I've got to
keep him happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Games like this is the way to do it. There's plenty of folks who
road the disastrous wave of the last two seasons in the clubhouse
to point out that 161 games remain, but this opener offers hope
because of the way the Dodgers' offense pounced on mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos made four errors that led to four unearned runs, but
the Dodgers still needed a pair of key hits.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-run fifth inning, a pair of throwing errors led to
Sheffield's triple and a 5-1 lead. Two innings later Expos third
baseman Michael Barrett, with two errors in hand, failed to make a
play on Mark Grudzielanek's grounder a few feet to his left. It
went as a base hit, but put reliever Anthony Telford in a game.
After a Sheffield single and Green walk, Karros smacked his grand
slam down the left field line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We capitalized on their mistakes,'' said Karros, who passed
Steve Garvey and is second on Los Angeles' all-time homer list with
212. ``We were given a lot of opportunities. Hundley had a big hit,
Sheff had two big hits, Green got the walk and I got the hit. It's
not like we came out and rolled them over. We were given a lot of
opportunities, but when you're given opportunities you have to take
advantage of them and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the eight RBI, the No. 3 through No. 6 spots in
the order were a combined 6 for 17, hit two homers and scored four
runs. The offensive production was exactly what the club hoped for
when it sent Raul Mondesi to Toronto in exchange for Green in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the imbalanced Dodgers failed to reach double digits
in runs until the 22nd game of the season. They reached the mark
only 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think the striking power and balance of the middle of
the lineup doesn't comfort the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to make mistakes and get by with bad pitches
and not pitch great when you have an offensive effort behind you
like that,'' said Brown, who struck out seven and allowed three
runs in improving to 3-2 on opening day. ``You definitely want to
pitch better, but I'll take the win. I think we're a lot better
balanced this year from the standpoint we've got a healthy of Todd
Hundley from the left side being a threat. We have Shawn Green,
who's real well-rounded, and last year we were a little right-side
heavy.''

SUSPECT IN WESTPORT DEATHS OFFERS TO PLEAD GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It has been almost a year since police found
in a house five men shot to death at different times and left where
they fell.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Beach was arrested a day after that, on April 6. Police
said Beach murdered the men from March 28 to April 1, and he soon
faced the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Now Beach, 57, has offered to plead guilty and serve life
without parole _ if prosecutors will drop the death penalty. His
lawyers filed the offer Feb. 28 in Jackson County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday defense lawyer Cynthia Short said that from the start,
Beach had been ready to pay for his crimes and wanted to plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this plea agreement,'' she noted, ``he would die in the
penitentiary.''
</P>
<P>
   County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said he had no plans to drop the
death penalty. Beaird said he would meet this week with dozens of
family members of the victims and inform them of the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Most family members have supported execution, Beaird said. Two
reached by telephone Monday declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Sales, the daughter of victim Kenneth Gulley Jr., said
that she would think about the offer but that this week was a
difficult time. The anniversary of the death carries its own pain,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The murder victims were Gulley, 45, the stepson of Beach's
brother; Michael Davis, 32, Beach's stepson, who lived at the
house; Mark Nelson, 28, who also lived at the house; Christopher
Conrad, 27, of Overland Park; and Jerry Nickerson, 56, of Kansas
City. Beach knew all five men.
</P>
<P>
   Police entered Beach's rented house at 4275 Jefferson St. in the
Old Westport neighborhood after one of Gulley's brothers, Dennis
Gulley, went to the home to find his brother, broke in and found a
body. Before Beach was captured the next day, police said, he
phoned a man and told him Dennis Gulley would be killed next.
</P>
<P>
   Officers arrested Beach at a hotel near his home, and he has
been incarcerated since then. He's charged with five counts each of
first-degree murder and armed criminal action.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Aug. 30. Beach's lawyers
have said in court filings that they will use a mental illness
defense if the case goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   During the period of the murders, they wrote, Beach twice tried
to kill himself with alcohol and pills. He also drove into the
country with a hose before backing out of a plan to kill himself
with car exhaust, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months before the murders, Beach started behaving
strangely, defense lawyers wrote, but ``no one appreciated the
depth of his depression or the depth of his irrational thinking.''

H&AMP;R BLOCK SHOPS AROUND FOR ADVERTISING AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Co. is putting its $100 million
global advertising account up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The account has been at Young &AMP; Rubicam, Chicago, since 1996,
but the departure of two key executives at that agency who oversaw
the Block account triggered the decision to initiate an agency
review.
</P>
<P>
   To help in the process, Block has hired Los Angeles consultant
Select Resources International to help find the right agency.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Select Resources clients include Hewlett-Packard, BMW and
Starbucks. Block and Select Resources hope to announce the agency
by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   David Byers, who has been Block's chief marketing officer for
about 10 months, said as the company had aggressively made
acquisitions and diversified, it began seeing a need for a new
marketing partner.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years the company has spent billions on
acquisitions, giving it 94 financial services centers across the
United States, mortgage services, and one of the 10 largest
accounting firms in the United States. And having spent billions on
its acquisitions to become a full-service financial services
company, Block now plans to dramatically boost its global
advertising, from about $30 million worldwide last year to $100
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of issues that we were working on with all
the Young &AMP; Rubicam companies...but I don't know that it was moving
along at the pace we needed,'' Byers said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the worldwide creative director on the account and the
worldwide account director left, sparking the decision to move
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Breen, president and chief executive officer of Young &AMP;
Rubicam, Chicago, said he was disappointed by Block's decision.
Although the agency had been invited to participate in the review,
Breen said a final decision hadn't been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young &AMP; Rubicam helped H&AMP;R Block achieve four consecutive
record-breaking years for its business,'' Breen said. ``They've
been happy with our efforts....In fact, the current work we've done
for them has effectively repositioned the company in a stylish,
contemporary and relevant way, and has been well-received by both
consumers and the media.''
</P>
<P>
   On the staffing issues, Breen said that although the agency
regretted losing two key persons, more than 70 others also worked
on the account.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary F. Prestopino, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Cleary
Gull in Chicago who follows H&AMP;R Block, said the company had too
much at stake to risk anything but a full-bore marketing effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen a number of changes and a positioning of the
company as a total financial services provider using the tax client
as leverage to sell those products, so it probably makes a lot of
sense to take a step back and ask, `Is there a better
mousetrap?' &UR; '' Prestopino said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's fairly common for a new head marketing person to
initiate an agency review soon after joining a company, Byers said
that wasn't the case here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the intent had been to make a change when I came in,''
Byers said, ``I'm aggressive enough that we would have made that
change immediately.''

MIAMI COUNTY, KAN., PLANNERS TO HEAR DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCYRUS, KAN. _ The Miami County, Kan., Planning Commission will
hear a proposal tonight to turn 10,000 acres near Bucyrus, Kan.,
into a planned development to protect it from haphazard growth.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Osborn, whose company Osborn Properties owns about 5
percent of the property, is proposing the plan. The idea, Osborn
said, is to create a plan that would bring orderly growth to an
area of a county that is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about preventing sprawl by controlling where growth
goes and where the density is,'' said Osborn, who recently
presented his ideas to Miami County commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The plan marries two new planning concepts, Osborn said. Around
the unincorporated community of Bucyrus, the plan calls for using
new urbanism, putting community and retail development within
walking distance of homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the areas outside Bucyrus, the plan would incorporate ``rural
by design,'' a concept that tries to preserve the rural feeling in
a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   That is achieved with lot setbacks of 100 feet or more,
incorporating walking and biking trails instead of standard
concrete sidewalks and eliminating a lot of curbs and gutters that
define suburban areas and create drainage problems downstream,
Osborn said. The plan also calls for keeping 40 percent of the
space undeveloped and keeping property lines from reaching streams.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn, whose family owns several parcels of land in Miami
County, is the son of Jim Osborn, who helped found Home Office
Reference Laboratory, now LabOne, and Osborn Laboratories. Both
companies do laboratory testing for insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The county has done a good job of creating zoning regulations
that favor development around the towns in the county like Paola
and Louisburg, Osborn said. But development will eventually come to
the Bucyrus area. Instead of having something that looks just like
a south Johnson County development, the proposal would give Miami
County the chance to develop something that may not exist anywhere
in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While his company owns only a small part of the property, Osborn
has explained his idea to owners of some of the larger land pieces
within the 10,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is we need a plan to have controlled
development,'' Osborn said. ``We know eventually development will
come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The presentation tonight is to gauge reaction from the planning
group to determine whether to proceed with the concept, Osborn
said. The plan would require revisions in the county's zoning
regulations, and there is a need for extensive public discussion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Davis, chief building official for Miami County, said the
area has become a desirable place to develop and the county's land
values are showing that. He said some of the county's residents
worry about the area losing its rural nature.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn believes his plan would create growth that is sensitive
to those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't happen right away, at least we would be
preserving the area with a good plan so when growth gets there, it
is not haphazard,'' Osborn said.

ASSOCIATED WHOLESALE GROCERS CONTINUES OPERATIONS DURING LAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc. continued
operating its distribution centers Monday, using outside companies
as the Teamsters union kicked its boycott into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the second day since Associated laid off about 640
warehouse and transportation workers at its Kansas City, Kan.,
distribution center. Nearly 700 employees in Springfield, Mo., also
were laid off after a three-year Teamsters contract expired Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated official said he expected Kansas City, Kan.,
warehouse operations, run now by CS Integrated (Kansas) LLC, to be
normal later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of (Monday), this is a 2-day-old company in the
warehouse,'' said Jerry Garland, Associated's executive vice
president of marketing. ``We have 450 new employees in the
warehouse, many of whom are still learning the job. We believe, by
the middle of this week, we'll be back on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   A Teamsters official said pickets monitoring the trucks leaving
Associated's distribution center said deliveries fell far short of
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a typical Sunday night and Monday morning, you'll have 150
to 200 trailerloads leaving AWG,'' said Jim Williams, recording
secretary of Teamsters Local 955. ``Our people counted 34
trailerloads leaving during that period.''
</P>
<P>
   A CS Integrated spokesman said he expected the normal number of
loads to be shipped out by the end of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit behind and delayed,'' said Hal Leddy, a
spokesman for CS Integrated, based in New Jersey. ``But I'm
expecting that from here on, day by day, things will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Leddy said CS Integrated was still taking job applications. The
company is operating with new hires, temporary workers and 85 to 90
former Associated employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Davidson, Local 955 president, said those former
Associated employees were not workers who lost their jobs this past
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of our members is still out and reporting for picket
duty and handbilling,'' he said. ``If they have former employees,
it's people AWG fired years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams of the Teamsters union said operations were not as
normal as Associated and CS Integrated were indicating. Several
trucks that left the distribution center returned 20 minutes later,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean that they're leaving AWG empty, because you
can't run a load in 20 minutes,'' Williams said. ``They're trying
to make it look like they're operating normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that rumor, but I can assure you that any trucks
leaving AWG have groceries in them,'' he said. ``I don't think we'd
be quite that naive as to return a truck 20 minutes later with the
same trailer number.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that truck deliveries to some Associated
stores have been several hours late. There also have been scattered
reports of Associated-supplied stores in the area being out of
certain items because of a ``warehouse shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that has anything to do with what's going on at
AWG,'' Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that retail grocery sales reportedly were
strong late last week and over the weekend. Part of that was
attributable to concerns over Associated's outsourcing plans and
dispute with the Teamsters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Associated, a cooperative with 850 stores in 10 states, supplies
Price Chopper, Country Mart, Sun Fresh, Apple Market, Thriftway and
Hen House stores in the Kansas City area. An official with Four B.
Corp., which operates more than two dozen area grocery stores
supplied by Associated, could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Teamsters continued picketing Associated's
distribution centers in Kansas City, Kan., and Springfield,
contending that more than 1,200 employees have been locked out. The
company said it did not consider the situation a lockout because
those employees were given layoff notices two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Local 955 had four pickets at Associated's two
entrances at its Kansas City, Kan., facility. There are others
there in support, without picket signs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union Monday sent members to start handbilling eight area
stores supplied by Associated, seeking customer support. Williams
said that effort would expand this week to more stores.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred former Associated employees Monday filed for
unemployment benefits. The Kansas Department of Human Resources
used the union hall of United Auto Workers Local 31 near General
Motors Corp.'s Farfax plant.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the waiting period for getting benefits was three
weeks. The weekly benefit is slightly more than $300, he said.

CLINTON SAYS WTO WOULD AID FREEDOM IN CHINA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ President Clinton, arguing that America must reject
``irrational attachments to the animosities of yesterday,'' pushed
strongly for Congress to approve the normalization of trade
relations with China in a speech Monday before a trade-friendly
gathering of Silicon Valley leaders and centrist Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want America's economy to continue to grow, and if you
want your country to continue to be a force for peace, and freedom
and prosperity ... we have to be willing to shoulder our burden for
the future,'' Clinton told a crowd of about 300 Democratic
Leadership Council members, business and political leaders,
including Gov. Gray Davis, and eBay CEO Meg Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ``And ironically,'' he said, ``we will be one of the greatest
beneficiaries by doing what is right for China and the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president delivered his speech at the futuristic Tech Museum
of Innovation in San Jose _ part of a two-day fund-raising and
political trip to the Bay Area. Granting China permanent normal
trade relations status before its entry to the World Trade
Organization would benefit American workers and the cause of
freedom in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do this, 20 years from now we will wonder why we ever
had a serious debate about it,'' Clinton told the audience, which
gave him a warm reception. ``If we don't do it, 20 years from now
we'll still be kicking ourselves for being so dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's push came as the White House announced that 200
high-tech heavyweights _ including CEOs of Silicon Valley giants
such as Sun Microsystems, Sybase, Nortel Networks and Qualcomm _
have signed a letter expressing their strong support for a
U.S-China trade pact, calling it ``an absolute priority'' for their
industry.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by a bipartisan group of 42 governors _
including Davis _ who Monday also urged congressional approval of
the trade measure. Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
GOP nominee for president, and his brother Jeb Bush, the Florida
governor, also signed their support for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also announced her support of
normal trade relations as the best way to create more American jobs
and ``bring about freedom'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress refuses to normalize trade relations, China could,
under WTO rules, refuse to grant the same market access to U.S.
companies that it gives to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech leaders fear this would give competitors in Europe and
Asia a huge advantage in one of the world's largest markets.
</P>
<P>
   The president's choice of a high-tech venue for his high-profile
appeal on the China trade issue was no coincidence. The wishes of
tech executives _ who have pushed hard for more open trade with
China _ have held increasing sway on Capitol Hill, where the
industry has dramatically increased its political donations _ and
its clout.
</P>
<P>
   And the president, who has visited the Bay Area twice this year
to collect technology donations, picked up $1 million in campaign
contributions for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
Sunday night at a South Bay fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the president's intense political lobbying effort
this week was not aimed at Republicans, who generally support
opening China trade _ but at a number of House Democrats who
maintain concerns about labor's opposition and human rights abuses
there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told tech leaders that the more than 270 trade
agreements signed by the United States in the past seven years have
contributed to economic boom in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged ``the trade issue has become symbolic about
people's general unease about globalization,'' including issues
such as child labor and abuse of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, these trade agreements have become a lightning rod
for everybody's dissatisfaction with everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by Congress ``is on an agreement that lowers no
American trade barriers, lowers no American tariffs, grants no
great access to China to any part of the America economy,'' Clinton
said. But Chinese tariffs ``will fall by more than half over five
years in every sector, from telecommunications to automobiles to
agriculture,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, China will agree to play by the same
trading rules that we follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that ``China is a one-party state, that it
does not tolerate opposition, that it still denies its citizens the
fundamental rights'' of freedom of speech and religion, Clinton
said the trade pact is ``the most intelligent thing we can do to
increase the chances that China will become more open, more
democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the answer is to allow them in,'' said Clinton, ``and
to let liberty spread from within.''
</P>
<P>
   The president noted, for example, that the number of Internet
addresses alone in China is expected to boom to 20 million this
year. ``We know how much the Internet has changed America ...
imagine how much it will change China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the United Status must ``continue to push China
in every way we can to improve and observe human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president warned there would be dire implications should
Congress turn down the trade agreements with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main consequences would be to hurt America economically
and to dramatically strain our relations with China at a time when
we need to maintain a positive ability to impact their conduct,''
he said, pounding the podium, adding the trade pacts are critical
``to get the leaders in that country to imagine the greatness of
their country in future terms, not yesterday's terms.''

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS PETITION TO LIST CALIFORNIA SPOTTED OWL
AS  ENDANGERED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Claiming that efforts to protect the California
spotted owl have failed abysmally, a coalition of environmental
groups is petitioning the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Tuesday to
list the reclusive deep-woods bird under the U.S. Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   If the owl is listed, it could greatly reduce logging in
California, and it would also restrict other activities in forested
areas of the state, including development, livestock grazing,
recreation and mining.
</P>
<P>
   The California spotted owl, native to the Sierra Nevada and
southern California's coastal mountains, is a kissing cousin of the
northern spotted owl, which is found in the coastal ranges of
northern California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The northern spotted owl, listed as threatened by the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service in 1990, was the subject of an epic battle
between environmentalists and the logging industry. Ultimately, the
listing resulted in timber harvest reductions in some national
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists said federal protection for the California
spotted owl is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 6,000 northern spotted owls when they were
listed,'' said Noah Greenwald, a forest ecologist with the
Albuquerque-based Center for Biological Diversity, one of the lead
groups in the coalition. ``By best estimates, there are only around
2,000 California spotted owls left.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will now have 90 days to
determine if a listing warrants consideration. If the agency
chooses to consider the petition, it will undertake a one-year
review of the owl's status, then decide whether or not to list it.
</P>
<P>
   There are three subspecies of spotted owls. Along with the
northern and the California varieties, there is also the Mexican
spotted owl, which lives in Arizona, New Mexico and northern
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   All are virtually identical in appearance: relatively large,
round-headed owls with spotted breasts that live in old-growth
timber and subsist on rodents.
</P>
<P>
   All three owls have declined in numbers across their range.
Research has indicated that logging of the birds' favored
old-growth habitat has contributed to the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid a listing for the California owl _ and the
concomitant economic effects it would have _ the U.S. Forest
Service issued ``interim guidelines'' in 1993 for managing national
forests known to harbor the bird.
</P>
<P>
   But three studies, two conducted by the Forest Service and one
undertaken by a Humboldt State University ornithologist, concluded
that owl populations have declined significantly since the interim
guidelines were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald said owl populations have declined between 7 and 10
percent in the Lassen, El Dorado and Sierra national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Watson, the California and Nevada regional director for the
Wilderness Society, an environmental group that originally endorsed
the Forest Service's interim rules, said his organization now
supports a listing under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guidelines were a step in the right direction, but a lot
of time has passed and a (permanent protection) plan has yet to
emerge,'' he said. ``You can't wait around forever. A petition is
warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said that the petition may goad federal agencies into
adopting tough protections for the owl under a pending management
plan for the Sierra Nevada, obviating the need for a listing.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial foresters are condemning the petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is more about a plea for fund-raising and
membership support for (the environmentalists') anti-forestry
campaign than it is about what is best for the California spotted
owl,'' said Chris Nance, a spokesman for the California Forestry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Nance said a 1992 Forest Service study shows that California
spotted owls are well-distributed throughout their historic range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we have to be careful where we point fingers,'' he
said. ``In the eight years since 1992, logging in the West has been
reduced by 92 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Robinson, a wildlife biologist with the forest service's
California regional headquarters, said that owl populations have
declined by ``a statistically significant'' degree.
</P>
<P>
   However, said Robinson, it is unlikely that a single factor _
such as logging _ is wholly responsible for the drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably a number of reasons, including (loss of)
habitat quality, weather, and perhaps to a certain extent,
intrusion by barred owls,'' he said. (Barred owls are a species
from eastern North America that is invading spotted owl habitat.)
</P>
<P>
   Spotted owl numbers also go up or down in response to prey
availability, said Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there may have been some ``holes'' in the spotted
owl reports that are cited as supporting evidence for the petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, owls that may have moved out of their established
territories were counted as dead by the researchers, when (the
owls) may actually have been alive and breeding elsewhere,'' he
said.

NATO TROOPS SEIZE A TOP SERB FACING WAR CRIME CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS with updates, revisions thruout.)

<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ After years of criticism for not
bringing top war criminals to justice, NATO troops Monday arrested
Momcilo Krajisnik, one of the most important Serb leaders in the
Bosnian war, on charges of war crimes, including genocide.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said in announcing the arrest that Krajisnik, a
close ally of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, was the
most senior of 39 war crime suspects now in custody. Diplomats have
described Krajisnik as a fanatic politician who sometimes equaled
Karadzic in power, and through his business deals helped finance
the ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik was immediately flown to The Hague where he will stand
trial before the International Tribunal, which charged him with
every war crime in its statute for his role as a principal
strategist behind hundreds of civilian massacres. Conviction would
mean a maximum life sentence for Krajisnik, 55, who is expected to
enter a plea this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although his impending indictment was reported in the Serbian
press three months before it was handed up secretly in February, it
was not clear why French troops with the SFOR peacekeeping force
decided to arrest him now.
</P>
<P>
   But given the long-running failure of NATO forces to bring war
criminals to trial, Krajisnik clearly was not expecting his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and tribunal officials said Krajisnik was at his elderly
par- ents' home in Pale when French troops blew open the door with
explo- sives shortly after 3 a.m. Monday. They briefly detained his
parents, tied the hands of his two sons and hustled Mr. Krajisnik,
still in his pajamas, out the door.In New York, Richard Holbrooke,
the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, said in an interview,
``This is possibly the most important day since the Dayton
agreement on Bosnia,'' adding that ``Krajisnik was a very important
person after all. He was the former co-president of Bosnia, he was
the head of the Bosnia Serb delegation at Dayton.'' Holbrooke was
the author of the Dayton peace accord on the Bosnian war in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The removal of Krajisnik from the country, which is long
overdue but couldn't happen until he was indicted, removes from
Bosnia the leading public opponent of the Dayton agreement. The
other opponent, Karadzic, has been in hiding for four years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks in Dayton, Krajisnik drew attention for his
rig- id, separatist views and his opposi- tion to the accords. But
his arrest does not affect the accords, diplo- mats said, because
it was Slobodan Milosevic, then president of Serbia, who excluded
the Bosnian Serbs and signed for the Serb side.
</P>
<P>
   Following the arrest, the chief prosecutor for the tribunal,
Carla del Ponte, called once more for the cap- ture of Karadzic and
said the two men should stand trial jointly be- cause they were
charged with the same heinous crimes. The tribunal is clearly
pressing NATO to make that trial a reality by arresting Kara- dzic,
who was indicted in 1995 on charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment against Krajis-H nik listed some 40 towns and
vil- lages from where Muslims and Croats were driven by force. It
also listed hundreds people who were massacred. It also specified
11 pris- on camps where non-Serbs were de- tained and tortured,
executed or de- ported under orders from Kra-H jisnik and other top
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the war he was second only to Karadzic and shared command
over Bosnian military and police,'' said Paul Risley, the spokesman
for del Ponte. ``The decisions he participated in, resulted in the
deaths of thousands of Bosnians and in the deportations and ethnic
cleansing of hundred of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on NATO to arrest key figures accused of genocide
in the Balkans has been growing since last spring, after Louise
Arbour, then the international tribunal's prosecutor, began
complaining publicly about the lack of cooperation she had received
from Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Arbour began to receive the help she sought from
British, German and U.S. military intelligence agencies, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that ``this puts pressure on everyone else, is a
strong warning, and a strong assertion of renewed determination by
NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte, who succeeded Arbour, said the tribunals'
investigators have stepped up their work in turn, and expect to
bring as many as 50 more indictments of senior officials
responsible for crimes of genocide, murder and ``ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Del Ponte has intensified the demand on the nations of NATO for
intelligence support and military action against suspected war
criminals in the Balkans. She called Monday for those nations ``to
insist on the apprehension and surrender of all other indicted''
war criminals, and in particular Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' demands helped stiffen NATO's spine, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik, an executive of Yugoslavia's biggest power company
before the nation war, has long been Karadzic's political tool.
Dealing in arms during the Balkans war, he also played a shrewd
enough hand to emerge as the titular political leader of Bosnia's
Serbs in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Out of office since 1998, he still wielded political control in
concert with Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krajisnik is a big fish,'' the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin, said in an interview Monday. ``And we expect his
arrest to rattle Karadzic's cage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary general, warned
other war crimes suspects: ``The net is closing. It is time to turn
your- selves in.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik held a series of polit- ical posts after helping
Karadzic found the Serb nationalist party known as SDS in the
1980s. As one of the SDS leaders, he became speaker of the Bosnian
Serb assem- bly and was a member of the Bosni- an Serb Security
Council. His roles gave him shared control over the military and
the police. He was Karadzic's top aide for much of the Bosnian war,
and after Karadzic was indicted publicly and could no longer have
an official function, Krajisnik succeeded him. Krajisnik served as
the Serbian representative in the post- settlement presidency of
the Bosnian Federation from 1996-98 without be- ing challenged by
the NATO-led peacekeeping troops that arrested him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   French officers were reluctant to  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  act
against prominent Serbs in and around Pale, in the zone French
forces command under NATO's ban- ner..
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one question being asked behind the scenes here was why
France suddenly agreed to capture a senior Bosnian Serb official.
Al- though most NATO personnel in Bos- nia deliberately avoided
encounter- ing indicted individuals until 1997, France held out
until recently. This prompted open talk among British and U.S.
military officials that France was pro-Serb and that the French
sector of Bosnia was a safe haven for indicted Serbs. Of the 18
NATO arrests made since 1997, the French military had arrested only
two low-level men, and only in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts here, several recently publicized incidents
point- ing to cooperation between French and Serbian intelligence
may have embarrassed Paris and brought the turnabout that led to
the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch officials also said that del Ponte, an experienced and
tough prosecutor in Switzerland before joining the tribunal last
year, has made it a priority to enlist French cooperation. She has
called on sev- eral ministers in Paris recently. President Jacques
Chirac visited the tribunal here in February while on a state visit
to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the French at last may have pulled the plug on
wanted Serbs in Bosnia,'' said one Dutch official. ``Some even went
skiing in the French sector, but people must be getting quite
nervous over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 70 suspects are known to be under indictment by the
tribunal; other sealed indictments may also exist. Of those
suspects, 39 are now in custody, including Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his critics in the region believe that Krajisnik's time
had come because he remained an im- portant obstacle to Western at-
tempts to make progress in the peace effort in Bosnia and allow
Muslim and other refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be the most per- sistent extremist and
xenophobic in- dividual with whom I had to deal,'' said Jacques
Klein, the head of the U.N. mission in Bosnia. ``He has this
xenophobic kind of ha- tred.''

 I DON'T SEE ANY STATUES OF LAWYERS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thank God Willie Mays didn't whine that his statue wasn't big
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Say Hey Kid, as it turns out, is a lot more gracious than
the Say Nay Kid.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the late Joe DiMaggio has threatened legal
action if San Francisco honors DiMaggio by giving his name to North
Beach Playground, where Joe played ball as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Morris Engelberg, is the Say Nay Kid. Even though
he's an old coot, he acts like an immature kid. He says Joe wanted
something bigger named for him _ the Bay Bridge or the airport.
</P>
<P>
   All Willie (Say Hey) Mays got was a large statue at the new
ballpark, and he didn't start talking about a lawsuit unless we
named that large pool of water next to San Francisco the Say Hey
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown and Supervisor Gavin Newsom, so far, are
caving in to the threats.
</P>
<P>
   What is this, Petaluma? This city can't afford to battle that
attorney twerp in court?
</P>
<P>
   And would the Great DiMaggio really have been offended to have
all those scruffy kids playing ball on Joe D Field?
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Mayor Willie and Gavin: Name the playground after Joe,
let his mouthpiece sue and expose himself to international
ridicule. If you don't, I'm going to sue the city for cowardice.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio got knocked to the dirt by about 1,000 chin-high
fastballs, and not once did he run whimpering to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   AND LITTLE STU Miller didn't whine when I referred to him in
Saturday's column as a diminutive lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the former Giants' pitcher once blown off the mound at
Candlestick, is a rightie.
</P>
<P>
   Honest mistake. In baseball, except for Stu, all little pitchers
are lefties. Bobby Shantz, Whitey Ford, Billy Pierce, Danny Boone,
Harvey Haddix. And all little lefties are crafty.
</P>
<P>
   But I should've known, since Miller is not Stuey and all small
crafty lefties have names ending in y.
</P>
<P>
   RECENT ITEM told of a male meter maid whose three-wheeler got
smacked by a bad guy in a stolen car, who also hit a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   In the account I got, the taxi driver chased the bad guy and
held him, then the bad guy's pals made threats, so cabbie let bad
guy go.
</P>
<P>
   In reality: Cabbie did nothing, while his  &UR; passenger  &LR; gave
chase. The passenger was a local financial writer, Jon Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   And as Rhine made the tackle and struggled with the bad guy, who
tried to bite him, at least a dozen bystanders did nothing. The
cabbie alertly kept the meter running, costing our hero an extra
$8.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Rhine is a serial vigilante. He has chased bad
guys on at least three other occasions over the years. And never
once did anyone say so much as ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yo, John: Thanks.
</P>
<P>
   TRAIN PAIN: My travel guru Seymour Seitz took the train to
Sacramento for the weekend, but come 8:40 Sunday morning, time to
return, no train.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Amtrak was an hour late because the driver of the train
crew's pickup van forgot to spring forward.
</P>
<P>
   And a Caltrain ballpark special last Wednesday (ballpark preview
day) was a disaster _ overcrowded, chaotic, many near fights, etc.
Veteran conductor Jeffery Craig Papp tried to defuse the tension by
issuing apologies for the screwup of the Joint Powers Board.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that the train would be passing the JPB building,
``So here's your chance to moon 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Papp has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   YOUR TAX dollars at work: Contra Costa County bought disposable
cameras and gave 'em to homeless folk, then put the photos on
display, calling the exhibition ``Putting a Face on Homelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   One official said, ``They were really empowered by the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Blarney, says homeless advocate Susan Prather. Their faces are
all over the streets as it is. How about some real programs to get
their faces off the streets?
</P>
<P>
   So Prather mailed a camera to each county supervisor (except
one) and to two other key county officials. Her instructions: Take
a picture of yourself for an exhibit titled ``Picture the
Bureaucracy: Faces of the Hopeless and Ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   STROLLING SUNNY Berkeley, Tom Turner stopped at a
cookies-and-lemonade stand run by two 8-year-old girls.
</P>
<P>
   When the group in front of Tom bought the last cookies, one of
the girls whipped out her cell phone. ``Mom, we've run out of
cookies. Can you bring some more?''

 SIMPLE TESTS FOR BREAST CANCER MAY SPARE WOMEN CHEMOTHERAPY  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two little-known biological signposts of breast
cancer that can be picked up in simple tests may spare thousands of
women the need for debilitating chemotherapy, scientists reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A new study found strong evidence that the testing can predict
which women who have surgery and radiation to remove an early-stage
breast tumor should also be treated with cancer-killing drugs to
cut the risk of a recurrence. A recurrence often brings a much
worse prognosis than the initial cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by a German research team, was outlined at
the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research
in San Francisco, where the main focus Monday was on new ways to
gauge the risks of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the
second-leading cancer killer of American women after lung cancer
and the most frequently diagnosed form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said they hope to translate recent gains in
understanding the molecular workings of cancer into better clinical
practice, particularly by targeting therapies to patients who
really need it while sparing others the sometimes awful side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 180,000 U.S. women newly diagnosed with breast
cancer each year have tumors of less than 2 centimers and the
cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   For more than roughly 2 out of 3 of these node-negative
patients, surgery and radiation eliminate the cancer for good. But
the tumor comes back in the other 30 percent of cases _ forcing
many women to opt for so-called ``adjuvant chemotherapy'' as a
precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   But measuring levels of two cancer-related proteins _ known as
uPA and PAI-1 _ can dramatically sharpen the odds of making the
proper choice.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are inexpensive, costing about $20 in Europe, where
they are widely used. But authorities have had little evidence to
justify widespread use in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Tests come in different forms for different types of tumors.
Some are licensed for routine use in the United States already,
while others are expected to be cleared by the end of the year,
depending on how persuasive the evidence turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new data is going to help a lot,'' said John Berryman,
manager for information services and regulatory affairs at
test-maker American Diagnostica Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Lead author Anita Prechtl of the Technical University of Berlin
found that the two tumor markers ``consistently demonstrated a
correlation with both duration of disease-free survival and overall
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   She followed 556 patients for about 32 months on average.
Results showed that about 55 percent of patients could be
classified as having a very low risk of relapse based on low
measured levels of uPA, short for urokinase-type plasminogen
activator, and PAI-1, an inhibitor of the same protein.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 93 percent of the low-risk patients had no recurrence
without the cancer-killing drug therapy. Conversely, in those
patients found to have high risk for recurrence, giving a standard
form of chemotherapy reduced the probability of relapse by nearly
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors emphasized that cancer may return after being absent for
many years, suggesting the need for a much longer study than what
was presented Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In other presentations, cancer researchers shed new light on
such diverse issues as the efficacy of radical surgery and the
everyday dietary risks of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A research team at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., found
that surgically removing both breasts as a way to prevent cancer _
so-called bilateral prophylactic mastectomy _ reduced the risk
significantly even in women with genetic mutations that make them
especially vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research had shown that prophylactic surgery can work
even if the woman has a family history of cancer, but Monday's was
the first to document a link to women with the genetic mutations.
</P>
<P>
   For those without the more frightening known risks, scientists
offered new grounds for making some fairly modest changes in diet.
</P>
<P>
   Research into the risks of eating meat have found that the
danger lies mainly in how it is cooked _ not in the meat itself.
That is because of probable carcinogens found in charred, well-done
meat cooked at high heat, such as on an open-flame grill.
</P>
<P>
   Data is not conclusive, and the dietary risks are thought to be
relatively modest overall even for frequent barbecuers. But given
the preliminary evidence, consumers might be wise to avoid eating a
lot of charred meat if they can help it, said Rashmi Sinha of the
National Cancer Institute.

 TRIAL TO DETERMINE FATE OF CHRONICLE SALE  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp. and former mayoral candidate
Clint Reilly agreed Monday to proceed directly to a full trial on
Reilly's legal effort to block the pending sale of The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which bypasses a hearing on a preliminary
injunction, means that Hearst's long-delayed purchase of the
newspaper will be postponed at least until after the full trial is
held in May.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement keeps in place a temporary restraining order
issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker after he
expressed concerns about Hearst's imminent sale of the San
Francisco Examiner to the Fang family, which owns the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the preliminary injunction hearing on April 13, the
two sides will prepare for a trial beginning May 1 where the judge
will decide whether or not to permanently block the sale. The
nonjury trial is expected to last one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Shulman, one of Reilly's attorneys, said the agreement
came at the suggestion of representatives for Hearst and The
Chronicle after the judge granted Reilly's request to delay the
sale until the scheduled April 13 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the judge's ruling last Thursday, I think they perceived
that they'd lose the preliminary injunction hearing,'' Shulman
said. ``They said they wanted an early trial, and we said fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Publisher Tim White said a trial will give the
newspapers an opportunity to present a full case to the judge. ``I
think, in some ways, it's a relief to have something definitive on
the horizon,'' said White, who will become publisher of The
Chronicle if the deal goes through.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least there's finally a finish line in sight for this
marathon,'' said Chronicle Executive Editor Matthew Wilson. ``We
want this over with so that we can focus all of our energies on
building an even stronger newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hearst and Reilly were hammering out an agreement to go to
trial, Reilly posted a $100,000 bond that had been ordered by
Walker to cover any losses that could be proven by Hearst and The
Chronicle if Walker's temporary restraining order were overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's order came after an attorney for The Chronicle said
that the newspapers' owners were losing almost $100,000 in interest
income every day the sale is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's developments did not come as a surprise to antitrust
experts, who said that it is not unusual in cases involving a
pending merger to try to get to trial as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is money,'' said Laurence Popofsky, a veteran San
Francisco antitrust lawyer. ``And these transactions live and die
in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fuss with a preliminary hearing and still face the
prospect of a trial sometime in the future, the newspaper owners
can present their strongest case, call in witnesses and obtain a
decision in a relatively short period of time, Popofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of legal controversy where the premium for
the defendant is to get to the guts of right and wrong as soon as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules against Reilly, the newspaper owners say, the
sale of The Chronicle and Examiner will immediately be completed.
Reilly could file an appeal, but antitrust lawyers say there is no
guarantee that Walker or the appellate court would agree to further
delay the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to put a final end to this apparently endless
saga,'' said Stephen Barnett, a law professor at Berkeley's Boalt
Hall School of Law who has followed newspaper antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawsuit appears to be the only roadblock to the sale,
which would dramatically reshape the newspaper market in the Bay
Area. The Justice Department has already approved the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, the San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner have
published under a joint operating agreement, which provides that
the two newspapers share business and publishing facilities but
maintain separate editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   After owners of The Chronicle put the paper on the market,
Hearst announced in August that it was purchasing the morning
newspaper for a reported $660 million and selling the Examiner,
which as the afternoon newspaper had seen its circulation plummet
to 108,968.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hearst agreed to sell the Examiner to the Fang
family.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of its deal with Pan Asia Venture Capital Corp.,
a publishing company owned by the Fangs, Hearst has agreed to keep
the Examiner running and pay all costs during a four-month
transition period.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst will pay $16 million for the balance of the first year
and up to $25 million for each of the next two years to keep the
Examiner operating.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly filed his original lawsuit in January, arguing that
Hearst's purchase of The Chronicle would give the newspaper chain
an illegal monopoly on the local newspaper market. After Hearst
announced the sale of the Examiner to the Fangs, Reilly went back
to court seeking an order to delay the deal, which he called a
``sham.''
</P>
<P>
   In his pleadings, Reilly relied on expert witnesses who said
that it would take a subsidy of $250 million over five years to
keep the Examiner in business.

CENTER FIELD BELONGS TO ANDERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- It took the trade of one of his best friends, but
Garret Anderson has found a home.
</P>
<P>
   From a personal standpoint, Anderson was sad to see Jim Edmonds
traded to the Cardinals last month. But from a professional
standpoint, it entrenched Anderson in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Anderson played mostly center field, but only
because Edmonds was hurt. In 1998, Anderson played right field
because Tim Salmon was hurt. Before that he was a left fielder.
Without the trade of Edmonds this spring, Anderson would have seen
some time as the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm an every-day player and not a DH,'' Anderson said.
``I'm glad I didn't have to go in there (to manager Mike Scioscia's
office) and say something. I know I've earned the right to play out
there every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's different now is that the outfield
situation is settled. We don't have too many outfielders anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unless Edgard Clemente is considered a candidate to
eventually challenge for a starting spot. The Angels are high on
Clemente and his best position is center field. And all the teams
that previously were interested in Edmonds -- Mariners, Yankees,
A's -- still need an outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is a free agent at the end of the season, but the San
Fernando Valley native would like to stay in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely would like to stay here,'' Anderson said. ``But
it's not a decision I can make. It's more a matter of what the
front office wants to do. I learned at an early age, if they want
you, they'll find a way to keep you. If they don't want you, you're
gone. So I've learned to take care of my own business on the field
and everything else will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question regarding Scioscia's opening-night lineup was
the catching spot, and he went with Bengie Molina over Matt
Walbeck. Molina became the Angels' seventh opening-night catcher in
eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bengie is going to get a little more of an opportunity early
on to see what he can do,'' Scioscia said. ``I talked to Matt and
he took it very well. He's a competitor and wants to play every
day. But he understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina got a chance to make Scioscia look good early in Monday's
game. The Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch led off the game, and tried to
steal second on the first pitch to Derek Jeter. Molina threw
Knoblauch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real exciting for me,'' Molina, 25, said of getting the
opening-night start. ``It's a dream come true for me. There are no
words to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels honored their all-time team in pregame ceremonies
Monday. Commemorating their 40th season, the fans voted on the
club's website, www.angelsbaseball.com.
</P>
<P>
   Those in attendance Monday were second baseman Bobby Grich,
third baseman Doug DeCinces, catcher Bob Boone, left fielder Brian
Downing, right fielder Reggie Jackson, right-handed starter Mike
Witt, left-handed starter Frank Tanana and reliever Troy Percival.
Those not in attendance were manager/shortstop Jim Fregosi, first
baseman Rod Carew, center fielder Jim Edmonds, right-handed starter
Nolan Ryan, left-handed starter Chuck Finley and DH Don Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ramon Ortiz (small tear in shoulder tissue) threw in the
bullpen Monday and will make his next rehab start Thursday in
Arizona in a minor league camp game. He's on track to make his
season debut April 11. ... Pitcher Tim Belcher, recovering from
off-season elbow surgery, will throw a two-inning simulated game
today and again later in the homestand. Belcher expects to go on a
rehab assignme nt after the Angels begin their first road trip
April 14. ... Mo Vaughn, who held a players-only team meeting on
opening night last season and did the same in Boston while with the
Red Sox, did not hold a meeting before Monday's game.

 STANFORD NAMES ENTREPRENEUR PRESIDENT  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ and BILL WORKMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Stanford University officials named Provost
John L. Hennessy the campus' 10th president Monday, making him the
first entrepreneur and computer scientist to lead a major research
university and positioning Stanford to take a leading role in the
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of a seminal Silicon Valley microprocessor company
that apparently made him millions, Hennessy, 47, has also served as
chairman of Stanford's computer sciences department and dean of the
School of Engineering. He replaces Gerhard Casper, 61, who
announced last fall that he would step down after eight years as
president to return to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy, who has been at Stanford since 1977, acknowledged that
he does not have a smooth road ahead of him when he takes the post
on September 1.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment comes only days after a federal jury in San Jose
concluded that a former Stanford University medical school
researcher was fired in retaliation for her complaints of sex
discrimination and awarded her $540,000. He must also mop up after
the failed merger of Stanford's hospital with the University of
California at San Francisco that was dissolved on April 1 after
racking up huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hennessy has been increasingly depicted as
sensitive to the issues of women on the faculty. As provost, he has
already initiated a schedule of taking female faculty members
individually to lunch to discuss their careers.
</P>
<P>
   `'We need to engage all of our faculty and staff about how to
make a better working environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said he must work to build on the academic
program that Casper undertook, including strengthening of the
undergraduate program and continuing Stanford's ``ability to
attract the best faculty, the best staff and the best students,
given the cost of living in the Bay Area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Ikenberry, president of the American Council on
Education, the nation's leading higher education association, said
Hennessy is well-prepared to handle the challenges of running a
world-class institution with 14,219 students and 1,640 faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strong point will be that none of those will be new issues
for him. He will have lived those issues and dealt with them as
provost,'' Ikenberry said. ``He enjoys a very strong reputation
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Casper said, he has admired Hennessy's ``clarity,
intellectual vigor and honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   As provost, Hennessy has been the chief academic and budget
officer, overseeing the university's $1.6 billion academic
operating budget and its $6.2 billion endowment.
</P>
<P>
   He has also taken on some of the tough issues facing the
university, including soaring housing costs and the need to
reexamine faculty and staff compensation. In addition, he is
leading the searches for new deans for the schools of medicine and
education and for undergraduate admission.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University President Richard Levin, a 1968 Stanford
graduate, said it is a ``healthy sign'' that Stanford chose an
insider as president and said it will give the new president a
``flying start.''
</P>
<P>
   With a Ph.D. in computer science and his business experience as
cofounder of MIPS Computer Systems in 1984, Hennessy is expected to
bring a strong focus on technology into the classrooms and
strengthen Stanford's position in the booming high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Diefendorff, editor and chief of the Sunnyvale-based
Microprocessor Report, said that Hennessy is one of the early
pioneers of a microprocessing design that changed the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy has also authored one of the most heavily used computer
architecture books, worked until recently as the chief architect of
Silicon Graphics Computer Systems and continues to consult for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is clearly a technologist at heart,'' Diefendorff said.
``He is one of the icons of Silicon Valley and the computer
microprocessor industry. From that perspective, you can only
believe he can only strengthen Stanford's role there.''
</P>
<P>
   As dean, Hennessy engineered an online master's degree in
electrical engineering in 1998, making Stanford the first major
research university to do so. And he has used the Internet
extensively to support students in his classes.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford graduates have founded several successful startups,
including Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Cisco Systems. The
university was also the incubator for Yahoo, created by two
Stanford undergraduates, Jerry Yang and David Philo, who studied
under Hennessy.
</P>
<P>
   Yang said Hennessy has always had a vision of how the university
and the industry work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the environment where there is a healthy interchange
of ideas between the university and industry has been one that John
supports,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy's ties to Silicon Valley may give him a leg up in
raising money for the university. He was instrumental in pulling in
the university's biggest ever donation, $150 million last October
from Silicon Graphics and Netscape cofounder Jim Clark, to fund a
biomedical engineering and sciences center.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy, who lives in Atherton with his wife and two sons, is
reputed to have made his fortune when he sold MIPS to Silicon
Graphics for $200 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education,
Hennessy would not reveal his net worth, but conceded he could
``get away with being on a few boards and doing nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, that means working at Stanford. Although university
officials did not disclose Hennessy's new salary, his predecessor
made $379,622 in 1997-98, according to the Chronicle of Higher
Education.
</P>
<P>
   `'If you have enough financial independence, then you can do
what you really love and not worry that you're missing the next dot
com,'' Hennessy said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expects Hennessy's engineering background to signal
that Stanford is ``about to become MIT west,'' said John
Bravman(cq) &LR; , Stanford's vice provost for undergraduate education.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, said Bravman, ``this is the time to have someone (as
president) who is deeply connected to the whole new economy, and
who also appreciates the breadth of what we do here at the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy was one of about 400 applicants considered for the job
during the five-month search. Just who the other finalists for the
presidency were could not be determined Monday, with the 17-member
search committee maintaining a discreet silence.
</P>
<P>
   Among those rumored to have been leading candidates were Nan
Keohane, president of Duke University, also a Stanford graduate;
William Brody, president of Johns Hopkins University, and U.S.
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Another name that emerged immediately after Casper's
announcement he was resigning was that of Condoleezza Rice, a
senior researcher at Stanford's Hoover Institution, Republican
George W. Bush's foreign policy adviser and Hennessy's predecessor
as provost.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rice said Monday that she was never a candidate for the
Stanford job. ``I love Stanford, but when I left I made clear that
my future was in foreign policy, and everyone respected my
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   In selecting a provost to step up to the president's job, the
trustees returned to what had become almost a routine procedure of
promoting provosts into the top spot before Casper's arrival on
campus in 1992. The two presidents immediately prior to Casper,
Donald Kennedy and Richard W. Lyman, had both been provosts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Levin, Stanford's student body president, said Hennessy's
appointment is ``a huge win for students.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As provost, John Hennessy cared very much what students had to
say, and we look forward now to working with him as president,'' he
said.

NO RUSH GETTING BLAKE INTO LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- With the Kings already in the playoffs, they are
using caution in bringing back captain Rob Blake from a bruised
left knee suffered in Saturday's game against the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Blake did not play Monday night against the Coyotes, remaining
in Los Angeles to undergo test. He will be reevaluated again today
and could rejoin the team for Wednesday's game in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him here, but it is important to get him health,''
coach Andy Murray said. ``Rob has had an outstanding season and he
is so important to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who has had a history of injuries, has been healthy all
season with the exception of two games in January with a strained
groin.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not ready to go, Blake is expected to play Friday
against the defendng Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In other injury news, Nelson Emerson, who broke the index finger
on his left hand just four games after coming over from Atlanta,
has the arm in a cast, but surgery has been ruled out for now.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson was whacked across the left hand by Philadelphia's
Daymond Langkow on March 23. When the hand swelled doctors thought
Emerson might need a pin in the finger to stabilize the joint.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy, sidelined since a sprained right shoulder March15
against the Might Ducks, remains in Los Angeles and is skating
daily at the club's training facility in El Segundo. The Kings do
not know whether Palffy will be back before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Big Hit: Although the Coyotes were on the verge of clinching a
playoff spot, most of the talk at America West Arena focused on the
crushing hit by Phoenix's Dallas Drake last Saturday on Edmonton's
Boyd Devereaux.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers are seeking a suspension for Drake, who they claim
left is feet to apply a shoulder to the head of Devereaux, who
suffered a concussion. The Coyotes rallied from a three-goal
deficit after the hit, but lost 4-3 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him, but it is part of the game,'' said Drake, who
scored the Coyotes' first goal Monday. ``I hear he is getting
better and I am happy for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick Whistles: The Kings came in 1-3 against Phoenix, but won
the last meeting 5-2. Phoenix is tied with Detroit for the league
lead with eight 40-point scorers, but has scored an NHL-low 36
power play goals. ....

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEAVES ACHIEVES A SLIVER OF THE DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES thruout with game result.) 
 (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The day before Monday night's national
championship game against Florida, Tom Izzo, the Michigan State
coach, made one of the more startling statements of the tournament.
He said Mateen Cleaves, his senior point guard, was as significant
to Michigan State basketball as Magic Johnson had been.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows arched. Magic was one of the great point guards in
National Basketball Association history. Magic transformed the
position. Magic and Larry Bird crystallized the melting-pot nature
of college basketball and carried that goodwill into the pro game
right when the National Basketball Association really needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo wasn't saying that Cleaves was as good as Magic. He was
saying that Cleaves was as significant to the Spartans in the late
1990s as Johnson was in the late 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's only one Magic,'' Izzo said. ``I just think
that Mateen Cleaves has been the next closest thing because of his
personality, because of his will to win. A lot of players have it,
but Mateen shares it with everybody. He is the reason we are a
great family. Great players make all the people around then better.
They might take them from good to great, from average to good. For
us, Mateen makes our coaching staff better, he makes our players
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo knew that if Michigan State was to win its first
championship since Johnson led them in 1979, Cleaves would have to
be everything Izzo said he was.
</P>
<P>
   In the 89-76 national championship victory, A.J. Granger and
Morris Peterson would be the most valuable players, bailing the
Spartans out with clutch basket after clutch bas- ket. But Cleaves,
who finished with 18 points, four assists and just two turn- overs,
was the emotional engine. He displayed skill in the first half and
heart in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves missed his first shot but then set the tone for Michigan
State's formula for beating the Florida press. He outran a double
team and scored. A possession later, Cleaves, employing the same
strategy, beat the double team and scored again. With 16 minutes 39
seconds left in the half and Michigan State leading by 11-9,
Cleaves left the game. His re- placement was Jason Richardson, a
6-foot-6-inch guard from Saginaw, Mich., who thrives in the
fullcourt up- tempo game forced by Florida. In Cleaves's absence,
Richardson flour- ished. He scored six points, but more than the
points, the understudy forced Florida to reconsider its full-H
court pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When Cleaves returned 3:11 later, Michigan State led by 17-11.
Just when the Florida defense was get- ting comfortable with giving
Cleaves breathing room, the all-American pulled through.
</P>
<P>
   His 3-pointer with 9:51 left gave the Spartans a 24-17 lead; his
3 with 8:49 remaining boosted the lead to 29-20. Finally, Cleaves's
3 with 1:12 left in the half gave Michigan State a 43-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Cleaves's bas- kets may have saved the game.
Flor- ida had just scored four straight points and pulled within
48-41. Cleaves broke the press and dribbled the length of the court
to score.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves came to Michigan State as a highly-touted
football-basketball player from nearby Flint, a city that has
turned out a large number of outstanding high school, college and
professional athletes. Each season has been better than the one
before, from an injury-riddled freshman year when the Spartans went
to the National Invitational Tournament, to a better sophomore
season, to last year's run to the Final Four, which ended with a
semifinal loss to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves said his freshman season set the tone for the rest of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lowest point in my career was when we went to the NIT,''
Cleaves said. ``There's nothing wrong with that tournament, but
just to sit back and watch TV and watch these teams in the NCAA
tournament, to see all the media, watching how much fun they were
having, seeing the smiles of guys, then watching the Final Four. I
promised myself back then: `I'm going to play in that NCAA
tournament; I'm not going to the NIT anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   So how good is Cleaves, really? Is he NBA caliber? He certainly
isn't the traditional player with obvious gifts. He doesn't have a
terrifying shot or an unstoppable penetration move. At 6 feet 1
inch, Cleaves is more likely to be posted up than post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a guy that wanted the stats, never been a guy
who wanted the accolades,'' he said. ``I just want to win. Whatever
you do, win. A lot of guys tease me a lot, they say I cheat when we
play cards, but I just want to win. The name of the game is win.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Wisconsin last Saturday, Cleaves' line was atrocious: 1
point. NBA personnel who watched the game weren't deterred. Chris
Wallace, the Boston Celtics general manager, is a Cleaves fan.
``You look at his statistics against Wisconsin _ nothing to be
excited about _ but they won and he played a key role in them
winning,'' Wallace said. ``He is a tremendous leader, has excellent
intangibles and he has a hardened, winning edge.''
</P>
<P>
   With Magic Johnson and Steve Smith watching, Cleaves showed the
hardness and the edge. At 50-44, Cleaves dribbled the length of the
court and was fouled. Cleaves, ap- parently not hearing the
whistle, kept going. His right ankle got tan- gled with Teddy
Dupay's foot; he tumbled and suffered a severe sprain. With 16:18
left in the season, he had to leave the game with his team clinging
to a 50-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, severely limping, re- turned to a thunderous ovation ,
with 11:11 left and Michigan State lead- ing, 58-49.
</P>
<P>
   His first play was a turnover on a fast break; his second a
fullcourt outlet to Peterson for a basket. With Cleaves playing on
one leg, Michigan State went on a 21-9 run and put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves didn't score, Cleaves did- n't pass. Michigan State won
a na- tional championship.

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Mateen Cleaves had returned for his senior year
for this national championship stage and those pearl white nets
dangling beneath two baskets. Monday night he grimaced and screamed
his way through a virtuoso performance in the spotlight and then
smiled sweetly and clipped down the nylon as his final bow as a
senior.
</P>
<P>
   He had plenty of help from his Michigan State teammates who had
vowed to be back hours after being defeated by Duke last year in
the national semifinals. His best friend from his hometown of
Flint, Mich., Morris Peterson, rained in 21 points from distances
that were often barely inbounds. Another senior, willowy A.J.
Granger, snaked through the lanes for 19 points worth of tip-ins
and point-blank jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Michigan State's 89-76 victory over young
Florida was Cleaves-willed, Cleaves-orchestrated and as fine a
one-man show a college basketball player could perform. The point
guard who missed the first 13 games of the season with a stress
fracture to his right foot poured all his talent into an 18-point
on 7-of-11 shooting and four-assist outing.
</P>
<P>
   He blunted the Gators runs at every turn so his old team could
beat the precocious one and forced a precocious coach, Florida's
34-year-old Billy Donovan, to wait his turn behind a beloved one,
Michigan State's Tom Izzo. And so finally a wacky, unpredictable
tournament came to a true and just end: the best team in the nation
rightfully crowned.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did it look like it wouldn't _ Florida burst out in
the second half intent on cutting into Michigan State's 11-point
lead. The Gators pounded the ball into Udonis Haslem and Brent
Wright, then Mike Miller drained a 3-pointer to cut the lead to
47-41. But Cleaves refused to let the young Gators to get a grip on
the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   He sliced through the Florida press for a layup; he nailed a
3-pointer - his 18th point - and put the Spartans back up by 50-44.
With 16:18 left, Cleaves was trying to stop Florida's surge again.
He caught a pass on the fly at midcourt and was slapped on the
wrist by Brett Nelson. Cleaves, however, continued to the basket
and tangled with the Gators' Teddy Dupay and was hammered to the
floor. He crawled along the baseline, grabbed his lower leg and
after several minute delay was pulled from the game and taken back
to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates repelled another Florida surge in his absence -
Mike Chappell and Granger banging in clutch 3-pointers. When a big
screen in the RCA dome showed Cleaves making his way back to the
court, the crowd of 43,116 roared. When Cleaves re-entered the game
with 11:51 minutes left and his team up 58-50, even the Gators fans
applauded politely perhaps knowing the end was at hand. The Gators
never got closer.
</P>
<P>
   For Michigan State, the vision of a national title appeared a
year ago at a hotel in Florida. The Spartans had just been beaten
by Duke in the Final Four semifinals, and Izzo gathered his guys in
a crowded room and told them they would be back.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida, the national championship apparition visited just
three weeks ago on a basketball floor in Winston-Salem, N.C. The
Gators were about to be bounced in the first round by Butler in
overtime when Miller hit a runner with three-tenths of a second
left to snatch a 68-67 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Just as this Michigan State team envisioned a championship, the
Spartans had some history on their side _ Magic Johnson led them to
a championship in 1979. Just as Florida was late to embrace its
title possibilities, the Gators' basketball program was a newcomer
to this spring spectacle. In 1994, the Gators made their only prior
Final Four appearance, and this was the school's first ever
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a 43-32 lead into halftime, Michigan State, the lone
top seed to make the Final Four, showed how age and experience
forged a tough-minded and deliberate team. Three seniors - Cleaves,
Peterson and Granger _ and two juniors, Charlie Bell and Andre
Hutson, looked every bit ready to uphold their refuse-to-lose
motto.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who had a sole senior and played seven freshmen and
sophomores at least 10 minutes a game, wanted to treat the 94-foot
court like a motor speedway and run over the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said his Florida team's helter-skelter style was
intended to take the ``fear and anxiety'' out of every possession
so his players would not treat a second of a 40-minute game like
it's ``life or death.'' But the Spartans showed early that they
were prepared for the full-court pressure when Peterson threw the
ball over the hawking defenders to a streaking Cleaves for easy
back-to-back layups and an 11-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Spartans not only did not commit a turnover into 12
minutes into the game, but Cleaves, their floor leader, led them to
53 percent shooting and a team-high 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As they have all season, Florida got a boost from its bench -
especially 3-point bomber, freshman Brett Nelson. The Gators first
five off the bench averaged 31.9 points a game in the regular
season and have upped it to 36.6 in the tournament. When the Gators
second unit entered the game with 13 minutes left, Nelson dropped
two 23-footers from top of the key to cut the Spartans lead to
21-17.
</P>
<P>
   But Izzo, too, dispatched his bench effectively. Freshman Jason
Richardson scored six points off the bench and helped ignite a 14-5
Spartan run that gave Michigan State a 35-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By playing stifling man-to-man defense and pounding the boards,
Michigan State also was able to control the tempo of the game. They
allowed their opponents an average of 59 points a game and led the
nation in rebounding margin, 11.7 a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators saw why as the Spartan defense held them to 40
percent shooting as Michigan State staked out the ground under the
basket as their own. Granger and the 6-3 Bell were especially
effective. Granger had four rebounds and scored nine points while
Bell, a tenacious jumper pulled down seven first-half rebounds.

MICHIGAN STATE TOPS FLORIDA, WINS NATIONAL TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-FLORIDA-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Florida sopohomore guard Teddy Dupay describes
his team's playing style this way: ``I bet if you're way up in the
arena, it probably looks like a bunch of ants running around after
you pull up a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   But rocks crush ants like scissors cut paper. And the Gators'
remarkable NCAA Tournament ran into an avalanche of boulders
disguised in Michigan State uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Even with two of their Flintstones _ Morris Peterson (foul
trouble) and Mateen Cleaves (sprained right ankle) _ missing a key
second-half stretch, Michigan State showed its flinty side. The
Spartans played Florida's game better than Florida in recording an
89-76 national championship victory Monday night before 43,116 in
the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has sunk in yet what we've done,'' Michigan
State coach Tom Izzo said. ``It was a team effort. We had a lot of
guys do a lot of things. All of our subs played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (32-7) now has a second national championship
trophy to match the hardware won by the 1979 Magic Johnson team.
Florida, playing in its first national championship game, finished
29-8.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who finished with 21 points, went to the bench with
his third foul at 17:23. Just over a minute later, Cleaves _ who
had sliced through Florida's pressure defense with no impediments _
sprained his right ankle. As he hobbled to the locker room, it
appeared the Gators were ready for feeding time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cleaves went down, we knew we had to start making our
run, but we were never able to get it going,'' said Florida
sophomore forward Mike Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely going to get back out there,'' Cleaves said.
``The trainer just told me it was going to be sore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans played with the resolve and dedication of a room
full of Trappist monks. They turned Florida's strengths _ pressure
defense and waves of production from the bench _ into their
strengths. Especially with Peterson and Cleaves off the court.
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie Bell (nine points, five assists), A.J. Granger (19
points, nine rebounds) and reserve Mike Chappell (five points) made
sure that Florida never got closer than six points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see a team press them all year long, and that's
probably for a good reason,'' Donovan said. ``We didn't take away
the things we needed to. The press was effective in the second
half. Every time we made a run, they answered. That's a sign of a
great team with great leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, who finished with 18 points and four assists, and
Peterson returned with 11:51 remaining. Peterson, seeing his good
friend hobbled and limping, took over. He scored 14 points,
including three stone-cold 3-pointers, over a six-minute period.
His final three boosted Michigan State's lead to 82-62 with 5:18
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Michigan State's first eight field goals were the result
of slicing through Florida's full-court pressure. Cleaves had two
layups and an assist on an Andre Hutson basket. And the Spartans'
first turnover didn't occur until the 8:05 mark when Brett Nelson
poked the ball free from Cleaves. And all that resulted in was a
Gators turnover on the ensuing possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great game plan against their press,'' Cleaves said.
``We wanted me to cut through the middle and get me the ball. We
attacked it. We set up a formation that was easy for us to break
the press.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final 10 minutes of its last three NCAA Tournament
victories (Duke, Oklahoma State, North Carolina), the Gators
outscored those teams by 25 points (66-43), outshot them 47 percent
to 32 percent and outrebounded 39-23. But that witching hour never
came for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 minutes remaining, Michigan State had a 62-50 lead,
courtesy of Granger's follow shot. Over the last 10 minutes,
Michigan State turned the Gators into geckos.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo, 45, who was a Spartans assistant for a dozen years before
getting his current job, wants to have a picture taken with his old
boss, former Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote. Izzo said he wants
each of them holding the trophies of their respective championship
teams, to depict bridging the gap between 1979 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the Spartans, Michigan State 89, Florida 76 was a
championship game worth framing. nn

MICHIGAN STATE GETS MAD, THEN GRABS TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The last thing Florida should have done, the very
last thing, was injure Michigan State All-American Mateen Cleaves.
Instead of giving the Gators a chance to win, it actually sealed
their doom. Because when Teddy Dupay and Cleaves collided and
Cleaves landed awkwardly and sprained his right ankle and hobbled
to the lockerroom _ all it really did was make Michigan State mad.
</P>
<P>
   Tough, talented and wise, the Spartans are the best team in the
nation under normal circumstances. Once they got mad, they
overwhelmed the Gators with inspiring resolve, timely shooting and
a granite defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went out, we kind of knew how bad he was hurt,''
forward A.J. Granger said after the Spartans won the NCAA
championship Monday with an 89-76 victory over Florida before
43,116 in the RCA Dome. ``We rallied together in the huddle. We
looked at each other and said, `Let's do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves and Dupay tangled on a fast break with just over 16
minutes remaining and the Spartans leading 50-44. After they broke
free of each other, Cleaves landed hard and immediately grabbed his
right ankle. He was engulfed in medical and support personnel. He
eventually hobbled to the lockerroom. During his 4:30 absence, the
Spartans not only increased their led by three points, they
smothered Florida with an aggressive, immovable defense. The Gators
would make just five baskets over the next nine minutes as Michigan
State extended its six-point lead to 20.
</P>
<P>
   The victory will resonate throughout the state. The epicenter of
celebration, of course, is Michigan State's campus in Lansing,
which has waited 21 years for a title. The man who delivered the
1979 crown, Magic Johnson, attended Monday's game and joined the
Spartans afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very special to see him support us,'' Cleaves said. ``We
wanted to get a win for him.''
</P>
<P>
   They also will rejoice in Iron Mountain, in Michigan's Upper
Peninsula, where Spartans coach Tom Izzo and San Francisco 49ers
coach Steve Mariucci were high school classmates. They have
remained best friends and have had a longstanding bet: would Izzo
win a national title before Mariucci won a Super Bowl? Mariucci
lost.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, they're celebrating in Flint, the industrial town 60
miles northwest of Detroit. Home of General Motors and the United
Auto Workers' union, Flint now has something to show the nation
besides decay and (ital)Roger and Me(end ital). The Spartans' soul
_ Cleaves, Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell _ comes from Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``People outside of Flint see Flint as a bad, run-down city,''
Peterson said. ``Flint is a great city. Through all of the negative
things, Flint has taken pride in in athletics. We've brought some
glory back to Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Flintstones, as they're called, were instrumental in
the Spartans' victory. Cleaves had 18 points and four assists and
shredded Florida's pressure defense; he was named Final Four MVP.
Bell was quiet but effective, with nine points, eight rebounds and
five assists. He ran the offense flawlessly when Cleaves went down
_ just as he did during Cleaves' 13-game absence (broken foot) at
the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation was not any different than the beginning of the
year,'' Bell said. ``For half the year, I ran the team when Mateen
was injured. I feel very comfortable running the point. We had
adversity all year and tonight was no different. We are a team, and
that's why we're still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson _ Mo Pete, as he's called _ again showed why he is the
best pressure player in the country. After struggling in the first
half, he scored 16 points in the second and buried the Gators with
a series of 3-pointers. In six tournament games, Peterson scored 75
of his 105 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was more important than Granger, who made 7-of-11
shots , scored 19 points and grabbed nine rebounds. He also hit
three 3-pointers, each arriving just when the Spartans needed it
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called Granger the X factor,'' Florida coach Billy Donovan
said. ``We could not allow him to step out and make 3-point
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans not only broke Florida's press, they attacked it.
Usually, Cleaves pushed the issue, but he had help from Bell,
Granger and Peterson. Even center Andre Hutson helped a few times.
Together, they burst past the first wave of defenders, then either
took the ball to the rim or passed to open teammates for jumpers.
The Spartans used this approach to make seven of their first 10
shots and score 17 points in five minutes. It was a near-perfect
display: Michigan State did not commit a turnover for 12 minutes
and grabbed a lead it would not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a 1-4 set, and we made one pass and then let me cut
(to the middle of the court),'' Cleaves said. ``If we had (an
advantage in) numbers, (coach Tom Izzo) said to attack.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ They are a relic from the past, a product of another
time, like the butter churn, the Pony Express and the tankful of
gasoline that doesn't cost a sultan's riches.
</P>
<P>
   They are a running, jumping, up-in-your-face anachronism that
was built for the long haul rather than the quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of teen-agers dancing straight from the high school
prom into the NBA or using the university campus as no more than an
ivy-covered takeoff strip to jet toward the riches of a pro career,
they are a college basketball team that is the equivalent of newly
discovered drawings on the wall of a cave _ both old and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State won the national championship Monday night with a
starting lineup that consisted of three seniors and two juniors who
grew together, who lost together, who suffered together and
ultimately came together in a thoroughly complete and utterly
satisfying 89-76 triumph over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans are three longtime friends _ Mateen Cleaves, Morris
Peterson and Charlie Bell _ from the hardscrabble streets of what
was once the thriving town of Flint, Mich. They worked to build
this dream, this accomplishment, this special memory the way their
parents and neighbors used to build cars at the old Ford plants
that have long since shuttered their doors _ by toiling long hours
and for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Flintstones, as they came to be known, had a job to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Yabba dabba done.
</P>
<P>
   They might as well have been running an assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   They were led by Cleaves, the firecracker of a point guard who
was never going to let them come up short of their goal. He had
turned his back on a chance to jump to the NBA after his junior
season and had put so much of himself into reaching this point. He
hit seven of 11 shots, including a trio from 3-point range, to fire
in 18 points straight between the eyes of the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves is their voice, their emotion, the ignition spark that
turns over their engine, and he was not going to be denied, not
going to be stopped. He went down hard to the floor with 16:18 left
in the game after a particularly rough run-in with Florida's Teddy
Dupay and wound up crawling along the baseline toward the Spartans'
bench before being helped to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But you knew he would come back, even if the trainers had to tie
him to the saddle and prop him up like El Cid returning to battle,
and in less than five minutes, Cleaves was out on the floor again,
limping with a high sprain in his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   They were led by Peterson, the sharp, smooth, slender fellow who
is built like a stiletto and sticks just as deep and deadly.
Peterson, playing with the emotional burden of his grandmother's
death last week, pumped in 15 of his team-leading 21 points in the
second half to continually keep those Gator jaws from snapping shut
on his team.
</P>
<P>
   They were led by Bell, the junior-class member of the
Flintstones, who scored nine points but managed to get his 6-3
frame on the boards all night long for eight rebounds and dealt
five assists.
</P>
<P>
   They were led by A.J. Granger, the senior who will graduate next
month and then get married in June. He went on an early honeymoon
cruise with 19 points _ 3-for-5 on treys _ and was the X-factor
that repeatedly confused and made the Florida defense pay.
</P>
<P>
   If you're counting, that's four leaders, and, truth be told,
there were more. For this was a team that came back to the Final
Four for the second straight year to finish the task it started a
year ago when it lost to Duke in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   This was the team of the future in Florida _ five freshmen and
four sophomores _ that met the team of this night, this game, this
chance.
</P>
<P>
   They came from behind three straight times in the NCAAs, against
Utah, Syracuse and Iowa State, survived Wisconsin's coma ball, then
ran Florida right out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a bunch of guys who will always be special, because we
were always in it together,'' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this shouldn't be regarded as a throwback or one of the
first antiques from the 20th century. Maybe in this time of one- or
two-year wonders blowing through campus faster than a thunderstorm,
the way to build a real champion is to do it the Spartan way _
without an overall No. 1 NBA draft pick but with parts that are
complementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team will have five- and 10- and 20-year reunions,'' said
coach Tom Izzo. ``People at Michigan State will remember this team
for how it played.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more for how it persevered.

LOCAL TECH ISSUES TAKE IT ON THE CHIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Investors moved their money away from the new
economy stocks of the Nasdaq on Monday and toward the stalwarts of
the Dow Jones industrial average, continuing a market correction
that began last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq exchange, where shares of scores of local technology
companies are traded, sustained its largest single-day point drop
to date Monday. The fate of local firms in the sell-off mirrored
that of the rest of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Chatsworth-based MRV Communications, which manufactures
components for the fiber-optic networks that make up the
infrastructure of the Internet, had the region's largest decline
Monday, losing 19.65 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductors were down 7.4 percent, according to Anthony
O'Bryan, a market analyst with A.G. Edwards Inc. Locally, Vitesse
Semiconductor Inc. of Camarillo and Semtech Corp. of Newbury Park,
both semiconductor manufacturers, had only moderate losses Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Gerber, manager of the Woodland Hills office of Sun America
Securities, said Monday's decline ``was not a bad day in the stock
markets. The drop was in selected high-risk securities. ... Even
with a correction in the Nasdaq, it would be hard for me to believe
that people who invest today won't be happy in two to three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the recent volatility is because uninformed investors
sell their shares after seeing other investors dump their shares,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sell-off was precipitated by the breakdown in talks
between representatives of Microsoft and the U.S. Justice
Department, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just kind of a shock to the market,'' O'Bryan said.
``It just gave people an excuse to restart the correction in the
tech stocks because Microsoft was such a big player in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case was a fairly predictable catalyst for
Monday's decline, said Richard Barnett, director of equities for
Beverly Hills-based City National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Added Barnett: ``These declines are very healthy. Prices can't
continue to increase. It brings rationality back to the market.''

CLEAVES THE MAGICIAN HAS FIRM GRASP ON TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Muslim name that his activist parents gave
him means ``firm and unshakable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the beginning, it seems, they knew.
</P>
<P>
   On the night that he had dreamed about all his life, Michigan
State's Mateen Cleaves, raised to be a leader, took his dream by
his poised hands and transformed it into an NCAA basketball
championship Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Magic.
</P>
<P>
   It was 21 years ago that another Michigan State born-leader, a
magician named Earvin Johnson, unshakably carried the Spartans to
their last NCAA tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's known as a winner,'' Cleaves had said. ``I just want to
be known as a national champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Expected to be up to their shorts in Gators, the Spartans blew
through the Florida press and made a mockery of the notion that
their opponents' depth would be a telling factor.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant factor in the 89-76 victory, as it turns out, was
Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   The senior from Flint, Mich., painted the complexion of the game
from the beginning. He drove the paint. He shredded the Gators'
full-court pressure. When a sprained ankle finally slowed him down
four minutes into the second half, Cleaves had 18 points, and the
partisan Michigan State crowd could sense what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   A sign among the Spartans fans read, ``Party like it's 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a great competitor,'' Florida coach Billy Donovan
said of the new magician, Cleaves. ``He has a tremendous will to
win, as he showed all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring and shooting, however, were not supposed to be Cleaves'
paramount skills. Through his first five games of this NCAA
Tournament, Cleaves had been shooting only 37.5 percent from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think it was their defense tonight,'' the
Gators' Teddy Dupay said later. ``I think so often that's what they
get credit for. But offensively is where they hurt us tonight. They
scored pretty much at will.''
</P>
<P>
   And where there was a will Monday night, there was usually a
Mateen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has the heart of a lion,'' winning coach Tom Izzo
said. ``He has worked for this for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few Final Four teams in recent years who have seemed
more prepared. The Spartans' 13-point winning margin _ it once rose
to 20 _ is the largest since Duke overwhelmed Michigan's alleged
Fab Five by 20 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   An even more ringing statement about the job that Izzo did,
however, is that in Saturday's semifinals, the Spartans had every
answer for a startlingly different, doggedly defensive Wisconsin
team.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo had less than 48 hours to prepare for the hip-shooting,
free-subbing Gators.
</P>
<P>
   But what he had, Donovan clearly lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was they're seniors,'' the Florida coach said.
``Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson and A.J. Granger all stepped up,
made plays, made shots and opened the game up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Spartans had passed this way. Cleaves' boyhood
dream at that time was snuffed in the 1999 Final Four semis by
Duke. After two All-American seasons at point guard, Cleaves was
roundly expected to turn pro after that Final Four loss.
</P>
<P>
   But there was unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave up a lot of money to come back,'' Izzo said. ``People
should appreciate him for the great kid that he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as storybook as it gets for Mateen. He has lived his
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, he has been the Michigan State program's heart
and soul. But leading a team to its dreams was what Frances and
Herb Cleaves had in mind for their son 22 years ago, when they
pushed his baby stroller with them to civil-rights rallies and
school-board meetings and wherever there was a cause over which to
be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was what I came back for,'' Cleaves said. ``This was the
dream.'' nn

SPARTANS' CLEAVES WAS SIMPLY MAGICAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There is a seven-inch height difference between
Mateen Cleaves and Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson. And Cleaves' style is
bullish while Johnson was elegant and well, magical.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, a 21-year gap was closed between the 6-foot-2
Cleaves and the 6-9 Johnson when Michigan State won its second
national championship with an 89-76 victory against Florida.
Cleaves, who played 31 minutes against Florida's relentless
pressure defense, was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding
Player.
</P>
<P>
   The senior guard finished with 18 points. A less than 40-percent
shooter in the NCAA Tournament, he was an uncharacteristic 7-of-11
from the field, including 3-for-3 on 3-pointers. It was his
leadership as much as his statistics, however, which again willed
the Spartans to victory.
</P>
<P>
   With 16:18 remaining, shortly after scoring his final basket,
Cleaves injured his right ankle. He limped to the locker room with
his team leading, 50-44. When he returned with 11:51 left, Michigan
State was leading, 58-50. He played the rest of the game, often
limping up and down the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a lot of pain. I tried to walk on it and I couldn't
put any more pressure on it. We added some tape and a brace on it.
I started to cry a little bit, but luckily I was able to get back
out there and play,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the greatest leader in school history,'' Michigan
State coach Tom Izzo said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Which includes a guy named Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Johnson led the Spartans to their first national title
in a memorable championship-game matchup with Indiana State's Larry
Bird. Johnson was named the tournament's most outstanding player in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves announced at a pretournament pep rally in East Lansing,
Mich., that the Spartans would win the national championship. He
helped make good on that boast Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mateen has the heart of a lion,'' said Michigan State senior
Morris Peterson, a childhood friend of Cleaves. ``There's nothing
he can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves and the Spartans solved Florida's vaunted full-court
press with ease most of the night. The Spartans passed over it, or
in-bounded the ball to their big men, who then passed to Cleaves
for what amounted to fast-break opportunities. Florida had just one
steal off its press in the first 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleaves is a great point guard and he showed that tonight,''
Florida sophomore forward Mike Miller said. ``He did a good job of
running his team against our press and he hit some big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves missed the first 13 games of the season because of a
stress fracture in his right foot. After he returned, the Spartans
won 23 of their past 26 games. nn

HULL TIES DAD; FLAMES KNOT STARS

<P>
   DALLAS _ The Calgary Flames played like a desperate hockey team,
the Stars couldn't stand prosperity, and a night that should have
belonged to Brett Hull ended the way it started: All even.
</P>
<P>
   At the 7:48 mark of the second period, Hull blasted a vintage
one-timer past Calgary goalie Fred Brathwaite, nailing down career
goal No. 610 and tying his Hall of Fame father, Bobby, for ninth
all-time on the NHL's goals list.
</P>
<P>
   The goal supplied the Stars a 2-0 lead, a raucous home crowd and
610 reasons to finish off the 11th-place Flames. But Calgary's
desperation and the Stars' inability to clear their zone accounted
for two hard-luck third-period goals against Stars backup goalie
Manny Fernandez, who made 34 saves. But he was bombarded by 17
shots in the third period and overtime when the Stars managed six
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Each team traded chances in the extra period. Joe Nieuwendyk
missed wide left on a breakaway, and when the smoke cleared from a
wild, end-to-end affair, the Stars and Flames were tied, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allowed this game to get tied because we didn't stay with
the program,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We decided the
territorial game that we played the first two periods wasn't good
enough, and we decided we were going to start making plays. We had
full control of the hockey game and then we allowed them back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was a shame considering Hull's long-awaited
accomplishment. Goal No. 610 left only a smoking net and a burned
goaltender. It was long in coming, but Hull's blast from the lower
right circle ate up Brathwaite the way a wicked Nolan Ryan fastball
used to freeze batters into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another blown lead in the third, but \Rthe goal\S is a
good feeling. I didn't know if it was ever going to happen, but
it's nice that it's here now,'' Hull said. ``It's quite an honor.
He's a Hall of Fame player. They voted for the Top 50 greatest
players he was No. 8 and, not only that, he is my father.''
</P>
<P>
   His 24th goal in one of the most grueling seasons of his 13-year
career was vintage Hull. Hitchcock rolled out a new power-play line
of Hull, Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano. It clicked. Hull drifted into
the lower right circle and Nieuwendyk, from below the goal line,
flicked a one-touch pass from Modano onto Hull's cocked stick.
</P>
<P>
   Hull let it rip and Brathwaite had no chance to catch up to it.
Brett notched his 610th in 937 games, while Bobby did it in 1,063.
Bobby also had 303 goals from 1972-79 while playing for Winnipeg of
the World Hockey Association. Brett is now three goals shy of
catching Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have grown up and be a part of what he \RBobby Hull\S did
and then to go on and be able to achieve that for myself is a great
accomplishment I feel very proud of,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano's 38th goal of the season gave the Stars a 1-0 lead on
their first of five first-period power plays. He blistered a
one-timer from the top of the right circle that carried some mean
English and curved around a Calgary defenseman and beat Braithwaite
high to the far corner for a 1-0 lead at the 6:09 mark.
</P>
<P>
   With nothing to gain, the Stars seemingly lost focus and strayed
from their suffocating forecheck and were sloppy in their own end.
The Flames capitalized with an onslaught on Fernandez, whose busy
night also included some spectacular saves.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shantz cut the Stars' lead in half at the 8:27 mark of the
third period when he deflected in Phil Housley's blast from the
point. Housley tied it when his centering pass from below the goal
line caught the back side of Fernandez's stick blade and trickled
into the net with less than seven minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, it's two goals I would like to take back,
unfortunately,'' Fernandez said. ``We're stuck with a tie, but it's
better than a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars played their second game without Sergei Zubov, out
with a sprained ligament in his right knee. nn

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ Their eyes met from across the room. Victims of
love.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those early moments in Monday night's NCAA
championship game, one of those supposedly tense and treacherous
times when the game still was close and Michigan State guard Mateen
Cleaves still could walk without a limp.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cleaves finished doing one of those Most Outstanding
Player things of his, blasting through the Florida press, faking,
spinning and flicking in a layup that hardly made the net flinch,
he seemed to make all the pressure fade with a simple smile.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other player to wear Spartans green has ever been able
to show such calm on this kind of stage. And there was that one
player watching from about 20 rows up. There was Magic Johnson
shaking with pride in his MSU sweatshirt, pumping his fist and
pointing down to this Mini-Him of sorts wearing jersey No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, who stands 6-2 going on 5-11, glanced up at Johnson and
opened his mouth wide. He smiled and pointed back at Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Hero, say hello to Mini-Hero. Magic, wave at Mini-Magic.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those scenes that seemed almost too choreographed
to be real, much like this whole night. But it was indeed real and
it was wonderful because sometimes a player can possess a game as
radiant as the style with which he plays it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, two players can be so gifted. Sometimes, one can come
along 21 years after the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans hadn't seen this kind of night since 1979, when
Johnson flashed the same type of game and showed the same kind of
dominance by simply being on the floor and being so calm amid the
madness.
</P>
<P>
   It might be trite. It might be corny. But guess what. Sometimes
the hero does come home, sometimes the good guys win in the end,
patience is a virtue, history repeats itself, dreams do come true,
and all that other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, everything CBS wants in made-for-television drama
does not have to be contrived. It can be real.
</P>
<P>
   So there was the hero from Flint on Monday night, the one with
the darting eyes and bouncy game like we had seen a generation
before. There was Cleaves, who hung around for his senior season
for the most remarkable of reasons _ because he wanted to bring
home the championship to ol' State.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Gators had come into the RCA Dome with both barrels
of their 21st-century attack blasting. But there was Cleaves
weaving and passing, breaking down the Gators' will as often as
their press with that circa-1979 style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleaves is really tough,'' Gators guard Teddy Dupay said. ``We
could never match him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were the confused and tormented looks on so many Gators'
faces even in the first half as they wondered what was going wrong
with all their big plans.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there was the obligatory riveting drama _ Cleaves
crumbling to the floor and suffering a freaky ankle sprain early in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the director barking instructions from the
truck: ``Cut to Cleaves' mom! Cut to Cleaves' mom!''
</P>
<P>
   And there was Mom, a look of concern on her face, one hand
holding a green-and-white pompom, the other covering her mouth in
shock.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Gators beginning to cut into the Spartans' lead.
Cut to a shot of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Cleaves, limping back onto the floor and telling
his coach he was ready to go back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was as storybook as it gets for Mateen,'' MSU coach Tom
Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes storybook is wonderful. Cleaves never scored another
point after re-entering the game with 11:51 remaining, but he ran
the show and stole it.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-point lead became a romp. The story ended with Cleaves
(18 points, four assists) standing there facing the Spartans'
stands, hopping on one leg, his arms pumping back and forth, his
head swiveling from one side to the other.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Magic just a few feet away, applauding Mini-Him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might sound strange because (Johnson) is 6-8 and I'm real
little,'' Cleaves said. ``But he's the guy I always looked up to. I
wanted to be just like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what. He was.
</P>
<P>

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Former Gov. Fife Sy mington acknowledged Monday that
six of his real estate projects were foundering at a time that he
was telling lenders that he had become a multimillionaire because
of those projects' success.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Manning, the attorney who is pursuing Symington in U.S.
Bank ruptcy Court for six union pension funds, used a methodical,
daylong interrogation to attack the 1990 Symington financial
statement that forms the core of the 3-week-old trial.
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds are asking Judge George Nielsen to reject
Symington's attempt to shed his debt on a $10 million loan. With
interest, they estimate the tab at more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The funds claim that Symington used bogus financial statements
not only to get the 1990 loan but also to persuade Arizona voters
that he was a successful businessman who could put the state's
financial house in order.
</P>
<P>
   Symington became governor in 1991 after winning a runoff against
Demo crat Terry Goddard. He was re-elected in 1994, the year before
he declared personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Symington, who developed 16 com mercial properties, lost all of
them in the Phoenix area real estate down turn of the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Manning abandoned the battering ram attack with which
he began questioning Symington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he laid patient siege to Symington's finances, aiming
to demonstrate that Symington tricked the pension funds into making
the loan that financed the Mercado project in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Symington acknowledged that in the months before the 1990 loan
he:
</P>
<P>
   Tried to sell his share in a Scottsdale building for $600,000
while giving the pension funds a financial state ment that claimed
its value was $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hired lawyers to advise him on taking six projects into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Lost all the tenants in a Missouri Avenue office building that
his finan cial statement said was fully occu pied.
</P>
<P>
   During questioning, Symington maintained a patrician calm as he
insisted that those admissions signi fied nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Symington shrugged off Manning's list of failures. The
bankruptcy talk, for example, merely was intended to consider a
possible strategy for pressuring lenders to back off, he said. He
noted that none of the projects went into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor claimed that his financial statement gave
the pension funds plenty of information to see that he was
vulnerable to the sort of real estate recession that ultimately
forced him into personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Denying that he tried to deceive the pension funds, Symington
said that they made no attempt to understand his complex financial
situation. He claims that such questioning would have had little
meaning anyway, because the funds had committed themselves to make
the loan three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Symington noted that his financial statement reported loans
totaling $178 million at a time when the Phoenix area real estate
market was lurching toward recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe my financial statement shows I was highly leveraged
in a very difficult market,'' the ex-gover nor said.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking a key point of his defense, Symington blamed the
pension funds for not taking a careful look behind his numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had taken time to look and ask questions, they would
have known that I was being buffetted by the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's outcome could hinge on two hotly contested issues.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue derives from federal bankruptcy law, which
states that the funds can keep Symington on the hook only if they
prove that they acted reasonably in making the loan. That means
that the funds have to defeat Symington's claim that they did
little more with his financial statement than stuff it in their
file.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue derives from a 1987 written agreement in which
the pen sion funds committed to making the loan. Symington says
that agreement, for which he paid $110,000, locked the funds in.
</P>
<P>
   Manning argues that the agreement allowed the pension funds to
back out of the loan if they had the sort of information that
Symington failed to reveal in his financial statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He flat lied to us, and he knows it,'' Manning said after the
court session.
</P>
<P>
   Manning gained ground in court Monday as he noted Symington's
efforts to shore up the loan on a Mesa shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Symington's records show that his staff feared that if the loan
went into default, the pension funds might have grounds to back out
of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and Symington sparred over the meaning of a pledge that
Symington gave the pension funds just before receiving the loan. Sy
mington declared that he knew of no ``material adverse change'' in
his financial statement, which reported a $12 million net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Symington said he stood by the statement because he understood
the 1987 agreement to define that term as meaning insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still solvent and had a viable business,'' he said.

   TERM-LIMITS (Hollywood, Fla.) _ For nearly two decades, Elaine

Now, at 62, she is running an uphill campaign for Congress against
a popular 10-term Republican representative, E. Clay Shaw Jr., in
what promises to be one of the most expensive House races in the
country this year. Why would she relinquish a position of stature
she loves for a long shot at a seat on a back bench in Washington?
Two words: term limits. Like 17 other states, Florida placed a
limit in the early 1990s on the number of years that legislators
could serve. This year, in dozens of places from coast to coast,
politicians like Ms. Bloom are campaigning for higher office
against prominent incumbents. It is a consequence that few of the
advocates foresaw when the term-limit measures were enacted. And it
has created many more compelling races for Congress. By David E.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ When Michigan State's season ended with a loss to
Duke in the national semifinals one year ago, Mateen Cleaves,
Morris Peterson and A.J. Granger made a pact.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They would not leave Michigan State without a national
championship in their senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cleaves' foot injury that kept him out for 12 games
early in the season, and his ankle injury Monday night in the
national title game, it all came to pass. Behind Cleaves, Peterson
and Granger _ the team's three senior leaders _ the Spartans beat
Florida 89-76.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, this is what I came back for,'' said Cleaves, who
thought about leaving college early to enter the NBA but decided to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the difference was their seniors,'' said Florida
coach Billy Donovan. ``They stepped up and made plays and made
shots every time we'd cut the lead to six or eight points in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson had 21 points, Granger 19 and Cleaves 18, despite
missing part of the second half after twisting his ankle with 16
minutes left in the game. He returned at far less than full speed
with about 12 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has the heart of a lion,'' Michigan State coach Tom
Izzo said of Cleaves. ``He has worked for this for four years, and
I knew he wasn't going to let this stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take my hat off to our seniors. They came in four years ago,
and we made some promises. Now we have answered those promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves was injured after he was fouled by Florida's Teddy
Dupay, landing on Dupay and twisting his ankle. Cleaves was helped
to the dressing room with the Spartans ahead 50-44.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his ankle was taped and he returned with 12 minutes
left, the Spartans were ahead 60-50. During the time Cleaves was
out and shortly thereafter, Granger and Peterson took the game
over.
</P>
<P>
   Granger and Peterson led the Spartans to dazzling 60 percent
shooting from the field (15-of-25) and from 3-point range
(6-of-10).
</P>
<P>
   Granger had nine points in the half, while Peterson had 15
points on 3-of-5 shooting from 3-point range. With Cleaves in the
locker room getting medical attention on his ankle, Granger and
Peterson scored 16 straight points for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said that before the game, he considered Granger the
X-factor Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called him that going in because we knew that Cleaves and
Peterson were going to probably play well and do a good job
handling our press,'' said Donovan. ``We knew we could not allow
Granger to step out and make 3-point shots. We lost because of what
they did behind the 3-point arc (11-of-22).''
</P>
<P>
   Granger, the least heralded of the three Michigan State seniors,
had no problem accepting the designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be that guy, because if you're not in the spotlight
you're going to get more open shots,'' said Granger, who also led
the Spartans with nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Cleaves was instrumental in helping the
Spartans break the Florida press. Twice, Cleaves beat the defense
downcourt and scored on easy layups. Michigan State led 43-32 at
the half, with eight points coming directly from baskets after
breaking Florida's press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we attacked their press well tonight and pushed the
ball up the floor,'' said Izzo. ``We got some easy baskets early. I
don't know if that broke them or not. We had four turnovers in the
first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans turned the ball over 10 times in the second half,
but one subplot in the game spoke plenty about the way they handled
Florida's pressure. Michigan State scored 16 points off turnovers,
while Florida scored 14.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the main reasons the Michigan State seniors were
able to leave with the title they had dreamed about since last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be remembered as champions,'' Granger said. ``No
one remembers who came in second.''

PARKS REJECTS IMMUNITY PLANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The union representing Los Angeles police officers
Monday called for a moratorium on any administrative actions
against officers who come forward to break the code of silence and
tell of corruption at the Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chief Bernard C. Parks issued a scathing
rejection of a proposal last week from District Attorney Gil
Garcetti on a similar offer of confidentiality to officers willing
to provide evidence about the expanding corruption probe.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his dispute with Garcetti, Parks said the county's
chief prosecutor failed to consult with him or the department
before making his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no potential positive benefit to the citizens of this
city when this offer is viewed in the context of identifying and
removing corrupt police officers from the department and restoring
faith in the criminal justice system,'' Parks said in his report to
the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather it is a bold declaration of noncooperation ... that
prevents the (LAPD) from its legal obligation to hold officers
accountable for illegal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Garcetti said he would have no comment on Parks'
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been at odds for more than a month after Garcetti
accused Parks of refusing to allow detectives to cooperate with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Parks would not accept the Police Protective League's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These calls for anonymity and amnesty do not provide a
legitimate path to justice,'' said Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a department
spokesman. ``These proposals are not necessary and clearly send the
wrong message and could very well hamper ongoing investigative
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League,
however, argued that the Rampart scandal is an extraordinary event
in the history of the LAPD and requires extraordinary steps to
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about protecting criminals,,'' Hunt said.
``If they did something wrong, they should be filed on. We are
talking about that if there is a code of silence, let's give people
a chance to break it without further recriminations. Other
governmental institutions provide for whistle-blowers to uncover
wrongdoing and so should the LAPD.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was contained in a letter to the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Commission President Gerald Chaleff said he wanted to review it
before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Mayor Richard Riordan's office said Riordan would
have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the City Council's
Public Safety Committee overseeing the LAPD, said she believes the
League proposal has merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a sense that there will be nonretribution, it
might encourage some officers to come forward,'' Miscikowski said.
``I have a feeling that this could be a pressure point, and a lot
of people would come forward. We have to give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said his proposal calls for the Police Commission to
instruct Inspector General Jeffrey Eglash to deal with the
officers, rather than the District Attorney's Office. Eglash did
not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's the inspector general acting as an agent for the
Police Commission, we believe an officer can be protected from
reprisals,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a blue wall of silence, we want it torn down. To
assure the public of our officers' complete forthrightness and high
degree of integrity and to assure officers they won't suffer
reprisals, this moratorium is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said Parks is concerned that both the Garcetti plan and
League proposal would hamper police investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, these officers might be co-conspirators and are
looking to avoid punishment,'' Kalish said. ``Besides, we have a
number of officers who already have come forward and are providing
information to detectives.''

UCLA LAGS SYSTEM IN ADMITTING MINORITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years after the University of California
dropped race as a factor in admission, the number of minorities
accepted statewide has nearly bounced back to affirmative action
levels _ except at the two most prestigious campuses, UCLA and
Berkeley, according to figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA sent out 10,752 letters of acceptance to high school
seniors for the fall 2000 freshman class, an increase of 4.4
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of African-American, Chicano/Latino and American
Indian students receiving acceptances was 1,544, an increase of 9.4
percent over the previous year. The only minority group
experiencing a decline was African-Americans, with 315 acceptance
letters going out, down from 329 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last year the UC system considered race in
undergraduate admissions, the number of minority students accepted
at UCLA was 2,121.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the UC system admitted 7,336 minority students, out
of nearly 42,000 total admissions for the fall 2000 freshman class.
That's 100 more than were admitted for fall 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Asian applicants who were offered admissions
dropped slightly, from 14,358 to 14,306. Asians, who did not get
preferential treatment under affirmative action, account for 34
percent of offers systemwide and lead UC Berkeley's freshman class
with 40 percent of admission offers. The numbers of other
minorities admitted to Berkeley this year are still well below 1997
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Most of UCLA's acceptance and rejection letters arrived at
students' homes Saturday, the last of the UC bunch. The arrivals
ended a period described by high school seniors as one of
anticipation and dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I'd be the one running out to get the mail,'' said
Karina Quintero, a senior at Francis Polytechnic High School who
was accepted to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   When the thick envelope arrived with the UCLA seal on the
outside, ``I just couldn't believe it. I was looking at the
envelope and I was overwhelmed with joy,'' said Quintero, 18, of
Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero and several other local UCLA-bound minority students
said Monday that they are glad they were accepted based on their
merits alone, and not based on their ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always of the opinion that I didn't want to get into a
school just because I was a female Hispanic,'' said Sandra
Hernandez, 17, a North Hollywood High School senior who was
accepted by UCLA but rejected by UC Berkeley. ``I wanted to be
something more than that. I don't think it would've felt right
knowing I got into Berkeley over somebody who was more qualified
than I was just because of that factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But a representative of the Los Angeles-based Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund said many disadvantaged minority
students are being denied a quality education under the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think students are being hurt,'' said Theresa Bustillos,
MALDEF's vice president of legal programs. ``If you don't have the
diversity and you don't have (minority) students going to every
campus, then that's hurting very qualified minority students and
that's bad for the future of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, more minority students have ended up at
junior colleges or not attending college at all.
</P>
<P>
   But on the positive side, she believes the state has been paying
more attention to educating minority students at the K-12 level to
make sure they are better prepared for college.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the UC regents decided to reject a 17-year practice of
using affirmative action goals in admission. The following year,
California voters reinforced that decision, passing Proposition
209, which prohibited state agencies from making race-based
decisions. The first year of the new policy, 1998, saw a 36 percent
drop in minority admissions at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions at California State University campuses were not
directly affected by Proposition 209 because the CSU system never
used race as a factor in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA Admissions Director Rae Lee Siporin said the increase in
Latino students admitted this year and decrease in African-American
students aresimply a reflection of California's demographics: The
Latino population has been growing rapidly, while the
African-American population has not.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, California's Latino
population was 10.1 million in 1998, an increase of more than 31
percent since 1990. By comparison, the African-American population
was 2.45 million in 1998, an increase of only 6.6 percent since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Siporin said the school has also been working harder in the past
few years to reach out to minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working to increase the Latino population and
interest in the university because historically not a huge number
of Latino students have gone on to four years,'' Siporin said.
``We've been trying to make everything more accessible to and of
interest to the Latino population.''
</P>
<P>
   Students have until May 1 to indicate their college choice.
Typically, about 42 percent of the accepted students decide to
attend UCLA, Siporin said.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ For four years, he had longed for the spotlight,
even demanded it at times. Finally, Mateen Cleaves was where he
wanted to be. The man in charge. All eyes on him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But for a brief moment Monday night, the spotlight was not on
Cleaves' dream. It was on his severely sprained ankle as he limped
to the locker room with a national championship on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, however, the Michigan State senior was back,
and the spotlight returned to what proved to be his immeasurable
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Providing an emotional lift in the last 12 minutes to match his
fantastic play through the first three-fifths of the game, Cleaves
all but willed Michigan State to a rousing 89-76 win over Florida
in a fast-paced NCAA Tournament final Monday night at the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   On crutches following the game, Cleaves said he had no doubt he
would return to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely going to come back,'' said Cleaves, who was
named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. ``I told the
trainer that they would have to amputate my leg to keep me from
going back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of pain when I went down. I tried to walk, but I
really couldn't put any pressure on it. Back in the locker room, I
dropped a couple of tears. I was a little sad about it. But they
taped it up good, and luckily I was able to come back and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (32-7), whose 13-point margin of victory was the
largest in a title game since Duke beat Michigan by 20 points in
1992, claimed its first championship since Magic Johnson led the
Spartans to the crown in 1979. Florida, which was playing in its
first NCAA championship game, finished the season with a 29-8 mark,
equaling the most wins in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves scored all 18 of his points before hurting his ankle,
but he was still invaluable to the Spartans _ from the moment the
sellout crowd of 43,116 spotted him on the jumbo screen making his
way back to the court until the final minute, when the outcome was
decided and he could leap for joy on only one leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's got the heart of a lion _ not just for one year but
for four years,'' said fifth-year Michigan State coach Tom Izzo.
``I love him because he's what the whole university embodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three seniors I don't know what I can say to make
everybody know how much they mean to me. They've done a great job
in helping build this program.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' senior trio of Cleaves, Morris Peterson and A.J.
Granger combined for 68 points, and each hit three 3-pointers as
Michigan State went 11-for-22 from long range and shredded the
Gators' defense by making 55.9 percent of its shots from the field
(33-of-59).
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who led the Spartans with 21 points, continued his
second-half dominance, scoring 15 after the break. All of those
came after he returned to the game with the limping Cleaves at the
11:51 mark, Michigan State holding on to a slim 50-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a minute after Peterson left the game with his third
foul, the collective heart of the Spartans faithful stopped beating
as Cleaves took a nasty spill that resulted in a twisted ankle with
16:18 to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wild sequence that started underneath the Florida
basket when Donnell Harvey grabbed an offensive rebound but had his
shot blocked by Aloysius Anagonye. With bodies falling to the floor
in the paint, Anagonye found a streaking Cleaves around midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves was fouled there by Brett Nelson, but he couldn't hear
the whistle above the roar of the crowd. Cleaves continued to drive
for the layup, hand-fighting with Teddy Dupay the whole way.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing the ball into the basket, Cleaves came down
awkwardly, his ankle tangled with Dupay's. Minutes later, when he
was finally able to limp up the arena tunnel, Michigan State held a
six-point lead, and its two best players were on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication the Spartans would not wilt came on the
possession immediately after Cleaves' injury. David Chappell
stroked a 3-pointer to get the lead to nine points, but that lift
was erased over the next few minutes before Cleaves and Peterson
returned.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Peterson hit the floor, he went to work. He sneaked
out on a one-man fast break for a layup, broke the Florida press
and picked up a three-point play with another layup, then drilled
three 3-pointers, the last of which gave Michigan State an 82-62
lead and was the final nail in the coffin for the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I have to get yelled at at halftime or something,'' said
Peterson, who scored 31 of his 41 points in the Final Four after
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which got a game-high 27 points on 10-of-12 shooting
from Udonis Haslem, should have known it was in trouble at the
half, as it went into the locker room facing a 43-32 deficit. The
Spartans had handled Florida's much-ballyhooed press with ease,
turning the ball over only four times to the Gators' eight in the
first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators' pressure forced 10 turnovers in the second half, but
they never seemed to be in the ballgame. And the couple of times
they did make a move, Michigan State came up big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we made a run, they answered,'' said Florida coach
Billy Donovan, who at 34 failed in his attempt to become the
third-youngest coach to win a national championship. ``To me that's
the sign of a great basketball team.''

O'NEILL AND SPENCER GIVE YANKEES VICTORY OVER ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Orlando Hernandez has always seemed to find
tranquillity in big games, in those situations when he is in the
vortex of trouble in the most significant situations, in the
playoffs, in the World Series. On opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Having drawn the assignment of pitching the first game of the
New York Yankees' season, Hernandez found that calmness and kept
his team close long enough for Paul O'Neill and Shane Spencer to
hit home runs in a 3-2 victory over the Anaheim Angels. The Yankees
have opened their season on the West Coast the last four years, and
this was the first time they came away with a victory. Hernandez
allowed a run and eight hits, walking three and striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, who came into the game not having allowed a run
since last July 21, a stretch of 30 2/3 innings, had his streak end
Monday night when he gave up a run-scoring single to Mo Vaughn in
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Yankees were in the clubhouse more than three hours
before Monday's game, some of them already in their full workout
uniforms. With lots of time to kill before batting practice, they
watched baseball on television. Bernie Williams, Chuck Knoblauch
and a dozen others shouted at the highlights of Andres Galarraga's
home run in Atlanta, and of Tony Batista's game-winning blow in
Toronto. Mel Stottlemyre has been in the professional game nearly
40 years and he watched, too. He woke up Monday morning, he said,
and ``I found myself craving it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the tension of competition lures them, then they were all
drawn into their own game by the fifth inning. Anaheim's Tim Salmon
had slugged a home run in the second inning, and the Angels led,
1-0. In the fifth, manager Joe Torre rose out of his seat and
leaned against the railing in the front of the Yankees' dugout. The
situation was getting serious.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had runners at first and second and one out and Darin
Erstad popped up weakly toward left, flipping his bat away
disconsolately. But shortstop Derek Jeter, chasing the fly well
onto the grass, peeled away thinking that Spencer in left field
would catch the ball. Spencer pulled up, figuring Jeter would make
the catch. The ball fell, the bases were loaded with one out and
Anaheim had a chance to seize control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez threw a fastball high on his first pitch to the next
batter, Adam Kennedy. Stottlemyre jogged to the mound to calm
Hernandez, saying something that caused the pitcher to laugh. The
right-hander had seemed out of rhythm in the early innings, cutting
off his delivery prematurely when throwing a couple of breaking
balls, and he did not have much zip on his fastball. But he had to
navigate his way through this mess.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez jammed Kennedy with a fastball, the second baseman
barely lifting a blooper at third baseman Scott Brosius, who made
the easy catch with the runners hustling back to the bases _ and
Hernandez screaming at him to let the ball fall. If Brosius had
done so, he almost certainly could thrown home or to second to
start a double play, for Kennedy had barely moved from the batter's
box.
</P>
<P>
   From El Duque's perspective, the defense behind him had given
away two outs and now Vaughn was walking to the plate, a grand slam
waiting to happen. Hernandez had struck out Vaughn in his first two
at-bats with off-speed pitches _ once whiffing him with a 67 mph
curveball after throwing mostly fastballs _ and with the count one
ball and two strikes, Hernandez threw his hardest fastball to that
point, 90 mph, Vaughn leaning back. Two balls and two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Hernandez followed that fastball with a changeup, and
Vaughn swung over the top, missing and killing the threat.
Hernandez has been much more relaxed this spring, teammates have
noticed, but as he came off the mound after that inning, he was
yelling to himself, his head and hands bouncing with the syllables.
The momentum had turned.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter returned to the dugout after the inning, met briefly with
Spencer and Torre to review the muffed pop-up and then pulled on
his helmet to lead off the inning. Jeter pulled a single into the
hole at shortstop, bringing O'Neill to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two hits in the first five innings, but as they
have done so often in the last three years, they had worn down the
opposing pitcher, Ken Hill, with their patient and pesky approach.
The first 14 batters to hit for the Yankees had taken the first
pitch, and it wasn't until Hill threw his 64th pitch _ to Tino
Martinez _ that any Yankee swung and missed. The Anaheim
right-hander, who threw into the sixth inning only one time all
spring, required 57 pitches in the first three innings, breathing
heavily at the end of that frame.
</P>
<P>
   He was approaching 100 pitches and threw O'Neill what was
supposed to be a sinking fastball. But the ball remained over the
plate and O'Neill, a low-ball hitter, smashed it. At the sound of
contact, Ricky Ledee threw his arms into the air in the Yankees
dugout, where the rest of the players rushed forward to see
O'Neill's ball land over the center field wall, an estimated 430
feet from home plate. The Yankees led, 2-1; Hill was relieved two
batters later.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, given a chance to be a regular member of the lineup
this season, bashed a home run in the seventh, pushing the Yankees'
advantage to two runs. Vaughn came to bat again in the seventh, two
outs and a runner at first base, and Hernandez's next-to-last pitch
of the night was his hardest, a 91 mph fastball. Vaughn swung and
missed that for strike two, then grounded out weakly on the next
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez strolled off the field. The marathon has begun,
Stottlemyre said before the game, and El Duque ran the first leg. &QL;

KINGS LOSE GAME, MAYBE SMOLINSKI
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Kings' first game after clinching a playoff spot
had no Rob Blake, no Stephane Fiset and no real letdown.
</P>
<P>
   And though their 2-1 loss Monday night against Phoenix clinched
a playoff spot for the Coyotes, the Kings maintained their momentum
for the first round that begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   Without Blake, who remained in Los Angeles with a bruised knee,
Jere Karalahti stepped in and provided a spark.
</P>
<P>
   Without Fiset, who played perhaps his best game of the season in
Saturday's clincher against the Mighty Ducks, the Kings turned to
Jamie Storr, who faced 30 shots in the first two periods alone.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until rookie Trevor Letowski ripped a shot past Storr
with 11:06 in the third period that the Coyotes took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' victory moved them to within a point of the Kings
(37-31-11) for the fifth spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever finishes fifth is expected to face the mighty Detroit
Red Wings in the first round. The number six team probably will
face Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, which plays its next two games at home before finishing
at home Sunday at Dallas, has one more victory than the Kings, but
three more losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings move on to Vancouver, where they play Wednesday night
against the Canucks. Then it's back home Friday night for the
Stars, and the final game of the regular season Sunday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The team, however, could be playing without second line center
Bryan Smolinski, who suffered a knee injury in the final minutes
during a collision with the Coyotes' Travis Green.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries this season to captain Keith Tkachuk, Letowski has
19 goals this season, including seven in the third period alone.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first in four games for the Kings at America
West Arena. The Kings dropped all three meetings at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were coming off a demoralizing loss Saturday at
Edmonton, their chief competition for the sixth spot in the West
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-0, Phoenix scored three goals late in the third
period only to lose in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Kings, who last month overtook Phoenix in the
conference and the Pacific Division, the Coyotes had 18 shots
against Storr in the first period but did not score.
</P>
<P>
   The game was scoreless until Murray's 28th goal of the season at
the 4:16 mark of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jozef Stumpel, who has worked well with Murray since
Ziggy Palffy went down with a sprained right shoulder, skated into
the Coyotes zone and took the Phoenix defense with him.
</P>
<P>
   Murray hustled past Greg Adams on the right and Stumpel gave him
the puck. Murray fired at Sean Burke's weak side and beat him over
the right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were 0 for 3 on the power play in the first
period,including a 5 on 3 advantage in the first three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After a loud meeting by coach Bob Francis between periods, the
Coyotes started to pick up their game midway through the second.
</P>
<P>
   At the 10:30 mark, Benoit Hogue circled the Kings defense and
passed in front to Dallas Drake for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   For Drake, who has been widely criticized for a hit last
Saturday on Edmonton's Bob Devereaux, it was his 14th goal of the
season and 300th NHL point.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix slowly took control of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings Luc Robitaille had an excellent scoring chance with
six minutes left, but defenseman Lyle Odelein dropped to the ice
and stopped the puck with his chest.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:32 remaining in the period, the Coyotes had a great
chance to take the lead. Letowski had two open looks at the net,
but both shots were blocked by Storr.

DUCKS KEEP HOPES ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- If not for his bright red hair Jorgen Jonsson would
gone virtually unoticed since he was acquired by the Mighty Ducks
from the New York Islanders on March 11. The quiet 27-year old
Swedish center had only one assist in his first nine games with
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonsson made the crowd of 15,759 at The Pond take notice
Monday night when he did more than his share to keep the Ducks'
fading playoff hopes alive in a 3-1 victory over the Nashville
Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had controlled virtually all of the first two periods,
but the Ducks were locked in a 1-1 tie when Jonsson scored on a
sharp angle from along the right boards at 18:26 to give them a
much-needed lift, and the lead, heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Then early in the third he jumped off the bench and carried the
puck quickly into the Nashville zone. He pulled up in the high slot
and slipped a nice pass to Kip Miller in the left circle, who beat
Nashville's Mike Dunham on the stick side with Anaheim's first shot
of the period at 1:50.
</P>
<P>
   The two points doubled Jonsson's Anaheim point total and they
were the difference in a game that was much too close for the
Ducks' comfort. Anaheim outshot the outhit the Predators, outshot
them 33-17 and outchanced them by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   But the pesky Predators hung around just long enough to make
things interesting, thanks to the outstanding play of Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was a must coming in, but it became even more
important when San Jose defeated Edmonton 1-0. That result was
another a blow to the Ducks' best chance of making the playoffs
(catching San Jose), but Anaheim's win keeps it within striking
distance of both the eighth-place Sharks and seventh-place Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ducks (33-34-12-2) were to win their remaining three
games, the Sharks will need four points in their last three to
assure the Ducks can't pass them, while the Oilers would need three
in their final three games.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Kings over 24 minutes to get a shot on goal on
Saturday. Nashville needed only 18 seconds, but the Predators also
took an early penalty and the Ducks made them pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   Drake Berehowsky was called for holding Teemu Selanne's stick 52
seconds into the game and it was Selanne who set up Anaheim's first
goal. From behind the net the winger found Steve Rucchin wide open
in the slot and the center easily beat Dunham at 1:40. The goal was
Rucchin's 17th of the season, but his first in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   While Hebert wasn't serious tested in the opening period, Dunham
kept his team in the game by stopping Antti Aalto from close range
after a Predators turnover and Ladislav Kohn on a two-on-one. The
Nashville goalie also got a good break when the puck bounced over
Selanne's stick with the net wide open.
</P>
<P>
   The game was beginning to look more and more like a repeat of
Saturday's loss in Los Angeles, especially when Cliff Ronning
slipped a backhander through Hebert's pads at 8:10 to tie the game,
1-1, shortly after Dunham and the Predators had survived a flurry
that included chances by Paul Kariya, Mike Leclerc and Kohn.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham stopped Kariya while the Ducks were on the power play,
but then Jonsson finally made his mark with the Ducks.

ANGELS FALL SHORT IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Mo Vaughn had waited all winter for the opportunity
he had in Monday night's season-opener against the defending World
Series champion New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After an off-season of rehabilitating his severely sprained left
ankle, and regaining a passion for the game, the Angels first
baseman found himself where he wanted to be -- standing at
homeplate with the game on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn, batting with the bases loaded, two out and the
Angels clinging to a 1-0 lead in the fifth inning, struck out
against Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez. Vaughn struck out three
times and was 0 for 4 before his RBI single in the ninth inning cut
the Yankees' lead to 3-2. But it wasn't enough as Mariano Rivera
got Tim Salmon on a fly to right with the tying run on second base,
finishing the 3-2 Yankees victory before a sellout crowd of 42,704
at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Paul O'Neill took advantage of his opportunity only
moments after Vaughn's fifth-inning strikeout, hitting a two-run
homer off Angels starter Ken Hill for a 2-1 Yankees lead in the
sixth inning. One inning later, Shane Spencer homered off Angels
reliever Kent Mercker for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill (0-1) pitched well in defeat, giving up two runs and four
hits in 5 1/3 innings. Hernandez (1-0) was better, allowing one run
-- on a home run by Salmon -- and eight hits in seven innings. The
Angels out-hit the Yankees, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had given the Angels a 1-0 lead, hitting Hernandez's
first pitch of the second inning into the bullpen beyond the
left-field fence. It was the third opening-day homer for Salmon in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Hill made the lead stand up early on, and he got plenty of help
from his catcher, Bengie Molina. Through four innings, the Yankees
had two hits -- a single by Chuck Knoblauch to lead off the game,
and a single by O'Neill leading off the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Molina threw out both Knoblauch and O'Neill trying to steal,
thwarting any potential Yankees rally. Through five innings, those
two hits were all that Hill allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Hill is the ace of the rotation after elbow
troubles and a 4-11 record last season has had many observers
predicting a miserable season for the club. But Scioscia has been
optimistic about his team's chances this year from the moment he
first donned perwinkle blue.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Angels finished in last place after too many
injuries to key players and internal strife, but Scioscia said that
is no reason to predict the same in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the Braves in '91 or the Dodgers in '88, both
teams were fourth place the year before,'' Scioscia said. ``So it's
possible. People say we don't have the pitching. Well, I'm looking
at the other side of the coin. History has proven it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm basing my optimism on is the arms are better than a
lot of people give 'em credit for. And our offense stacks up with
anybody's.''
</P>
<P>
   That offense had a chance to break open the game in the fifth
inning against Hernandez. Scott Spiezio opened the inning with an
infield single and one out later, Gary DiSarcina singled Spiezio to
second.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad followed with a popup to shallow left field, where
at the last moment shortstop Derek Jeter moved away from the ball.
The left fielder Spencer had no play and the Angels had the bases
loaded with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy, who doubled in his previous at-bat, hit a weak
popup to Scott Brosius at third for the second out of the inning,
bringing up Vaughn. But Vaughn, who struck in his first two
at-bats, struck out for the third time to end the threat. He
grounded out to first in his fourth at-bat, then singled home
DiSarcina with two out in the ninth.

KINGS LOSE GAME AND SMOLINSKI
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Kings didn't want to lose, but it was more
important not to lose players.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are looking at going the rest of the way without
second-line center Bryan Smolinski, who sprained his right knee in
the final 16 seconds of Monday's 2-1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, who made a dramatic defensive play Saturday in the
Kings' playoff clinching victory over the Mighty Ducks, was struck
on the side of the leg when the Coyotes' Travis Green fell to the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski will return to Los Angeles today, but coach Andy
Murray said it was the kind of injury - a sprained medial
collateral ligament - that would sideline a player six weeks during
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so disappointing,'' said Luc Robitaille. ``But now
we have to find someone else to do the job. There is too much at
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory clinched a playoff spot for Phoenix, which had
dropped behind the Kings after a seven-game losing streak. Now, the
Coyotes are just two points behind the Kings for the fifth spot in
the Western Conference and the unhappy prospect of playing Detroit
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings already are playing without Ziggy Palffy (sprained
right shoulder), who should be back for the playoffs and Nelson
Emerson (broken left index finger), who probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake also did not make the trip due to a bruised
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so close to the end and now these injuries,'' said
Jozef Stumpel, who assisted on Glen Murray's second-period goal.
``We'll be okay, but we sure are getting tested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also played without goalie Stephane Fiset, who played
perhaps his best game of the season in Saturday's clincher. The
Kings turned to Jamie Storr, who faced 30 shots in the first two
periods alone and 33 overall.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until rookie Trevor Letowski ripped a shot past Storr
with 11:06 in the third period that the Coyotes took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries this season to captain Keith Tkachuk, Letowski has
19 goals this season, including seven in the third period alone.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, which plays its next two games at home before finishing
Sunday in Dallas has one more victory than the Kings, but three
more losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings move on to Vancouver, where they play Wednesday night
against the Canucks. Then it's back home for the Stars on Friday
night and the final game of thr regular season Sunday at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The loss also was the first in four games for the Kings at
America West Arena. The Kings dropped all three meetings at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were coming off a demoralizing loss last Saturday at
Edmonton, their chief competition for the sixth spot in the West.

OPENING NIGHT AT EDISON
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ 5 p.m.: Seven members of the Angels' all-time
team Bobby Grich, Doug DeCinces, Mike Witt, Brian Downing, Bob
Boone, Frank Tanana and Reggie Jackson are supposed to be present
at an interview room for a press conference. But the only people
present are impatient members of the media.
</P>
<P>
   5:15: Five gentlemen from the Angels' distinguished group Grich,
DeCinces, Witt, Downing and Tanana finally are brought in by the
team's communication director, Tim Mead. Where's Reggie?
</P>
<P>
   5:20: Grich reflects on his greatest Angel moment going 5 for 5
one Sunday afternoon against the New York Yankees. ``After I hit a
home run against Ron Guidry, I was given a standing ovation and
came out and tipped my hat to the crowd,'' recalls Grich. ``I'll
never forget that golden moment because there was a beautiful girl
in a red dress in the second row.'' The one-time Long Beach single
guy once had quite a notoriously passionate eye for the ladies. But
these days he's lapsed into the less humdrum life of doting
husband/papa/golf feign in Coto de Caza out in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   5:30: Bob Boone shows up, and actually says that the 1982 and
1986 Western Division-winning teams had some of the greatest
personnel in the history of baseball. And the guy said it with the
straightest of faces.
</P>
<P>
   6:15: Reggie Jackson is spotted! He's in front of the Yankees'
dugout doing what he does best these days networking. I didn't
bother to ask him why he missed the press conference because, well,
it's never been one of my overwhelming compulsions in life to talk
to Reggie Jackson, even when he was a somebody.
</P>
<P>
   7:00: I run into Tony Tavares, and Michael Eisner's
man-in-waiting with the Angels says, ``I'm sure we're going to hit
well. We'll go as far as our pitching will take us.'' I simply
didn't have the nerve to inform Mr. Tavares in the bliss of early
April that the Angel pitching won't take the team into October.
</P>
<P>
   7:40: They're singing the National Anthem, an American Bald
Eagle named Challenger is set to descend on the infield, and I'll
play Regis and give you a million dollars if you can figure out
what Long Beach figure is a commanding presence in the middle of
the Edison Field diamond. Give up? Why, of course, it is none other
than that ol' Long Beach mayoral candidate, Ski Demski,
resplendent, as always, in his flowing Santa Claus beard as he
oversees the unfurling of one of his 300-feet American flags.
</P>
<P>
   7:44: Play ball. The temperature is a mild 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   7:45: Surprise. New York Yankee leadoff batter Chuck Knoblauch
singles.
</P>
<P>
   7:46: Surprise. Knoblauch is caught stealing by the new Angels
catcher, Bengie Molina.
</P>
<P>
   7:52: Surprise. Angels starter Ken Hill gets out of the inning
without yielding a run to the mighty Yankees. Hey, who says the
Angels' pitching is lousy?
</P>
<P>
   7:56: Darin Erstad opens with a single.
</P>
<P>
   8:03: Mo Vaughn makes it through the first inning this time
without tearing up his ankle, but he doesn't make it through
without whiffing on a textbook change up thrown by Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   8:15: Can you believe it? Ken Hill has a shutout going after two
innings!
</P>
<P>
   8:18: Rockets explode! The crowd explodes. Tim Salmon slams El
Duque's first pitch 430 feet over the left-field wall. How about
those Angels! They actually have a 1-0 lead against the defending
world champions.
</P>
<P>
   8:35: Wow. Ken Hill has made it through three innings, giving up
only that measly hit to Knoblauch. And to think I've been
questioning the quality of Angel pitching.
</P>
<P>
   8:44: The Angels' self-professed Big RBI Man, Mo Vaughn, isn't.
He strikes out again on an El Duque change after Adam Kennedy
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   8:50: Bengie Molina guns out another Yankee base runner, the
not-so-fleet Paul O'Neill. No wonder the Angels dumped Todd Greene.
</P>
<P>
   8:51: Ken Hill still is working on a shutout. And four innings
are in the book!
</P>
<P>
   9:04: Mo Vaughn is charged with first Angel error of the season
when first base umpire Terry Craft claims his misguided throw pulls
Ken Hill off first base on a grounder by Shane Spencer. TV replays
indicate Hill's foot touches the bag ahead of Spencer. Why wasn't
the new Angel manager, Mike Scioscia, out there arguing?
</P>
<P>
   9:09: Mo Vaughn flags down Knoblauch's check-swing grounder, and
makes another lousy throw to Hill that this time Terry Craft
acknowledges arrives in time to assure Hill of five shutout
innings.
</P>
<P>
   9:20: Derek Jeter gives up on Gary DeSarcina's pop fly to short
left ield, figuring Shane Spencer will catch it. But Spencer also
shies away, and suddenly the Angels have the bases loaded with a
chance to break open the game.
</P>
<P>
   9:22: An opportunity for redemption for Mo Vaughn. Alas, El
Duque strikes him out for the third time in five innings. The
Angels have seven hits off the cagey Yankee right-ander, but,
ominously, they have only that one run produced by Salmon. They
also have stranded five base runners, four by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   9:31: Finally, form prevails. Hill, as he's known to do after a
few innings, falters. After Jeter singles, O'Neill homers, and, as
quickly as you can say Mo Vaughn, the Yankees silence the capacity
crowd and take a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   9:35: Hill is replaced by Kent Mercker, who gets the Angels out
of the innings without any further damage.
</P>
<P>
   9:56: Angels threatening again with runners on first and second,
and Bengie Molina facing Hernandez. But Bengie fares as feebly as
Vaughn, popping up weakly to Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   9:59: Shane Spencer's home run gives the Yankees a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   10:10: Poor Mo Vaughn. He strands still another base runner, but
at least this time he doesn't strike out. He grounds out to Tino
Martinez at first base. It doesn't look good for the home town
heroes, as deadline prohibitions arrive. El Duque is cruising and
the Yankees are only an inning away from Mariano Rivera. The Angels
seem destined for the first of what figures to be many losses this
season.

ANGELS FALL SHORT IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM - Mo Vaughn had waited all winter for the opportunity he
had in Monday night's season opener against the defending World
Series champion New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After an offseason of rehabilitating his severely sprained left
ankle, and regaining a passion for the game, the Angels first
baseman found himself where he wanted to be - standing at home
plate with the game on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn, batting with the bases loaded, two out and the
Angels clinging to a 1-0 lead in the fifth inning, struck out
against Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn struck out three times and was 0 for 4 before his RBI
single in the ninth inning cut the Yankees' lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough as Mariano Rivera got Tim Salmon on a fly
to right with the tying run on second base, finishing the 3-2
Yankees victory before a sellout crowd of 42,704 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Paul O'Neill took advantage of his opportunity only
moments after Vaughn's fifth-inning strikeout, hitting a two-run
home run off Angels starter Ken Hill for a 2-1 Yankees lead in the
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   One inning later, Shane Spencer homered off Angels reliever Kent
Mercker for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill (0-1) pitched well in defeat, giving up two runs and four
hits in 5 innings. Hernandez (1-0) was better, allowing one run -
on a home run by Salmon - and eight hits in seven innings. The
Angels outhit the Yankees 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of good things, the only bad thing was we didn't
win the ballgame,'' said Angels manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   And Hernandez had as much to do with that as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   His funky delivery, ability to change speeds and throw at
different arm angles had the Angels hitters on their heels all
night. Particularly Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ball doesn't stay in the zone long,'' Vaughn said. ``He
makes his pitches. Some guys hit the ball hard, but they hit 'em
foul. Not a lot of guys throw the baseball like he threw tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn already had struck out twice against Hernandez before
facing him in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed up every at-bat,'' said Vaughn. ``He was as sharp
as I've ever seen him. Over the course of the game I think I swung
at one bad ball. Everything was on the corners. He threw strikes,
but you couldn't pick up a pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful,'' Hernandez said he told himself when facing
Vaughn in the fifth. ``Make your pitches because Mo Vaughn is one
of the best hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had given the Angels a 1-0 lead, hitting Hernandez's
first pitch of the second inning into the bullpen beyond the
left-field fence. It was the third opening-day homer for Salmon in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Hill made the lead stand up early on, and he got plenty of help
from his catcher, Bengie Molina. Through four innings, the Yankees
had two hits - a single by Chuck Knoblauch to lead off the game,
and a single by O'Neill leading off the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Molina threw out both Knoblauch and O'Neill trying to steal,
thwarting any potential Yankees rally. Through five innings, those
two hits were all that Hill allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, it appeared Hill had a 1-2-3 inning. But a
bad call by first-base ump Terry Craft extended the inning. And
even though Hill got out of that inning, it took its toll on him in
the next inning, when O'Neill homered after an infield single by
Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone longer,'' Hill said of his 5 innings. ``But
that play at first cost me another 10 bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth inning that began so promising started with Scott
Spiezio's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Gary DiSarcina singled Spiezio to second. Darin
Erstad, who had three hits, followed with a popup to shallow left
field, where at the last moment shortstop Jeter moved away from the
ball. Left fielder Spencer had no play and the Angels had the bases
loaded with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy (Cal State Northridge), who doubled in his previous
at-bat, hit a weak popup to Scott Brosius at third for the second
out of the inning, bringing up Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn, who struck in his first two at-bats, struck out for
the third time to end the threat.

DUCKS KEEP SLIM HOPES ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM - If not for his bright red hair, Jorgen Jonsson would
have gone virtually unnoticed since he was acquired by the Mighty
Ducks from the New York Islanders on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet 27-year-old Swedish center had only one assist in his
first nine games with Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonsson made the crowd of 15,759 at the Pond take notice
Monday night when he helped keep the Ducks' fading playoff hopes
alive by scoring the game-winning goal and setting up another in a
3-1 victory over the Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had controlled virtually all of the first two periods,
but the Ducks were locked in a 1-1 tie when Jonsson scored on a
sharp angle from along the right boards at 18:26 to give them a
much-needed lift, and the lead, heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Then early in the third he jumped off the bench and carried the
puck quickly into the Nashville zone.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled up in the high slot and slipped a nice pass to Kip
Miller in the left circle. Miller beat Nashville's Mike Dunham on
the stick side with Anaheim's first shot of the period at 1:50.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson, according to Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg, hadn't been
playing poorly, but the former Islander admitted he has been
pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he said when asked if was bothered by his lack of
production since his arrival in Anaheim. ``It's been a long time
since I've had a good game in terms of points. It gets to your
mind, you wonder what you are doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge goal,'' said Hartsburg of Jonsson's 12th of the
season - he scored the first 11 for the Islanders. ``Going into the
third period tied after playing so well would have been edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Ducks were aware that eighth-place San Jose had
defeated Edmonton, but they didn't let up in the final period, or
most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim outshot the Predators 34-17, outhit and outchanced them.
And thanks to Jonsson they scored just enough despite some
outstanding goaltending by Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to score tonight,'' said defenseman Oleg Tverdosvky
of the Ducks, who had been limited to one goal in seven of their
previous 14 games. ``It's simple, you score you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Three goals were more than enough for Guy Hebert, who said, ``I
probably could get used to games like this, the more the merrier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are doing an unbelievable job out there,'' added the
Anaheim goalie. ``I'd have to go back to maybe recreation hockey
when the last time I was facing just 15-16 shots a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was a must coming in, but it became even more
important when San Jose defeated Edmonton 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   That result was another a blow to the Ducks' best chance of
making the playoffs (catching San Jose), but Anaheim's win keeps it
within striking distance of both the eighth-place Sharks and
seventh-place Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   It also kept the team's spirits up heading into games in Chicago
on Wednesday and Nashville on Friday. Anaheim completes the regular
season Sunday against the Kings at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still exciting to be on the cusp of the playoffs,'' said
Hebert. ``I would rather playing with a ray of hope than be one of
the teams that has already been eliminated.''

SPORTS' NATIONAL HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG SPOON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If sports fans ruled the government, Monday would've been a
national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Since it wasn't, I left the office early, grabbed some extra
batteries for the TV remote and settled into my easy chair for the
best six hours of sports entertainment since the Super Bowl pregame
show.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers opened their season in Montreal at 4:30 p.m.
Michigan State and Florida met in the NCAA basketball championship
game beginning at 6. The Angels opened at home against the Yankees
at 7:30, the same time the Kings started their game in Phoenix and
the Ducks dropped the puck at home against Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Five games, all televised on different stations. Opening Day in
one sport, Closing Day in another and two hockey games with playoff
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, this is a tough job sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   First observation, made about 5:15 p.m. while glued to Channel
5: The Dodgers aren't real solid up the middle. Of course, they
don't have to be to beat the Expos. The problem will be beating the
Diamondbacks and Giants in a National League West race that appears
to be up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will try to get by this season with 35-year-old
Kevin Elster at shortstop. Hope he gets to ground balls better than
he did Monday night. Watching the guy flop around on the Olympic
Stadium artificial turf on ground balls up the middle was almost as
painful as watching 37-year-old Devon White bobble the balls that
get past Elster.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered by the time Eric Karros' grand slam in the
seventh inning put the Dodgers ahead to stay in a game they won
easily, 10-4. Time to click over to the NCAA game.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Packer, who's been announcing games since God created CBS,
was drooling all over himself before the game ever started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not about the few who will make it to the NBA,
but about the hundreds trying to get their MBA's,'' Packer screamed
during the pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   You mean college athletes go to class?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Michigan State showed early that it was too big and too
strong for Florida, no matter how quick the Gators thought they
were. Teams like Florida and Wisconsin gave the Final Four some
drama, but did anyone really think the Spartans would not come out
on top?
</P>
<P>
   By halftime Michigan State led, 43-32. Early in the second half
Mateen Cleaves sprained an ankle, but he limped back onto the court
moments later. How inspirational. The Spartans barely needeed him,
especially with A.J. Granger burying jumpers and Morris Peterson
beating the Gators back on the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   A quick click over to KCAL revealed a film clip introducing the
Angels-Yankees game. Some overzealous film editor decided to string
together old and new clips of Angels moments with shots of Babe
Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Fox Sports Net 2, the Ducks were already ahead of
Nashville, 1-0. Too little too late? Anaheim entered the game three
points out of a playoff spot with four games remaining. That's what
happens when you let 99 percent of the league into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Back on CBS, Michigan State wrapped up an 89-76 win for the
national title. A limping Cleaves still had plenty of spring left
as the Spartans prepared to cut down the nets. OK, back to
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got a strong outing by Ken Hill and some fancy
footwork afield by Mo Vaughn to take a 1-0 lead over the Yankees
through five innings. Too bad the game lasts nine. In the sixth,
Paul O'Neil hit a two-run homer for a 2-1 Yankees lead.
</P>
<P>
   Silly me. I remained optimistic anyway. Must be all that Opening
Day euphoria. It's enough to make one take only a brief check of
the hockey scores (Kings tied 1-1, Ducks leading 2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Still, I had to keep reminding myself it's early. Real early. A
baseball season that began at 2 a.m. in Tokyo last week will last
for dozens of summer nights and thousands of clicks on that old
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Time for some more AAA batteries.

ANGELS FANS DON'T EXPECT MUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ To mark their 40th anniversary, the Angels
splayed a mural of their all-time team across the outfield fence
and invited the players to Edison Field to be honored in front of
Monday night's season-opening crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Chuck Finley was not available. He's preparing to
pitch today for Cleveland. Jim Edmonds also sent his regards. He
was playing center field for St. Louis on Monday. Don Baylor might
have been in an Angel uniform, too, but he's running the Cubs --- a
matter of dollars (Disney's) and sense (Baylor's).
</P>
<P>
   Their presence might have given Angels fans something to look
forward to once the game started. Instead, those who were brave
enough to wear Angels jerseys or caps --- they were outnumbered by
Yankee fans about 4 to 1 --- seemed resigned to another season of
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   If Yankee fans came to the park with visions of another World
Series championship, Angels fans were already willing to say
fuhgedaboudit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an Angel fan for 25 years, so I've had to deal with
this 22 times,'' said Scott Vandenberg, a firefighter from Cypress.
I don't think the pitching is very good. If they can out-slug
people, maybe they'll do OK but I'm a dreamer.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to make a substantial offer to Finley, a career
Angel and fan favorite, is what bothered several fans. Particularly
since the staff ace is now Ken Hill, who won four games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said the baby was kicking her on the way here,'' said
Vince Defabiis of Upland, who attended the game with his pregnant
wife, Cami. ``I think it was nervous that Hill was pitching
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations inside the clubhouse are quite different than
outside it, insisted Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who's embarking
on his first major-league season as manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you said the word --- external,'' said Scioscia, when
asked about the low expectations. ``Nobody in our organization,
from the front office to the clubhouse, doesn't believe that this
is a championship caliber team.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the salary-cutting moves the Angels have made since last
summer --- dumping Omar Olivares, Randy Velarde, Edmonds and Finley
--- they spared no expense for the pre-game ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Three-hundred Edison employees unfurled a 300-foot wide American
flag. (The seamstress may want to stick around; the pitching staff
figures to need work soon.) The red glare of fireworks accompanied
the national anthem, sung by Mandie Pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive, however, was the finale when an American bald
eagle named Challenger --- perhaps as close as the Angels get to
one all year --- descended from the upper deck and landed safely on
the pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   This was a marked improvement from the last such Disney stunt,
when at a Mighty Ducks opener a few years ago, the team's mascot,
Wild Wing, descended from the rafters of the Pond through a shower
of fireworks only to catch on fire. Duck l'orange, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   This time the wings were OK. Now, it seems, all the Angels need
is a prayer.

ATTACKING THE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GOVERN THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   It
takes a piggish amount of arrogance to attempt to limit the free
speech rights of the people. But most of Congress is up to it _ as
well as many state legislators, mayors and governors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 29, the U.S. Senate was only four votes shy of passing
a flag desecration amendment that would have limited the First
Amendment protections of the Bill of Rights. The U.S. House had
already passed the amendment last June with 15 more votes than
necessary to achieve the required two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Flag desecration or flag burning in a political context is both
an act of dissent and a statement. Clearly, though many who object
to flag burning deny it, the act speaks volumes. It is one way that
those who protest U.S. foreign policy or U.S. acts of war can
startle the media into paying attention to their cause or dissent,
and thereby get their message to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized
that some actions are also speech or even predominantly speech.
Symbolic speech the court calls them. Protest marches are speech;
picket lines are a form of speech; raising a red flag is a form of
speech; wearing black arm bands to protest the Vietnam War was
speech; waving an American flag when our soldiers return home and
march down New York City's Fifth Avenue is speech; and so, in
contrast, is burning the flag a form of speech.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment protects the right of a speaker to support a
war in which this nation is engaged. It also protects the right of
a speaker to criticize that same war. If waving a flag in support
of a war is protected speech, then burning it to show one's
disagreement with the war must also be protected speech. That's the
essence of the First Amendment and the meaning of the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The 63 members of the Senate and the 305 members of the House
who would hog our right of speech and dissent seem to have an
extremely myopic vision of our right to freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Their vision certainly doesn't take into account the
constitutional history of the First Amendment and the U.S.
Constitution. Nor does this myopia take into account the founding
fathers' grand experiment _ a people given the power to govern
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution makes an absolute
statement about free speech _ not unlike the founders' clear
meaning of the First Amendment: ``The Senators and Representatives
... for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be
questioned in any other place.'' That means no matter what a
senator or representative says about any citizen of the United
States or anyone else, or about any government action, they cannot
be brought into a court of law. They cannot be sued for slander or
arrested for sedition if what they say is spoken on the floor of
the House or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Had the flag amendment passed and been ratified by two-thirds of
the states, any senator could still burn a flag on the Senate floor
and not be taken to jail for this symbolic speech.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching concept of self-governance means that the people
must have all the rights of debate and speech that their elected
representatives have under the Constitution. That's why the First
Amendment reads, in part: ``Congress shall make no law ...
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-governance is precisely the reason that political speech
enjoys the greatest protection under the Constitution. And flag
burning as dissenting political speech must continue to be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   By what foggy notion of liberty and democracy can our elected
officials seek to take away a portion of that right and yet retain
it for themselves?
</P>
<P>
   A number of state legislatures have been attempting to restrict
the Internet to only that material which is deemed appropriate for
children to view or read. Anything considered ``inappropriate'' or
``harmful'' to children would be banned from the World Wide Web.
Fortunately, all these Internet laws have been struck down as an
unconstitutional infringements on freedom of speech and freedom of
the press.
</P>
<P>
   These elected officials may be too near-sighted to see that the
Internet is the most democratic form of mass communication ever
invented. Or, they may be afraid of its inherent power.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with access to the Internet can be a publisher and have
thousands of readers. Being an Internet publisher doesn't require
wealth, only knowledge and the ability to communicate. As such,
this new form of communication _ the people's mass communication
system _ jeopardizes the elitist power structure. And that is the
real reason politicians want to control it and limit what can be
communicated through this medium.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has finally realized that
his attacks on the Brooklyn Museum of Art for showing a
controversial British art exhibit were bound to fail. Last week,
his administration settled out of court with the museum and
reinstated city funding to the institution.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's numerous attacks on freedom of speech have shown he
is deficient in his understanding of the First Amendment and the
protections it provides to speech, art, music and books.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent opinion, Judge Guido Calabresi of the Second U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, a former Yale School dean, criticized the
number of First Amendment lawsuits filed against Giuliani's
administration. He wrote, ``We would be ostriches if we failed to
take judicial notice of the heavy stream of First Amendment
litigation generation by New York City in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is another elected official who acts as if the people
should have a much narrower and more limited right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican Party's choice for presidential candidate,
George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, has an abysmal First
Amendment record in his state. He has had protesters arrested for
peacefully demonstrating against his administration's policies and
proposed legislation at the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The public sidewalk outside the governor's mansion has a long
tradition of being a forum for rallies, demonstrations, and even
press conferences. Not any more. Bush doesn't like criticism.
Therefore, the citizens of Texas are not allowed to express or hear
other points of view concerning state public policies in front of
the mansion where many of those policies originate.
</P>
<P>
   It takes unmitigated gall for an elected official to think he or
she has the right to take away or restrict the rights of the
people, rights essential for self-governing _ the right to discuss
and debate public policy, the right to dissent, the right of free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, arrogance instead of respect for the people's
rights seems to have become the new currency in American politics.

   EXAMINER-SALE (San Francisco) _ A federal judge fast-forwarded
the future of San Francisco's daily newspapers when he set a May 1
trial on former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly's antitrust suit to
block Hearst Corp. from buying the San Francisco Chronicle. U.S.
District Judge Vaughn Walker on Monday set the date for a full

 &HT;    All toilets are not created equal
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Roger the plumber is my new best friend; he
keeps me flush(ing) as did his father before him. This morning,
he's wedged into the downstairs bathroom preparing to do battle
with a 1950-vintage, emerald green
</P>
<P>
   American Standard that won't quit running unless its handle is
jiggled rhythmically to one complete chorus of ``Mairzy Doats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toilets,'' he mutters and shakes his head, ``can't live with
'em...can't live without 'em.'' Socrates never said it better.
</P>
<P>
   Americans love flush toilets and will not be deprived of their
convenience _ at any cost. Do-it-yourselfers willingly spend hours
kneeling in abject reverence before a broken one, replacing
this...sealing that. Praying.
</P>
<P>
   Swearing. And for the rest of us, those whose kids took all
their tools off to college with them, there is Roger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress, a day late and a dollar short as usual,
mandated that in an effort to conserve resources, all new toilets
retailed in the U.S.of A. were to use only 1.6 gallons of water per
flush which immediately resulted in
</P>
<P>
   suburban unrest _ as well as a lot of flushing. Three per visit,
to be exact, or your bathroom ended up on the auto club's condemned
list.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, did not take this deprivation lying (or
sitting, as the case may be) down. We did what we had to do and
turned into a nation of toilet smugglers _ with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the U.S. are still allowed to manufacture the
high-flush models _ but only for export. Our toilets are going to
Canada, and we're having to bring them back one at a time as
contraband. It's a legend in the making _
</P>
<P>
   kind of like rum-runners during Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' the story will go in the re-telling, ``I remember when
Granddaddy was running them high-flushers from
</P>
<P>
   Windsor to Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Crapper, a 19th-century Englishman, left an indelible
mark on the plumbing business. His fame as well as his manhole
covers, are widespread. Homage for his weighty contribution to
human comfort and sanitation is paid
</P>
<P>
   world-wide, even in south Florida where some of my friends have
organized a Thomas Crapper society with regular meetings and
tee-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect alcohol may have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   But just to set the record straight, Crapper, though credited
with manufacturing and installing some thirty lavatories with
cedarwood seats in Sandringham House much to the delight of Queen
Victoria, was not, I'm sorry to
</P>
<P>
   say, the father of the original flush toilet. That was Sir John
Harington.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John was a naughty boy who had been banished from the royal
presence for translating and circulating among the young ladies at
court, salacious parts of Ariosto's epic poem, ``Orlando Furioso.''
It was somewhere around the same time (1591) that he invented the
flush toilet and installed one for Queen Elizabeth in her palace at
Richmond, Surrey. Without doubt, this pleased Elizabeth and allowed
Harington to slink back into her good graces.
</P>
<P>
   Crapper, on the other hand, may very well have been the inventor
of the syphonic ``short-flush'' that is now so dear to the hearts
(and occasionally nether regions) of the American Congress. Because
of a piece of legislation
</P>
<P>
   enacted by London authorities in 1870, to preserve vast amounts
of water being wasted in ``water-closets'' (the more dignified
British term for toilet, and believe it or not, the one that got
Jack Paar and his ``Tonight Show'' bumped off television for saying
it back in 1960), plumbers were ordered to build water-waste
preventers into their cisterns.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Crapper's syphon mechanism: user pulls chain on
wall-mounted cistern, water flushes bowl, and then stops. Simple
operation - one moving part. It was progress where man desired it
most _ in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, Roger yells up the stairs that ``Old Green'' is
working just fine. No more ``Mairzy Doats.'' I thank him profusely
and silently mutter a little prayer asking that he never give up
plumbing for e-trading.
</P>
<P>
   A high-flush beats a low one every time - whatever the game.

 &HT;    Underinflated tires steal dollars down the road
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's just awful. How can a $10 bill not even come
close to filling your gas tank halfway? Sadly, it's today's
reality. Wasn't it yesterday _ well, OK, last summer _ that your 10
spot would bring most fuel gauge needles well past the halfway
mark, maybe even all the way up?
</P>
<P>
   But we have to deal with the present. What are we to do?
</P>
<P>
   Short of selling our gas-guzzling buggies and running out to
purchase cars like Honda's Insight, Toyota's Prius or even a diesel
Volkswagen New Beetle, we can take baby steps to increase our
vehicles' fuel efficiency. But with gas prices expected to rise to
the high side of $1.50 before summer and already approaching $2 in
many areas, something is better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The first and simplest place to begin is with your vehicle's
tire pressure. The U.S. Energy Department in 1995 estimated we
wasted 4 million gallons of gasoline daily because of underinflated
tires. Factor in today's number of vehicles, and we are talking
about serious waste.
</P>
<P>
   An underinflated tire _ besides being the leading cause of tire
failure _ can rob you of as much as 10 percent of your fuel
economy, says Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co.'s chief engineer of
product design, Bill Egan. That may not sound like a lot, but let's
look at the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Say you drive one of those big sport-utility vehicles. They get
11 or 12 miles to a gallon stopping and going in city traffic.
Let's assume you drive 100 miles per day. We'll assume that your
vehicle runs on regular-grade fuel. So now we have you driving 500
miles a week just going to work and running daily errands. We'll
add another 100 miles for weekend travel. So now we are looking at
600 miles per week or 31,200 miles per year.
</P>
<P>
   Divide 31,200 by 12 miles per gallon, and you get 2,600 gallons
of annual fuel usage _ and we didn't even send you off on a
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Regular gas at $1.50 means that you spend $3,900 per year for
fuel. If underinflated tires can rob you of as much as 10 percent
in fuel economy, that means the same SUV now gets only gets 10.8
miles per gallon. You now use 2,889 gallons of gas, which adds up
to $4,333 in fuel costs, or an additional $433.
</P>
<P>
   That 10 percent number, according to Goodyear's chief engineer
for light trucks, Mike Kolowski, was based on data for passenger
cars. The bigger the tire, the more potential for rolling
resistance, and the more an underinflated tire can help guzzle gas.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that you can pick up a quality tire pressure
gauge for much less than the cost of a half a tank of gas. You'll
have to check your tire pressure. The proper pressure can be found
on a sticker inside your door sill, sometimes on the fuel door
filler or in your owners manual. Some stations now charge for air,
but many still have free air. Even if you spend 50 cents on air,
proper pressure still equates to pennies saved and dollars earned.

 &HT;    BMW M5 makes splashy return
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a five-year absence, the M5 sport sedan's return
to the BMW lineup is made with more than enough credentials to earn
the category's No. 1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The car it supplants, in most reviewers' estimation, is the BMW
540i six-speed sedan, so it's really a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to claim that the 540i six-speed was the best sports
sedan money could buy,'' says Automobile magazine. ``But that was
before BMW unveiled the M5.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like about the M5? It has quietly stylish good
looks, tremendous performance and enough luxury/high-tech touches
to compete effectively in those areas with domestic, Japanese and
other European cars. It really needs no options, but a car with a
base price of $69,400 _ plus a $2,100 gas-guzzler penalty _ had
better be equipped not well, but totally.
</P>
<P>
   The M5 is a driver's car, with precise steering,
stomp-'em-and-stop brakes, a slick six-speed transmission and a
400-horsepower V-8 with 369 pounds-feet of torque at a relatively
mild 3,800 engine revolutions per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers translate into sheer fun in the city, on the
highway or at the performance driving center at Spartanburg, S.C.,
where BMW offers a free two-day course to M5 buyers. Only there or
on other closed courses can the M5 be fully utilized. It has a
zero-to-60 mph rating of about five seconds and a computer-limited
top speed of 155 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Innovations and other nice touches include a variable-redline
tachometer that raises the suggested limit from 4,000 rpm to about
6,500 rpm as the engine warms, a stability control system combining
traction control with anti-lock brakes, and a tire pressure warning
system.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the M5's appeal and driving experience, however,
is the V-8 engine. It docilely burbles along in traffic, growls
when aroused and loafs quietly _ well, rather quietly _ at cruising
speed in the top gears. But its sudden response, even in fifth or
sixth gear, is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   The laudatory adjectives can go on and on, with conclusions
typically matching that of Car and Driver magazine, which summed it
up pretty well: ``The sport sedan may never have been more
elegantly _ or potently _ expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for now, of course, because it was just yesterday that
the same was said of the 540i.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 BMW M5 rear-drive sports sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $72,070 (base: $69,400; includes $2,100
gas-guzzler tax)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 5.0-liter V-8 engine with 32 valves (400
horsepower), six-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: two-stage dual front air bags, front
side-impact air bags, front head-protection system air bags,
automatic height-adjusting front safety belts, power anti-lock disc
brakes, stability control system
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: none
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 13 mpg premium unleaded city, 21 mpg highway

 &HT;    Do fish feel pain? Sure; as did those snared by PETA prank
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I'm torn. I could go either way on this one _ with
PETA, or with its ethical archrival, PETGIF.
</P>
<P>
   That would be People for the Ethical Treatment of Guys in
Flannel.
</P>
<P>
   The issue: Brutality against fish. But first, the treatment of
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   This week my sympathy goes to them after People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals pulled off an April Fools prank that succeeded
beyond PETA's wildest estimations.
</P>
<P>
   The hook: PETA announced, and several newspapers reported, that
it would put tranquilizers into Lake Palestine before Saturday's
Red Man Cowboy Division Fishing Tournament. The fish would doze
while fishermen grew red, PETA said.
</P>
<P>
   The line: The tournament happened to be on April 1. PETA listed
``April Phule'' as a press contact.
</P>
<P>
   The sinker: A variety of people took the bait, principally
officials at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Upper
Neches River Municipal Water Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the latter accused PETA of ``borderline
terroristic methods.'' Park rangers were mobilized to catch anyone
dumping sleep aids into a 25,500-acre reservoir containing 40
billion gallons of water.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquilizing that pond would take enough Sominex to fill three
Exxon Valdezes.
</P>
<P>
   Phuled you, said PETA.
</P>
<P>
   After a ``gotcha'' press release trickled forth, I spoke by
phone to the person behind the prank.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Dawn Carr. She's devoted four years of her life to
sparing the feelings of fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish, like all animals, can feel pain, and tricking them into
impaling themselves on hooks is hardly sporting,'' said Carr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes a brief look at a trout on the end of the hook
to know that he would far prefer not to be in this predicament,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   I must say, Carr has good points. The first _ the sporting
notion. Imagine if, say, a giant beyond the clouds dangled lottery
tickets over a Texas sidewalk, and then snatched their takers out
of this life sphere before they could scratch. Sporting?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the pain thing. Hook through jaw: Discomfort?
Mild, burning sensation? Erotic pleasure?
</P>
<P>
   Well, to some guys in flannel, yes. The latter.
</P>
<P>
   Before I go too far out in this current, I must acknowledge the
flannel in my lineage _ dedicated fly fishermen, hip-waders at the
ready. They love the smell of salmon eggs in the morning: the smell
of victory.
</P>
<P>
   I was with them for a time. I enjoyed catching fish. The thing I
didn't enjoy, I came to realize, was killing fish. In fact, the
killing so dampened the catching (catch-and-release seemed
pointless) that I stopped. I hiked instead.
</P>
<P>
   With hunting, fishing combines to provide one of society's key
social delineators. In my family, one son loves to catch and eat
fish, and one wouldn't so much as give a fish wrong directions. He
also won't wear or eat any animal flesh.
</P>
<P>
   As is a father's function, I am torn between the two
predispositions. I oppose animal cruelty. But my Rockport shoes
once said ``moo.'' So, too, with that cherished baseball glove.
</P>
<P>
   As for hunting, I can't imagine any joy that could come with
shooting dead a majestic beast. But I'm in no position to judge
because the pig that became that prized football of mine looked
majestic to its mama.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that though I don't like to see animals
killed, I manage to pay others to do my killing. So, what of Mrs.
Paul's? Queen of fish sticks, or matron of genocide?
</P>
<P>
   Torn, that's me. Let's eat.

 &HT;    Tax deadline less than two weeks away, with extra time this year
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The great American game may be procrastination, not
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain the millions of Americans who put off
their income tax preparations until the very last hour?
</P>
<P>
   We get two extra days this year, because the traditional
deadline, April 15, falls on a Saturday. You can bet that millions
of Americans will mosey through that extra weekend, confident that
they can stall just one more day.
</P>
<P>
   That's a mistake. In fact, stalling past today is an invitation
to unforeseen and unnecessary problems.
</P>
<P>
   The closer we get to the deadline, the harder it will be to find
help, professional or volunteer. You may have more problems
locating copies of any missing forms and instructions. Even on the
Internet, which has greatly simplified the process, you can't be
surprised if last-minute traffic jams develop.
</P>
<P>
   Want to start now? Here are some steps you can take:
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for freebies. There are locations where professionals or
trained volunteers will prepare your returns for free. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is providing help because it wants
to stop being seen as the enemy of taxpayers. Kroger stores are
involved because it's a community service _ one that brings people
into the stores. You'll find IRS employes at selected IRS offices
and Kroger stores.
</P>
<P>
   The senior advocacy group AARP just wants to help.
</P>
<P>
   The service is available to anyone who walks in the door. ``We
will help anybody with low to moderate income,'' said Billy
Phillips of Thomaston, coordinator of the AARP program. The
IRS-staffed sites have no income limitations.
</P>
<P>
   People with particularly complex tax situations are probably
better off doing it for themselves or hiring a professional. That's
just plain good sense if a lot of money is at stake. At the AARP
sites, volunteers will not tackle questions for which they are not
trained.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you bring with you last year's federal and state
returns, along with all forms for the current tax year. That
includes W-2s, 1099s and other papers that show tax-related income
and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick a professional, and do it right now. Remember that more
than half of America's individual taxpayers already use CPAs,
enrolled agents or other paid preparers. The best of them may
already be booked solid.
</P>
<P>
   The resource list gives contacts for professional associations
that make referrals. Remember that the best referral always is a
word-of-mouth recommendation from someone you know and trust.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to go with full-time, year-round tax preparers, and to
ask how they keep up with changes in the law.
</P>
<P>
   You should avoid people who advertise that they will get you the
biggest deductions. They might also get you the biggest headaches
with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Ask upfront how much the service will cost, and ask if the
preparer will stick with you in case of an audit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use your computer. Store-bought software is an established
option, and this year many taxpayers are preparing their returns by
using software on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's TaxCut, Quicken TurboTax and MacInTax are the
established packages available in stores. All of them get high
ratings from reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   They are also available online. For Kiplinger software, go to
www.taxcut.com or www.HRBlock.com. The Quicken versions are at
www.turbotax.com or www
</P>
<P>
   .macintax.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can find do-it-yourself software at hundreds of other Web
sites maintained by banks, mutual funds and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The buzzword for all these options is ``e-filing.'' Roughly one
of every four individual taxpayers will file electronically this
year, and the IRS would like to see a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The government likes e-filing for reasons that should also
appeal to taxpayers: fewer mathematical mistakes, legible returns
and easier processing.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other advantage for consumers: The software's
interview format, asking one logical question after another,
reduces the fear that you will miss crucial instructions or
misunderstand what you're supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that factor alone will encourage more people to file their
returns before the last minute, this year and in the future.

 &HT;    Underinflated tires steal dollars down the road
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's just awful. How can a $10 bill not even come
close to filling your gas tank halfway? Sadly, it's today's
reality. Wasn't it yesterday _ well, OK, last summer _ that your 10
spot would bring most fuel gauge needles well past the halfway
mark, maybe even all the way up?
</P>
<P>
   But we have to deal with the present. What are we to do?
</P>
<P>
   Short of selling our gas-guzzling buggies and running out to
purchase cars like Honda's Insight, Toyota's Prius or even a diesel
Volkswagen New Beetle, we can take baby steps to increase our
vehicles' fuel efficiency. But with gas prices expected to rise to
the high side of $1.50 before summer and already approaching $2 in
many areas, something is better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The first and simplest place to begin is with your vehicle's
tire pressure. The U.S. Energy Department in 1995 estimated we
wasted 4 million gallons of gasoline daily because of underinflated
tires. Factor in today's number of vehicles, and we are talking
about serious waste.
</P>
<P>
   An underinflated tire _ besides being the leading cause of tire
failure _ can rob you of as much as 10 percent of your fuel
economy, says Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co.'s chief engineer of
product design, Bill Egan. That may not sound like a lot, but let's
look at the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Say you drive one of those big sport-utility vehicles. They get
11 or 12 miles to a gallon stopping and going in city traffic.
Let's assume you drive 100 miles per day. We'll assume that your
vehicle runs on regular-grade fuel. So now we have you driving 500
miles a week just going to work and running daily errands. We'll
add another 100 miles for weekend travel. So now we are looking at
600 miles per week or 31,200 miles per year.
</P>
<P>
   Divide 31,200 by 12 miles per gallon, and you get 2,600 gallons
of annual fuel usage _ and we didn't even send you off on a
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Regular gas at $1.50 means that you spend $3,900 per year for
fuel. If underinflated tires can rob you of as much as 10 percent
in fuel economy, that means the same SUV now gets only gets 10.8
miles per gallon. You now use 2,889 gallons of gas, which adds up
to $4,333 in fuel costs, or an additional $433.
</P>
<P>
   That 10 percent number, according to Goodyear's chief engineer
for light trucks, Mike Kolowski, was based on data for passenger
cars. The bigger the tire, the more potential for rolling
resistance, and the more an underinflated tire can help guzzle gas.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that you can pick up a quality tire pressure
gauge for much less than the cost of a half a tank of gas. You'll
have to check your tire pressure. The proper pressure can be found
on a sticker inside your door sill, sometimes on the fuel door
filler or in your owners manual. Some stations now charge for air,
but many still have free air. Even if you spend 50 cents on air,
proper pressure still equates to pennies saved and dollars earned.

 &HT;    BMW M5 makes splashy return
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a five-year absence, the M5 sport sedan's return
to the BMW lineup is made with more than enough credentials to earn
the category's No. 1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The car it supplants, in most reviewers' estimation, is the BMW
540i six-speed sedan, so it's really a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to claim that the 540i six-speed was the best sports
sedan money could buy,'' says Automobile magazine. ``But that was
before BMW unveiled the M5.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like about the M5? It has quietly stylish good
looks, tremendous performance and enough luxury/high-tech touches
to compete effectively in those areas with domestic, Japanese and
other European cars. It really needs no options, but a car with a
base price of $69,400 _ plus a $2,100 gas-guzzler penalty _ had
better be equipped not well, but totally.
</P>
<P>
   The M5 is a driver's car, with precise steering,
stomp-'em-and-stop brakes, a slick six-speed transmission and a
400-horsepower V-8 with 369 pounds-feet of torque at a relatively
mild 3,800 engine revolutions per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers translate into sheer fun in the city, on the
highway or at the performance driving center at Spartanburg, S.C.,
where BMW offers a free two-day course to M5 buyers. Only there or
on other closed courses can the M5 be fully utilized. It has a
zero-to-60 mph rating of about five seconds and a computer-limited
top speed of 155 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Innovations and other nice touches include a variable-redline
tachometer that raises the suggested limit from 4,000 rpm to about
6,500 rpm as the engine warms, a stability control system combining
traction control with anti-lock brakes, and a tire pressure warning
system.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the M5's appeal and driving experience, however,
is the V-8 engine. It docilely burbles along in traffic, growls
when aroused and loafs quietly _ well, rather quietly _ at cruising
speed in the top gears. But its sudden response, even in fifth or
sixth gear, is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   The laudatory adjectives can go on and on, with conclusions
typically matching that of Car and Driver magazine, which summed it
up pretty well: ``The sport sedan may never have been more
elegantly _ or potently _ expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for now, of course, because it was just yesterday that
the same was said of the 540i.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 BMW M5 rear-drive sports sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $72,070 (base: $69,400; includes $2,100
gas-guzzler tax)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 5.0-liter V-8 engine with 32 valves (400
horsepower), six-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: two-stage dual front air bags, front
side-impact air bags, front head-protection system air bags,
automatic height-adjusting front safety belts, power anti-lock disc
brakes, stability control system
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: none
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 13 mpg premium unleaded city, 21 mpg highway

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Billy Wilkerson was part of the secret
aristocracy of Hollywood. The founder of the Hollywood Reporter, a
promoter of the Legion of Decency, an anticommunist who helped
foment the Hollywood blacklist, a successful restaurateur, a lover
of beautiful women (he had six wives), a compulsive gambler,
Wilkerson was not always admirable, but he was never dull.
</P>
<P>
   His son, W.R. Wilkerson III, has written a partial biography of
his father titled ``The Man Who Invented Las Vegas'' (Ciro's). The
book focuses on Wilkerson's purchase of the land and his part in
the building of the Flamingo Hotel, which he financed by offering
advertising in his newspaper at cut rates and by strong-arming the
moguls, some of whom were his close friends and all of whom were
loath to antagonize him, to let him use their lumber and building
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger for Vegas among the movie colony derived from the
fact that California gambling and prostitution had been effectively
shut down in 1938 by Earl Warren. Generalized need to relieve those
urges had built up mightily by the time Wilkerson swung into
action.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson correctly figured that the only way an inveterate
gambler could win was by owning the house, and the Flamingo was the
result. Wilkerson ran out of money partway through construction,
and had to give up two-thirds of the Flamingo to Meyer Lansky and
Ben Siegel, thereby giving organized crime a firm foothold in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson writes quite well, and the book is worth the attention
of those interested in Vegas history. Wilkerson's own role in Las
Vegas, while fascinating, pales next to his part in the social
history of Hollywood, and his son should set about filling in the
blanks in that historical record as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   WAVY GRAVY LIVES!
</P>
<P>
   With Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young touring again, the time may be
right for Lisa Law's ``Interviews with Icons: Flashing on the
Sixties'' (Lumen Books). It's a collection of interviews with
everybody _ Ram Dass, Paul Krassner, Mountain Girl, Graham Nash,
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, among others.
</P>
<P>
   For some odd reason, Johnny Rivers is also featured, although I
hardly think of him as a symbol of the period. (Why not Herb
Alpert, while you're at it?)
</P>
<P>
   But not to quibble. The questions are often idiotic and beneath
even Barbara Walters (''Who is Graham Nash, and why is he so
positive, passionate, concerned and loving?''), but they're very
much at one with the period.

 &HT;    Make safety a top priority in backyard play equipment
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When I was a kid growing up in Dayton, the only
question I had about a backyard swing set was how high could I
swing before the legs of the swing set pulled up out of the ground
and the whole thing tipped over.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've gotten old and boring, the first things I check
when I see backyard play equipment are the safety features. Like
the nosy lady from across the street, I think safety first and fun
second.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know I'll be screaming at some kid, ``Put down
that stick before you put somebody's eye out!''
</P>
<P>
   LOOK OUT FOR FALL ZONES
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission _ keeper of all the
statistics designed to scare you out of getting out of bed _ says
about 200,000 children a year are treated in U.S. hospital
emergency rooms for playground equipment-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those children are hurt in public parks, but about
51,000 of them are hurt at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the injuries are the result of falls, so it's important
to surround backyard play equipment with a soft surface for those
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Swings sets should never go on uncovered concrete or asphalt.
Even a grassy lawn will quickly become trampled and hard.
</P>
<P>
   The protective surface material should cover an area that
extends 6 feet in all directions from stationary equipment such as
climbing towers or slides. The protected area also should extend 6
feet to the sides of swing supports.
</P>
<P>
   Measure the distance from the ground to the point where swings
attach to their support bars. The protected area should extend
twice that distance in front of and behind the swings.
</P>
<P>
   The most common materials for a protective ground cover are
shredded-bark mulch, wood chips, fine sand and fine gravel.
</P>
<P>
   Wood chips or shredded-bark mulch are good choices because
they're effective, relatively inexpensive, fairly easy to maintain
and a little less messy than sand.
</P>
<P>
   Shredded tire mulch is even easier to maintain, but it's
expensive and hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Consumer Products Safety Commission, a
9-inch-thick layer of shredded-bark mulch or wood chips should
prevent a life-threatening head injury in a fall of up to 10 feet.
The same depth of fine gravel gives protection from a 7-foot fall,
and 9 inches of fine sand protects from a 5-foot fall.
</P>
<P>
   One way to keep the ground covering in place is to surround the
play area with a wooden border. Pairs of 6-by-6-inch landscape
timbers held together with galvanized landscape spikes hold in
ground covers up to 12 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   MAINTENANCE IS AN ONGOING PROCESS
</P>
<P>
   Wooden equipment should be inspected at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Remove any splinters and sand rough spots. Check the structure
for loose nails, screws and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure all guardrail posts are secure. Gaps between parts
should be less than 3 1/2 inches or greater than 9 inches so that a
child's head cannot become stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Wood that is exposed to outdoor weather must be sealed regularly
to protect it from water damage. Most wooden play equipment is made
of wood treated to prevent insect infestation, but treated lumber
still must be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden playground equipment that sits in direct sun probably
should be sealed more often than equipment that sits in shade, but
most equipment should be sealed every second or third year.
</P>
<P>
   Throw a bucket of water on the equipment after at least three
days with no rain. If the water soaks in instead of beading, it's
time to reseal.
</P>
<P>
   Use a penetrating sealer of the type used for decks. The sealer
should include an ultraviolet radiation screen and a mildew
inhibiter.
</P>
<P>
   Plan to inspect metal swing sets at least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   These problems should be corrected immediately:
</P>
<P>
   _ Loose or worn hardware or any part that projects or protrudes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any rope or cord, such as a jump rope, attached to or left
near the equipment. Clothing with drawstrings also present a
strangulation hazard, and strangulation is the main cause of death
in playground accidents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exposed equipment footings such as concrete blocks or metal
anchors that have pulled loose from the ground partially or
completely.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rusted joints or tubing. Sand rust spots and paint with
rust-resistant paint.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missing or damaged components such as handholds and swing
seats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Open S-hooks. Squeeze the open ends of S-hooks shut with a
pair of pliers or enclose them in plastic sleeves to prevent
snagging clothing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pinch and crush points. Look closely at all the moving parts
for swing components such as gliders and seesaws. Any joint where
fingers or limbs could be compressed should be inaccessible. If you
can't ensure safety, get rid of the component.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD'S AGE DETERMINES CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   If you're considering buying new play equipment, the No. 1
variable in choosing appropriate products is the age of your child.
</P>
<P>
   If you're buying for a pre-schooler or toddler, your best choice
might be a plastic play set. They come in a variety of
configurations from small playhouses to larger sets with swings and
slides.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic play sets are usually easy to assemble; some just slide
out of a box ready to go. They're small enough that the falling
hazard is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   But they're rather expensive for their size, and children will
lose interest in them when they get a little older.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden play sets can grow with the child. You add components as
the child's interests grow. Also wooden play sets make an
attractive addition to a back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden play equipment can be quite expensive, though. Assembly
can be handled by an experienced home carpenter working with a
helper, but many homeowners buying elaborate sets opt for
professional installation.
</P>
<P>
   Though metal swing sets are not as glamorous as wood, they
generally are good values. A set with as many play components as
your children can imagine probably will cost less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their relative cheapness, one option is to buy a
metal swing set and simply dismantle it in a few years as it wears
out or the children
</P>
<P>
   outgrow it.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The first mummy, it is said, was the Egyptian god Osiris _
brother and husband of Isis. And the last mummy, it may someday be
said, is a man who died in Baltimore in 1994 of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The latter left this life in his 70s. By now, his mummifiers
imagine, this man has already approached Osiris and been deemed
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mummifiers is Ronn Wade, director of the Maryland
State Anatomy Board and director of the Anatomical Service Division
of the University of Maryland. He is in charge of finding and
allotting to medical schools the bodies of those who donate
themselves to science.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, these quarters opened a small window
onto the funerary practices of the ancient Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the family it was a `long-term' research project,''
Wade says. ``They don't know that Dad's a mummy, but from my point
of view, we treated him like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wade was contacted by the classical scholar Bob Brier,
a professor of philosophy and Egyptology at the C.W. Post campus of
Long Island University in New York. After years of studying
hieroglyphs and investigating tombs, Brier had decided that his
research would not be complete until he mummified a human body. The
problem: where to get the body.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague put him in touch with Wade, who agreed to help. They
became partners in a plot to re-create ancient Egyptian techniques
of body preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Brier waited months for the perfect subject _ someone
who was relatively healthy and physically intact. Finally, the
ideal candidate arrived: a 187-pound man in his 70s, dead after a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Following 2,000-year-old descriptions of mummifying techniques
and using only replicas of ancient tools, Wade and Brier
transformed the body into an Egyptian-style mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics say the team's project was frivolous, both men
insist their purpose was to understand _ in real time _ how and why
certain procedures were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not a mummy,'' Brier says sternly. ``The goal was
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brier and Wade were determined to answer nagging questions
regarding Egyptian mummification. Why did it take 70 days, as Greek
historians Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus claimed? How did they
remove the organs and minimize injury to the body's exterior? How
was the brain removed?
</P>
<P>
   Removing the brain, Brier emphasizes, was the critical step _
and it proved a challenge. Herodotus had described taking clumps of
brain tissue out by hooking it on the end of a metal tool and
lifting it out one chunk at a time. But Wade and Brier found that
brain tissue wasn't dense enough to hold together for that kind of
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tissue just doesn't adhere to the tool,'' Brier says. ``We
had to put the hook in and rotate it like a whisk.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed to thread the whisk up the nostril and through the
olfactory tract to get it into the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did figure the whisking out, the brain tissue poured
out pink, with a little blood, like a strawberry milk shake,''
Brier says.
</P>
<P>
   To cleanse the skull, they wound linen strips on the end of the
hook and swabbed out excess tissue and moisture. Then they packed
the skull with linen rubbed with frankincense _ one of the seven
sacred substances the ancient mummifiers used. The other sacred
substances known are myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to extract and preserve the internal organs.
(The brain, considered unimportant, was discarded.) Because ancient
Egyptians believed that the dead would use their bodies in the next
life, minimizing damage to the exterior was crucial. The organs had
to be removed through a small, three-inch cut in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herodotus, the first incision was made with a sharp
``Ethiopian stone.'' Brier took the term to mean obsidian _ a
glassy black volcanic rock that can be flaked to a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsidian is sharper and thinner than any surgeon's scalpel,''
Brier says. ``Inside the body we used bronze and copper knives, but
obsidian was definitely meant for making the first slit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, the designated surgeon, then reached into the slit with a
small copper knife firmly wedged between his first and second
fingers so that only a few centimeters of blade peeked out. The
first organs removed, Wade recalls, were the upper intestinal tract
and the pancreas. Next were the spleen, kidneys, bladder and more
of the digestive tract. The intestines, colon, stomach, liver and
lungs followed.
</P>
<P>
   The heart _ considered the nexus of thought and soul by ancient
Egyptians _ was left in the rib cage. When the deceased approached
Osiris in the afterlife, his heart would be weighed. If it was as
light as the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth, the person was
a step closer to being accepted by the gods.
</P>
<P>
   As a final touch, 29 linen-wrapped packets of natron were tucked
inside the body. In addition to collecting water, hastening
desiccation and absorbing foul odors, the packets helped preserve
the natural contours of the body for its resurrection in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wade and Brier placed the body on a wooden platform covered
with natron and heaped more natron upon it. The organs were placed
on ceramic platters nearby. They, too, were covered with natron.
</P>
<P>
   Just as salts will preserve and dry meats, the natron _ 580
pounds of it _ would draw out the body's moisture and render the
dried flesh impervious to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The platform holding the body and the other organs was put into
an embalming preparation room in the basement of Wade's department
and left at 90 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. Two dehumidifiers working
around the clock for 35 days would re-create the dry desert
conditions of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At midday of the 35th day, Wade and Brier opened the room
containing the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natron was wet,'' Wade remembers. ``It smelled like wet
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The white, sandy compound had clumped on top of the body and
become stiff from the fluids it had absorbed. The body, originally
156 pounds with its organs removed, ``now weighed 79 pounds,'' Wade
said. ``He lost 77 pounds of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to remove the natron packets through the initial
cut. ``The incision had been drawn tight by the body's shrinking,''
Wade says. ``I could barely get my hand in it.'' Brier and Wade
managed to get out all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Wade and Brier began the beautification process.
First they rubbed the skin with linen strips that had been soaked
in oil containing frankincense, myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
Then they wrapped the body with linen strips, securing it with dabs
of lacquer made of cedar resin.
</P>
<P>
   According to ancient texts, the body was supposed to be kept
under natron for 35 days, and then kept around, exposed, for
another 35 _ perhaps for a period of mourning or other religious
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Brier and Wade departed from Egyptian tradition
and waited 140 days to make the final preparations. The body had
lost more moisture. It now weighed about 70 pounds. This was the
day to complete its linen shroud and inscribe the cloth with
appropriate prayers. Each finger, toe and limb was wrapped
individually, and as each was done, Brier recited a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mummy rests three doors down from Wade's office. It has
been admired by museum-goers and coveted by Egyptologists as a
control for analyzing the physical conditions of ancient mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic archaeologists can already determine if the person
mummified had parasites, arthritis, or sometimes, bacterial
disease. Now that they know what mummification does to the body's
tissues, they can extrapolate with more accuracy the health
conditions of ancients who were mummified.
</P>
<P>
   If Brier uttered the proper prayers as the final wrappings were
applied, the Egypt of the afterlife may have a new, unexpected
citizen. &QL;

   The world's first bowling robot hunkers down in an alley in
Muskegon, Mich., plotting its next strike. Ten feet high and 20
feet long, with an arm the size of a howitzer and springs like
rocket launchers, Throbot weighs more than 8 tons. Stored in its
Pentium-powered brain are tens of thousands of throws by dozens of
human bowlers, their exact spin, velocity and position recorded by
video cameras, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, and a
computer-aided tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' says Bill Orlikowski, a professional
bowler whose throws the machine often imitates. ``I sit behind it
and get the same feeling as when I'm bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarier still, to the average weekend player, may be the sheer
scientific sophistication of modern bowling. Professional bowling
now requires space-age equipment _ urethane balls, plastic-coated
pins, lanes laser-inspected for smoothness _ and true success is
measured in thousandths of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting strikes, of course, is slamming the ball into
the ``pocket'' _ for right-handers, the space between the first pin
and the one angled behind it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. A ball that hits the pocket
straight on will deflect away from the pins, rather than
ricocheting through the pyramid. To knock down every pin, it should
hit the pocket after veering six degrees from its original path,
says Roger Dalkin, executive director of the American Bowling
congress. ``But you have to hit a target 1 inch wide that's 60 feet
away, and more hook equals less accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science and technology can help. Beneath a bowling
ball's urethane shell lies a dense core of polyester infused with
calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. This structure lowers a ball's
inertia by concentrating its weight in the center, thus helping the
ball to roll faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly off-center, irregularly shaped core also lends itself
to sidespin, which makes a ball curve down the lane. To see what
works best, bowling engineers use computers to model balls. When a
prototype is ready at the Brunswick Bowling research center in
Muskegon, Throbot gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Bill Wasserberger, Brunswick's director of
high-performance bowling-ball research and development, placed one
of his creations into Throbot's paw _ a U-shaped chuck, set at a
10-degree angle _ and set it spinning. When the ball reached 300
revolutions per minute (the forward rotation an average bowler can
achieve), the giant arm swung back, locked with a thunk and then
slowly tightened its springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid professional bowler has about an inch and a half
variation five feet down the lane,'' Wasserberger said. ``Throbot
has between two- and four-tenths of an inch.'' By the time the arm
hurtled forward and the ball blasted out at a programmed height and
angle, a strike seemed preordained. Yet even Throbot can't control
every variable.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain a ball's speed, bowling lanes are usually
coated in mineral oil once or twice a day, Wasserberger explained.
In a typical bowling alley, the edges of the lane are lightly
oiled, and the last 20 feet are left dry. That way, a ball with
sidespin can better grip the lane, curving clear of the gutter and
hooking into the pocket at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But lane oil is hardly a constant. Alley owners can slather
their lanes with various types and quantities of it. Professional
lanes are coated with an even layer of oil across their entire
width, but they still suffer more from patchy distribution as balls
spread the oil around. Because a bowler can't see the oil pattern
from the top of the lane, his first toss is a blind trial. After
that, he can adjust his throw, try a different ball or, as a last
resort, sand or polish his original ball to alter its coefficient
of friction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get rid of some of the guesswork, Wasserberger's
engineers had given the ball he was testing an arrow-shaped core
and a shell made of a new kind of urethane called Proactive. The
core made the ball change its axis as it rolled, so a dry part of
the ball touched by the lane on every turn, thereby improving its
grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the ball gets to the back part of the lane, you
get an increase in hooking action,'' Wasserberger said. Whenever
the ball hit an especially oily patch, special particles in the
urethane shell (Wasserberger wouldn't reveal their composition)
increased the ball's traction.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the difference such small changes can make,
Wasserberger had Throbot try the exact same throw with a more
traditional ball. This time, it swung short of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no limit to how precise and powerful a
bowling ball could be made. But the American Bowling Congress and
the Women's International Bowling Congress keep a sharp eye on
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the congresses' joint testing center in
Greendale, Wis., 16-pound balls are weighed to make certain that
their balance isn't off-center by more than an ounce. In another
room, a ball rolls down a ramp and through an archway strung with
fiber-optic infrared sensors. When the ball hits a pin, both the
ball speed and the pin speed are measured to ensure that no more
than 35 percent of the ball's energy has been transferred to the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a ball on a conveyor belt continually climbs another
ramp and then knocks down sets of newly manufactured pins. If they
give higher or lower scores than regulations allow, they won't be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling lanes have their own strict specifications to meet: They
are not supposed to have dips, peaks or crosswise tilts of more
than 40-thousandths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But John Davis, president and chief engineer of the Kegel
Company in Sebring, Fla., thinks there is still room for
improvement. Forty-thousandths of an inch may be less than the
thickness of a quarter, he says, ``but that amount of tilt can
affect how a lane plays.''
</P>
<P>
   One machine Davis has designed scoots down a lane, stopping
every two feet to check the surface topography with a laser at 80
separate points across the boards. Another of his inventions uses
microprocessors and fluid measuring devices to apply as little as
one-thousandth of an ounce of oil to each board of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it doesn't matter on the recreational level,'' Davis
says. ``But why wouldn't you want the same conditions as the
competitive level to compare yourself to the stars?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, success or failure lies in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the technology in the world,'' Wasserberger say, ``can't
help you if you stink.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The first mummy, it is said, was the Egyptian god Osiris _
brother and husband of Isis. And the last mummy, it may someday be
said, is a man who died in Baltimore in 1994 of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The latter left this life in his 70s. By now, his mummifiers
imagine, this man has already approached Osiris and been deemed
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mummifiers is Ronn Wade, director of the Maryland
State Anatomy Board and director of the Anatomical Service Division
of the University of Maryland. He is in charge of finding and
allotting to medical schools the bodies of those who donate
themselves to science.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, these quarters opened a small window
onto the funerary practices of the ancient Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the family it was a `long-term' research project,''
Wade says. ``They don't know that Dad's a mummy, but from my point
of view, we treated him like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wade was contacted by the classical scholar Bob Brier,
a professor of philosophy and Egyptology at the C.W. Post campus of
Long Island University in New York. After years of studying
hieroglyphs and investigating tombs, Brier had decided that his
research would not be complete until he mummified a human body. The
problem: where to get the body.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague put him in touch with Wade, who agreed to help. They
became partners in a plot to re-create ancient Egyptian techniques
of body preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Brier waited months for the perfect subject _ someone
who was relatively healthy and physically intact. Finally, the
ideal candidate arrived: a 187-pound man in his 70s, dead after a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Following 2,000-year-old descriptions of mummifying techniques
and using only replicas of ancient tools, Wade and Brier
transformed the body into an Egyptian-style mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics say the team's project was frivolous, both men
insist their purpose was to understand _ in real time _ how and why
certain procedures were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not a mummy,'' Brier says sternly. ``The goal was
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brier and Wade were determined to answer nagging questions
regarding Egyptian mummification. Why did it take 70 days, as Greek
historians Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus claimed? How did they
remove the organs and minimize injury to the body's exterior? How
was the brain removed?
</P>
<P>
   Removing the brain, Brier emphasizes, was the critical step _
and it proved a challenge. Herodotus had described taking clumps of
brain tissue out by hooking it on the end of a metal tool and
lifting it out one chunk at a time. But Wade and Brier found that
brain tissue wasn't dense enough to hold together for that kind of
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tissue just doesn't adhere to the tool,'' Brier says. ``We
had to put the hook in and rotate it like a whisk.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed to thread the whisk up the nostril and through the
olfactory tract to get it into the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did figure the whisking out, the brain tissue poured
out pink, with a little blood, like a strawberry milk shake,''
Brier says.
</P>
<P>
   To cleanse the skull, they wound linen strips on the end of the
hook and swabbed out excess tissue and moisture. Then they packed
the skull with linen rubbed with frankincense _ one of the seven
sacred substances the ancient mummifiers used. The other sacred
substances known are myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to extract and preserve the internal organs.
(The brain, considered unimportant, was discarded.) Because ancient
Egyptians believed that the dead would use their bodies in the next
life, minimizing damage to the exterior was crucial. The organs had
to be removed through a small, three-inch cut in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herodotus, the first incision was made with a sharp
``Ethiopian stone.'' Brier took the term to mean obsidian _ a
glassy black volcanic rock that can be flaked to a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsidian is sharper and thinner than any surgeon's scalpel,''
Brier says. ``Inside the body we used bronze and copper knives, but
obsidian was definitely meant for making the first slit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, the designated surgeon, then reached into the slit with a
small copper knife firmly wedged between his first and second
fingers so that only a few centimeters of blade peeked out. The
first organs removed, Wade recalls, were the upper intestinal tract
and the pancreas. Next were the spleen, kidneys, bladder and more
of the digestive tract. The intestines, colon, stomach, liver and
lungs followed.
</P>
<P>
   The heart _ considered the nexus of thought and soul by ancient
Egyptians _ was left in the rib cage. When the deceased approached
Osiris in the afterlife, his heart would be weighed. If it was as
light as the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth, the person was
a step closer to being accepted by the gods.
</P>
<P>
   As a final touch, 29 linen-wrapped packets of natron were tucked
inside the body. In addition to collecting water, hastening
desiccation and absorbing foul odors, the packets helped preserve
the natural contours of the body for its resurrection in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wade and Brier placed the body on a wooden platform covered
with natron and heaped more natron upon it. The organs were placed
on ceramic platters nearby. They, too, were covered with natron.
</P>
<P>
   Just as salts will preserve and dry meats, the natron _ 580
pounds of it _ would draw out the body's moisture and render the
dried flesh impervious to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The platform holding the body and the other organs was put into
an embalming preparation room in the basement of Wade's department
and left at 90 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. Two dehumidifiers working
around the clock for 35 days would re-create the dry desert
conditions of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At midday of the 35th day, Wade and Brier opened the room
containing the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natron was wet,'' Wade remembers. ``It smelled like wet
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The white, sandy compound had clumped on top of the body and
become stiff from the fluids it had absorbed. The body, originally
156 pounds with its organs removed, ``now weighed 79 pounds,'' Wade
said. ``He lost 77 pounds of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to remove the natron packets through the initial
cut. ``The incision had been drawn tight by the body's shrinking,''
Wade says. ``I could barely get my hand in it.'' Brier and Wade
managed to get out all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Wade and Brier began the beautification process.
First they rubbed the skin with linen strips that had been soaked
in oil containing frankincense, myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
Then they wrapped the body with linen strips, securing it with dabs
of lacquer made of cedar resin.
</P>
<P>
   According to ancient texts, the body was supposed to be kept
under natron for 35 days, and then kept around, exposed, for
another 35 _ perhaps for a period of mourning or other religious
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Brier and Wade departed from Egyptian tradition
and waited 140 days to make the final preparations. The body had
lost more moisture. It now weighed about 70 pounds. This was the
day to complete its linen shroud and inscribe the cloth with
appropriate prayers. Each finger, toe and limb was wrapped
individually, and as each was done, Brier recited a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mummy rests three doors down from Wade's office. It has
been admired by museum-goers and coveted by Egyptologists as a
control for analyzing the physical conditions of ancient mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic archaeologists can already determine if the person
mummified had parasites, arthritis, or sometimes, bacterial
disease. Now that they know what mummification does to the body's
tissues, they can extrapolate with more accuracy the health
conditions of ancients who were mummified.
</P>
<P>
   If Brier uttered the proper prayers as the final wrappings were
applied, the Egypt of the afterlife may have a new, unexpected
citizen. &QL;

<P>
   The first mummy, it is said, was the Egyptian god Osiris _
brother and husband of Isis. And the last mummy, it may someday be
said, is a man who died in Baltimore in 1994 of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The latter left this life in his 70s. By now, his mummifiers
imagine, this man has already approached Osiris and been deemed
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mummifiers is Ronn Wade, director of the Maryland
State Anatomy Board and director of the Anatomical Service Division
of the University of Maryland. He is in charge of finding and
allotting to medical schools the bodies of those who donate
themselves to science.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, these quarters opened a small window
onto the funerary practices of the ancient Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the family it was a `long-term' research project,''
Wade says. ``They don't know that Dad's a mummy, but from my point
of view, we treated him like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wade was contacted by the classical scholar Bob Brier,
a professor of philosophy and Egyptology at the C.W. Post campus of
Long Island University in New York. After years of studying
hieroglyphs and investigating tombs, Brier had decided that his
research would not be complete until he mummified a human body. The
problem: where to get the body.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague put him in touch with Wade, who agreed to help. They
became partners in a plot to re-create ancient Egyptian techniques
of body preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Brier waited months for the perfect subject _ someone
who was relatively healthy and physically intact. Finally, the
ideal candidate arrived: a 187-pound man in his 70s, dead after a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Following 2,000-year-old descriptions of mummifying techniques
and using only replicas of ancient tools, Wade and Brier
transformed the body into an Egyptian-style mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics say the team's project was frivolous, both men
insist their purpose was to understand _ in real time _ how and why
certain procedures were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not a mummy,'' Brier says sternly. ``The goal was
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brier and Wade were determined to answer nagging questions
regarding Egyptian mummification. Why did it take 70 days, as Greek
historians Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus claimed? How did they
remove the organs and minimize injury to the body's exterior? How
was the brain removed?
</P>
<P>
   Removing the brain, Brier emphasizes, was the critical step _
and it proved a challenge. Herodotus had described taking clumps of
brain tissue out by hooking it on the end of a metal tool and
lifting it out one chunk at a time. But Wade and Brier found that
brain tissue wasn't dense enough to hold together for that kind of
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tissue just doesn't adhere to the tool,'' Brier says. ``We
had to put the hook in and rotate it like a whisk.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed to thread the whisk up the nostril and through the
olfactory tract to get it into the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did figure the whisking out, the brain tissue poured
out pink, with a little blood, like a strawberry milk shake,''
Brier says.
</P>
<P>
   To cleanse the skull, they wound linen strips on the end of the
hook and swabbed out excess tissue and moisture. Then they packed
the skull with linen rubbed with frankincense _ one of the seven
sacred substances the ancient mummifiers used. The other sacred
substances known are myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to extract and preserve the internal organs.
(The brain, considered unimportant, was discarded.) Because ancient
Egyptians believed that the dead would use their bodies in the next
life, minimizing damage to the exterior was crucial. The organs had
to be removed through a small, three-inch cut in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herodotus, the first incision was made with a sharp
``Ethiopian stone.'' Brier took the term to mean obsidian _ a
glassy black volcanic rock that can be flaked to a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsidian is sharper and thinner than any surgeon's scalpel,''
Brier says. ``Inside the body we used bronze and copper knives, but
obsidian was definitely meant for making the first slit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, the designated surgeon, then reached into the slit with a
small copper knife firmly wedged between his first and second
fingers so that only a few centimeters of blade peeked out. The
first organs removed, Wade recalls, were the upper intestinal tract
and the pancreas. Next were the spleen, kidneys, bladder and more
of the digestive tract. The intestines, colon, stomach, liver and
lungs followed.
</P>
<P>
   The heart _ considered the nexus of thought and soul by ancient
Egyptians _ was left in the rib cage. When the deceased approached
Osiris in the afterlife, his heart would be weighed. If it was as
light as the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth, the person was
a step closer to being accepted by the gods.
</P>
<P>
   As a final touch, 29 linen-wrapped packets of natron were tucked
inside the body. In addition to collecting water, hastening
desiccation and absorbing foul odors, the packets helped preserve
the natural contours of the body for its resurrection in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wade and Brier placed the body on a wooden platform covered
with natron and heaped more natron upon it. The organs were placed
on ceramic platters nearby. They, too, were covered with natron.
</P>
<P>
   Just as salts will preserve and dry meats, the natron _ 580
pounds of it _ would draw out the body's moisture and render the
dried flesh impervious to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The platform holding the body and the other organs was put into
an embalming preparation room in the basement of Wade's department
and left at 90 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. Two dehumidifiers working
around the clock for 35 days would re-create the dry desert
conditions of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At midday of the 35th day, Wade and Brier opened the room
containing the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natron was wet,'' Wade remembers. ``It smelled like wet
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The white, sandy compound had clumped on top of the body and
become stiff from the fluids it had absorbed. The body, originally
156 pounds with its organs removed, ``now weighed 79 pounds,'' Wade
said. ``He lost 77 pounds of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to remove the natron packets through the initial
cut. ``The incision had been drawn tight by the body's shrinking,''
Wade says. ``I could barely get my hand in it.'' Brier and Wade
managed to get out all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Wade and Brier began the beautification process.
First they rubbed the skin with linen strips that had been soaked
in oil containing frankincense, myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
Then they wrapped the body with linen strips, securing it with dabs
of lacquer made of cedar resin.
</P>
<P>
   According to ancient texts, the body was supposed to be kept
under natron for 35 days, and then kept around, exposed, for
another 35 _ perhaps for a period of mourning or other religious
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Brier and Wade departed from Egyptian tradition
and waited 140 days to make the final preparations. The body had
lost more moisture. It now weighed about 70 pounds. This was the
day to complete its linen shroud and inscribe the cloth with
appropriate prayers. Each finger, toe and limb was wrapped
individually, and as each was done, Brier recited a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mummy rests three doors down from Wade's office. It has
been admired by museum-goers and coveted by Egyptologists as a
control for analyzing the physical conditions of ancient mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic archaeologists can already determine if the person
mummified had parasites, arthritis, or sometimes, bacterial
disease. Now that they know what mummification does to the body's
tissues, they can extrapolate with more accuracy the health
conditions of ancients who were mummified.
</P>
<P>
   If Brier uttered the proper prayers as the final wrappings were
applied, the Egypt of the afterlife may have a new, unexpected
citizen. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The world's first bowling robot hunkers down in an alley in
Muskegon, Mich., plotting its next strike. Ten feet high and 20
feet long, with an arm the size of a howitzer and springs like
rocket launchers, Throbot weighs more than 8 tons. Stored in its
Pentium-powered brain are tens of thousands of throws by dozens of
human bowlers, their exact spin, velocity and position recorded by
video cameras, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, and a
computer-aided tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' says Bill Orlikowski, a professional
bowler whose throws the machine often imitates. ``I sit behind it
and get the same feeling as when I'm bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarier still, to the average weekend player, may be the sheer
scientific sophistication of modern bowling. Professional bowling
now requires space-age equipment _ urethane balls, plastic-coated
pins, lanes laser-inspected for smoothness _ and true success is
measured in thousandths of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting strikes, of course, is slamming the ball into
the ``pocket'' _ for right-handers, the space between the first pin
and the one angled behind it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. A ball that hits the pocket
straight on will deflect away from the pins, rather than
ricocheting through the pyramid. To knock down every pin, it should
hit the pocket after veering six degrees from its original path,
says Roger Dalkin, executive director of the American Bowling
congress. ``But you have to hit a target 1 inch wide that's 60 feet
away, and more hook equals less accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science and technology can help. Beneath a bowling
ball's urethane shell lies a dense core of polyester infused with
calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. This structure lowers a ball's
inertia by concentrating its weight in the center, thus helping the
ball to roll faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly off-center, irregularly shaped core also lends itself
to sidespin, which makes a ball curve down the lane. To see what
works best, bowling engineers use computers to model balls. When a
prototype is ready at the Brunswick Bowling research center in
Muskegon, Throbot gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Bill Wasserberger, Brunswick's director of
high-performance bowling-ball research and development, placed one
of his creations into Throbot's paw _ a U-shaped chuck, set at a
10-degree angle _ and set it spinning. When the ball reached 300
revolutions per minute (the forward rotation an average bowler can
achieve), the giant arm swung back, locked with a thunk and then
slowly tightened its springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid professional bowler has about an inch and a half
variation five feet down the lane,'' Wasserberger said. ``Throbot
has between two- and four-tenths of an inch.'' By the time the arm
hurtled forward and the ball blasted out at a programmed height and
angle, a strike seemed preordained. Yet even Throbot can't control
every variable.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain a ball's speed, bowling lanes are usually
coated in mineral oil once or twice a day, Wasserberger explained.
In a typical bowling alley, the edges of the lane are lightly
oiled, and the last 20 feet are left dry. That way, a ball with
sidespin can better grip the lane, curving clear of the gutter and
hooking into the pocket at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But lane oil is hardly a constant. Alley owners can slather
their lanes with various types and quantities of it. Professional
lanes are coated with an even layer of oil across their entire
width, but they still suffer more from patchy distribution as balls
spread the oil around. Because a bowler can't see the oil pattern
from the top of the lane, his first toss is a blind trial. After
that, he can adjust his throw, try a different ball or, as a last
resort, sand or polish his original ball to alter its coefficient
of friction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get rid of some of the guesswork, Wasserberger's
engineers had given the ball he was testing an arrow-shaped core
and a shell made of a new kind of urethane called Proactive. The
core made the ball change its axis as it rolled, so a dry part of
the ball touched by the lane on every turn, thereby improving its
grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the ball gets to the back part of the lane, you
get an increase in hooking action,'' Wasserberger said. Whenever
the ball hit an especially oily patch, special particles in the
urethane shell (Wasserberger wouldn't reveal their composition)
increased the ball's traction.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the difference such small changes can make,
Wasserberger had Throbot try the exact same throw with a more
traditional ball. This time, it swung short of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no limit to how precise and powerful a
bowling ball could be made. But the American Bowling Congress and
the Women's International Bowling Congress keep a sharp eye on
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the congresses' joint testing center in
Greendale, Wis., 16-pound balls are weighed to make certain that
their balance isn't off-center by more than an ounce. In another
room, a ball rolls down a ramp and through an archway strung with
fiber-optic infrared sensors. When the ball hits a pin, both the
ball speed and the pin speed are measured to ensure that no more
than 35 percent of the ball's energy has been transferred to the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a ball on a conveyor belt continually climbs another
ramp and then knocks down sets of newly manufactured pins. If they
give higher or lower scores than regulations allow, they won't be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling lanes have their own strict specifications to meet: They
are not supposed to have dips, peaks or crosswise tilts of more
than 40-thousandths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But John Davis, president and chief engineer of the Kegel
Company in Sebring, Fla., thinks there is still room for
improvement. Forty-thousandths of an inch may be less than the
thickness of a quarter, he says, ``but that amount of tilt can
affect how a lane plays.''
</P>
<P>
   One machine Davis has designed scoots down a lane, stopping
every two feet to check the surface topography with a laser at 80
separate points across the boards. Another of his inventions uses
microprocessors and fluid measuring devices to apply as little as
one-thousandth of an ounce of oil to each board of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it doesn't matter on the recreational level,'' Davis
says. ``But why wouldn't you want the same conditions as the
competitive level to compare yourself to the stars?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, success or failure lies in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the technology in the world,'' Wasserberger say, ``can't
help you if you stink.''

&HT;     `FALCONE' STANDS ON ITS OWN AS WORTHY DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The comparisons to ``The Sopranos,'' the scheduling that recalls
``Roots,'' the way a national tragedy kept it off the air last fall
_ all that can wait for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' the long-overdue mob drama from CBS that began
Tuesday night, holds its own without caveats as engrossing
television. The drama manages to avoid being derivative, even
though it's a series (a miniseries, maybe) based on a movie
(``Donnie Brasco''), based on the real life of undercover FBI agent
Joe Pistone.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Gedrick (``The Last Don,'' ``Murder One,'' ``Iron Eagle''
and ``Ally McBeal'') plays Pistone _ Joe Falcone to his ``mob
pals'' in New York City. When we pick up the story, Falcone has
already ingratiated himself in a cell of la famiglia, befriending
Sonny Napoli (Titus Welliver of ``Mind Prey'' and ``Brooklyn
South,'' in a wonderfully revelatory performance).
</P>
<P>
   The tension grows as Falcone faces constant challenges about his
loyalty, and an intramural mob war looms. The plot's effects are
heightened when we remember that a real person went through this.
</P>
<P>
   But the real tension comes from within Falcone's other family,
which includes his wife, Maggie (Amy Carlson of ``Another World''),
and their two children. They don't know the specifics of his other
life. They don't know what he's doing for the Feds. All they know
is that it takes him away from home for weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the (show's) future, I can see family life being every bit
as important as the mob life,'' said executive producer Mark
Johnson, who was also a producer for ``Donnie Brasco.''
</P>
<P>
   The new series ``is about a man who is so strongly compromised
in every relationship he has, yet has chosen his life _ and
secretly enjoys it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The show first garnered notice last spring for not making it on
the air. CBS President Les Moonves said he knew ``Falcone'' was a
good drama when it crossed his desk in April. Yes, good drama _ but
the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   It was post-Columbine. Immediate post-Columbine, a week after
the school shooting in a Denver suburb. Moonves said he had a
``visceral'' reaction to the violence (an ice-pick murder has since
been toned down). The show was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Now the program CBS didn't want to air is being presented as
event television. Using a scheduling strategy for a drama not seen
on network TV since ABC's ``Roots'' aired on eight consecutive
nights in January 1977, ``Falcone'' will be ``stripped'' _ running
on eight nights over nine days.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour pilot will be followed by one-hour installments
airing at 10 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and Monday, April 10,
through Wednesday, April 12. (CBS is airing a live teleplay, ``Fail
Safe,'' on Sunday night.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Kahl, the network's senior vice president for program
planning and scheduling, said CBS didn't have a natural time slot
for the show, and wanted to put some promotional effort behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really liked the show, and we kind of said to ourselves,
`What can we do a little differently ... so it wouldn't fall into
the mid-season pitfalls?''' he said. ``How can we call a little
extra attention to that show so it doesn't fall into the same
trap?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who spent the downtime from ``Falcone'' producing the
feature movies ``Galaxy Quest'' and ``My Dog Skip,'' relishes the
show's change of fortune. ``I'm thrilled we are doing it this
way,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although each episode can stand on its own, there's a serial
effect that is amplified by the nightly airings: ``As written, one
show feeds off the next. We do pick up where the last one left
off.''
</P>
<P>
   But remember: Although the success of ``The Sopranos'' certainly
piqued the interest of CBS, this is not a clone show. The moral
center is different. The feel is different. The executive producer
said it came naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to consciously be different,'' Johnson said.
``Like everyone else, I am a huge fan of `The Sopranos' ... (but)
ours is a different show. Ours does not have the black humor. We
didn't have it in the movie, and we didn't have it in the show
itself. It is about a completely different character.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: There is no cable-only profanity. Still, the
dialogue rings true, with one notable exception.
</P>
<P>
   When a mobster asks another mob guy in the hospital how he
feels, there are a lot of things he can say. ``Like a bag of poop''
is just not one of them. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize he said that,'' Johnson said. ``I have no
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are a couple of ``Sopranos'' crossovers. For
example, Louis Lombardi, who plays FBI agent Skip Alari on the HBO
series, is small-timer Ernie Bello on ``Falcone.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lillo Brancato Jr., who as Matt Bevilaqua got blown away a
few weeks ago, plays Sonny's pal Lucky on ``Falcone.'' Our guess is
his fate won't live up to his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside all those tangential issues surrounding this
compelling drama. ``Falcone'' is not ``The Sopranos,'' or
``Roots,'' or just a scheduling guinea pig. It stands on its own
just fine.

<P>
   KEENE VALLEY, N.Y. _ There's no telling what to expect in the
Adirondacks in late winter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we were treated to several inches of fresh powder for
an annual snowshoeing weekend at Grace Camp and Camp Peggy O'Brien
in the heart of the High Peaks region. This year, on similar dates
on the calendar, hiking boots and crampons for occasional icy
patches turned out to be more practical for trails that had melted
and re-frozen over the previous few days.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready for the trip, it was unclear what we should even
pack for the 3 1/2-mile trek to the cabins, the two-night stay and
then a day of climbing some of the tallest peaks in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Record-breaking high temperatures and rain had melted all of the
snow in lower elevations, but our band of hikers was experienced
enough to know to expect anything at higher elevations. Indeed, as
late as mid-week an average of one foot of snow still lay on the
ground of the High Peaks region.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, traces of snow covered more and more of the brown
grass the further we drove north from Albany. By the time we pulled
into the parking area in Keene Valley called the Garden, the
scenery was mostly white under a sky that had brightened, for a
short while, from dark gray to a clear blue.
</P>
<P>
   Making a quick assessment at the trailhead, we determined that
with sturdy boots we could safely tread the route packed down by
dozens of previous hikers. But we stuffed crampons inside our
backpacks in case of icy patches near the peaks, and we strapped
snowshoes on the outsides in case a prediction of a couple of
inches of new snow proved too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us recalled the pleasant surprise last year of walking
in on nearly bare earth and then awakening the next morning to
several inches of powder that built up to 18 inches by the end of
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, ski poles turned out to be our most treasured
equipment as we set out on the Phelps Trail toward our lodging for
the night. The warm weather and earlier rains had transformed
trickling creeks into free-flowing, rushing streams, and the poles
helped with balance in stepping atop rocks that provided only
slippery footholds across the dangerously cold water.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, near the afternoon's destination, the only way to
avoid a good foot-soaking was shimmying across a slick log while
clutching a second, parallel dead tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking in on the cusp of two seasons brought some rewards as
well, though. Slender daggers of ice that had melted and refrozen
at the tips into glasslike bells hung over some of the taller
rocks, interrupting the flow of the newly freed streams.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Wolf Jaw, one of the 46 tallest Adirondack peaks that
would be obscured by full foliage in the spring or summer, appeared
in full view most of the way. And the higher we climbed the gently
graded trail, the heavier the dusting of snow that adorned the
hemlock trees.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly beyond the tricky stream passage, we veered off the main
trail to cross Johns Brook _ thankfully over a bridge this time _
and to enter property owned by the Adirondack Mountain Club.
</P>
<P>
   It was here in the 1920s that the club, which promotes
preservation of the Adirondacks and low-impact recreation in the
park, purchased land and two existing camps from club member Homer
Brown. Some of the earliest snowshoe and ski climbs in the High
Peaks started from this property in the late 1920s, according to
``With Wilderness at Heart,'' a history of the club published for
its 75th anniversary in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Our destination, Grace Camp, originally had been built closer to
the brook and named for Brown's wife. It burned to the ground in
1967, the cause never determined, and was replaced in time for the
1968 summer season, according to the historical account. New
environmental sensibilities prompted the club to move the camp 180
feet farther from Johns Brook in 1991 to its current location. The
one-room camp, which sleeps six, was modernized two years later,
with the interior gutted and renovated to increase floor space and
glass area.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a quarter-mile away on the same property, other
friends were staying at Camp Peggy O'Brien, a larger two-room cabin
that accommodates up to 12 people. This camp replaced the club's
deteriorating decades-old Winter Camp in 1988, and was named for an
active club member who had died a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even more rustic accommodations are available in a nearby
lean-to and state-designated campsite. The thought of being open to
the whims of winter in these settings really builds up appreciation
for the Grace Camp's warmth, the mattresses on the beds, the
propane lights, the indoor clothes line for drying wet clothing,
and, the most deluxe feature, the foam covering for the
otherwise-cold outhouse toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
   (In the spring through fall, the club operates and staffs Johns
Brooks Lodge on the other side of the brook. A night's stay in the
hostel-like accommodations includes a full breakfast; a trail lunch
and family-style dinner are available for an additional fee. Like
Grace Camp and Camp Peggy O'Brien, the lodge is usually booked so
far in advance that it is wise to make reservations in the spring
for the following winter.)
</P>
<P>
   (MORE MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEENE VALLEY, N.Y.: xxx the following winter.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tim, Sandra, Mark and I arrived at Grace Camp before the other
two weekend occupants and knew enough to claim the bottom tiers of
the triple bunk beds. Heat can rise to near-sauna temperatures from
the wood-burning stove, once it gets stoked.
</P>
<P>
   It was only mid-afternoon, so we sat down on the benches at the
rustic wooden kitchen table and dug into our backpacks for
sandwiches and fruit for a late lunch before heading back on the
trail for a short hike while the sunlight lingered. There would be
plenty of time later to settle in and divide up chores: fill a pail
of water from the brook and heat it to a rolling boil on the
propane stovetop to make it potable; store perishable food in the
latched metal storage box on the covered porch that serves as a
refrigerator in the winter; fill the heat stove with some of the
firewood piled in another box on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   Trail signs posted within a mile of the two camps indicate that
several of the Adirondacks' highest summits are less than three
miles away. No wonder many aspiring 46ers, hikers intent on
climbing all of the highest 46 peaks, start their treks from here.
</P>
<P>
   Even the notoriously long walk in and then climb up Mount Marcy
becomes an 11-mile round trip from here, instead of the 17-mile day
trip required when starting out and returning to the Garden parking
area.
</P>
<P>
   With so many choices of trails for the full Saturday ahead, our
larger group of 16 hikers split into two. One decided to venture up
Upper Wolf Jaw, about a three-mile climb, and then, if stamina
permitted, continue on for another mile to Armstrong. My hiking
buddy, Tim, and I joined the other group led by an aspiring winter
46er, who wanted to add the 4,827-foot Basin to the list of peaks
scaled during the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Several in that group already had been to that summit at least
once, so they were anxious for some variety. They devised a route
that started out on a maintained trail over a suspension bridge
then veered off to begin the increasingly steeper climb up Chicken
Coop Brook before rejoining the trail again for the steepest ascent
to the peak.
</P>
<P>
   Those who had brought along maps and compasses _ and knew how to
use them _ became our guides, since low-level clouds obscured any
nearby peaks that might have provided other hints on direction.
</P>
<P>
   The previous year, some of us had snowshoed up neighboring
Saddleback in several inches of powder, working hard to break trail
on the way up and then sliding on our feet, as if with skis, on the
steepest parts of the descent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the deep holes in the snow around the trees indicated
that a few feet of snow remained on the ground. But a series of
melting and re-freezing had packed down the snow enough for easy
treading with hiking boots, leaving enough snow to cover the fallen
branches and roots that could trip an unwary hiker in other
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery along the way featured ice in all of its beautiful
and treacherous forms: a thick, solid layer of chunks of frozen
snow built up behind a tree that had fallen across Johns Brook;
blue, glazed ice coating the trail near the peak; and a
greenish-hued frozen cascade tumbling over a tall rock face.
</P>
<P>
   The weather noticeably changed as we gained elevation and left
behind the shelter of tall evergreens. Crampons, sharp spikes
strapped onto the soles of boots, came out of day packs to dig
footholds into crustier snow and ice. Outer parkas were zipped up
as shields against the windy, damp air at the top, which was
enshrouded in a cloud. The mist blocked the views of Marcy and
Haystack accessible on clearer days, which was just as well since
the gray veil also prevented truly seeing how far the drop-offs
were beyond the ice patches I cautiously crawled over.
</P>
<P>
   Ever eager for adventure, my hiking companions chose to try yet
another route off the mountain, along Basin Brook, and then to
bushwhack alongside the opposite side of Johns Brook from the
established trail. This latter part of the trek brought the
discovery of an abandoned cabin not far from the camps yet far
enough from any regular route to remain hidden from most hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Our adventures were pretty well concluded, with just the hike
back to the cars left for Sunday morning. Light snow that had
fallen throughout the late afternoon and early evening turned to
freezing rain and wet snow by the time we set out. The streams were
still high, but we knew now where to cross the trickier sections;
the trail was turning mushy, disappointing the skiers passing us on
their way in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the snowshoes had remained strapped to packs throughout
the trip. But we had been prepared for anything late winter in the
Adirondacks was ready to deliver.

&HT;     PASSES MAKE RAIL TRAVEL IN EUROPE EASY AS A WHISTLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ The Yellow Submarine stands at the ready at Waterloo
Station, all set to whisk passengers through the Chunnel to Europe.
No underwater skills necessary _ this is the Eurostar train.
</P>
<P>
   This train just happens to be painted up to promote the
re-release of the Beatles' feature-length cartoon ``Yellow
Submarine.'' Here are Blue Meanies alongside the Fab Four of John,
Paul, George and Ringo. Inside, the plush seats of first class give
no indication that this is anything but a great way to travel in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Security is as tight here as it is for an international airport
departure. Within 30 minutes of settling in, though, we are on our
way to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Busy executives break the silence of the train on cell phones,
talking business and personal lives. Tea and coffee are served by
smiling attendants. Then there is breakfast, a choice of hot or
cold. There are wide seats, a handy table that is roomy enough for
a briefcase full of work or a meal tray, and scenic Britain just
outside the window.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 20 minutes to travel the 32 miles of the Chunnel,
under the English Channel, just enough time to polish off the hot
breakfast served by the train attendant. Maximum speed is 186 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging in France, the weather is overcast, but the sun breaks
through as the morning wears on and we make a stop at Lille.
</P>
<P>
   Eurostar trans-Channel travel began in November 1994, and
reports indicate that more than 900,000 North American passengers
have used these fast and convenient trains between London, Paris
and Brussels. In 1999, more than 200,000 Americans took the train.
</P>
<P>
   For this group of railroading travel writers, Brussels is merely
a stop for lunch; then it is back on the train for the 90-minute
trip to Paris. Popping out of the train station like gophers, we
are herded a few blocks away to a restaurant, then back to catch
the 3:40 train to Paris-Nord.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably how international business is conducted between
Belgium and France: a quick dash to the neighboring country for a
meeting, lunch and back on the train. You're home in time for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than 60 percent of passengers on the Thalys (a
made-up word for the rail system) are leisure travelers, according
to Michel Jadot, a spokesman for the European rail line. Thalys is
a service of Belgian, French, German and Dutch rails to facilitate
travel in Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thalys is moving south, east and west,'' Jadot said. Special
trains serve Disneyland Paris and ski regions in Europe. Regular
runs include Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp in the Netherlands;
and Koln and Dusseldorf, Germany; and between Brussels and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The five-hour trip from Brussels to Frankfurt is expected to be
cut in half by 2002 with the addition of new dedicated lines. The
privately owned rail line aims to serve 12 million passengers by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   Cee Cee Drummond works for the New York office of Rail Europe.
On this cross-continent trip, she is showing more than telling
about the trains and the countries that Rail Europe serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clients that we have today do so much research for the
trip,'' Drummond said during a ride on the high-speed train from
Paris to Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers consult friends, the Internet and guidebooks before
booking trips to Europe, Drummond said. ``We do about 85 percent of
our business through travel agents,'' she said of the $230 million
generated by Rail Europe sales.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Rail Europe customer is not a first-time visitor to
Europe, Drummond said. He or she is a repeat traveler, 45 to 55
years old, college educated, who may have seen Europe from a motor
coach tour a few years before. This time out, the traveler plans to
see two to three European countries.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the booming youth market made up of backpackers
who hop the trains for summer travel after college. Drummond said
that the Eurail Flexipass is the most popular, allowing unlimited
first-class travel in 17 countries for either 10 days or 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   My six-day Europass, for example, cost $368 and allows travel in
France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Travel in Britain is
not covered with under Europass, but rather with the separate
BritRail passes. Rail passes must be purchased in the United States
before the traveler leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Rail passes provide unlimited rail trips for the number of
travel days indicated on the pass. Supplements, necessary to ride
the Premier trains, are covered or discounted with the rail passes.
</P>
<P>
   Seat reservations are also required for Premier trains such as
the Eurostar, French TGV, Italy's Cisalpino and Artesia (between
France and Italy). ``If you've paid for a supplement on a train,
that includes your seat reservation and there are no additional
fees required,'' Drummond said.
</P>
<P>
   While riding the rails no longer has the romantic allure shown
in old movies, Europe's rail comes pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   For Rose and Richard Huber of San Jose, Calif., a 21-day rail
pass from Eurail is just the ticket. We met on the deck of the
Compagnie Generale de Navigation steamer on Lake Geneva for a
cruise to Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Both Eurail and Swissrail passes are valid on CGN boats. The
Hubers, who own an electronics business, were return visitors to
Europe _ some 30 years after their first visit. This time, they had
flown into Munich, Germany, and were taking trains across Western
Europe on a 21-day pass. The plan was to end the trip at
Oktoberfest.
</P>
<P>
   Like walking ads for a European vacation, the Hubers said they
rented a car on a 1968 European vacation. A few years later, Mrs.
Huber joined an escorted bus tour with a friend. Ten years ago, the
Hubers made a train trip.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with rail passes in hand, the Hubers were crossing borders,
taking city tours and traveling with no particular itinerary in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the freedom of Eurail,'' Mrs. Huber said, taking in
the bright, blue sky on the deck of the Swiss steamship. ``The
trains are all clean and beautiful.'' And they hadn't even sampled
the Premier trains.

RESIGNATION OF JAPAN'S CABINET PAVES WAY FOR NEW PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(See also JAPAN-OBUCHI-REACT) 
(js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's Cabinet resigned en masse Tuesday, setting the
stage for a rapid political succession two days after a
life-threatening stroke incapacitated Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation, which was made formal in a brief, final Cabinet
meeting Tuesday evening, is expected to lead to the nomination of a
candidate to succeed Obuchi by the governing Liberal Democratic
Party as early as Wednesday morning. A parliamentary vote to ratify
the party's choice, who is widely reported to be the Liberal
Democrat's second-ranking official, Yoshiro Mori, would be held
almost immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   With tears streaking down his cheeks as he spoke during a late
afternoon new conference, the caretaker prime minister, Mikio Aoki,
said the dissolution of the government was made ``based on the
judgment of the doctors and from the viewpoint that we should not
allow even one moment's political vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   The news came amid persistent reports throughout the day that
Obuchi's condition was steadily worsening and that the prime
minister was already brain dead by mid-afternoon. Aoki denied this,
saying he was ``very upset'' at the media for passing on what he
said were unsubstantiated rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians close to the transition process and several Japanese
political analysts said Tuesday that the party had used the
extraordinary 22-hour news blackout surrounding Obuchi's
hospitalization early Sunday, and the carefully stage-managed
process since, to quietly engineer the selection of Mori, the
party's secretary-general, as its unopposed candidate for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive handling of the news of Obuchi's hospitalization
and the back-room machinations drew strong, renewed criticisms
Tuesday from several quarters. Many Japanese said the process
revealed a side of their country that was neither altogether modern
nor democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Mori was reportedly selected in part because of his reputed
strong loyalty to Obuchi. Even more decisive, however, were his
close ties to the ruling party's major coalition partner, the
Buddhist-backed New Komeito Party.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's ratification by the parliament, or Diet, is already
considered a foregone conclusion, political analysts said Tuesday,
because the governing coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party
enjoys far more than the simple legislative majority needed to
approve the choice.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question about the choice,'' said Kozo Watanabe,
deputy speaker of the lower house of the Diet. ``In a matter of a
few hours, the central commission of the L.D.P. will announce Mr.
Mori's selection, and their junior coalition partners will support
it. In that event, we will have a new prime minister before the
parliament tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said Tuesday, however, that by choosing Mori _
a burly, raspy voiced politician not especially known for his
personal popularity or campaigning skills _ the Liberal Democratic
Party was taking a huge risk in difficult national elections that,
because of Obuchi's stroke, are now expected to be held before the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The choice spoke volumes, they said, about some unusual
imperatives in Japanese politics like loyalty to partners and
allies in a crunch _ in this case to Obuchi's memory and to the New
Komeito Party _ rather than short-term gain, or even survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that the L.D.P. lacks people who could enjoy
popularity, there is Mr. Kono and Mr. Kato, both of whom would
probably be more popular,'' said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor of
politics at Nigata University of International and Information
Studies, and a former senior political correspondent of the Asahi
Shimbun newspaper. ``But the L.D.P. is basing its decision on who
has a good relationship with Komeito. They are not thinking of the
reaction of the people of Japan, and this behavior is very
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, and Koichi Kato, a former
chief Cabinet secretary, were both thought to aspire to the prime
minister's job.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, many analysts were already describing the Liberal
Democratic Party's choice of Mori on the basis of the New Komeito
Party's comfort as a recipe for electoral difficulties, because the
coalition between the two parties has been deeply unpopular since
it was formed last October. Opinion polls have consistently shown
that Japanese voters disapprove of having a party with religious
affiliations in the government.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new government will have to dissipate growing criticism of
the secretive, seemingly antiquated mechanics of a succession in
which Aoki was allowed to become caretaker merely on the basis of
an unsubstantiated conversation with the stricken prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The way in which Mori was selected contributed further to the
appearance of a process dominated by consultations between
all-powerful party barons who assiduously kept the public in the
dark while deciding the nation's course.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime political insiders spoke Tuesday with almost
reverential approval of the off-stage consultations that produced
Mori as Obuchi's successor, describing it as a confirmation of the
efficiency of Japan's political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Aoki's reaction to Obuchi's collapse was very tactful,''
said Watanabe, the lower house deputy speaker. ``If he had waited a
week or 10 days after Mr. Obuchi collapsed, somebody else could
have raised their hand as a candidate, and there could be some
chaos. But by the time Mr. Aoki announced the condition of Mr.
Obuchi, it was already virtually decided who would take over.''
</P>
<P>
   But for independent politicians and commentators, and indeed
much of the public, the baronial succession process gave way to a
field day of introspection about how, 55 years after World War II,
Japan has remained a democracy largely in name rather than in
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Japanese politicians keep saying `minshushugi' there
is no spirit of democracy in this country,'' said Kaoru Okano, a
political commentator who is a former president of Meiji University
in Tokyo, using the Japanese word for democracy. ``There are
statesman and politicians in the west. In Japan there is a third
category, wheeler-dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Okano said that the current crisis had revealed Japan to be
dominated by this latter category.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other commentators said the failure of the country's leaders to
operate in a more open manner and include the people in their
decision making had contributed to widespread public distrust of
politicians and disillusionment with politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of choosing a successor has revealed itself as not
very democratic, and is indeed very closed,'' said Shusei Tanaka, a
political scientist at Fukuyama University in Hiroshima. ``I have
the feeling that whoever comes out of this coalition will probably
be the same, and the people of Japan feel much the same way. The
feeling is that even if the prime minister changes, the policies
won't. We are in need of dramatic reforms of Japanese politics.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 4:
</P>
<P>
   The battle to reform administration of the nation's deeply
flawed death-penalty system gained momentum last week with the
introduction of legislation in the House that would provide
important new safeguards to lessen the chance of executing innocent
people. The enlightened measure, the Innocence Protection Act,
would require preservation of biological evidence, make DNA testing
available to federal and state inmates, and set national standards
to ensure competent lawyers for indigent defendants accused of
capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Ray LaHood, R-Ill., and William Delahunt, D-Mass.,
the measure parallels a bill that Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
introduced in the Senate in February. Lending critical support is
Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, who declared a
moratorium on executions in his state in January because of its
``shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting them on
death row.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde, praised the
bill as a ``very reasonable treatment of a very difficult and
delicate issue'' and promised a prompt hearing _ a pledge the
Senate Judiciary chairman, Orrin Hatch, should match. Both
supporters and opponents of the death penalty should be able to
agree on a measure reducing the risk of executing the innocent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 4:
</P>
<P>
   Japan is suffering from a leadership crisis far deeper than the
sudden disability of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. A new prime
minister will soon be named to replace Obuchi, who was left in a
coma by a stroke over the weekend and is not expected to recover.
But none of the current contenders are likely to have the political
clout or daring needed to energize Japan's creaky government
machinery or to jolt its economy out of an almost decade-long
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed as a colorless hack when he took office almost two
years ago, Obuchi scored some successes. He carried out a badly
needed banking bailout, applied the kind of powerful fiscal
stimulus that had long been sought by Japan's major trading
partners, including Washington, and in the process modestly revived
the political fortunes of his sagging Liberal Democratic Party. But
he failed to follow up these initial economic achievements with the
kind of bold deregulation needed to rationalize Japan's banking and
business systems and to stimulate a resurgence of consumer demand.
As a result, Japan's economy is once again contracting and the
Liberal Democrats remain dependent on coalition partners who make
it hard to provide effective, consistent governance.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's political system appears particularly threadbare at
times of unexpected turbulence, whether they involve natural
disasters like the latest volcanic eruptions of Mount Usu, or human
tragedies like Obuchi's illness. For more than 24 hours the
Japanese public was fed misleading information disguising the
gravity of Obuchi's condition. Then came a hasty announcement that
power was being passed, on a caretaker basis, to a cabinet
official, Mikio Aoki, who appears to lack the political stature to
hold the job on his own.
</P>
<P>
   That will leave it to the Liberal Democrats' powerful faction
leaders to choose among several more formidable contenders. The top
candidates now seem to be Yoshiro Mori, the party's secretary
general, and Yohei Kono, the foreign minister. The winner will
probably serve only a few weeks before facing the voters in new
elections now expected before the Group of 8 economic summit
meeting in Okinawa in July. The Japanese people should use that
election to demand that their political leaders show more courage
in devising bold economic reforms that can lead Japan out of its
prolonged and costly recession.

</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 4:
</P>
<P>
   With settlement talks having broken down, the judge overseeing
the government's antitrust case against Microsoft issued a stinging
ruling Monday that Microsoft had violated the antitrust laws by
abusing its monopoly position over Windows, the operating system
that controls the vast majority of personal computers. The ruling,
which supported most but not all of the government's accusations,
deserves wide credence. It was carefully grounded in antitrust
doctrine and the facts presented at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Now the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, moves on to the far
harder task of concocting a remedy. Here he will find no completely
satisfactory options.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson embraced the core of the government's case, ruling that
Microsoft illegally used its monopoly over Windows to get most
consumers to use its browser, the software that connects computers
to the Internet, rather than Netscape's. Microsoft's aim was far
more devious than a mere attempt to sell browser software. Browsers
can potentially replace Windows as the platform from which
computers run word processors and other application programs. So
Microsoft's decision to incorporate its browser in Windows and to
prohibit manufacturers from substituting anyone else's browser was
designed not to benefit consumers, the ultimate test of antitrust
doctrine, but to insulate Windows from competitive challenge. That,
Jackson ruled, violated the antitrust laws. Microsoft is counting
on the conservative justices on the appeals court to reverse
Jackson and give it more leeway to design products as it likes.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that Microsoft violated the antitrust laws
by proposing to carve up software markets with competitors and by
using its market power to steer the biggest Internet providers away
from Netscape. But he did not rule, as the government asked,
against less troubling contracts that Microsoft wrote with other
partners to discourage their customers from using Netscape's
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Jackson in devising an acceptable remedy is that
the government has failed to produce decisive evidence that
Microsoft's illegal tactics have as yet seriously harmed consumers.
Yes, Microsoft's tactics kept the price for Windows a bit too high
and squelched innovation in operating systems. But by how much, and
with what impact? The uncertainty leaves Jackson with two somewhat
unsatisfying solutions.
</P>
<P>
   He could focus on so-called conduct remedies for some of the
ways Microsoft unfairly drove out competition. Microsoft might, for
example, be required to publish promptly and completely all the
technical data that software companies need to make their programs
work smoothly with Windows. But these remedies would require
permanent government oversight of the software industry _ a
potential nightmare in a fast-moving, technically complicated
industry. Besides, conduct remedies do nothing to address the
government's core accusation: that Microsoft's illegal acts
eliminated potential competition in the market for operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson might be tempted, then, to impose structural remedies.
He might require Microsoft to license Windows to several other
companies that would be free to modify it and compete against
Microsoft. That way consumers could choose a version of Windows
based on price, customer service and perhaps features. But some
experts believe customers would flock only to Microsoft's version,
because only Bill Gates employs the experts who wrote the program
and know it best.
</P>
<P>
   The other structural remedy would go the final step _ breaking
up Microsoft into three or so separate companies, with Microsoft
personnel divided among them. The advantage of this remedy is that
it would break Microsoft's monopoly choke hold and avoid the need
for constant government oversight. But Jackson, let alone the more
conservative justices on the appeals court, may choke on that
drastic a remedy.

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Cesko Refika, 63, lives on the north
side of this old industrial city in what may be the most heavily
protected apartment building in the world, surrounded by hundreds
of French soldiers, not to mention nine tanks.
</P>
<P>
   And she is terrified.
</P>
<P>
   She has fled her home five times, staying briefly with relatives
on the south side, only to return again under armed guard. Her home
is surrounded by hostile Serbs, she cannot sleep, and her two young
grandchildren cry constantly. Last month, someone fired a
rocket-propelled grenade into a neighbor's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she comes back, the old Albanian woman shrugged,
saying, ``I have nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Oliver Ivanovic talked about how his Serb
neighbors are under siege by ethnic Albanians who want to kill
them, and by international peacekeepers he says are unable or
unwilling to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has to do more to protect Serbs,''
said Ivanovic, the Serb community leader and a former executive in
a mineral company. ``There are 16,000 Serbs left in Mitrovica, but
4,000 have been expelled and there are Albanian extremists who want
to kill or expel the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica (Mee-trow-VEE-cha) is the belly of the beast, the nub
of the problem in Kosovo. This drab, shabby city of about 80,000 is
so bitterly and literally divided that one despairs for the United
Nations' ambitious plan to transform this Serbian province into
something resembling a stable, multi-ethnic democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Divided by the Ibar River, separated by Kosovo Force, or KFOR,
peacekeepers, Serbs live on the north side, ethnic Albanians on the
south. They snarl at each other, occasionally erupting in murderous
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica is a bastion of extremism. The middle ground is the
bridge, a desolate expanse of barbed wire guarded mostly by French
soldiers that is the only thing keeping the two sides from
slaughtering each other. It has replaced the Berlin Wall and
Belfast's Peace Line as Europe's greatest monument to division and
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the woman in the Old Testament who agreed to let Solomon
cut a baby in half rather than share it with someone else, the
Serbs are content to abide by the partition of Mitrovica, seeing it
as their Alamo, their last stand in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But about 700 Albanian families are demanding to return to their
homes on the north side, which Serbs seized during and after
Yugoslavia's campaign to drive ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, and
the NATO bombing last year that stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica presents international peacekeepers with their biggest
challenge, and its de facto partition makes a mockery of the UN
mission to nurture a multi-ethnic society. But a difficult task has
been made even harder by disagreements over how best to keep the
lid on boiling tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Some soldiers, including Americans, accuse the French Army,
which controls the sector, of being soft on the Serbs, by not
disarming them and showing them who's boss. Some say the French
harbor a historical sympathy for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the KFOR commander, General Klaus Reinhardt, a German,
defends the French troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French have the hardest job,'' he said in an interview,
bristling at suggestions that other nations have lost confidence in
the French. ``They never got a chance to prove they are impartial.
They do a dangerous job, and they do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some American soldiers who have been to Mitrovica said the
problem is not that the French are biased toward the Serbs, but
that the French believe the best way to keep the peace is to make
the Serbs feel safe. Sometimes that means looking the other way
when weapons are found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a philosophical difference,'' said US Army Sergeant
Joshua Themann. ``I'd say most of KFOR thinks you should go in
there and take every weapon you can find. The French don't share
that view. They think if you're not hostile, things will settle
down. We think just the opposite, that unless you confront and take
weapons, it will get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But while American soldiers seem more than willing to confront
extremists, their superiors are more skittish. When American
soldiers met violent resistance from Serbs during house-to-house
searches for weapons in February, the Pentagon ordered US troops
out of the area. Reinhardt said he sent the American troops back in
a day later to prove that the Serbs could not dictate who would be
assigned in the area. But it was a token gesture, and the Americans
have not gone back since.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the heavy lifting to the French. Dozens of their
soldiers have been hurt, some seriously, in clashes with both
sides, and Albanians have repeatedly tried to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Matthieu Mabin, 25, a French soldier, acknowledged he
was sympathetic to Serbs, but not to the extent that he would favor
them over Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy for the Serbs,'' said Mabin, standing outside
one of three apartment buildings on the north side where the French
soldiers guarded returning Albanians. ``The Albanians have a future
because we're here. The Serbs are very afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   International police units dispatched here by the United
Nations, meanwhile, are critical of the KFOR in general and the
French in particular. J.D. Lucky, a Texan who was in charge of
policing in North Mitrovica, said that French troops looked on and
did nothing to help as he was set upon and beaten by a Serb mob in
February. For his trouble, Lucky was transferred.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, John Adams, an inspector from the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force, which is among the
world's most experienced in policing a divided society, held the
job for less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Adams gave an interview to the Globe and several
other newspapers in which he criticized the French troops, he, too,
was summarily transferred by UN administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt was unapologetic about the discipline meted out to the
police commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody in the police doesn't like what we're doing, they
should talk to me, not to you,'' Reinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the situation in Mitrovica needs a police response
more than a heavy-handed military one. But he said the UN is not
backing the police, prefering to defer to KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's lacking here is a determination to show who is in
charge,'' said Adams. He said the police force in Mitrovica, which
numbers 500 officers, needs to be three times larger.
</P>
<P>
   The police and military, meanwhile, appear to be singing from
different hymn sheets. Adams said he had intelligence reports
showing that many of those causing trouble on the Serb side are
taking orders from Belgrade, where the regime of the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, sees the destabilization of
Mitrovica as a way to undermine the international effort throughout
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Reinhardt, contradicting not just Adams but US officials and
his direct superior, NATO supreme commander General Wesley Clark,
said there is no evidence that Belgrade is directing Serb
troublemakers in Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica is home to extremists on both sides. On the south
side, Emin Xhinovci, a former rebel with the Kosovo Liberation
Army, runs a cafe he named after Adolf Hitler. French troops forced
him to take down a sign that had a swastika. But the soldiers could
do nothing to alter Xhinovci's appearance. He has dyed his hair jet
black, combed it to one side, and trimmed his mustache so that he
resembles Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that an ethnic Albanian would idolize someone
who carried out genocide against Jews and various minorities, but
the Nazis also occupied Serbia and killed Serbs, and any enemy of
the Serbs is a friend of Xhinovci's.
</P>
<P>
   Just over the bridge, on the north side, Serbian men with
walkie-talkies sit in the Dolce Vita bar, smoking cigarettes,
drinking beer, and looking out the window for Albanians who dare to
try to come back. They sometimes beat up journalists, whom they see
as biased against them. When French troops went after the
walkie-talkie men last week, they were greeted with a shower of
stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place reminds me of home,'' said Adams, ``but we don't
have the level of hatred in Northern Ireland that exists here.
These people really, really hate each other.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no shortage of thugs on either side, there are
also many ordinary people like the sleepless, beleaguered Mrs.
Refika and Olivera Josifovic, who don't wish harm on anyone and
just want to be allowed to live in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Josifovic, 35, a Serb, used to live next to the bridge, but
moved in with her brother in the Zvecan section farther north when
the war ended and the bridge became the epicenter of communal
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the war, I worked with Albanians, and we would go to
each other's homes, but now I don't have contact with them,'' she
said, holding her 9-month-old son, Marko, in a Serb community
center.
</P>
<P>
   She accepts that partition is necessary ``at least until things
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she think things will get better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' she said, turning to look at her smiling son. ``I
hope I live, for him.''

HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching a diva meltdown is like witnessing the implosion of a
grand old building: in an instant, a once-great and mighty
structure is reduced to rubble and dust.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the destruction of a building is a methodical,
meticulously planned event _ it's supposed to happen. Divas, on the
other hand, just come undone, unraveling before our eyes with a
myriad of tantrums, tribulations, and troubles until there's isn't
much left. It happened to Billie Holiday, it happened to Judy
Garland. And, some believe, it may be happening to Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not implying that Houston will wind up destitute,
shattered, and gone too soon like Holiday and Garland, who finally
checked out at 44 and 47 respectively. But, recent reports seem to
indicate that Houston, 36, is spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Houston _ depending on whose story you believe _ either bowed
out of or was fired from an appearance on the last week's Academy
Awards. At one preshow run-through, Houston was allegedly ``out of
it,'' and at another rehearsal, she reportedly missed her cues,
sang the wrong song, and generally seemed ``discombobulated,''
according to what one source told gossip maven Liz Smith. Burt
Bacharach, one of the show's musical directors, is said to have
told Houston, ``Just leave. It's not going to work out,'' 48 hours
before showtime. (She was replaced by country singer Faith Hill.)
</P>
<P>
   And even as tongues were still wagging about Houston's Oscar
no-show, word came of her bizarre behavior during an interview with
Jane magazine. According to writer Tony Romando, the notoriously
tardy Houston arrived four hours late, claiming she had a dental
emergency. And during the interview, she ``was extremely unfocused,
had trouble keeping her eyes open, and kept singing and playing an
imaginary piano on the table,'' he said. She also compared meeting
the president to hanging out with a junkie, and referred to the
jeweler who made the gold and diamond bracelet adorning her wrist
as ``this Jew guy on Diamond Row.''
</P>
<P>
   Quipped Romando about Houston's demeanor, ``I guess laughing gas
can do that to you.'' Could be. But there's nothing funny about
what's been happening to Houston. It's just sad.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a strange year for Houston. In January she was
detained at an airport in Hawaii after 15.2 grams of marijuana were
found in her bag; she was late-hour scratch from this year's Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony where she was supposed to
honor her mentor, Arista's Clive Davis; and there's even continued
debate over whether, during the Grammys, she flipped the bird (some
say she merely shook her fist) at Rosie O'Donnell when the comedian
made a thinly veiled crack about Houston's Hawaii troubles.
</P>
<P>
   All this has been keeping Houston's publicists busy, issuing
statement after statement to explain their client's recent
exploits. But nothing can erase the perception that Houston has
become that most frightening of creatures _ the diva run-amok.
</P>
<P>
   These disturbing reports come at an inopportune time for the
singer. After less-than-stellar initial sales in 1998 for her
latest album, ``My Love is Your Love,'' the CD rebounded big-time
on the strength of brilliant dance remixes of ``Heartbreak Hotel''
and especially, ``It's Not Right But It's Okay.'' With her career
regaining its momentum, Houston doesn't need bad press. Despite the
old axiom, sometimes there is such a thing as bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   While she still has some of the best pipes in the business _ you
can fault her choice of material, but her voice is extraordinary _
Houston is a long way from the squeaky-clean image cultivated for
her when her career began 15 years ago. Whereas people once watched
Houston to marvel at her considerable talent and beauty, now just
as many folks probably want to see her because she might do
something unseemly or outrageous, if she even bothers to show up.
These days, watching Houston is like attending a stock car race _
there's always potential for a spectacular crash.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Houston's having a bad spell, and there's more to the
official reports of the singer's sore throats and bouts of
exhaustion than the subterfuge of her publicists. She's hardly the
first star to be combative, belligerent, and difficult. After all,
she is a diva, and that is what divas do. But it's high-time for
someone to rein Houston in _ not just to save her career and
reputation, but perhaps the singer herself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember back in 1992 when Houston inexplicably married
oft-troubled singer Bobby Brown, and many believed such an
association would tarnish her reputation? Now, it seems, the two
may have been better matched than any of us then realized.

HARSHBARGER TAKES REINS IN CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What timing. Six months after taking the reins of
Common Cause, a granddaddy of good-government groups, Bay State
transplant Scott Harshbarger finds himself riding high on the
hottest horse in Washington, the drive for campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just a coincidence that both parties' presumptive
presidential nominees, plus some of Congress's strongest defenders
of the current money system, became born-again reformers just after
Harshbarger arrived in town. In fact, the Democrat who narrowly
lost the governor's race in 1998 says with self-deprecation that he
still doesn't get all his phone calls returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hershberger? Hamburger? It's back to the days of having to
spell my name,'' said Harshbarger, who, as Massachusetts attorney
general from 1990 to 1998, led high-profile campaigns against
tobacco, guns, legalized gambling, and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this new job _ president of Common Cause _ could be
Harshbarger's greatest challenge and opportunity. His mandate is to
energize and restore status to the 30-year-old citizens' lobby that
by most measures is showing its age. His mission is to lead Common
Cause in a year when, thanks largely to Arizona Senator John
McCain's assault on special interests, its signature issue _
getting big money out of politics _ has captured the public
imagination and has a chance to move in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary moment for Common Cause,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, who headed the group for a more than a decade. ``The
issue of campaign finance reform is attracting unprecedented
national attention, and Common Cause has been there from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiercely independent, Common Cause never has had a partisan as
president, and Harshbarger is taking pains to erase his Democratic
brand and play no favorites in the presidential race. This week he
called Vice President Al Gore's new proposal to ban unlimited
donations of so-called soft money and create a $7.1 billion
endowment to fund candidates ``a good, solid response'' to
campaign-finance abuses. But, Harshbarger added, he still has
doubts about Gore's sincerity and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are right, but how is Gore different from Bill
Clinton, how does what he says effect the 1996 presidential money
scandals, which were the biggest in history, and why should you
believe him on this issue at all?'' Harshbarger asked.
</P>
<P>
   He's no more charitable to Texas Governor George W. Bush.
Harshbarger says Bush adopted ``a phony reform proposal'' to beat
McCain in the GOP primaries and ``is not even in the same
ballpark'' with Gore because he defends soft money. And the sudden
interest by Senate Republicans in tinkering with the campaign
finance laws is aimed less at change and more at giving senators
political cover in the November elections, Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, it's a little hard to believe (Gore and Bush)
are going to pick up the reform mantle,'' Harshbarger said. ``On
the other hand, it proves they see what McCain and (Bill) Bradley
saw: that campaign-finance reform is a really salient issue in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harshbarger harbors ambitions for elective office _ another
run for governor in 2002, perhaps _ standing on a national platform
and exposing political hypocrisy isn't likely to help him win
friends in the Democratic establishment. Representative Martin
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who probably has his own eye on a
higher prize, said using Common Cause as a political stepping stone
``won't work'' for Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused of being holier-than-thou all of my
political career, and there is no point in being different now,''
said Harshbarger, insisting he likes what he's doing and ``the last
thing on my mind'' is running for office. ``As a practical matter,
it's our job to call them as we see them.''
</P>
<P>
   The job, which was offered to him by Derek Bok, Common Cause's
chairman and the former president of Harvard University, is a good
fit for Harshbarger. He said it allows him to stay in public life
and in touch with the kind of ethics issues that interested him
most as general counsel of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission, as
Middlesex district attorney, and as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave him a needed change of venue after a very
disappointing defeat in the governor's race, a bout of
post-election depression, and some career uncertainly for a
58-year-old ``former'' office-holder with a lawyer wife and empty
nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a little distance was important, so I wasn't
constantly thinking about what could have been, or what might have
been,'' said Harshbarger, who commuted to Boston each weekend last
fall but now has rented an apartment in Washington. ``I vowed I
wouldn't say anything about (Gov.) Paul Cellucci _ he won, that's
the ballgame, that's the way it is _ and besides, nobody really
wanted to hear my opinion, and nobody wants to hear you whine.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Washington was a culture shock. As a candidate,
Harshbarger said he was tuned in to the public's cynical view that
government is at best irrelevant and at worst tainted and corrupt.
Inside the Capital Beltway, Harshbarger found elected officials
tone deaf to the cry that Washington is the captive of special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable disconnect,'' Harshbarger said during an
interview in his spacious downtown office. ``People in Washington
see the world totally differently from people anywhere else in the
country. The feeling here is `the public is wrong. That's not the
way we do business here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A second surprise, Harshbarger said, was to find the community
of public-interest activists, supposedly led by Common Cause,
arguing about agenda, divided over tactics, and nursing old
grudges. How on earth were they going to win a war against the
powerful lobbyists on K Street, Harshbarger wondered, if the
reformers were fighting among themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why the other side can sleep at night,'' Harshbarger
said, recalling the industry's divide-and-conquer strategy that
defeated antitobacco legislation in 1998. ``They know their best
chance is to throw red meat out there and get the reform groups to
yell at each other and refuse to talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign, said Common
Cause was mostly to blame for the bad blood because ``like an
800-pound gorilla,'' it got accustomed over 30 years to throwing
its weight around and disregarding newer advocacy groups like hers.
``Scott has put out the peace flag, and I think it's working,''
Miller said. ``People are feeling a lot more generous these days
toward Common Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said one of his goals is to broaden the Washington
coalition of clean-government types to include civil-rights and
public-health groups and to mobilize more activists at the grass
roots. Another is to grow Common Cause's 200,000 membership and $10
million budget because both have been static for years. A third is
to use the Internet, a larger staff, and Harshbarger's
communication skills to raise the visibility of the organization
and make the arcane subject of campaign finance accessible to a
larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   He's already getting attention in some unexpected places.
Conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh recently gave
Harshbarger credit for questioning Gore's reformer credentials.
``He didn't criticize me, and he quoted me twice,'' Harshbarger
said, amazed.

DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT SICILIAN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. FRANKLIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALERMO, Italy _ When it comes to advice on traveling and
safety, Palermo seems to rank as one of the most dangerous
destinations in the world, right up there with Haiti, Colombia, and
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Filthy, dirty city, one acquaintance told my husband and me
before we left for a recent 10-day trip to Italy, most of which we
spent in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pericoloso'' (dangerous), said our friends from the north of
Italy. ``Mafioso,'' they added, just to make sure we got the point.
The most skilled pickpockets in the world are there, the guidebooks
warned. Take off your gold, leave the camera in the hotel room. (Mi
scusi? Why would I possibly want to be in bella Italia, and leave
my camera at the hotel?)
</P>
<P>
   Worst traffic on the planet, said the American we met on the
Amalfi coast just days before our journey south to Sicily. Drivers
refuse to yield to stop signs, he said; worse, unruly motorcyclists
drive on the sidewalks. You take your life in your hands when you
walk in Palermo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mama mia! Were we ``patzo'' to want to visit Palermo?
</P>
<P>
   Crazy we were not, but we sure were curious to see Palermo with
our own eyes. And so, after four magical days in the tranquil and
sophisticated tourist town of Taormina, we boarded the train at
Messina for the 3 1/2-hour ride west to Palermo, the capital of
Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, our stay was brief, only 36 hours, but surely our
observations are as valid as anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what my husband and I will remember about Palermo:
</P>
<P>
   --The pleasant couple who drove us from the train station to a
hotel, which they recommended to us, in the center of this bustling
city. That act of random kindness saved us several hours and a
whole lot of stress.
</P>
<P>
   --The roped-off Via Liberta, a wide and well-used pedestrian
boulevard in the center of Palermo's Old Square, an architecturally
rich and beautiful part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   --The sophisticated men and women who strolled the
pedestrian-only street, arm-in-arm, greeting friends with a kiss on
one cheek and then the other, pushing designer baby strollers, and
being pulled by their yuppie dogs.
</P>
<P>
   --Our charming horse-and-buggy ride through the Quattro Canti di
Citta; the shimmering blue Mediterranean Sea filled with cruise
ships and cargo barges in the bustling Bay of Palermo, the largest
port in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it probably would have been prudent to spend
three or more days in Palermo, a cosmopolitan city with quite a bit
to do. With more time, we would have ventured to the Palazzo
Abbatellis and the Museo Regionale Archeologic, two of Italy's most
renowned museums and home to important collections of ancient and
modern art. We would have also visited Museo Internazionale delle
Marionette, Palermo's well-known puppet museum. And we would have
taken a day trip seven miles east to the popular beach town of
Mondello.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my point: Travel is as much about expanding our awareness
_ of our world, our neighbors, ourselves _ as it is about getting
on and off planes, checking in and out of hotels, and eating at
restaurants and seeing the sights recommended by the guidebook or
by a friend. To truly expand our awareness, we must make our own
impressions about a place. When Gulliver travels to Lilliput and
Brobdingnag and tells the reader that ``nothing is great or little
than by comparison,'' he means that only by contrasting ourselves
to others can we really figure out who we really are.
</P>
<P>
   Why travel if not to compare our lives, history, culture, and
cuisine with others? What better way is there to really know
yourself? You must decide where to journey and why. Yes, read the
guidebooks; yes, talk to friends; but don't go to a place just
because it's in vogue, or stay away from a destination because
someone else didn't enjoy their time there.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: What others had led us to believe we would find
in Palermo, and what we actually found.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being mowed down by drivers who impulsively careen
onto sidewalks to avoid traffic jams, we saw cars parked neatly
along side streets. Contrary to what we had heard _ that there were
no traffic lights in Palermo _ we found both streetlights, and
drivers who obeyed them. It was possible to be a pedestrian in
Palermo and safely cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding a dirty, unattractive city here in Sicily's
northwest corner, we found a picturesque older town, bordered on
one side by the sparkling blue Mediterranean Sea, and on the other
by the snow-capped mountain peaks of Monte Pellegrino.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being upset by the sight of dirty, begging children
in the streets, we found children eager to speak English with two
Americans while the kids took a break from their pick-up
neighborhood soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand me. I'm not specifically advising you to go
to Palermo. What I am advising is that, after reading the
guidebooks and talking with friends, remember this: The adventure
of travel, the excitement that comes when you venture someplace
new, is entirely up to you.

RUSSIAN OIL GIANT FORCED TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEFTEYUGANSK, Russia _ Times have changed for Yukos oil _ or so
it says.
</P>
<P>
   In Yukos's heyday, the giant oil company was one of Russia's
most powerful and politically connected corporations. But to
foreign investors, it was also an example of what was wrong with
doing business in this vast country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Yukos's executives of using their political ties
to make themselves fabulously rich while evading taxes, hiding
profits, and using dirty tricks to keep stockholders from sharing
the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Yukos's executives appeared to be willing to try anything to
prevent investors from having a say. Last year, minority
shareholders showed up for an important meeting to find a notice
taped to the door informing them that the session had been moved to
a town 100 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But since President Vladimir V. Putin came to power in December,
Yukos has lost the allies in government it had under Boris N.
Yeltsin and also expects to lose the tax breaks, government
contracts, and other privileges it once enjoyed. Instead, the
company hopes to regain its position by running an efficient
business _ or at least selling that image.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the company has posted healthy profits, cut
costs, paid delinquent taxes, and promised stockholders millions of
dollars in dividends. In an effort to spruce up its image, it also
flew groups of reporters out to its oil fields to witness the
progress.
</P>
<P>
   On the Priobskoye oil field in western Siberia last month, Yukos
showed off Russian employees and foreign partners working together
on towering rigs in subzero cold. It has brought in the French
company Schlumberger, a leading oil-field services company, to help
increase output and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Yukos's chief executive officer, said in
an interview that he wants to bring ``efficiency and transparency''
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the company has hired the US accounting
firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit its books. Khodorkovsky also
promised that independent directors, including foreigners, will be
appointed to the board and that executives will hold frequent
meetings with investors.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have produced results, Yukos said.
</P>
<P>
   It has slashed its operating costs to $3.70 per barrel of oil,
down from $12 in 1998, helping the company post a pre-tax profit of
$600 million last year. Shareholders have been promised $100
million in dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Has this former bad boy of Russian capitalism really gone
straight?
</P>
<P>
   Troika-Dialog, a Moscow-based investment bank that holds a
minority stake in Yukos, is not persuaded. In a recent report, the
bank called Khodorkovsky's efforts to clean up Yukos's image ``spin
control masquerading as corporate governance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For many investors, Yukos is the epitome of shareholder abuse
in Russia _ no mean feat,'' the report read.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Yukos's impressive profits were attributable to
higher oil prices, while the company's low production costs were
the result of Russia's devaluation of the ruble in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yukos is effectively playing the game that everyone else is
playing now, which is `be nice to investors.' But they still have a
lot to do to prove this isn't just hot air,'' said Jim Henderson,
an oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital, a Moscow-based
brokerage. ``It is not as if they said: `Ooh, we've been naughty
and now we had better be good.' It is in their own interests to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russia becomes prosperous and stable depends largely on
companies like Yukos, one of eight major oil companies here.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry dominates Russia's economy. Fuel and energy
taxes provide 40 percent of the national budget. Oil and gas
exports account for 47 percent of foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   If the industry can generate wealth for its employees and
investors, not just its executives, the economy should flourish. If
the industry can't, or won't, then Russia's explosive mix of a
small wealthy class and a majority mired in poverty could
destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Yukos's history gives ample cause for caution.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, the chief executive, is one of Russia's
``oligarchs,'' a group of financiers who used their political
connections after the Soviet breakup to buy the crown jewels of
Russia's economy _ oil and gas companies, nickel mines, aluminum
smelters, television stations _ at prices well below their value.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovky, perhaps the most influential of the oligarchs,
boasted in a 1996 interview that he and six other men controlled
half of Russia's economy, and that they had financed the reelection
of former president Yeltsin and had been dictating government
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under Yeltsin, the oligarchs were able to use their clout to
avoid taxes, manipulate legislation to their benefit, and increase
their stranglehold over the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Putin's Kremlin, Berezovsky still has influence. But
Khodorkovsky has lost his allies.
</P>
<P>
   That has made it necessary to live down the reputation Russia's
oil giants gained for manipulating their finances to cheat
shareholders. The biggest blow to Yukos's reputation resulted from
a scandal involving the financier Kenneth Dart, a US-born
billionaire who in 1994 renounced his citizenship and moved to the
Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Dart, who held minority shares in three Yukos
subsidiaries, publicly accused the company's executives of cheating
minority investors. Yukos responded by excluding Dart from a series
of shareholder meetings where it issued new stock and sold it
cheaply to Yukos-owned companies in Cyprus, diluting Dart's stake.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky does not deny the charge, but said he acted because
Dart was resisting plans to streamline the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start this dirty game, but I was ready to answer in
kind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a yearlong battle in the courts and the press, the two
sides settled their dispute in December when Yukos agreed to buy
out Dart's shares for a reported $120 million. (He is believed to
have invested significantly more, but his representatives refused
to say how much.)
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky has accused the Western media of an anti-Russian
bias for taking Dart's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all very unpleasant because during the battle with
Dart there was a lot of Russophobia in the Western media,
particularly in America,'' Khodorkovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But Western investors are not alone to have clashed with Yukos.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Petukhov was mayor of Nefteyugansk, a Siberian outpost
where Yukos has its largest production company. A harsh Yukos
critic, the mayor led protests outside its headquarters after the
company cut salaries and stopped paying local taxes. In a letter to
the federal government in June 1998, Petukhov accused Yukos of
``cynical actions and murderous politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, he was shot dead while walking to work.
</P>
<P>
   Yukos officials, who accused Petukhov of corruption, denied any
involvement, but many people in Nefteyugansk suspected the oil
company. The crime has never been solved.
</P>
<P>
   The company's relations with the town have improved. Yukos has
paid all its taxes, contributed computers to city schools, and
helped finance the building of a church.

&HT;     `FALCONE' STANDS ON ITS OWN AS WORTHY DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The comparisons to ``The Sopranos,'' the scheduling that recalls
``Roots,'' the way a national tragedy kept it off the air last fall
_ all that can wait for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' the long-overdue mob drama from CBS that began
Tuesday night, holds its own without caveats as engrossing
television. The drama manages to avoid being derivative, even
though it's a series (a miniseries, maybe) based on a movie
(``Donnie Brasco''), based on the real life of undercover FBI agent
Joe Pistone.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Gedrick (``The Last Don,'' ``Murder One,'' ``Iron Eagle''
and ``Ally McBeal'') plays Pistone _ Joe Falcone to his ``mob
pals'' in New York City. When we pick up the story, Falcone has
already ingratiated himself in a cell of la famiglia, befriending
Sonny Napoli (Titus Welliver of ``Mind Prey'' and ``Brooklyn
South,'' in a wonderfully revelatory performance).
</P>
<P>
   The tension grows as Falcone faces constant challenges about his
loyalty, and an intramural mob war looms. The plot's effects are
heightened when we remember that a real person went through this.
</P>
<P>
   But the real tension comes from within Falcone's other family,
which includes his wife, Maggie (Amy Carlson of ``Another World''),
and their two children. They don't know the specifics of his other
life. They don't know what he's doing for the Feds. All they know
is that it takes him away from home for weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the (show's) future, I can see family life being every bit
as important as the mob life,'' said executive producer Mark
Johnson, who was also a producer for ``Donnie Brasco.''
</P>
<P>
   The new series ``is about a man who is so strongly compromised
in every relationship he has, yet has chosen his life _ and
secretly enjoys it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The show first garnered notice last spring for not making it on
the air. CBS President Les Moonves said he knew ``Falcone'' was a
good drama when it crossed his desk in April. Yes, good drama _ but
the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   It was post-Columbine. Immediate post-Columbine, a week after
the school shooting in a Denver suburb. Moonves said he had a
``visceral'' reaction to the violence (an ice-pick murder has since
been toned down). The show was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Now the program CBS didn't want to air is being presented as
event television. Using a scheduling strategy for a drama not seen
on network TV since ABC's ``Roots'' aired on eight consecutive
nights in January 1977, ``Falcone'' will be ``stripped'' _ running
on eight nights over nine days.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour pilot will be followed by one-hour installments
airing at 10 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and Monday, April 10,
through Wednesday, April 12. (CBS is airing a live teleplay, ``Fail
Safe,'' on Sunday night.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Kahl, the network's senior vice president for program
planning and scheduling, said CBS didn't have a natural time slot
for the show, and wanted to put some promotional effort behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really liked the show, and we kind of said to ourselves,
`What can we do a little differently ... so it wouldn't fall into
the mid-season pitfalls?''' he said. ``How can we call a little
extra attention to that show so it doesn't fall into the same
trap?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who spent the downtime from ``Falcone'' producing the
feature movies ``Galaxy Quest'' and ``My Dog Skip,'' relishes the
show's change of fortune. ``I'm thrilled we are doing it this
way,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although each episode can stand on its own, there's a serial
effect that is amplified by the nightly airings: ``As written, one
show feeds off the next. We do pick up where the last one left
off.''
</P>
<P>
   But remember: Although the success of ``The Sopranos'' certainly
piqued the interest of CBS, this is not a clone show. The moral
center is different. The feel is different. The executive producer
said it came naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to consciously be different,'' Johnson said.
``Like everyone else, I am a huge fan of `The Sopranos' ... (but)
ours is a different show. Ours does not have the black humor. We
didn't have it in the movie, and we didn't have it in the show
itself. It is about a completely different character.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: There is no cable-only profanity. Still, the
dialogue rings true, with one notable exception.
</P>
<P>
   When a mobster asks another mob guy in the hospital how he
feels, there are a lot of things he can say. ``Like a bag of poop''
is just not one of them. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize he said that,'' Johnson said. ``I have no
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are a couple of ``Sopranos'' crossovers. For
example, Louis Lombardi, who plays FBI agent Skip Alari on the HBO
series, is small-timer Ernie Bello on ``Falcone.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lillo Brancato Jr., who as Matt Bevilaqua got blown away a
few weeks ago, plays Sonny's pal Lucky on ``Falcone.'' Our guess is
his fate won't live up to his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside all those tangential issues surrounding this
compelling drama. ``Falcone'' is not ``The Sopranos,'' or
``Roots,'' or just a scheduling guinea pig. It stands on its own
just fine.

&HT;     HEARTBURN MAY BE SIGN OF WORSE THINGS TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the right concentration, the acid in your
stomach is powerful enough to dissolve a penny. It can also wreak
havoc in your throat, as millions of sufferers of heartburn know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a burning pain,'' said Dr. Richard MacDermott, chief of
gastroenterology at the Albany Medical Center. ``Some patients will
have a feeling of acid in their throat or a bad taste in the
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such discomfort is common, affecting up to half of all American
adults. Most people treat heartburn on their own, spending a total
of $1 billion a year on over-the-counter remedies such as Tums and
Maalox.
</P>
<P>
   But many people still wonder when it's appropriate to see a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, according to MacDermott, occurs when the gastric acid
that normally stays in the stomach to digest food leaks back up
into the esophagus, the tube that links the mouth to the stomach.
Persistent leakage causes irritation and pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody refluxes acid into their esophagus, but we all have
mechanisms to get the acid out,'' MacDermott said. A patient with
heartburn, however, may be unable to move the acid out because of a
defective or weak sphincter, the ringlike muscle that separates the
stomach from the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   A highly publicized study last year caused concern when it
reported that heartburn sufferers were almost 45 times more likely
than normal to develop cancer of the esophagus, an especially
aggressive type of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, with its intense and sudden chest pain, can also
mimic the symptoms of a heart attack. This makes it difficult to
know when the problem is a potentially life-threatening condition
or ``just heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to die from not treating heartburn for a few
days or a week, but not treating angina is a serious problem,''
said Dr. Edward Orris, the chief of gastroenterology at St. Peter's
Hospital in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, he advises anyone over 40 or 50 who has any
risk factors for heart disease, whether it's high blood pressure or
obesity, to seek treatment for such pain, especially if it's
accompanied by shortness of breath or sweating.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know their problem is heartburn, the question
about when to go to the doctor is a matter of severity and
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has a history of heartburn related to a specific
food, a cautious diet and a little self-medication is fine,'' Orris
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the pain turns into a weekly or daily event, and not
just with the chili or tacos, take heed. At that point, doctors say
the symptoms might point to a more serious problem, known as
gastroesophageal reflux disease.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs include painful swallowing, coughing, weight loss,
bleeding and anemia. If the acid reaches the mouth, it can even
cause tooth decay.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious, such reflux can lead to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, chronic heartburn sufferers can get relief, with a
host of medicines or surgery. But two weeks ago, the Food &AMP; Drug
Administration cracked down on one of the more popular treatments
for severe nighttime heartburn, called Propulsid.
</P>
<P>
   That drug has been linked to 341 reports of heart rhythm
abnormalities, including 80 deaths. People on the drug are advised
to talk to their doctors. Although it will be available through
July 14 to give patients time to find alternatives, the drug will
be available after that only a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   For most people with mild heartburn, the best strategy for
minimizing symptoms is to make lifestyle changes, according to
Orris.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to avoid fatty foods, large meals, caffeine-rich
foods,'' he said. People should be especially careful not to eat
close to bedtime, to give the stomach plenty of time to empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first line of treatment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm a criminal. The deadline for returning U.S.
Census forms passed on Saturday and my ``short form'' is still
sitting on my desk next to my tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The government definitely will get my tax returns. I'm scared of
the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not scared of the Census Bureau, which has given us an
extension to April 11 and probably won't prosecute anyone who
misses that deadline. So I don't know when I'll mail back that
form.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40 percent of the American public isn't returning
census forms. Some are simply procrastinators or losers who can't
keep federal forms separate from Ed McMahon's letters in the mail
pile.
</P>
<P>
   I partly fall in that group, but also partly in a group that
consciously resists returning the forms. In other words, I
consciously resist going through the pile of junk mail to find that
census form.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well ask me to get up from the dinner table and
have a nice conversation with someone reading a script to persuade
me to change phone services. You might as well ask me to put my
credit card and Social Security numbers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The census comes every 10 years, and this isn't the decade to be
asking people personal questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative radio talk show hosts have advocated
resistance to the census and the supposedly intrusive questions
about income and indoor plumbing posed by the all-powerful federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   They have it backwards. The government can't be all that
powerful if it needs to find out if you have a toilet or a
telephone. So much for all those conspiracy theories that have the
Feds watching us while we're on the john and listening to all our
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't mind filling out the long form's questions about
indoor plumbing. Of course, there is some shame involved. I'm
ashamed I don't have outdoor plumbing. That's what determines
status in the San Francisco area _ outdoor plumbing like a hot tub
and a Port-a-Potty for workers building additions on the house.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one set of questions on the short form I find
troublesome, the questions about race. Despite a large number of
boxes to check (11 different ones for Asians), there simply aren't
enough choices to fit America.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be real honest, I hate checking a box marked ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just so boring, bland and doesn't quite match the way I'd
describe myself, which is all-American, half-crazed, half-Irish
swamp Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Being white definitely has its advantages, such as during
traffic stops, police sweeps or visits to the loan departments of
banks. But nobody wants to check a box marked ``white.'' You might
as well check ``can't jump,'' ``can't dance'' or ``white shoes and
white belt.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to the Census Bureau, if you check two boxes, say
``black'' and ``white,'' you'll be counted as black. In other
words, they're following the same definition of race created by
racists in the South.
</P>
<P>
   A national census (or ``enumeration'') is mentioned five
paragraphs into the Constitution as the basis for determining
representation. If a census were important enough to mention that
high up in the Constitution, perhaps we should go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, though, the census seemed tangled up in issues of
race and legitimacy. The Constitution leaves the specific questions
on the census to Congress, but does mention counting ``free
persons,'' excluding ``Indians not taxed,'' and counting all other
persons as ``three-fifths.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the Founding Fathers didn't get off to a good start,
counting each slave as three-fifths of a human being. Maybe there's
some poetic justice in the fact that 200 years later only
three-fifths of the human beings in the country are responding to
the census.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants are scared of being harassed by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Conservatives don't like government
intrusion in service of redistribution of wealth _ or distribution
of services, as liberals would have it.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of plain people don't like giving their income or
answering questions like the one on the long form about whether
they have difficulty ``learning, remembering, concentrating?''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley says information on the
value of your home will help determine the adequacy of housing for
the elderly, and information about military service will help plan
the location of veterans hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   As if housing for the elderly ever will be adequate. As if the
government is actually opening VA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes the Census Bureau when it says our answers will
remain confidential. After all, this is America.
</P>
<P>
   The president released private letters from a woman he allegedly
made passes at. The mayor of New York released juvenile records for
a guy shot and killed by the police. College transcripts for George
W. Bush and Al Gore were spread all over the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not advocating that people violate the law and refuse to
respond to the census. I doubt the Feds will be telling the
tabloids you don't have a phone or indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm definitely returning my census forms, but only to keep the
Census Bureau from sending an enumerator to my house. I can tell a
Jehovah's Witness to get lost, but I don't think I can tell a
census guy I'm not really white.

COMPUTING UNIVERSE HAS CHANGED DURING MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In 1997, when the US Justice Department asked a federal court
to slap Microsoft Corp. with a $1 million-a-day fine for illegal
practices, the company's number two executive, Steve Ballmer,
replied: ``I say to heck with (US Attorney General) Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 2 1/2 years later, Microsoft's bold confidence has been
shaken not only by the beatings it has taken but also by the rapid
changes in the technology world that make it harder for any one
company to be as dominant as Microsoft has been.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's harsh ruling on Nov. 5, which
denounced Microsoft's business practices, forced the company into
four months of negotiations aimed at settling the case. But
settlement talks died and Jackson has found Microsoft guilty as
charged. No one doubts the software giant will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   So Microsoft's renewed determination to win in the courtroom
comes as the company has already lost the first major battle and is
virtually certain to lose the next.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the legal battlefield has been reshaped over the
past 29 months, so has the competitive landscape of the computer
industry. These changes will permanently alter Microsoft's role in
the industry, whatever the outcome of the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when the case began, many thought the future of
computing would be resolved by the browser wars. And Microsoft's
move against Netscape was viewed ominously by those who feared the
Redmond, Wash. company was gaining a lock on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, there were ample evidences of other rising
technologies. That year, 3Com Inc. sold a million of its handheld
Palm Pilot handheld computers, devices that didn't use any
Microsoft software. Already, about 70 million people worldwide were
using the Internet, a computerized communications system run with
non-Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   And hobbyists and computer science students were beginning to
sing the praises of a new kind of computer operating system called
Linux _ sophisticated, powerful, and available at no cost. Unlike
Windows, Linux is ``open source'' software. That means its raw code
is freely available, so programmers can modify it at will. And
Linux is completely independent of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   None of these changes have harmed Microsoft's ability to make
money. The company earned $7.8 billion in profits in the fiscal
year ending last June. And its core market for personal computers
continues to grow rapidly. The Chicago market research firm
eTForecasts projects that over 200 million PCs will be sold
worldwide in 2005, up from 125 million this year. The majority of
these machines will rely on Microsoft operating systems and
applications software. If Microsoft isn't dismantled by the federal
courts, years of robust earnings lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft of 1997 seemed unstoppable. Not only did it
boast overwhelming dominance on the desktop, it also appeared
poised to extend its power to every other area of computing.
Indeed, that fear was at the heart of the government's decision to
prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   But today, it's a different world. ``You have dramatic shifts in
the industry every 18 months to two years,'' says Microsoft
spokesman Jim Cullinan. Because of those changes, he says,
Microsoft's role in the industry was bound to change _ lawsuit or
no lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is simply the inevitable backlash felt by any
institution that's perceived as extremely powerful. Bob Young,
chairman of Red Hat Software Inc., the leading supplier of Linux
operating systems, can tell the difference simply by listening to
people who greet him on the street. ``They say, `We're just
generally pulling for you guys,' '' says Young. ``There's sort of
the sense (that) people are tired of being dictated to by
Microsoft, and they want successful alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   From near-total obscurity in 1997, Linux now commands a quarter
of the market for server operating systems, second only to
Microsoft Windows NT. Part of Linux's success, says Young, is due
to the perception of Microsoft as a corporate bully.
</P>
<P>
   Young also credits the government's antitrust case, saying that
it prevented Microsoft from attacking Red Hat with the sort of
heavy-handed tactics the company has used against other rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it was easier to strike the
relationships we've been able to build with (computer makers)
Compaq, IBM, and Dell as a result of Microsoft not being as
aggressive as they have been documented as being in the past,''
says Young.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he believes that even if Microsoft hadn't faced the
lawsuit, there'd still be a Linux boom. The reason, says Young, is
the rise of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet and open source are tightly linked,'' says Young.
Like Linux, the raw programming or source code for every key
Internet system is public information. As companies began building
Internet-based communications and business systems, they became
accustomed to the freedom and flexibility that comes with access to
the source code. And so corporate computer users were happy to
embrace an operating system based on the same philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Wladawsky-Berger, the Linux chieftain at IBM Corp.,
shares Young's view. Despite Microsoft's efforts to control
Internet browsers, Wladawsky-Berger says there's no way any firm
can dominate a system as open as the Internet. ``The world economy
is so much bigger than a browser,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As Young predicted, IBM has embraced Linux and other types of
open source software because they're a perfect fit for the open,
decentralized design of the Internet itself. For example, Windows
is basically limited to running on computers with microprocessors
based on Intel Corp.'s Pentium design. Linux, on the other hand,
will run on everything IBM makes, from laptops to mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lingua franca,'' says Wladawsky-Berger _ a universal
language for all kinds of smart machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is just beginning to have an impact on other
software markets dominated by Microsoft. The company's most
profitable product is its Office software suite, with word
processor, spreadsheet, personal information manager, and other
features. But little by little, people are starting to use
Internet-based software as a substitute for some of these
functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of liberation going on,'' says Geoff Ralston,
vice president for communications services at Yahoo Inc. Ralston is
in charge of a variety of Yahoo services that let people collect
their e-mail or schedule their appointments from any
Internet-connected computer, using software running on a Yahoo
server instead of the desktop machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston scoffs at the idea that Web-based applications like his
will ever substitute for traditional PC software. But it has
altered the way people store and access personal information.
Instead of keeping it solely on a Windows PC at work or at home,
the data is also stored on a remote computer located somewhere in
the Internet's ``cloud'' of interconnected servers. ``Suddenly,
everything is available to you all the time,'' Ralston says.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the same will apply to other popular software products. Sun
Microsystems Inc. plans a service called StarPortal that will give
users access to a full-fledged suite of office software, stored and
run on a remote server rather than the local computer. Microsoft
plans to offer the same service. If the concept catches on, it
could mean a dramatic decrease in sales of traditional software
packages _ an unsettling prospect for the leader in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has never been the leader in handheld computing. That
industry was founded by Apple Computer Inc.'s ill-fated Newton
device, but blossomed when 3Com Inc. introduced the Palm Pilot in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's been trying to catch up ever since. But its
feature-laden Windows CE system left consumers cold. Meanwhile,
consumers have snapped up 6 million Palm devices, and a company
called Handspring is now selling less expensive models that use the
same underlying software.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's chief competitive officer Michael Mace says that
Microsoft and other rivals have failed because they try to apply
old software thinking to this new market. ``They've tried to design
a handheld as a miniature PC,'' says Mace. ``What you get is a bad
PC . . . and a bad handheld.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft vows to keep on trying. The company is launching a new
version of its Windows CE technology next month. But already, Palm
has achieved the kind of loyal customer base that Microsoft has
built up in desktop computers. Meanwhile, Palm and other companies
are rushing to add Internet browsing capability to the millions of
cellular phones sold each year. Again, it's a vast new market where
Microsoft isn't in the running.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is left intact by the federal government, it will
remain one of the world's biggest and most powerful companies. But
in a striking illustration of how much the world has changed,
Microsoft last week lost its place as the world's most valuable
publicly traded corporation. That crown was snatched by Cisco
Systems Inc., builder of the underlying hardware and software that
makes the Internet work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network has become the predominant issue in today's
marketplace,'' Cullinan admits. Microsoft is one of the biggest
nodes on that global network. But at the end game of the antitrust
trial, it's merely one among many.

&HT;     HIKING TO THE ADIRONDACK PEAKS ON THE CUSP OF SPRING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KEENE VALLEY, N.Y. _ There's no telling what to expect in the
Adirondacks in late winter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we were treated to several inches of fresh powder for
an annual snowshoeing weekend at Grace Camp and Camp Peggy O'Brien
in the heart of the High Peaks region. This year, on similar dates
on the calendar, hiking boots and crampons for occasional icy
patches turned out to be more practical for trails that had melted
and re-frozen over the previous few days.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready for the trip, it was unclear what we should even
pack for the 3 1/2-mile trek to the cabins, the two-night stay and
then a day of climbing some of the tallest peaks in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Record-breaking high temperatures and rain had melted all of the
snow in lower elevations, but our band of hikers was experienced
enough to know to expect anything at higher elevations. Indeed, as
late as mid-week an average of one foot of snow still lay on the
ground of the High Peaks region.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, traces of snow covered more and more of the brown
grass the further we drove north from Albany. By the time we pulled
into the parking area in Keene Valley called the Garden, the
scenery was mostly white under a sky that had brightened, for a
short while, from dark gray to a clear blue.
</P>
<P>
   Making a quick assessment at the trailhead, we determined that
with sturdy boots we could safely tread the route packed down by
dozens of previous hikers. But we stuffed crampons inside our
backpacks in case of icy patches near the peaks, and we strapped
snowshoes on the outsides in case a prediction of a couple of
inches of new snow proved too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us recalled the pleasant surprise last year of walking
in on nearly bare earth and then awakening the next morning to
several inches of powder that built up to 18 inches by the end of
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, ski poles turned out to be our most treasured
equipment as we set out on the Phelps Trail toward our lodging for
the night. The warm weather and earlier rains had transformed
trickling creeks into free-flowing, rushing streams, and the poles
helped with balance in stepping atop rocks that provided only
slippery footholds across the dangerously cold water.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, near the afternoon's destination, the only way to
avoid a good foot-soaking was shimmying across a slick log while
clutching a second, parallel dead tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking in on the cusp of two seasons brought some rewards as
well, though. Slender daggers of ice that had melted and refrozen
at the tips into glasslike bells hung over some of the taller
rocks, interrupting the flow of the newly freed streams.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Wolf Jaw, one of the 46 tallest Adirondack peaks that
would be obscured by full foliage in the spring or summer, appeared
in full view most of the way. And the higher we climbed the gently
graded trail, the heavier the dusting of snow that adorned the
hemlock trees.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly beyond the tricky stream passage, we veered off the main
trail to cross Johns Brook _ thankfully over a bridge this time _
and to enter property owned by the Adirondack Mountain Club.
</P>
<P>
   It was here in the 1920s that the club, which promotes
preservation of the Adirondacks and low-impact recreation in the
park, purchased land and two existing camps from club member Homer
Brown. Some of the earliest snowshoe and ski climbs in the High
Peaks started from this property in the late 1920s, according to
``With Wilderness at Heart,'' a history of the club published for
its 75th anniversary in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Our destination, Grace Camp, originally had been built closer to
the brook and named for Brown's wife. It burned to the ground in
1967, the cause never determined, and was replaced in time for the
1968 summer season, according to the historical account. New
environmental sensibilities prompted the club to move the camp 180
feet farther from Johns Brook in 1991 to its current location. The
one-room camp, which sleeps six, was modernized two years later,
with the interior gutted and renovated to increase floor space and
glass area.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a quarter-mile away on the same property, other
friends were staying at Camp Peggy O'Brien, a larger two-room cabin
that accommodates up to 12 people. This camp replaced the club's
deteriorating decades-old Winter Camp in 1988, and was named for an
active club member who had died a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even more rustic accommodations are available in a nearby
lean-to and state-designated campsite. The thought of being open to
the whims of winter in these settings really builds up appreciation
for the Grace Camp's warmth, the mattresses on the beds, the
propane lights, the indoor clothes line for drying wet clothing,
and, the most deluxe feature, the foam covering for the
otherwise-cold outhouse toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
   (In the spring through fall, the club operates and staffs Johns
Brooks Lodge on the other side of the brook. A night's stay in the
hostel-like accommodations includes a full breakfast; a trail lunch
and family-style dinner are available for an additional fee. Like
Grace Camp and Camp Peggy O'Brien, the lodge is usually booked so
far in advance that it is wise to make reservations in the spring
for the following winter.)
</P>
<P>
   (MORE MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEENE VALLEY, N.Y.: xxx the following winter.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tim, Sandra, Mark and I arrived at Grace Camp before the other
two weekend occupants and knew enough to claim the bottom tiers of
the triple bunk beds. Heat can rise to near-sauna temperatures from
the wood-burning stove, once it gets stoked.
</P>
<P>
   It was only mid-afternoon, so we sat down on the benches at the
rustic wooden kitchen table and dug into our backpacks for
sandwiches and fruit for a late lunch before heading back on the
trail for a short hike while the sunlight lingered. There would be
plenty of time later to settle in and divide up chores: fill a pail
of water from the brook and heat it to a rolling boil on the
propane stovetop to make it potable; store perishable food in the
latched metal storage box on the covered porch that serves as a
refrigerator in the winter; fill the heat stove with some of the
firewood piled in another box on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   Trail signs posted within a mile of the two camps indicate that
several of the Adirondacks' highest summits are less than three
miles away. No wonder many aspiring 46ers, hikers intent on
climbing all of the highest 46 peaks, start their treks from here.
</P>
<P>
   Even the notoriously long walk in and then climb up Mount Marcy
becomes an 11-mile round trip from here, instead of the 17-mile day
trip required when starting out and returning to the Garden parking
area.
</P>
<P>
   With so many choices of trails for the full Saturday ahead, our
larger group of 16 hikers split into two. One decided to venture up
Upper Wolf Jaw, about a three-mile climb, and then, if stamina
permitted, continue on for another mile to Armstrong. My hiking
buddy, Tim, and I joined the other group led by an aspiring winter
46er, who wanted to add the 4,827-foot Basin to the list of peaks
scaled during the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Several in that group already had been to that summit at least
once, so they were anxious for some variety. They devised a route
that started out on a maintained trail over a suspension bridge
then veered off to begin the increasingly steeper climb up Chicken
Coop Brook before rejoining the trail again for the steepest ascent
to the peak.
</P>
<P>
   Those who had brought along maps and compasses _ and knew how to
use them _ became our guides, since low-level clouds obscured any
nearby peaks that might have provided other hints on direction.
</P>
<P>
   The previous year, some of us had snowshoed up neighboring
Saddleback in several inches of powder, working hard to break trail
on the way up and then sliding on our feet, as if with skis, on the
steepest parts of the descent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the deep holes in the snow around the trees indicated
that a few feet of snow remained on the ground. But a series of
melting and re-freezing had packed down the snow enough for easy
treading with hiking boots, leaving enough snow to cover the fallen
branches and roots that could trip an unwary hiker in other
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery along the way featured ice in all of its beautiful
and treacherous forms: a thick, solid layer of chunks of frozen
snow built up behind a tree that had fallen across Johns Brook;
blue, glazed ice coating the trail near the peak; and a
greenish-hued frozen cascade tumbling over a tall rock face.
</P>
<P>
   The weather noticeably changed as we gained elevation and left
behind the shelter of tall evergreens. Crampons, sharp spikes
strapped onto the soles of boots, came out of day packs to dig
footholds into crustier snow and ice. Outer parkas were zipped up
as shields against the windy, damp air at the top, which was
enshrouded in a cloud. The mist blocked the views of Marcy and
Haystack accessible on clearer days, which was just as well since
the gray veil also prevented truly seeing how far the drop-offs
were beyond the ice patches I cautiously crawled over.
</P>
<P>
   Ever eager for adventure, my hiking companions chose to try yet
another route off the mountain, along Basin Brook, and then to
bushwhack alongside the opposite side of Johns Brook from the
established trail. This latter part of the trek brought the
discovery of an abandoned cabin not far from the camps yet far
enough from any regular route to remain hidden from most hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Our adventures were pretty well concluded, with just the hike
back to the cars left for Sunday morning. Light snow that had
fallen throughout the late afternoon and early evening turned to
freezing rain and wet snow by the time we set out. The streams were
still high, but we knew now where to cross the trickier sections;
the trail was turning mushy, disappointing the skiers passing us on
their way in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the snowshoes had remained strapped to packs throughout
the trip. But we had been prepared for anything late winter in the
Adirondacks was ready to deliver.

&HT;     PASSES MAKE RAIL TRAVEL IN EUROPE EASY AS A WHISTLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ The Yellow Submarine stands at the ready at Waterloo
Station, all set to whisk passengers through the Chunnel to Europe.
No underwater skills necessary _ this is the Eurostar train.
</P>
<P>
   This train just happens to be painted up to promote the
re-release of the Beatles' feature-length cartoon ``Yellow
Submarine.'' Here are Blue Meanies alongside the Fab Four of John,
Paul, George and Ringo. Inside, the plush seats of first class give
no indication that this is anything but a great way to travel in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Security is as tight here as it is for an international airport
departure. Within 30 minutes of settling in, though, we are on our
way to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Busy executives break the silence of the train on cell phones,
talking business and personal lives. Tea and coffee are served by
smiling attendants. Then there is breakfast, a choice of hot or
cold. There are wide seats, a handy table that is roomy enough for
a briefcase full of work or a meal tray, and scenic Britain just
outside the window.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 20 minutes to travel the 32 miles of the Chunnel,
under the English Channel, just enough time to polish off the hot
breakfast served by the train attendant. Maximum speed is 186 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging in France, the weather is overcast, but the sun breaks
through as the morning wears on and we make a stop at Lille.
</P>
<P>
   Eurostar trans-Channel travel began in November 1994, and
reports indicate that more than 900,000 North American passengers
have used these fast and convenient trains between London, Paris
and Brussels. In 1999, more than 200,000 Americans took the train.
</P>
<P>
   For this group of railroading travel writers, Brussels is merely
a stop for lunch; then it is back on the train for the 90-minute
trip to Paris. Popping out of the train station like gophers, we
are herded a few blocks away to a restaurant, then back to catch
the 3:40 train to Paris-Nord.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably how international business is conducted between
Belgium and France: a quick dash to the neighboring country for a
meeting, lunch and back on the train. You're home in time for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than 60 percent of passengers on the Thalys (a
made-up word for the rail system) are leisure travelers, according
to Michel Jadot, a spokesman for the European rail line. Thalys is
a service of Belgian, French, German and Dutch rails to facilitate
travel in Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thalys is moving south, east and west,'' Jadot said. Special
trains serve Disneyland Paris and ski regions in Europe. Regular
runs include Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp in the Netherlands;
and Koln and Dusseldorf, Germany; and between Brussels and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The five-hour trip from Brussels to Frankfurt is expected to be
cut in half by 2002 with the addition of new dedicated lines. The
privately owned rail line aims to serve 12 million passengers by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   Cee Cee Drummond works for the New York office of Rail Europe.
On this cross-continent trip, she is showing more than telling
about the trains and the countries that Rail Europe serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clients that we have today do so much research for the
trip,'' Drummond said during a ride on the high-speed train from
Paris to Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers consult friends, the Internet and guidebooks before
booking trips to Europe, Drummond said. ``We do about 85 percent of
our business through travel agents,'' she said of the $230 million
generated by Rail Europe sales.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Rail Europe customer is not a first-time visitor to
Europe, Drummond said. He or she is a repeat traveler, 45 to 55
years old, college educated, who may have seen Europe from a motor
coach tour a few years before. This time out, the traveler plans to
see two to three European countries.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the booming youth market made up of backpackers
who hop the trains for summer travel after college. Drummond said
that the Eurail Flexipass is the most popular, allowing unlimited
first-class travel in 17 countries for either 10 days or 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   My six-day Europass, for example, cost $368 and allows travel in
France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Travel in Britain is
not covered with under Europass, but rather with the separate
BritRail passes. Rail passes must be purchased in the United States
before the traveler leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Rail passes provide unlimited rail trips for the number of
travel days indicated on the pass. Supplements, necessary to ride
the Premier trains, are covered or discounted with the rail passes.
</P>
<P>
   Seat reservations are also required for Premier trains such as
the Eurostar, French TGV, Italy's Cisalpino and Artesia (between
France and Italy). ``If you've paid for a supplement on a train,
that includes your seat reservation and there are no additional
fees required,'' Drummond said.
</P>
<P>
   While riding the rails no longer has the romantic allure shown
in old movies, Europe's rail comes pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   For Rose and Richard Huber of San Jose, Calif., a 21-day rail
pass from Eurail is just the ticket. We met on the deck of the
Compagnie Generale de Navigation steamer on Lake Geneva for a
cruise to Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Both Eurail and Swissrail passes are valid on CGN boats. The
Hubers, who own an electronics business, were return visitors to
Europe _ some 30 years after their first visit. This time, they had
flown into Munich, Germany, and were taking trains across Western
Europe on a 21-day pass. The plan was to end the trip at
Oktoberfest.
</P>
<P>
   Like walking ads for a European vacation, the Hubers said they
rented a car on a 1968 European vacation. A few years later, Mrs.
Huber joined an escorted bus tour with a friend. Ten years ago, the
Hubers made a train trip.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with rail passes in hand, the Hubers were crossing borders,
taking city tours and traveling with no particular itinerary in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the freedom of Eurail,'' Mrs. Huber said, taking in
the bright, blue sky on the deck of the Swiss steamship. ``The
trains are all clean and beautiful.'' And they hadn't even sampled
the Premier trains.

<HEADLINE>
TIME TO DO SOME YELLING ABOUT THE `QUIET PERIOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was going to be a darned interesting story about a
start-up's fund-raising experience. We did the interviews. We got
all the juicy details on its next-generation TV services, its
money, and its financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the chief executive talked to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He called back and said he shouldn't have spoken to us because
(gasp) his company is in the dread and oh-so-mysterious ``quiet
period.'' If we wrote the story, he claimed, he'd be in trouble
with the feds. Worse, if a story appeared where he seemed to be
touting his IPO _ which is slated to happen not this month, but
``sometime this year'' _ it might derail his stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   We'll still write that story, of course. But the incident
brought to a head the frustrating mythology of so-called quiet
periods, which are being overused in this heyday of high-tech stock
offerings, nervous chief executives, and overly zealous lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the facts. First, there is absolutely no rule in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's books about quiet periods. In
fact, no such words show up anywhere in securities law.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to quiet periods, observes Stuart Cable, a partner
at Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar in Boston, ``Much of what you're dealing
with is lore, rather than law.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. All of the rules related to the quiet period have
been written by lawyers, who are paid worrywarts. They all agree on
one central rule: that companies should clam up as soon as they
agree with their investment bankers to do an initial public stock
offering. The period lasts from then until the day their stock
starts trading, which is usually around 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. The point is _ and always has been _ that
companies should not be talking up their stock, or priming the
market, in advance of an offering. That means they shouldn't be
seeking press, urging their buddies to invest, making forecasts
that aren't in the IPO papers, or suddenly doubling their
advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   It does not mean they should fail to respond to routine
questions about their operations, executives, and prospects during
that time. Nor does it mean that every corporate maneuver,
investment, or buyout thereafter begets a quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   Two wildly successful local companies, Akamai Technologies Inc.
and Sycamore Networks Inc., recently declined to talk to the Globe,
citing quiet periods. Sycamore was doing a secondary stock
offering, Akamai wrapping up a previously announced acquisition
(which was not the subject of the story).
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these are great reasons to shut off the flow of
information. Lawyers say a secondary offering requires less
solemnity than the IPO. An acquisition shouldn't spark a quiet
period, they say, unless the company's finances will be
significantly impacted by the event.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lynnette Fallon, a partner at Palmer &AMP; Dodge in Boston:
``There's no quiet period that gets triggered by an acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon says companies are under gag orders simply because some
lawyers and executives are very conservative. They'd rather say
nothing than risk trouble. They're all fearful after the mistakes
of Webvan Group Inc., a Silicon Valley online grocery start-up,
which gave interviews to Forbes Magazine and to TheStreet.com
before its IPO last year. The SEC stepped in, in that case, and
called for a ``cooling-off period,'' delaying the IPO for one
month.
</P>
<P>
   Says Fallon: ``There's a lot of market fear. No one wants to be
the one that gets delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   But once a company is public _ like highfliers Akamai and
Sycamore _ there are far fewer excuses not to answer the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Cable tells his clients that ``normal corporate news,''
unrelated to a stock sale, is ``natural, desirable, and entirely
consistent with the objective of disclosure to the public which
underlies the federal securities laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the SEC itself pushes for maximum disclosure to average
investors. The regulators have been pushing companies to stop
giving details to Wall Street analysts that they won't give to the
public, or to reporters who are writing to inform the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Unless a company's a few months from going public,
the quiet-period excuse is pure fiction. Why should the growing
ranks of ``insiders'' _ company executives and their families, the
lawyers, venture capitals, and Wall Streeters _ hoard information
that ordinary investors should have, too?
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't. And it's time they grow up and act like the real
companies they profess to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT'S A 'QUIET PERIOD'? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A ``quiet period'' is not required by law but is based on
lawyers' recommendations. It starts the day a company agrees with
its underwriters to go public and ends the day the company's stock
starts trading _ typically about 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   During the quiet period, lawyers tell clients:
</P>
<P>
   --Don't suddenly increase your advertising plans.
</P>
<P>
   --Put one person in charge of all information that goes out of
the company in response to questions.
</P>
<P>
   --No employee, officer, or director should encourage anyone to
buy the stock.
</P>
<P>
   --No employee, officer, or director should divulge forecasts or
other company information not in the IPO prospectus to people
outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   --Respond to legitimate inquiries for facts on the firm's
financial condition and business operations.

HIGH-FLIERS SHARE THE WEALTH WITH THEIR OLD SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ In this enclave of fabulous wealth sits a
public school that works hard to blend in with its unassuming
surroundings, lest it betray its high-profile benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which runs from kindergarten through eighth grade,
counts among its friends Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle
Corp. and unofficial Silicon Valley playboy; L. John Doerr, the
uber-venture capitalist who has funded Amazon.com and Netscape;
and, Scott Cook, cofounder of Intuit Inc.
</P>
<P>
   All like to give generously to the school's multimillion-dollar
foundation through an annual auction that has come to symbolize the
power of new money. At last year's auction, described in caustic
and hilarious detail in David Kaplan's recently published book
``The Silicon Boys,'' Ellison offered a week in the French Riviera
on his 192-foot yacht, complete with an 11-person crew. The outing
went for $125,000, thrusting the total amount raised to $439,000
(of which $99,000 went to pay for the auction itself).
</P>
<P>
   The winning bid was lobbed by Bruce Thompson, superintendent of
the Woodside School District. Thompson, it turns out, was bidding
on behalf of a Woodside resident rumored to be J. Taylor Crandall,
financial adviser to the Bass family.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson discreetly declined to confirm the rumor but gracefully
agreed to give a tour of his 580-student school. The tour begins in
a kindergarten classroom decked out in tiny blue chairs and red
Play-Doh. Thompson explained that the school gets about $4,400 in
state funding for each pupil, but the Woodside School Foundation
kicks in another $3,000 per student.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be very ordinary if it weren't for our parents,''
said Thompson, a slender mustachioed man whom students greet as
``Mr. T.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out the various extras afforded by the foundation.
There are two full-time reading specialists, a full-time librarian,
a dedicated art teacher, and a half-time math specialist who,
Thompson carefully notes, has a doctorate in mathematics. Their
salaries are paid primarily from earmarked foundation dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These poor teachers. I don't know how they can continue to
live here,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 40 teachers at Woodside live in the town,
where the average home sale price was $1,592,625 in February,
according to the San Mateo County Association of Realtors. Teacher
salaries average only $32,000, Thompson noted. He does not explain
how teachers feel about a seventh-grade math assignment in which
students are asked to spend $1 million imaginary dollars and
display the results on a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   The tour continues to the school's science center, a building
that came about entirely from two $500,000 donations. The
classrooms have views of a idyllic green lawn surrounded by tall
native oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation is occasionally interrupted by the din of
construction crews working on a $12 million project that will add a
gym and six new classrooms. About half of the bill will be footed
by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to make his school appear as normal as possible,
Thompson mentions that many public schools in California now have
foundations, including those in neighboring Portola Valley,
Hillsborough, Atherton, and Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, public school foundations are ubiquitous in California,
said Michael Kirst, professor of education at Stanford University.
But the average amount of voluntary contributions is about $100 per
student, making Woodside's foundation a statistical ``outlier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodside is a very unusual community,'' Kirst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't exist on state dollars,'' Thompson said. He
explained that Proposition 13, the state's 1978 initiative that
limited property taxes to 1 percent of the property's value, put a
severe crimp on the amount of money spent on public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's insta-wealth has changed this horsey, old-money
community, said Thompson, who has been at Woodside School for 15
years and is retiring later this year to teach at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality of Silicon Valley is that everything has to be
done yesterday,'' said Thompson, who has taken to reading Fortune
and Business Week magazines to better understand his student's
parents. ``That does come into the school. The kids are so highly
programmed that they practically need a Palm Pilot to figure out
where they need to go next. More is better. And the parents are
always negotiating with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The school tries to tone down the Valley's hypercompetitive
culture by requiring that each student perform at least 30 hours of
community service between their sixth and eighth grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to teach them to give from the heart,'' Thompson said.
``Many of them will be our future philantropists.''

IS BOSTON A CITY OF NEGATIVITY? 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Perhaps this cradle of culture has become a bastion of
bashing. Maybe this city that prides itself on higher education and
high-tech is guilty of a less-savory reputation for low blows.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the hypothesis has assumed at least some renewed
relevance since Celtics coach Rick Pitino put Boston on notice _
and on the psychiatrist's couch _ with his harangue March 1
following a 104-102 loss to the Toronto Raptors at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Despondent that the slumping Celtics had been beaten on Vince
Carter's implausible last-second 3-pointer and infuriated that he
had been subjected to jeers for his team and cheers for the
opposition in his own building, Pitino chastised the city, his most
volatile charge being, ``All this negativity that's in this town
sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   More remarkably, Pitino _ who changes opinions the way some
people do TV channels _ did not retreat from his stance. He
insisted the following day, ``I have no problem with anything I
said, not even this minuscule amount.'' He closed his right thumb
and forefinger for illustration and added, ``Everything I said was
the gospel truth according to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it the gospel truth, period?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Pitino's comments are grist for
self-examination _ even self-guilt, a cherished Boston tradition.
Is this city a citadel of cynicism? Is it any more demanding, or
insufferable, than other metropolitan playpens celebrated for their
passion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a tough town?'' said University of Connecticut and
former Northeastern basketball coach Jim Calhoun. ``Yeah, it's a
tough town. It's a very judgmental town because they love their
teams. And when you have love, there are two parts _ the other part
is hate. The one thing you have to do in Boston is succeed. And if
you do, they'll put you on top of the Pru.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't, just hope they don't expect you to jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense in Boston that it's almost something to take
pride in to be nasty,'' said Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who
believes the city has a lot in common with other places in that
regard.
</P>
<P>
   The hectic lifestyle is not conducive to patience; it's tough to
make the mortgage, it's a challenge just to get from here to there,
and by the time harried patrons reach the game, they almost demand
instant gratification as a salve for daily life's indignities.
Anything less is considered a personal affront. That intolerance
has been stoked by the droughts of the local franchises: The
Celtics haven't won a world championship since 1986, the Bruins
since 1972, the Red Sox since 1918, the Patriots since the dawn of
time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, failure seems to have become almost a medallion of
public pride; mass masochism is the prevailing sentiment even on
those occasions when a World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals, or
Stanley Cup Finals becomes Boston's destination. Of a far more
disturbing nature, the city long had a reputation for being
inhospitable toward minority athletes. Although the climate is said
to be improving, the hangover lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Sports reportage sometimes can be mistaken for war
correspondence. With the proliferation, if not saturation, of media
outlets and the resulting competition, controversy can become the
coin of the realm. But for all that attention, Boston is a
metropolis that sometimes seems to exalt small-town priorities. A
case in point is the professional franchises' struggles for
upgraded facilities, which, in this arena of political football,
often get treated like local zoning board debates over installing a
fire hydrant at the street corner. The Red Sox are still playing in
Fenway Park, amid the ghosts _ and some of the dirt _ from its 1912
construction. In their efforts to replace it with a more
commercially viable replica, they must tiptpoe through a minefield
of environmentalists and antiquarians, among others. Patriots owner
Bob Kraft's campaign for an urban stadium was summarily rebuffed,
and the intransigence of Massachusetts Speaker of the House Thomas
Finneran almost chased Kraft to Hartford before a compromise was
forged to keep the team in Foxborough. The Bruins and Celtics were
consigned to the cobwebs of Boston Garden for some three extra
decades before their pleas for better accommodations were answered.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's just plain meanness, as evidenced at the
FleetCenter Wednesday during the McDonald's All American High
School Basketball Game. Some among the crowd of 18,264 took the
opportunity afforded by the presence of 7-foot-6-inch Neil
Fingleton of Holy Name in Worcester _ a native of England and a
relative newcomer to the sport _ to chant, ``This isn't a circus,''
and ``Freak.'' When Fingleton missed a dunk, he was booed
mercilessly, prompting Celtics forward Paul Pierce to echo his
coach's comments of four weeks before: ``The fans of Boston are
terrible. They booed the kid from Boston _ he's only 16.''
</P>
<P>
   So how bad are things? Is this indeed a town without pity? Or,
in the final analysis, is it worth the aggravation? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Location, location, location &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the cursed, eclectic weather. Or the relentless
congestion of the megalopolis from Boston to New York to
Philadelphia. Or the unforgiving economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, they worry about holding the door open for the
next person as opposed to slamming it in someone's face to get a
better spot in line. On the West Coast, the major concerns seem to
be what sunblock to use and when the surf will be up.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the Northeast. Generally, there is no escape. So the game
becomes the surrogate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East is tougher,'' said Celtics guard Kenny Anderson, who
also has played in New Jersey, Portland, and Charlotte. ``It's
tougher to make a living. You've worked (hard) all day, it's a
hassle getting to the games, maybe there's a crisis at home . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``There's more a sense of urgency,'' said former
Rangers and Bruins defenseman Brad Park. ``People here have less
patience. It's `I want to be entertained and I want to be
entertained now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With no excuses accepted. ``East Coast fans,'' said John
Davidson, an analyst on Rangers telecasts for MSG and an NHL
commentator for ABC, ``are not good at hiding their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson remembers experiencing culture shock during his
goaltending days when he was dealt from pardon-me St. Louis to the
crucible of New York in 1975. During warmups before his first
exhibition game, Davidson was besieged with vile expletives by a
customer behind his net. His curiosity could endure only so much.
He turned to identify this roughneck who had taken such an instant
disliking to him. ``It was a woman,'' said Davidson with a laugh.
``About 40. I thought, `Oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?'
''
</P>
<P>
   He'd gotten himself into the cacophonous corridor of the
Northeast, the Boston-New-York-Philadelphia axis.
</P>
<P>
   Boston isn't necessarily as loud as its bigger brethren, but it
has a distinctive, intimidating voice nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Sox reliever Dick Radatz considers it ``the greatest
place to play if you win and the toughest if you lose. It's like a
way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz has seen that life from both sides. During four years as
the American League's premier reliever, he was a veritable oasis on
some dreadful Sox teams, a civic icon. As a rookie in 1962, Radatz
didn't allow a run in his first 20-plus innings. Then he was
brought into a bases-loaded, two-out jam in a Fenway tie against
the Yankees. Bill Skowron managed to get his bat on one of The
Monster's fastballs, mustering a feeble dribbler that found its way
through the infield, scoring the tying and winning runs. As he left
the mound, a stunned Radatz was booed. When he arrived, shaken, in
the dugout, third baseman Frank Malzone turned to him and said,
``Tough town, huh, kid?''
</P>
<P>
   Tough because, as ex-Patriot quarterback Steve Grogan observes,
the constituents ``can get a little impatient when things are not
going well, more than anyplace else.'' So much so that, he said,
``I've seen it drive some guys out of town before their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Sox general manager Lou Gorman, now executive
consultant for public affairs with the team, thinks that's because
the complaints often cross the line into foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many players resented it when it got personal,'' said Gorman.
``(Their feeling was), `If I strike out four times, criticize me.
But don't call me names.' ''

UNHERALDED LEFTY MOYER IS NO. 1 IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There's always been a thin line between a crafty
veteran and a No. 1 starter. After 11 years pitching for six teams,
Seattle's Jamie Moyer has learned to feel comfortable in both
roles.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, Moyer is an Opening Day
starter. Tuesday night, at Safeco Field, he'll oppose two-time Cy
Young Award winner Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox. It may sound
like a mismatch, but the Sox know better. Moyer has a 52-24 record
since July 1996, when he was traded to Boston for outfielder Darren
Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   If you recall, Moyer isn't one of those guys who tries to
overpower hitters. He will change speeds, throw sinkers, and use
anything else he can think of to befuddle batters.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer was 2-0 with a 1.80 ERA against Boston last year.
Lifetime, he is 5-3 against the Sox in 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners opened Safeco Field last July, Moyer was the
starting pitcher but not the loser in a 3-2 setback against San
Diego. He didn't hesitate when asked to pitch this year's opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a big honor just to have the opportunity,'' said
Moyer. ``Especially since the last time I pitched an opener was
back in the eighth grade. I plan to go out and pitch and have fun
with it. But at the same time be competitive and give it my all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me a long time to learn my craft. Why? I don't
know. Gaining confidence is a big thing. People having confidence
in you is a big thing, too. Over a period of time I learned a lot
and I matured a lot as a pitcher and a person. Since coming over
here, it's all come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer first made it to the majors with the Cubs in 1986. After
three seasons, he moved on to Texas, then St. Louis, Baltimore,
Boston, and Seattle. His overall record as both a starter and
reliever is 118-101.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer developed his unique style through trial and error.
Control is the key. Last year, he walked two or fewer batters in 29
of 32 starts. He averaged 1.9 walks per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer's education started at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up in the Cubs organization, people had faith in me,
but I couldn't put up the numbers,'' said Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   Then he pitched in the heat of Texas and St. Louis before moving
on to homer havens in Baltimore, Boston, and Seattle. Instead of
wearing down, he became one of baseball's best pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   His winning percentage since 1996 (70.2) is bettered only by
Martinez (71.3).
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said his experiences at Fenway and the recently demolished
Kingdome forced him to make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Fenway, you ideally like them to hit to center field or
right field,'' he said. ``Everybody likes to hit for the Wall. But
I quickly learned that in my style of pitching, I had to keep the
ball on the ground and try to utilize my defense. It was the same
way when I went to the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to make adjustments. In the Kingdome, the ball
seemed to carry better to right in the power alley. The solution
was the same even though it was turf. Keep the ball down and stay
away from the big inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they call Safeco a pitcher's park. I don't know about
that. We haven't even played a whole year here. Everything I know
is on last year's games. I will say if a ball is hit well, the
batter will be rewarded. But there are no cheap home runs here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella says there was never a doubt in
his mind about his Opening Day starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good group of young men,'' said Piniella. ``They're
professional. They work hard. The attitude and the chemistry have
been good. ``He's just the best we have.''

WHEN SPORTS, LAW MEET, PROSECUTORS MUST WALK A FINE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nola Foulson is probably the only person ever to read Red Sox
slugger Ted Williams's book ``The Science of Hitting'' for its
legal insights.
</P>
<P>
   Foulson, the district attorney for Sedgwick County, Kansas, also
spent scores of hours last fall watching ESPN and CNN-Sports
Illustrated into the early morning, and not because she
particularly likes baseball, or any other sport for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I would just as soon watch grass grow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like other prosecutors across North America, Foulson
was struggling with the hazy boundary separating rule-breaking from
lawbreaking in contact sports, a debate that has raged anew since
Boston Bruin Marty McSorley was charged with assault in Canada last
month for smashing another player in the head with his hockey
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically at least, prosecutors have broad power and
discretion to bring criminal charges against violent sports
conduct. Even a hard cross-check in hockey or a beanball in
baseball could be interpreted as an assault under the laws of
Canada and most of the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet legal experts say prosecutors who must play referee often
find themselves making judgment calls without a rulebook. Athletes,
meanwhile, are given little or no guidance about what separates
conduct that could land them in the showers from conduct that could
land them in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly can be a very dangerous situation,'' said
attorney Randy Chapman, former chairman of the Massachusetts Bar
Association's Criminal Justice Section. ``Prosecutors have broad
discretion. That's the slippery slope everyone is concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Foulson's case, she had to decide last spring whether to
bring charges against Wichita State University pitcher Ben
Christensen, who it appeared had intentionally thrown a pitch at an
opponent during warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing player, Anthony Molina of Evansville University,
recently filed a $150,000 civil lawsuit alleging that he suffered
facial fractures, retinal damage, and permanent vision impairment
when the ball struck him in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Foulson found that a ``brushback'' pitch _ even
between innings, thrown at a batter who might be improperly
``timing'' warm-up pitches _ was essentially part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In her six-page report explaining why Christensen wasn't charged
criminally, she quoted no less an authority than Williams, who
wrote in his book that major league pitchers would sometimes brush
him back if he got too close to the plate during warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Foulson found that ``brushback'' pitches were tolerated under
NCAA rules and that Christensen did not intend to hit Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Foulson said she probably would have brought charges against
McSorley, which illustrates just how fine a line prosecutors walk
when sports and law intersect.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning moments of the Bruins' Feb. 21 game against the
Vancouver Canucks, McSorley hit Canucks winger Donald Brashear in
the head with his stick, sending Brashear crashing backward, his
head striking the ice. Brashear suffered a Grade 3 concussion, the
most severe kind.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, who said he meant to hit Brashear in the upper arm and
provoke a fight, was suspended for the last 23 games of the season
and lost $72,000 in salary. Because he is 36 and nearing the end of
his career, it's likely McSorley may never play in the NHL again.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors in British Columbia brought assault charges
against McSorley, however, many cried foul, including the NHL's
chief legal officer, Bruins president and general manager Harry
Sinden, and McSorley's defense lawyer, Paul Kelly, of the Boston
firm of Foley Hoag &AMP; Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement should never have been involved in this
case,'' said Kelly, a former longtime federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But equally vocal was a chorus of politicians, judges, and
prosecutors in Canada and the United States, including Suffolk
(Mass.) County District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II, who said he
``probably'' would have charged McSorley if the incident had been
at the FleetCenter in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers, the debate over the McSorley case points up
just how unevenly prosecutions are brought for conduct that occurs
during sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for instance, was McSorley prosecuted and not Christensen?
Just as the NCAA tolerates inside pitching, Kelly said, the NHL has
long tolerated fighting and tough-guy ``enforcer'' players like
McSorley and Brashear, who had fought earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer Mike Tyson, who unlike McSorley had a criminal record, was
not prosecuted for biting off part of Evander Holyfield's ear
during their 1997 heavyweight championship fight.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Limon, a high school basketball player in San Antonio,
was sentenced to five years in state prison for breaking an
opponent's nose with an elbow last year, and a 15-year-old Chicago
boy is facing charges of aggravated battery for a hit from behind
he made during a high school hockey game that left another player
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors such as Las Vegas District Attorney Stuart Bell,
whose office declined to prosecute Tyson, say a myriad of factors
go into a decision whether to prosecute, including how much
professional players implicitly ``consent'' to rough conduct in
their particular sport; whether the victimized player is willing to
press charges; and whether there is another forum for punishment,
such as a league or government agency.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Las Vegas police declined to charge Tyson criminally,
Bell said, was that the Nevada Athletic Commission was already
conducting its own probe.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous attempts by both federal and state lawmakers to
regulate sports violence have failed over the past 20 years. Kelly
said the lack of clear legal standards for prosecutors or police to
follow confuses players and allows outside factors such as
community pressure to dictate decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said his own research in the McSorley case has shown that
most prosecutions have been brought against visiting players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you should leave it solely in the hands of
judges and ambitious prosecutors,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Canada, known as ``crown attorneys,'' have even
more power than their US counterparts, said prominent Ontario
defense lawyer Richard J. Bosada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crown attorneys have a tendency to respond to community
views,'' Bosada said. ``That's the unfairness of it. The crown
attorney's personality is often a factor, and community feeling is
a factor, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal researchers say a much larger percentage of prosecutions
for on-field behavior take place in Canada _ where baseball player
Dave Winfield was arrested and charged with cruelty to animals when
his warm-up throw killed a seagull in Toronto in 1983. The charge
was dropped the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there have been numerous criminal cases brought
against NHL players, including several Bruins, but none has been
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   One NHL player, Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli, did plead guilty to
assault charges in 1988 and was sentenced to one day in jail.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, McSorley would be the first player ever found
guilty by a jury of assault.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have called the McSorley prosecution an
important ``message'' to younger players in an era where sports
violence appears to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one NHL player, the New Jersey Devils' Scott
Niedermayer, doesn't appear to be listening.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the NHL suspended Niedermayer for 10 games _ worth
more than $150,000 in salary _ for a two-handed chop with his stick
to the top of the helmet of Florida Panthers forward Peter Worrell
during a game. Worrell was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the game at home when it happened,'' said
Bergen County District Attorney William H. Schmidt. ``Certainly it
crossed the pale as conduct that warranted some action by the NHL.
But it did not rise for us to . . . an indictable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL needs to and should police their own sport. In most
instances, law enforcement authorities should not be involved.''

 A PAINTING IN THE BANK  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Vt. _ It hangs in a nondescript spot behind the
tellers' desk, with no plaque, no label, no fanfare. If you didn't
crane your neck, you might not even notice it _ let alone realize
that this painting of a tree, hanging in a bank, is worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But try to take the Maxfield Parrish painting from this little
branch office and _ as one art gallery discovered last winter _
you'll face the wrath of a town.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the affection Windsor's 4,000 residents hold for the
early 20th-century illustrator. And such is their determination to
keep the painting, even if they have to fight the waves of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Famous in his own time, when his whimsical figures and classical
scenes graced magazine covers, Parrish's pricey originals now hang
in posh hotels and movie stars' homes. But nowhere is he better
loved than in Windsor, where he's seen as a link to a cherished
past.
</P>
<P>
   From the height of his career to his death in 1966, Parrish
lived in an artists' colony in the woodsy hills of Plainfield, N.H.
But he conducted his business in Windsor, a small town of brick and
Colonial homes just across the Connecticut River, in the shadow of
Mt. Ascutney.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time he spent there, only one true artifact remains:
the landscape painting he gave employees of the Windsor County
National Bank in the early 1950s. He wanted to thank them for the
help they gave him, month after month, balancing his accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a clear-cut gesture of gratitude at the time, but
then, it was a simpler time. When Parrish gave the painting to
``the girls'' at the bank, Windsor County National was locally
owned and had just two branches. In 1967, it was bought by Vermont
National Bank, which itself was recently taken over by the larger
Burlington-based Chittenden National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of big mergers and financial conglomerates, the
painting on the wall has become the subject of new debate. And the
question of who owns it _ a succession of banks, or of people _
remains, to Windsor's residents, disturbingly unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Chittenden's president, Paul Perrault, is doing his best to
reassure them. He pledged last week that ``that painting is going
to stay right there in that office.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the more delicate question of ownership,
Perrault won't be pinned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a question that needs an answer,'' he said.
``Does it have to have an owner?''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the state of affairs last week, when the latest bank
merger turned official and complete. To a small town, this was a
big deal: accounts were switched, new checkbooks were distributed,
Vermont National Bank signs came down, Chittenden signs went up.
</P>
<P>
   And a group of aging residents known as The Trust, afraid for
the painting's future, held a closed-door meeting with their
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Trust, which claims ownership of the Parrish painting and
seeks to keep it in Windsor, is composed of 11 former bank
employees, most of them now retired, many of them old enough to
remember when Parrish himself came into the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Those were golden years in Windsor, a West Vermont town whose
legacy outweighs its size. In the 18th century, the Vermont
Constitution was signed here. In the 19th, a new wave of industrial
production was born in Windsor factories. And in the 20th, Windsor
was a commercial capital for an artists' and writers' community,
the famous Cornish Colony founded in New Hampshire by sculptor
Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire may have had the landscape they loved, but Vermont
had the commerce. So artists would regularly cross the local
covered bridge, beneath a sign that still warns, ``Walk Your Horses
Or Pay Two Dollars Fine,'' and go to Windsor's post office, stores,
and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything in small-town life, banking back then was a
social event, said Wesley Hrydziusko, a teller at Windsor County
National Bank in the late 1950s. ``Even if people didn't have any
bank business, they'd just stop in and chew the fat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But of all of the bank's favored customers, Parrish was among
the most beloved, Hrydziusko said. When employees saw his Cadillac
roll slowly up the street and pull up at the post office _ as it
did every six weeks or so _ they knew they were due for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute he showed in the doorway, he was greeted all over
the place,'' Hrydziusko said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish wore neat, dapper clothes and had a shock of white hair,
Hrydrziusko said. And he always told a stream of jokes, and carried
a stack of checks. Bank officials would escort him into the
cashier's office as workers settled his accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, to thank them for their help, Parrish gave
the employees a painting, titled ``New Hampshire: Thy Beloved
Hills.'' The image had been commissioned as a poster to promote New
Hampshire tourism, said John Dryfhout, chief curator at the
Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site in Cornish. But the original
painting was Parrish's to sell or give away. And it had the
trademark Parrish qualities: an ethereal, luminous glow, and the
electric-blue color the artist had copyrighted as ``Parrish blue.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the painting hung prominently behind the tellers'
desk. When Vermont National took over and built a new branch office
down the road _ a neoclassical sort of structure, with thin columns
and a portico out front _ the painting was placed in a similar
spot.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank eventually moved it to a side wall, to make room
for a promotional display. The bank was trying to standardize its
look, one former employee said, and the painting didn't fit the
motif.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was there, and Windsor's residents were satisfied.
Over the years, the painting has become part of the local
landscape, said Pam Sullivan, 55, who works in a store that sells
Parrish's artwork on tote bags, night lights, and soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have been there a long time just see it as
part of the bank,'' she said. ``It's just been there. It would be
like moving the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the painting has been a constant even as Windsor has
changed _ as factories closed, businesses left, and commerce
started moving in the other direction, from Vermont to New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But of late, Windsor has been trying to revive itself, with a
new crop of artisans, museums, and promotions. And it still has
civic pride _ a lot of it _ as residents proved in February 1999,
when the Parrish painting almost disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor Police Lieutenant Vincent Jordan remembers the morning
well; it was 7 a.m., toward the end of his night shift, when he got
the frantic call. It was a former bank employee, who had been
tipped off by a current one: Vermont National planned to sell the
painting, for $150,000, to the Currier Gallery of Art in
Manchester, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery had asked if the bank would sponsor an exhibit of
Parrish's work, said gallery spokesman David Juvet. The bank had
declined, Juvet said, but had offered to sell the painting instead.
The gallery arranged to pick it up on a Tuesday morning, Jordan
said, before the bank opened, at 8 a.m..
</P>
<P>
   But employees, past and present, didn't think it was the bank's
to sell. And they had what they considered proof: a letter from
Parrish's son, Maxfield Parrish Jr., which seemed to state the
artist's intent.
</P>
<P>
   Bank employees, the son wrote, ``made a visit by dad to the bank
a social occasion instead of a necessary chore. He appreciated it,
hence the presence there of this painting in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rushed to the bank and told gallery officials that the
painting's ownership was under dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, quite frankly, I really couldn't let the painting
leave the town,'' he said. ``I negotiated a stoppage of action.
Either that, or I take it back, and we hang it in the police
station.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank and gallery backed down, and the painting stayed. But
for weeks afterward, the town was in a tizzy. People threatened
lawsuits and boycotts. Bank officials issued an apology. And a
cadre of former employees banded together, hired a lawyer, and
formed the Trust _ filing legal documents asserting their ownership
claim.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since, the Trust and the bank have shared a cordial
detente. But, as many townspeople are quick to point out, the bank
has never given up its ownership claim. The matter has never been
litigated or settled, said Jonathan Springer, the Trust's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   And many residents say they're always ready for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll guard it with our lives,'' said Barbara Rhoad, 60, a
lifelong Windsor resident who remembers Parrish from her childhood
days. ``We're not a money-type people. That isn't important. It's a
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Trust's latest fit of consternation was overblown,
Springer insists; it stemmed from confusion about the Chittenden
merger.
</P>
<P>
   And Perrault, the bank president, said that while he intends to
get the painting ``spiffed up,'' he also plans to keep it where it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we don't need to have a big,
drawn-out battle about who owns it,'' Perrault said. ``I think
everyone's in agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but townspeople still don't feel secure, judging by
the hushed conversations in kitchens and living rooms. People still
speculate about why the painting hangs on the side wall _ does the
bank want someone to steal it? _ and talk about better places to
display it. They wonder about the bank's intentions. Some even
hatch half-serious plots about jumping over the counter and
whisking the painting away for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   And while the painting seems secure for now, Lieutenant Jordan
has considered the possibilities. So every night when he's on duty,
he drives by the bank and peeks in the window, just to check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep an eye on it,'' he said. ``Make sure it's still
hanging on the wall.''
</P>

POLS FLUNKING THE SCHOOL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just for the fun of confusing a current
presidential campaign topic, consider two contrasting proposals for
dealing with public schools that are failing in their solemn
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Plan A is tough as nails. Any failing school should be shut down
at the end of the semester in which it is found to be failing. The
summer would be spent redesigning the place with a new principal, a
fixed-up physical plant, smaller class sizes, tutoring programs,
and extended school days or years for every child who is at risk or
behind. The school would reopen in the fall, but every parent would
have guaranteed access for his kid to any other public school in
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Plan B is mush. The first year after a public school was
officially labeled failing, nothing would happen. Nor would
anything happen in the second year. Only after a third year would
an undetermined percentage of lucky parent get a voucher, worth a
puny $1,500, which states could match if they chose, that would be
good at any private school he might be fortunate enough to get his
kid accepted at. Meanwhile, life at the ``failed'' public school
would go on.
</P>
<P>
   Plan A was advanced recently by Sandra Feldman, the president of
the American Federation of Teachers and a supposed guardian of the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Plan B's mush was concocted for George W. Bush. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   And for what it's worth, the odds of the current Republican
Congress going along with the big, city-based American Federation
of Teachers are a lot better than those for Bush's Rube Goldberg
concoction.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the evidence is already in on that point. When few were
noticing last October, and when the Texas governor was still being
hailed as both our inevitable next president and a ``compassionate
conservative,'' Bush's thinking was being laughed out of the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In committee, a version of the Bush idea that would shift a
per-pupil chunk of each system's basic federal assistance to
private school tuition went down by more than 2-to-1. And on the
floor, a 10-state test of the Bush voucher idea was crunched in a
271-153 vote, with 66 Republicans voting no.
</P>
<P>
   To his left, his thinking is opposed as a pointless, further
drain on resources for the public schools. To his right, Bush gets
guff for his heretical fondness for federal intrusion. And there is
no cheering middle for the governor, either.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the shouting match over ``choice'' and
vouchers engages engages people in small ideological salons far
more than it does parents or voters, and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   As a careful study of the opinions of moderate voters for the
moderately inclined, Democrat-oriented Center for National Policy
makes clear, people are likely to have more basic and pragmatic
sets of concerns. Above all, their focus is less on test scores and
ideology and more on secure learning environments for hopefully
happy, well-adjusted kids in public schools that are worth the
effort it takes to help them succeeed.
</P>
<P>
   The study's opinion research was based on a series of focus
group discussions in Richmond and a suburb of Chicago (Oak Park)
with people who described themselves as independents or ``weak''
Republicans and Democrats to the polling team of Democrat Celinda
Lake and Republican John Deardourff. It was supported by a poll
Lake's firm did for the American Association of School
Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   To what ought to be the surprise of no one, the center's
chairman, Leon Panetta (ex-Congress and Clinton White House),
summed up a portrait of voters that ``are seriously worried about
kids and likely to see schools as a key issue in races for national
office, but this is not about reform. The public believes all
American children deserve access to good, safe public schools. They
are saying, make targeted improvements and do no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time reasonable people have popped up to
point out that the noise that engages political junkies is of
limited concern to the public and that polarized debates turn more
people off than on.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentals are what matters, and politicians will do well
in direct proportion to their acceptance of that. The reason
Democrats have done much better with the issue until now (meaning,
until Bush) is that they have come across more as problem-solvers
than as revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason Bush will probably not do as well as he thinks is
that he has mistaken a few trees (failing schools and reading
scores, for example) for a much larger forest. Education is both a
bigger and a less sexy topic than he realizes.

THE JOY OF CUSHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Engley was curious about a word she'd come across in a
recent Globe Magazine column. ``What you will never see when you're
cushing in front of the TV,'' wrote John Yemma, ``is a major report
on, say, a crystal-clear afternoon in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Cushing? wondered Engley. ``Is this a real word? My abridged OED
doesn't list it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time Yemma had used cushing: Last fall he
wrote of the newest luxury, the well-appointed home office, ``It's
not for cushing, vegging, lounging, cribbing, or kicking back.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it a ``real'' word? Yes, in the sense that several layers
of editors assumed readers would get it; it's obviously a verb
formed from cushy, which means ``soft, comfortable, easy'' and is
often, these days, shortened to cush: ``The winner gets a cush spot
in the quarterfinal round.'' There's also a noun cush, short for
cushion or cushioning: ``Lexus needs more cush for the tush,'' read
one headline.
</P>
<P>
   But cush as a verb, meaning ``to luxuriate, or make luxurious,''
is still very rare. A Lexis-Nexus search turned up a 1986 report
about Chrysler's ``cushing up the interior'' of the new Dodge Ram
pickup truck. And the earliest citation available _ a San Francisco
Chronicle piece in praise of three-day weekends _ quoted a Mill
Valley dentist, back in 1992, using the word: ``It allows me time
to run my errands, cush out, and have a whole different perspective
on life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Californians were cushing first. The
unexpected twist, when it comes to cush, is that its two meanings
may have quite different origins. Cushy though your cushions may
be, the words, some etymologists say, are not related.
</P>
<P>
   Cushion is not in dispute; as a noun, it goes back to Middle
English, which spelled it dozens of different ways (quishin,
cuisshin, whishin, cusshyn, coussin, for starters). The derivation
goes back to Latin coxa, hip or thigh, presumably the parts most in
need of cushioning. Cushy, however, remains an enigma. It's first
recorded in a 1915 letter from a soldier, and some authorities
(including the Oxford English Dictionary) say it's an Anglo-Indian
word, borrowed by British colonials from the Hindustani khush,
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the source is more likely to be a different Indic
language, Romany, where the word is kushto, ``good.'' Some
reluctantly allow that it could be a slurring of cushiony, and Eric
Partridge's massive slang dictionary cites the dialect word cushie
_ ``soft, flabby'' _ as a possible source.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Heritage Dictionary editors think nobody's made
an airtight case. A usage note in the third edition (1992) opines
that the Anglo-Indian theory has scanty evidence, then throws
couchee (French for ``lying down; a bed'') into the mix. Recent as
it is, we may never know where cushy comes from.
</P>
<P>
   As for where it's going, that's our call. What is cushing for?
``I've used the word to mean something a little classier than
vegging,'' says Yemma. ``Vegging, to me, sounds brain dead. Cushing
is more joyful: It's sitting on that newly reupholstered chair with
a good reading light while listening to a great new CD with the sun
coming through the window, and an evening ahead with fresh scallops
and shrimp and mussels in the refrigerator and nice sheets to climb
into later.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like the sound of cushing, join the fun. It's not in the
dictionaries yet, but if the people want it, it will settle in and
stay a while.

FALCONE A NEARLY FLAT EXAMPLE OF MOB TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
FALCONE 
Starring: Jason Gedrick, Amy Carlson, Titus Welliver, Eric Roberts 
On: CBS 
Time: Tuesday from 9 to 11 p.m., followed by hourlong installments
at 10 p.m. through April 12, skipping only Sunday, April 9. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that we know the earth is as round as Michael Clark Duncan's
head, and Christopher Columbus has his own holiday, we don't have
much patience for flat. And so goes Mob TV after ``The Sopranos,''
now that we've taken David Chase's trip through the
multi-dimensional world of New Jersey's &UR;  &LR; made men and their
blood-stained car trunks. Who has time for a capo without a shrink?
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' a new series premiering Tuesday, is actually better
than flat, but only by a degree or two. It's based on the exploits
of real-life undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, a family man who
submerged himself in the New York mob. The story made an excellent
movie, ``Donnie Brasco,'' and it's a rich premise for a TV series,
as a moral man gets blood on his hands and neglects his family in
the name of a greater good. Is he a hero, or a workaholic? Is he
secretly turned on by the criminal world he's infiltrating? And
will the mean boys with the guns ever discover his true identity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' named after Joe's mob alias, skips in and out of
these questions, and it's a fun ride at first. The series is
tightly plotted, and the twists create moments of satisfying
intrigue, particularly when members of the Volonte family nearly
find out Joe's masquerade. But juicy plot turns alone cannot fuel a
series for long, especially when they repeat themselves, and the
limitations of ``Falcone'' become clearer in its second and third
episodes. Soon you realize that the mob will almost catch Joe in
every episode, and that Joe's wife may never do more than throw
worried looks at the camera again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems: The script is laden with overfamiliar
gangster-crew lingo that becomes tiresome. The noir look, now
predictible in TV crime dramas, is not artfully done. And the
casting is significantly off base. Pistone, played by Johnny Depp
in ``Donnie Brasco,'' is given an overly sensitive spin by Jason
Gedrick, the hunky actor recently seen cleaning Ally McBeal's
exhaust pipe in a car wash. Gedrick, also known from ``Murder One''
and ``EZ Streets,'' is likable, and he could easily carry a series,
but he's too likable in ``Falcone'' to be believable. What
self-respecting mobster would let this softy in on all his evil
plans?
</P>
<P>
   As ladder-climbing mob captain Sonny Napoli, Titus Welliver is
more effective, especially as the series progresses and we see his
cool crumble in explosions of rage. Along with his unusual name,
Welliver has a curiously compelling face, and his hard eyes seem to
whisper evil. On the other hand, his crew members aren't
distinctive, although ``Sopranos'' fans will recognize Lillo
Brancato Jr., who played the idiotic wannabe recently whacked by
Pussy and Tony. Only a raving Eric Roberts, who plays the mob boss
living in a psychiatric hospital, brings true electricity to the
proceedings, but he appears but a handful of times in the first
four episodes. He also adds a blackly comic element sorely missing
elsewhere on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In a risky move, CBS is airing the series as if it were a
miniseries event. Following the two-hour premiere, it will air in
nightly hourlong installments at 10 p.m. through April 12, skipping
only Sunday. The importance of that last date? It's the season
finale of ``The Sopranos.''

INFREQUENT-TRAVELER SMILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who travel infrequently may find themselves strangers in a
strange land as they puzzle their way through airports, hotels, and
car rentals. Sometimes their actions can be humorous _ to others
anyway (and, in retrospect, to themselves). Here are some of the
tribulations of inexperienced travelers who entered their stories
in Enterprise Rent-A-Car's Infrequent Flyer Rewards contest:
</P>
<P>
   --Debbie Bunten of Dohlonega, Ga., tried to heat her sandwich in
a hotel room safe, thinking it was a microwave. (She won the
contest grand prize _ a Chevrolet Tracker.)
</P>
<P>
   --Eliza Wolk of Ashland, Ore., dashed from her hotel room upon
spying a complimentary terry-cloth robe on the bed. A bellhop had
to assure her that no one else was staying in the room.
</P>
<P>
   --Charlotte Bender of Elyra, Ohio, was thrilled to see her name
in lights and a car waiting for her at an airport rental car lot.
Only one problem: The hoopla was for another C. Bender, who
belonged to the company's gold card club, and an embarrassed
Charlotte had to turn over the car to its rightful renter.
</P>
<P>
   --Other examples: Finding their hotel beds turned down, North
Carolina youngsters placed a hysterical call to their parents,
fearing someone had robbed their room. A roller-coaster fan just
loved her plane's emergency landing on a snow-packed runway but was
disappointed to learn all flights don't end that way. And a flight
attendant had to stifle her laughter when a man began yelling for
her into the air vent, thinking it was the intercom.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those of us who travel more frequently are immune
from such embarrassing actions, right? Well . . . there was the
London trip that began with me bringing the wrong passport to Logan
Airport and ended with me spilling the contents of my carry-on bag
all over the floor at Heathrow Airport. But enough about that.

WHEREFORE ART ROMEO AND JULIET? IN VERONA! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, Italy _ Under a sunny sky Verona seems to glow rosily,
romantically. And the air here seems unusually pure and zesty, like
the first sip of champagne at a wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   The many time-mellowed, red-tile-roofed and pink brick buildings
certainly contribute to the city's rosy coloration. The
invigorating quality of its air can be explained by the fact that
the jagged hills on the horizon are the Dolomites, foothills of the
Alps. But nothing _ or rather no one _ contributes as much to the
atmosphere of high-octane romance as those star-crossed loversRomeo
and Juliet.
</P>
<P>
   A jewel of a place, Verona is one of the best-preserved medieval
cities in northern Italy. It has magnificent churches and palaces,
a first-rate art museum, and an unusually beautiful main plaza. The
numerous ancient monuments include a well-preserved Roman
amphitheater, still in use and second in size only to the Colisseum
in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of visitors, however, Verona's only must-see
attractions are the sites associated with Romeo and Juliet,
including what are purported to be their homes and her tomb. That
there are such sites is a tribute to the power of literature (not
to mention the shrewdness of tourist offices) since there is no
real evidence that the two ever existed other than in writerly
imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's ``Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet'' was written around
1595. It was based on a romantic tale set in Italy and in
circulation in various forms since the 13th century but with plot
devices, such as two lovers dying after drinking from the same
poisoned cup, found in classical Greek literature. The feuding
Montagues and Capulets of Shakespeare's play did have real-life
counterparts in the Montecchis and Capuletis, two prominent
13th-century Verona families on different sides in the bitter power
struggle between the pope and the Holy Roman emperor, a dispute
that split the city and the region into warring factions.
</P>
<P>
   What is now known as Juliet's House was supposedly once owned by
the Capuletis, but whether a ``Giuletta'' ever lived there no one
can say. Anyway, she is certainly there now in the form of a bronze
statue of a pretty but downcast maiden that visitors love to pose
with.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, there is a balcony. The house on Via Capello is built
around an inner courtyard overlooked by a second-story stone
balcony. The small courtyard is frequently jammed with
camera-toting international tourists, and couples from Milan,
Berlin, Tokyo, Marseilles, Sheffield, and Boston happily line up to
reenact the balcony scene. ``Wherefore art thou, Romeo? . . . Hans?
. . . Pierre? . . . Guido? . . . Hideo? . . . Joe?''
</P>
<P>
   If tradition can be trusted, Romeo lived just a few streets away
from Juliet in a still standing but decrepit medieval house on Via
Delle Arche Scaligere. Because of its poor condition, the house, a
former Montecchi residence, isn't open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet's so-called tomb _ an empty sarcophagus of dubious
provenance _ is in the crypt of the chapel of a former monastery at
the intersection of streets named Shakespeare and Capuleti. The
interior of the tomb, which looks rather like a stone bathtub, is
usually littered with scraps of paper. These are notes to Juliet,
ranging in tone from romantic to skeptical. (``Wherefore art thou,
Juliet?'' is a common sentiment.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether looking for the shadowy traces of the two lovers or
exploring Verona's very real artistic and architectural treasures,
the place to start is Piazza Bra, the main square. Just inside the
line of the 14th-century walls and accessed by a monumental
archway, Piazza Bra is one of the most pleasant and impressive town
squares in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the piazza is a lushly-planted public garden, a
green oasis in the brick-red town. Facing the square on two sides
are several palaces, including Palazzo Barbieri, which houses
municipal offices. A third side is lined with cafes fronting on a
wide and curving sidewalk, known as the Listone, where the citizens
of Verona like to promenade in the early  &UR; evening &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The Piazza Bras's fourth side is dominated by the enormous mass
of the Roman amphitheater or arena. Built in the first century AD,
the arena _ which has 44 tiers of seating and could accommodate the
entire Roman town _ has long been Verona's pride. In the 17th
century a special town council was established to preserve and
restore it. The scene of chariot races and gladitorial spectacles
in Roman times, the arena is now used for large-scale grand opera
productions, naturally including ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Verona's other Roman monuments still in use are two city
gates, Porta Borsari and Porta Leona; and also Ponte Pietra (Stone
Bridge), a sturdy but graceful five-arched bridge over the Adige
River, which loops protectively around the town. Frequently
repaired over the centuries with different kinds of stone, the
bridge has an engaging piebald appearance and is much photographed.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the forum, the Roman seat of government, is now
Verona's second main square, Piazza della Erbe. The scene of a
daily fruit, vegetable, and flower market, this piazza is a lively
and atmospheric spot, just steps from Juliet's House. Her statue is
often decorated with bouquets of fresh flowers bought at the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Verona has many magnificent churches but the one that definitely
shouldn't be missed is the basilica of San Zeno Maggiore. Built in
the 13th century to house the shrine of Verona's patron saint, a
fourth-century bishop, this is one of the most ornate Romanesque
churches in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of San Zeno is richly decorated and has a large
rose window representing the Wheel of Fortune. The shape of the
window is artfully echoed in the halo of the Virgin Mary in the
superb 15th-century altarpiece by Mantegna.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze panels on the doors of the basilica's west entrance,
some dating from the 11th century, illustrate Bible stories and
incidents in the life of St. Zeno with crudely executed but
powerful images.
</P>
<P>
   The saint's tomb is in a vaulted crypt beneath the basilica.
However, Zeno's presence seems strongest in a side chapel that
contains a charming 14th-century wooden statue of him. Grinning
broadly, the old bishop is benevolence personified.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13th and 14th centuries, the powerful Scaligero family
ruled Verona from Castelvecchio, a sprawling brick fortress on the
banks of the Adige. An impressive castle with well-preserved
towers, turrets, ramparts, and moats, Castelvecchio is now the
town's principal art museum.
</P>
<P>
   The museum galleries are arranged in such a way as to also show
the highlights of the castle, which has sweeping views over the
town and river. The large art collection includes paintings by
Bellini, Veronese, and Tintoretto. Grouped in one gallery are a
number of beautiful madonnas by gifted but anonymous medieval
craftsmen. As you might expect in a castle, there is a display of
swords and armor, most dating from the high Renaissance and often
beautifully ornamented.
</P>
<P>
   Linked to the castle is Ponte Scaligero, a medieval bridge over
the Adige. Built of brick in the same fortress style as
Castelvecchio, it too has ramparts, turrets, and arrow slits. But
the old bridge is pretty and peaceful these days, its defensive
nooks and crannies popular trysting places for real-life Romeos and
Juliets.

ITALY REAWAKENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Italy is going to be one hot spot this year.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, this is a Jubilee Year, celebrating the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus, and for Catholics, a Jubilee
Year is especially important. Since the Middle Ages the Catholic
Church has been holding a special Jubilee every 25 years during
which pilgrims seek atonement and spiritual renewal by visiting
holy sites in Rome and elsewhere in Italy. One highlight will be a
World Youth Day observance from Aug. 5-20.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Italy, and especially in Rome, there has been a
reawakening in the country with the renovation, refurbishment, and
reopening of museums, historic churches, and sites. Rome alone has
refurbished more than 700 monuments, works of art, and sites.
</P>
<P>
   For tourists in general, travel agents are reporting that
Tuscany is fast replacing Provence as the chic getaway. The January
issue of Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report is devoted to Florence and
Tuscany. Harper reports the best months to visit for both weather
and to avoid the crowds are May and October. (For subscription
information, call 800-235-9622 or visit www.hideawayreport.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Souza of Central Holidays reports their bookings have been
up 15 to 20 percent so far this year, and the heaviest booking
season is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it is offering its most comprehensive tour
program ever for Italy and is including new programs for Tuscany
with optional house or villa rentals. Travel agents have details or
call 800-935-5000.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia has also produced a ``Complete Vacation Catalog'' about
Italy. For a copy, call 888-340-8562.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly two of the more enjoyable things about Italy are its
food and wine. The Parker Co. in Lynn not only specializes in villa
rentals, but also has food and wine tours throughout Italy. The
company's Italian cooking school tours begin at $2,650 a person and
include air fare from Boston, hotels, classes, most meals, and
more. For information, call 800-280-2811 or visit
www.theparkercompany.com.

 &QL; 
Shroud on view &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While every church in Italy is expected to hold special events,
the Cathedral of Turin will gain a lot of attention. From Aug. 26
to Oct. 26 it will display the Holy Shroud of Turin, a cloth said
to have been used to wrap Jesus' body after the crucifixion. While
the shroud's authenticity has been questioned, believers say it
bears the imprint of Jesus' body. The shroud is in fragments and
has been kept hidden for decades at a time. It was on display in
1978 and again for a few weeks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The free exhibition will be open daily, although some times will
be reserved for the sick and disabled.

&HT;     DNA TESTING: GOOD OR BAD FOR JUSTICE? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eyewitnesses may be uncertain. Lawyers may
bungle. Cops may err. But a $10,000 Zeiss microscope is as close to
infallible as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a world of hurt, criminals often leave behind traces of
themselves _ blood, hair and semen _ that can be used to convict
them or to clear others falsely accused of their misdeeds. DNA
testing is the key that can unlock the door to the truth in many of
the toughest cases before our courts.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology available in many cases to prove or disprove
guilt scientifically, the questions left to politicians, law
enforcement authorities and legal scholars are these:
</P>
<P>
   When do we set aside what our very fallible eyes and ears tell
us and rely on the reports of technicians? When is it in the
interests of justice to shift the responsibility for passing
judgment from ourselves to laboratory equipment?
</P>
<P>
   Barry Scheck, one of the famed crew of attorneys who persuaded a
jury that O.J. Simpson was innocent, says the time to make a
wholesale move to DNA testing is now.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck's Innocence Project at the Cardozo Law School in New York
has played a prominent role in the freeing of more than 60
prisoners in the United States on grounds of actual innocence.
</P>
<P>
   With Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer, Scheck is the author of a book
that makes a case for readily available post-conviction DNA
testing, ``Actual Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   An astonishing compendium of stories about miscarriages of
justice, the book looks into the causes and effects of defects in a
criminal justice system that, as of last summer, had sent at least
64 people to prison and death row for crimes committed by others.
</P>
<P>
   One was Ron Williamson, who played baseball in the minor league
organizations of both the Oakland A's and the New York Yankees.
Williamson was sentenced to death for a 1982 rape and murder. Last
April, he was freed by DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of people across the country who could
prove their innocence with DNA testing,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two states require post-conviction DNA testing, Illinois
and New York. That will soon change. Bills are now before
legislators in many other states, including California, where a
measure by state Sen. John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat, is to
go to the Senate Public Safety Committee on April 11. The bill
would grant convicts the right to DNA testing provided they
demonstrate that important new evidence has been found.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are expensive _ up to $9,000 in complex cases _ but
the Burton bill would require courts to pay for testing in the
cases of indigent convicts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, one of the
region's most experienced and respected prosecutors, Rockne Harmon,
has been handling his office's reconsideration of some of its
oldest unsolved cases.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, part of the prosecution team in the O.J. case, relies on
DNA testing heavily, but his agenda is very different from
Scheck's. He's trying to put people in jail. In the last 18 months,
Alameda County has reopened more than a dozen unsolved cases going
back an average of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon doesn't think DNA testing is a blanket answer to
questions of guilt or innocence. Biological testing is of limited
use, he said, because it can't ``touch the whole body of
evidence.'' It will never explain away compelling conventional
evidence, such as the presence of the rape suspect's wallet in the
victim's car.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon also contends that while the tool is basically a good
one, its proponents really want DNA testing to help further a
hidden agenda: undermining the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by Ed Blake, a forensic scientist who has
consulted on perhaps more DNA cases than anyone in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, of Richmond, Calif., thinks a post-conviction DNA testing
law like the one Burton is carrying ``is probably the most
important criminal justice legislation in 30 or 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   His fear _ a major one _ is that such legislation will be
misused if not crafted carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't say in a law that anyone convicted has an open book
for claiming this kind of work has to be done,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public gets the perception the defense attorneys are
abusing the process, the public will demand laws to prevent the
whole process from happening at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake called Burton's bill ``very reasonable,'' except for its
failure to say what constituted ``reasonable notice'' when a DNA
challenge was to be mounted. Defense attorneys will exploit that,
he predicted, by demanding DNA tests shortly before scheduled
executions, merely to delay them.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings Law School professor Rory Little, a former federal
prosecutor and onetime top assistant to U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno, also qualified his praise of the bill by pointing out that it
was silent on another important question: What happens next if the
DNA testing looks like it might exonerate the defendant _ and in
what court does it occur?
</P>
<P>
   Charles Weisselberg, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, argued that the Burton bill should include
a provision designed to preserve evidence to make it available for
future DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the alleged hidden agenda of some testing proponents,
Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg pleaded guilty. DNA
testing ``certainly is'' a collateral attack on the death penalty,
he acknowledged, but one worth making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The twist on this,'' he said, ``is that in the long term it
might re-enforce the popularity of the death penalty, because it
might eliminate the problem of factually innocent people being
executed.''

PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the cooler things to happen to photography in the digital
age has been the emergence of 360-degree pictures. They create a
``you are there'' experience for viewers, who use their computer
mouse to control what part of a panorama they see.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, the technology has quickly found a host
of uses, such as remote tours of homes for sale and interactive
entertainment. You can use your computer to pick which room or part
of an event or scene you want to see and zoom in as if you were
standing there watching with your own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While the pictures can be incredibly fun to look at, they can
also be a bear to make, requiring expensive equipment and complex
efforts to stitch together two or more pictures into a continuous
image.
</P>
<P>
   A firm that just moved its headquarters from Manhattan to
Westborough, Mass., however, is starting to roll out what it
promotes as a fast, cheap, one-click way to create ``interactive
images'' _ and a way to move quickly into real-time 360-degree
video for people who have powerful enough Net connections.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Cyclovision Technologies Inc., has just renamed
itself Remote Reality. It makes extensive use of technology
developed at Columbia University's computer science labs, including
seven patented or patent-pending inventions.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how its system works, try to imagine you are
looking up the stem of a martini glass to the reflections on the
underside of the cup. If you could counter-distort and greatly
magnify the images, you would have a way of looking at almost the
entire room.
</P>
<P>
   What Remote Reality now sells is a $500 lens that does just
that. The device has a convex mirror, about the size of a hamburger
bun, mounted by a pen-size stem to the front of the lens. It fits
most digital cameras, including Agfa, Nikon, and Olympus models.
You also have to buy a $300-a-year software license for converting
the images into a usable form.
</P>
<P>
   To take pictures, instead of looking through the camera and
aiming at a point in front of you, you aim the lens up at the
ceiling or sky to take in the whole scene.
</P>
<P>
   Through a fairly simple software process, pictures can be edited
and posted on the Web within minutes. And they can be downloaded in
a second or two with a broadband-speed connection. It might take up
to a minute, however, for a dial-up modem, because an individual
image may easily contain 2 megabits of data.
</P>
<P>
   Once the image is on your computer, you have everything you need
to see and rotate it because Remote Reality runs on so-called Java
applets rather than a special plug-in program you have to download
from a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the company plans field tests of a streaming video
product it expects to become available this fall. That will open
the door for people who have broadband-speed Net connections to
watch sports events, concerts, or street scenes in interesting
places as if they were standing there.
</P>
<P>
   The video system uses digital compression that can make images a
little herky-jerky. Without using billions of pixels, there is only
so far you can zoom in before the picture starts looking like bad
satellite surveillance of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, you could easily spend $25,000 on digital
cameras and associated software to create 360-degree images. You
could also take years off your life enduring the frustration of
making usable pictures. Both the price and complexity have since
plunged, though possibly not far enough for the average amateur
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in the field to date has been Silicon Valley-based
Interactive Pictures Corp. or Ipix, whose system requires taking
two images with a 180-degree fisheye lens to create one panorama.
It can cost as little as $330 if you already have a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   However, you have to pay Ipix a fee for every image you make,
like buying Polaroid film _ about $1.25 a pop for the consumer
product and a lot more for professional systems. If the light
levels in the two images are starkly different _ a picture at
Fenway Park, for instance, showing the sun-dappled field and the
gloomy grandstand _ getting the images to synch up can be vexing.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have paid Remote Reality your annual software licensing
fee (which includes upgrades), you can take all of the images you
want, including plenty of bad practice shots to get the hang of it.
</P>
<P>
   Remote Reality's president, Jeb S. Hurley, is so convinced
people will love the product that he left a job running a $1
billion division of Eastman Kodak to take over the 14-person
company last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You turn photography into an experience, as opposed to a mere
presentation of images,'' Hurley said. ``I think Web advertisers
are going to love this because they are really thirsty for
something more compelling than click-through banner ads.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Hurley's demonstrations shows the inside of a Lexus. You
get all the same visual information you could get from looking at
five or six sequential pictures of the dashboard, passenger seat,
rear window, and driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to explain without seeing it yourself, but trust your
reporter: When you sit in front of the computer scrolling around
the inside of the car in a continuous loop, you can really imagine
you are sitting on the gearshift.
</P>
<P>
   The potential applications for 360-degree photography and
videography are huge, going beyond entertainment and advertising to
include videoconferencing, military surveillance, one-camera video
security systems for office lobbies, and interactive photographs
for Web news sites that put you in the journalist's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Once millions of people finally have broadband-speed Net access,
it is easy to imagine that something as common as sending a
relative a picture of your new home will take on a totally
different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sending her some snapshots of the porch and the
kitchen and the kids' room, you would zap her a file that would
make her feel that she was standing there with you. As Hurley puts
it, with 360-degree pictures, ``You begin to change the very way
you think about an image.''

HOW LOW WILL TECH STOCKS GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How will you know when technology stocks hit bottom?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question on investors' minds Monday as they watched
the Nasdaq plunge into the abyss. The technology-heavy index lost
350 points, or 7.6 percent of its value, the most brutal day yet in
a correction that has been underway for the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's selloff was prompted by the breakdown of the
government's talks with Microsoft Corp., which like all trigger
events, was more an excuse than a reason for the carnage that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   With their lofty valuations, tech stocks were vulnerable to a
major correction. The only issue was when, not if.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting where a new floor will be established is never an
easy task, especially in times of such violent mood swings. But
with traditional stocks, there are at least some yardsticks you can
use to measure.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stock like FleetBoston Financial Corp. A few weeks ago we
argued that it was undervalued because it had fallen to a level
that struck us as a bargain price. Ours was not a brilliant call.
We looked at the bank's earnings, projections for future earnings,
and the multiple of earnings the stock was selling for _ about 8 _
and concluded that barring a collapse in the economy, Fleet had to
be worth more than the $27 per share it then commanded.
</P>
<P>
   Others made the same judgment and Fleet has since rebounded to
$40.
</P>
<P>
   But when you try to bring that same kind of analysis to the
newest of the new economy stocks, you hit an obvious problem: There
is very little measure. ``A lot of these stocks don't have much of
a foundation,'' said Jim Weiss, chief of equities at State Street
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the past year's hottest stocks were companies with no
earnings and very modest sales. They rose on expectations and
hopes. When investors were optimistic that was more than enough. In
the current rout, expectations and hopes aren't much to fall back
on.
</P>
<P>
   Consider another local stock, Navisite. The Andover company
specializes in hosting, a form of computer outsourcing. A brand-new
company, Navisite had $9 million in sales in its most recent
quarter to go along with losses of $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, those numbers were enough to drive Navisite's
stock to $327 per share and a market value of about $8 billion.
Monday Navisite closed at $95, a decline _ which we can measure _
of 70 percent from the top.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies, another high-flier, reached a peak of $327
per share at the end of last year. The Cambridge Internet company
had sales of $2.7 million and losses of $29 million in its most
recent quarter. Monday Akamai closed at $119, a decline from the
peak of 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of speculation in these stocks was pervasive,''
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger, more established tech stocks have not been spared in
this downturn. But profitable firms like EMC Corp. and Cisco
Systems have held up much better than their start-up counterparts.
In tough times, it seems, earnings actually do matter.
</P>
<P>
   Tech fans point out that nothing fundamental has changed between
this week and last week. Technology still has a bright future, they
say, and investors will get a glimpse of that future in the next
few weeks as corporations report their first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think those earnings will be very good,'' said Alan
Lowenstein, manager of the John Hancock Technology Fund. Lowenstein
is also hopeful that the Nasdaq's troubles may slow down the pace
of initial public offerings. With less money going into brand-new
companies, Lowenstein reasons, existing tech stocks may reap some
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, anyone who bet that fallen technology
stocks would stay down has lost his shirt and his money. Investors
have used the periodic tech corrections to load up on more
technology stocks. Maybe they will do that again this time.
</P>
<P>
   But if they don't, and they are forced to grope around in search
of a bottom, they may wish they had some more reliable markers to
rely on.

   Feeling left out of the business-to-business bonanza?
</P>
<P>
   Well, just wave a magic wand and call yourself a B2B company!
</P>
<P>
   Lately, everyone from ancient software firms to ailing Web
stores has been making the leap to business-to-business e-commerce.
Never mind that few so-called B2B firms do much Internet business.
And some have yet to sign on customers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been looking for a narrow definition of B2B, the
Net's latest rage, you won't find it. But here's a good starting
point. It's any business that sells to other businesses online or
helps them sell on the Web or . . .
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Blame investors for the B2B hype. After abandoning unprofitable
and free-spending virtual retailers, they raced toward seemingly
sexier ventures such as Chemdex Corp., which sells laboratory
supplies to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Companies that weren't B2B scrambled to become part
of the B2B trend. Last month, Lands' End, a catalog and online
retailer, raised its B2B banner, announcing plans to supply
companies with branded apparel and luggage through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Lands' End in B2B land are a host of cash-hungry virtual
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com, a California software retailer that couldn't make a
profit selling to regular shoppers, is now targeting businesses.
And last week, MotherNature.com, an online vitamin retailer that
has been trimming costs, said it would pursue a B2B strategy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   How do you keep a curious employee from nosing through the
corporate network and into his company's salary database? And how
do you give a preferred client a larger helping of Internet options
than a regular customer?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, corporations are turning to software firms such as
Marlborough-based Gradient Technologies Inc. to help them set
different levels of network access for employees, vendors, and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determine who (the users) are, and give them appropriate
information'' said Tracy Mansolillo, a Gradient spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gradient's NetCrusader technology was named ``The
Best of Security Solutions'' at the Internet Commerce Expo in
Boston. The company's customers include Citibank, Kaiser
Permanente, and Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989, closely held Gradient also has been helping its
corporate customers track people who click into their Web sites.
The function has become more important as hackers continue to break
into corporate sites, swiping valuable information and embarrassing
executives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As demand for Web site builders skyrockets, many of their
corporate customers are complaining about long delays, huge fees,
and arrogant consultants, a new survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   Executives told Forrester Research that some service providers
refused smaller projects, put off work, jumped ship, and demanded
equity in their firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered me either more than I wanted or not exactly what
I wanted,'' an executive with a publishing company told Forrester.
``They have an attitute that I should be grateful to buy their
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Attracting a large share of the gripes were hot developers of
integrated software systems, according to the survey of 50
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients chase integrators the way teenagers chase rock
stars,'' explained Christine Ferrusi Ross, a Forrester analyst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The .nu guys on the domain block are beginning to rattle their
more established .com colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The first spat involves Expedia.com, a big online travel service
spun off last year by Microsoft Corp., and cybersquatter
Expedia.nu.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia Inc., which owns the trademark for the word Expedia, has
challenged the Swedish company that registered the domain name
Expedia.nu. The fight will be arbitrated by the World Intellectual
Property Association, part of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the skirmish is .NU Domain Ltd., which has been handing
out domain names such as Microsoft.nu, Harvard.nu, and Amazon.nu to
anyone with a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's Web site, www.nunames.com, users can buy new
domain names for less than $100 a pop. Still available: Gillette.nu
and Procterandgamble.nu.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that the UN is watching.

FASHIONS FRESH FROM THE GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BARBARA DeWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In forever-spring L.A., daffodils have been sounding their
trumpets for weeks. Ditto for daisies, azaleas and those pretty
primroses that are blooming on spring fashions.
</P>
<P>
   A colorful, refreshingly feminine alternative to all the
snakeskin and bohemian looks, these florals are more what you'd
find in an English garden than a tropical island.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles studio of designer David Meister, there are
flirty cocktail dresses in a floral watercolor print; over on Rodeo
Drive in Beverly Hills are stores filled with elegant silk florals
on peasant tops, pants and fringed stoles by European designers
such as Emanuel Ungaro and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, and floral-trimmed
purses by Ferragamo and Kate Spade.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood malls are in full bloom, too. You can find
Tahari's mini-floral print skirts in ruffled chiffon _ to be worn
with a sassy pink leather halter top that exposes the midriff, as
well as shoes accented with silk daisies at Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gap are flowers on everything from T-shirts to baby
dresses, with floral scarves and handbags at Coach, delicate
jasmine designs on silk skirts at Banana Republic, and saucy little
jersey tops with embroidered roses at junior boutiques like Wet
Seal. Mervyn's has recruited Australian artist Ken Done to put
flower power on sandals, swimsuits and tote bags.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought florals were always ladylike.
</P>
<P>
   For the office or Sunday brunch, designers such as Liz Claiborne
have provided us with conservative sheaths sprinkled with poppies,
while other designers are using a floral design on cotton eyelet
skirts and shirtwaists to be topped with flower-accented cardigans.
</P>
<P>
   Also fresh from the garden are silk flowers to pin on a pantsuit
lapel and cosmetics in hot-house brights to put the roses back in
your cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Like all spring flowers, they'll be fading with summer's first
heat wave, so wear them while you can.

 BOSTON: ... me names.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet not one of more than 20 past and present athletes and
executives interviewed would trade his Boston experience. The
demands may be greater, but they go with the territory. And it
beats the alternative. An adoring public may be the ideal, but a
caring public is better than an ignoring public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal,'' said
Rangers center Tim Taylor, a former Bruin and Detroit Red Wing,
``you'd better be prepared to know that when things don't go well,
you're going to have to deal with the pressure. And when things go
well, there's nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grogan said, ``You succeed here and there's a lot of perks.
Pedro Martinez owns this town because he's the best. I don't think
it would be the same way if he were in Kansas City or Minnesota or
Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Martinez's Red Sox predecessor, Yankee starter Roger
Clemens, who endured a relationship of extremes with Boston fans
before he bolted to Toronto, has no complaints _ or claims none.
``I wouldn't say it was difficult, because I enjoyed playing in
that environment,'' he said. ``They're caring fans and they come
out and support you.''
</P>
<P>
   Or savage you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Our little town &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, a Bay Stater born and bred who still considers himself
a Bostonian 15 years after relocating to Storrs, Conn., believes
size matters in a sociological sense. ``When I call Boston `the old
town,' '' he said, ``I mean that because it is a town. It has that
intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports definition of ``intimacy'' can be translated as
``lack of alternatives for abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York can be (harsh), but it's a huge market,'' said
Gorman. ``There are 8 million other things to do. But here
everything seems to get regurgitated more than anyplace else.
Everybody has an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   And isn't shy about changing it without warning. ``There were
many games where I was almost booed out of the stadium,'' said
Grogan. ``Then I did something at the end, we won, and suddenly, I
was the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a microcosm of his 16-year career, during which Grogan
experienced the cycle of rejection, rebirth, and redemption.
``There were a couple of times I thought about bailing out,'' he
said. ``But I never asked for a trade. I liked the city, so I stuck
with it and wound up on their good side again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's more than can be said for some past minority athletes.
</P>
<P>
   During the Celtics' glory days of the 1950s and '60s, Bill
Russell was a hero who led them to an unparalleled 11 NBA
championships in 13 years. Off the court, his home was vandalized
when he settled in suburban Reading. After his retirement, Russell
maintained an icy distance from the city and only recently has
there been a rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Hall of Famer-to-be Kirby Puckett rejected a more
lucrative free agent offer from Boston and stayed in Minnesota.
While Puckett's agent, Ron Shapiro, maintained that his client
``really liked Boston,'' there were some undercurrents of social
tension in the outfielder's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my wife along to help figure out what we wanted,'' said
Puckett then. ``I know that when Tonya goes to the Metrodome, she
is going to be safe. That's not true at other ballparks.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny also was uncomfortable. ``I felt like a fugitive,''
said Puckett. ``If I saw someone coming, I had a feeling someone
was going to call something in on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But past and present Red Sox coach Tommy Harper, ostracized in
1984 when he confirmed that the team implicitly condoned the
segregationist spring training policies of the Winter Haven (Fla.)
Elks Club _ which invited only white members of the team to
socialize _ was pleased by the melting pot he saw upon his return
to camp this year in Fort Myers, Fla. ``This is like night and
day,'' said Harper. ``This is a different atmosphere altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the perception dies hard. Al Skinner experiences it as he
tries to rebuild the Boston College basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Boston has had its share of problems as far as
minority students are concerned,'' he said last month. ``We
recognize the evolution the city has made. But that still lingers.
Those are the things you deal with. It's not just BC. But the city
of Boston has to take some responsibility for what exists.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The sky is falling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.L. Carr, the former Celtics player and coach and current
executive, remembers a ragged stretch on the court back in 1981.
``They let us know we weren't performing at the level we should
be,'' he said. The Celtics at the time were in the midst of the NBA
Finals against the Houston Rockets, a series they went on to win in
six games for the franchise's 14th world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Cashman, a winger on the Big, Bad Bruins who's now an
assistant coach in Philadelphia, assumed that Stanley Cup crowns in
1970 and '72 would sate the masses. Quite the contrary. ``After two
Cups,'' he said, ``it was almost automatic that we were expected to
win again. It was a lot tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   And last season, after the Patriots roared to a 6-2 start that
put them in prime playoff position, there was a sense of doom about
the upcoming game against the Jets. Sure enough, in a
self-fulfilling prophecy, they lost that game, staggered to an
also-ran 8-8 finish, and cost coach Pete Carroll his job.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how Boston reacts when things are going well.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the dismal showings of the Bruins and Celtics, they
really have something to harp on. But the targets seem to accept it
as due punishment, Pitino's scolding notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're allowed to boo,'' said Bruins coach Pat Burns, who
previously coached in the hockey hotbeds of Toronto and Montreal.
``They pay $80 or $90 and the players don't (perform), they're
allowed to boo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' fabled tradition doesn't do them any favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of history,'' said forward Eric Williams. ``All
that winning. The people still remember. The kids grow up with
that. They're spoiled from all the banners. Is it fair? Life's not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, star forward _ and frequent villain _ Antoine Walker
rates Boston ``a great basketball town. When you're the top guy and
the team isn't doing as well as people thought it would, there's
going to be finger-pointing. I like that kind of pressure. That's
good pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   From afar, former Bruins center Adam Oates of the Washington
Capitals considers the issue nonsense. ``Pitino was out of line as
far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ``Look at the product. It sucks,
and it's because of him. . . . Professional athletes in Boston are
spoiled. A lot of guys just aren't honest with themselves.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
You talk too much &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe self-delusion is a form of self-defense. There's nowhere
to hide in a city with a merciless media contingent that seemingly
grows by the minute with the advent of talk radio and the flood of
Web sites to supplement the two metropolitan and sundry suburban
newspapers, plus the electronic ganglia of television and
microphone cords.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Hobson's first game as Red Sox manager was against the
Yankees in 1992. Afterward, his office was overflowing with 100
journalists. After the media exodus, Gorman dropped by and asked,
``What did you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson responded with near dread, ``Is it like this every
night?''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman replied, ``It's not quite that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But almost. That's why Gorman classifies this media coverage as
``the most intense of any city in the country. The talk shows are
probably more (influential) than any other place than New York.
There's tremendous coverage. Sometimes it's unfair, but you have to
be willing to accept it as part of being in this market. I didn't
mind it as long as it didn't get too personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriots general manager Patrick Sullivan believes it
did, that some reporters had an inexplicable vendetta against his
father, late team founder Billy Sullivan. ``What differentiates it
here,'' said Sullivan, ``is that the media isn't content to report
the story, but wants to be part of it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
For the record &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what matters is the bottom line; everything else is
peripheral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every city's tough,'' said Walker. ``Everything is
based on wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   `Twas ever thus, as Harry Sinden, the former Bruins coach and
longtime general manager, can testify. ``Pitino is not wrong,'' he
said, ``but it has to do with the team's performance. I wouldn't
say (the negativity) is any worse here. I just don't see a heck of
a lot of difference here than anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Bostonians, that may be the real insult. &QL;

SOME KNOCKOUT COMPETITION EXPECTED THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The European Champions League graduates to the knockout phase
this week, recalling the origins of the competition. The event has
become an ambiguous conglomeration of summer qualifying rounds and
round-robin group play, leading to the quarterfinals, which revert
to good old home-and-home elimination.
</P>
<P>
   And the Real Madrid-Manchester United match should be a classic.
Manchester United is the world's most glamorous and richest club,
but Real Madrid is probably the most popular club in history. Real
made its reputation by opening its doors to the great Hungarian
dissident players in the 1950s and, under the on-field direction of
Argentine Alfredo Di Stefano, won the first five European Champions
Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid also symbolized Franco-style fascism, though this
association has been filled with contradictions, not the least of
which is the monarchical implications of the name ``Real'' (Royal).
But the club has long embraced the values of capitalism, and is
worth more than nearly all other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But sporting clubs now are becoming transparent enough to be
assigned values. Manchester United is considered the richest,
recently being assessed at $1.66 billion _ a significant increase
on the $1.06 billion offered by Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate
last year. The club last week announced pre-tax profits of $19.5
million for the past six months, which should increase the yearly
take to $44.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other European clubs are following the lead of English clubs and
going public.
</P>
<P>
   And it is more than coincidental that SS Lazio is among
Manchester United's challengers, since the Rome club became the
first Italian team to be quoted. Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti
has revived a team that has only one Serie A title. Now, Lazio is
in contention for three championships _ Serie A, the Coppa Italia,
and the European Champions Cup, and coach Sven-Goran Eriksson told
the Swedish daily Expressen ``we have everything to take all
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, which meets Valencia Wednesday, is coming off a 1-0
victory over Juventus, which rejuvenated the Serie A ``scudetto''
race. A glancing header by Diego ``El Cholo'' Simeone provided the
difference as Lazio pulled within 3 points of Juve with six weeks
left in the season. When the Milan Borsa opened Monday, Lazio's
stock value had increased by 10.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, though, is that an immense amount of capital is
needed to field teams deep enough to withstand the crowded
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Three Spanish teams have advanced to the final eight of the
European competition. Barcelona, which meets Chelsea Wednesday, is
making a run at the Primera Liga title after crushing Valencia,
3-0, on goals by Dutchmen Patrick Kluivert (two) and Winston Bogard
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish soccer appears to be adjusting to modern times better
than some of its more populous neighbors. The Liga has absorbed an
enormous influx of foreign players, maintained its reputation for
wide-open offensive play, and continues to produce young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Spain defeated Italy, 2-0, for the first time in 22
years. And, the Spain Under-23 team also stopped the Italians, 3-0.
Young players such as Valencia midfielder Gerard could be heading
to Serie A, but there appear to be plenty of replacements.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Return of Hurtado
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution earned a point in a 2-2 tie at Los Angeles, but
might have fared even better had Eduardo Hurtado arrived. Hurtado
is expected to return from Ecuador this week after his family
experienced visa problems. Alex Aguinaga and Agustin Delgado, his
teammates with Ecuador's national team, had a smooth return after a
2-0 win over Venezuela in Quito Wednesday. They rejoined their club
team in Mexico City and helped Necaxa take a 4-0 victory over
Atlante. Delgado, who appears to be a young version of Hurtado,
scored three goals . . . Bruno Schneider, the leading scorer in
Eastern Massachusetts high school soccer the last three years,
suffered a leg injury during a tryout last week with Blackburn
Rovers. Schneider, 17, who has American and European citizenship,
is scheduled to return to England for training this month . . .
Former Revolution midfielder Jair has been called to the Cape
Verdean national team for a World Cup qualifier against Algeria
Sunday.

GODOLPHIN IS A STABLE OUTFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is only a matter of time before Godolphin Racing Inc., the
thoroughbred stable of Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum and Sheik Mohammed
al Maktoum, becomes a major force in American racing.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the horses owned by the ruling family of
Dubai, which includes Sheik Hamdan al Maktoum, who owns the
Shadwell Estate Co. Ltd. breeding operation and also races under
his own name, and a fourth brother, Marwan, was sensational at the
Dubai World Cup March 27. Granted, Dubai World Cup Day amounts to a
home game for the sheiks, but they still won five of the six races
on the $11.75 million card, and had several other runners hit the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai; Sheik Hamdan, the minister of
finance, Sheik Mohammed, the minister of defense, and Sheik Marwan,
the youngest of the brothers, are the four sons of the late ruler,
Sheik Rashid bin Said al Maktoum. It was the idea of Sheik
Mohammed, a horseman who specialized in Arabians, to take
thoroughbreds from England, train them in Dubai, and return them to
England to race. Godolphin, which was established in 1994, quickly
outgrew England, became international, and Mohammed began the Dubai
World Cup in 1996. Money is not a problem in oil-rich Dubai, a
member of the United Arab Emirates, and Sheik Mohammed is
determined that his horses make an inpact in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Dubai World Cup Day offer an example of how
powerful Godolphin is right now. Dubai Millennium captured the $6
million World Cup, the world's richest race, by 6 lengths over
Behrens, the best America had to offer. Sheik Mohammed was so
confident in the ability of the 4-year-old Dubai Millennium that he
changed his name from Yaazer when he was age 2 because the sheik
felt confident he would win the first World Cup of the new
millennium. A son of Seeking the Gold, Dubai Millennium has won
eight of nine career starts, earned $4.2 million, and is considered
the best horse in training. The remainder of his campaign will be
directed toward the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic, at Churchill
Downs Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Godolphin colorbearers Rhythm Band ($2 million Duty
Free at 9 furlongs on turf); Fantastic Light ($2 million Sheema
Classic at 12 furlongs on turf), and China Visit ($500,000 United
Arab Emirates Derby at 9 furlongs on the dirt), won on Dubai World
Cup Day. Plus, Conflict, owned by Marwan al Maktoum, won the
$250,000 Godolphin Mile. Only in the $1 million Golden Shaheen, a
6-furlong dash, did a shipper break through, as Big Jag, arguably
the best of the American sprinters, scored by 4 lengths. Even then,
Godolphin's Bertolini was second.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of Godolphin has been steadily building. Among the
best horses the stable has raced in the past are Lammtarra, who won
the Epsom Derby, King George the VI, and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
in 1995, the first to accomplish that triple since the legendary
Mill Reef in 1971; Swain, second in the World Cup and third in the
Breeders' Cup in 1998; Daylami, who won last year's Breeder's Cup
Turf; and Almutawakel, who won last year's World Cup. However, the
outfit never has had the depth it now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin took its first shot at the Kentucky Derby last year.
The stable purchased Worldly Manner, who was trained by Bob Baffert
and owned by John and Betty Mabee, for $5 million after he won the
Del Mar Futurity. Managed by Simon Crisford, the spokesman for
Godolphin, and trained by Saeed bin Suroor, the hands-on trainer,
Worldy Manner was prepared for the Rose Run in Dubai. He ran a
great mile in the Derby, looming a threat in Godolphin's bright
blue colors as the field turned for home, but he ran out of gas and
faded to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   This year Godolphin intends to send China Visit, and, perhaps,
Chief Seattle, who was purchased after he ran second in both the
Champagne and the Breeders' Cup, to Louisville to contest the first
jewel of the Triple Crown. China Visit, a son of Red Ransom, has
run only twice, breaking his maiden at Deauville last August.
Conventional wisdom says he's too lightly raced to win the Derby.
Frankly, he'd have to be a monster to do so. Chief Seattle, a son
of Seattle Slew, would be a serious player, but he has been
training, without racing, in Dubai since February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheik Maktoum (who bred China Visit at Gainsborough Farm in
Kentucky) is keen to go for the Kentucky Derby with his homebred
colt,'' said Crisford. ``We are hoping that Chief Seattle will also
be able to take part.''
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin was criticized last year for not giving Worldly
Manner, who appeared like a horse not ready to run the distance, a
prep race in the United States before the Derby. The stable now has
decided if it doesn't want to prep its horses in America, maybe
American horses will prep in Dubai. After the World Cup, Sheik
Mohammed announced that the purse of next year's UAE Derby will be
raised to $2 million, making it the richest Derby in the world.
``Our aim is to make the meeting better each year,'' said Sheik
Mohammed. ``By increasing the prize money for the Emirates Derby,
we expect to have an even stronger field for the race in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   While it appears that Godolphin will be up against it at
Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May, consider this: It is
sending 30 2-year-olds to train at Santa Anita this month. The
juveniles will be trained by Eoin Harty, a protege of Baffert. The
decision to ship to California was based on the quality of
2-year-old racing on the West Coast, and the similarity in climate
between California and Dubai. ``We feel that California is the
right place for Godolphin's training base, and we look forward to
competing in 2-year-old races in California, and throughout North
America,'' said Crisford.
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin is not yet ready to dominate American racing, but the
clock is ticking.

   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ He is not out of place amid the azaleas, the pine
trees, and the giants of the game. Make no mistake, Aaron Baddeley
fits into the Augusta National landscape like a green blade of
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the plan,'' said Dale Lynch. ``This is no dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for a Masters berth in 2000? OK, conceded Lynch,
perhaps they figured that Baddeley would be part of the world golf
stage by age 21. Silly them, because the amateur from Australia
turned 19 three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we looked at the whole picture when he was younger and
he's been doing the mental preparation all along,'' said Lynch, who
has nurtured Baddeley's golf game since the two were introduced six
years ago. And this rare exemption into the Masters, Lynch
emphasized, is another step in the progress. ``No matter what
happens this week, he'll gain from it. This is a long-term plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, however, some valuable dividends have been cashed
in to support their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Age 14. Baddeley received a letter from Jack Nicklaus, who had
heard great things about the youngster. Work hard, wrote Nicklaus,
and stay focused. Later that year, Baddeley won the club
championship at Croydon Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Age 15. He became the youngest player to make a cut in an
Australasia Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Age 16. His first competition in the United States was a rousing
success, with runner-up finishes at the World Junior and US Junior
Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Age 17. A pairing with Gary Player in the Greg Norman
Invitational in Australia. Sort of a publicity stunt, with the
youngest and the oldest. But Player turned up the intensity by
saying of Baddeley: ``The best young player I ever saw was Jack
Nicklaus. I think this young man _ and I don't say this lightly _
has the ability Jack Nicklaus had at the same age.''
</P>
<P>
   Age 18. A friendly round with Phil Mickelson at Greyhawk in
Arizona. The graceful lefthander shoots 71. The kid with the plan
shoots 67 and wins $40.
</P>
<P>
   Age 18. Baddeley became the first amateur in 40 years to win the
Australian Open, and the nation could barely contain itself. ``A
supernova emerged,'' gushed Peter Thomson, a five-time British Open
champ and Australian legend.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the investment was ready to be cashed in. Wrong.
Baddeley would remain an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' said Player. ``Don't you like money?''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, money is very important. But not so important
that it disrupts The Plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was hours after the Australian Open, and the Baddeley family
was celebrating with friends. Craig Spence, a veteran pro on the
Australasia Tour, was part of the festivities, and when he heard
Jo-ann Baddeley say how wild things were, Spence said, ``Wait till
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the next morning chaos kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron had a mobile phone, (father) Ron had a mobile phone, and
there was a hotel phone, too _ all three rang constantly,'' said
the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of Aaron Baddeley had begun, and the usual
suspects were out in front. Nike. Titleist. IMG. Newspapers.
Magazines. Cable sports shows. The Masters called in its first
exemption to an amateur in 25 years, even though the good news came
at 7:30 in the morning and woke him up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that wasn't as bad as the call from the folks at The
International, a PGA Tour stop in August. Obviously
misunderstanding the time difference, they called at 2:30 in the
morning. ``They were very apologetic,'' said Ron, ``and we had a
nice talk.'' But they made no commitment, for there are decisions
still to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Such as when to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   There's no rush, said Ron Baddeley, who recently sold his auto
parts store. He understands what is at stake here, but he is more
father than manager. Financial concerns take a back seat to the
human frailties that can fracture a young man's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Aaron didn't turn pro after stunning the golf world
last winter, the father invoked the name of Justin Rose, the
17-year-old Briton who surprised with a fourth-place finish at the
1998 British Open and turned pro the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost weep for him,'' said Ron Baddeley, knowing that Rose
had barely made a nickel as a pro. That explains why the father
pulled his son aside following the first round of the Bay Hill
Invitational three weeks ago. Aaron had played a near-flawless
round _ save for three balls hit into the water at the par-5 sixth
hole. The round of 75 had the young Aussie hanging his head.
</P>
<P>
   Did they talk about his mechanics?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not with me,'' said the father. ``I'm not a golfer. I'm
just telling him to enjoy, to stop putting too much pressure on
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike fellow phenoms such as Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia,
Baddeley did not swing a club while in diapers. He didn't start
playing until he was 12, which raises the question: How did he get
so good, so fast?
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked so hard. I quit cricket and would practice hours
every night,'' said Aaron. ``I asked a club professional, `How do
you get better?' And he told me to `hit balls till your hand
started bleeding.' So I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much, thought Ron, so a few years ago the father laid down
the law: There would be no golf on Sundays because the kid needed a
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys are too fanatical,'' said Lynch, ``but Aaron knows
where that fine line is between working on something and leaving it
alone and trusting it.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided 1999 was a good time to test the game at another
level, so Baddeley returned to the United States. He was second at
the Northeast Amateur, then second in the Western Open in Chicago.
Everything was going to plan, until Baddeley missed making it into
match play at last summer's US Amateur at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing,'' said Lynch, ``but it actually
worked out in our favor. We got to work on his swing and what was
wrong with it. We never would have won the Australian Open had we
not worked on the swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The win at the Open came in dramatic fashion, for Baddeley
played in the final group with Colin Montgomerie. The kid shot 69,
Montgomerie 71.While othersled the cheers, perhaps the most telling
quote was delivered by Baddeley himself: ``If Tiger Woods is the
best player in the world, then I've got to be better than Tiger.
Tiger's the benchmark, and I want to be better than the
benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley made the cut at the Honda Classic, missed it at Bay
Hill, and has already played seven practice rounds at Augusta.
Other exemptions will be accepted, but there is no official word on
when he will turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can play with these guys,'' said Baddeley, and
you'd be hard pressed to find anyone to disagree. There is,
however, a test to his maturity that will come when Ron and Jo-ann
return home and let him fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time,'' said Jo-ann. ``He is ready.''

NORTH DAKOTA GLAD TO BE BACK IN FROZEN FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday night was turning into Sunday morning a little more
than a week ago, and there was University of North Dakota hockey
coach Dean Blais in the middle of a downtown Minneapolis hotel
lobby answering the urging of the Fighting Sioux faithful and
dancing an impromptu jig.
</P>
<P>
   Happy times were here again in the land of the Fighting Sioux.
</P>
<P>
   They were headed back to the Frozen Four _ the NCAA's hockey
championships _ where they will try to repeat the success they had
last time North Dakota made a stand in the finals, without some of
the off-ice wildness that came along with the journey.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota knocked off Niagara, 4-1, in the West Regional to
punch its ticket to Providence and this week's Frozen Four. North
Dakota plays Maine Thursday at 2 in one semifinal. Boston College
meets St. Lawrence at 7 in the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Sioux had a bit of a tough time just getting to the
Frozen Four when they won it last time around in 1997. A World War
II fighter plane slid down the runway when its landing gear didn't
work and that closed the airport back home and the Sioux were a day
late getting into Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen it all,'' said Peter Armbrust, then a freshman
forward and now North Dakota's captain.
</P>
<P>
   They had a much rougher time of it shortly upon returning to
Grand Forks. What should have been a high time for celebrating a
6-4 title-game win over Boston University, quickly became a time
for sandbagging and trying to hold off high waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Red River flooded that spring and the university's hockey
players, along with the rest of the community, went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three days after we got back from winning it all, we
started sandbagging all over town.'' Armbrust said. ``You'd drive
around and listen to the radio and they'd tell you where to go.
They called off school and we basically tried to save the town. We
did that for a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The water won.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said get out of here,'' Armbrust said. ``You packed all
your stuff as quick as you could. Usually it's an hour to Fargo and
it was three hours. The interstate was flooded and it was basically
a line of cars for 70 miles. It was pretty crazy. We got back up
here a month after the flood and the town was totally torn up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the team's drama has been confined mostly to the
rink. And while the past couple of regular seasons have been super,
the postseasons have been super frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Fighting Sioux have been among the top-ranked
teams in the nation. Each year they had a bye in the NCAAs, meaning
they got to stay in the West and only had to win one game to get to
the Frozen Four. Each year, they lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Sioux were 30-7-1 and looking to come to the
FleetCenter and try to become the first team since BU in 1972 to
repeat as national champions. They lost to Michigan in the
regionals in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up, 3-1, or something and ended up blowing it,''
Armbrust said. ``I don't know how. Everyone was saying it was
basically our year. It was a shoo-in for us. I don't know if we
necessariy believed it. But the games we should have shown up for
and played our best hockey, we didn't. It wasn't that we were
overconfident or thought they were going to hand us the
championship. We didn't play well the night we should have. It was
terrible, looking at the seniors' faces and seeing the dejection.
We had such a great team, we couldn't believe we had lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Sioux were even better and were 32-5-2 and
planned a trip to Anaheim, Calif., to get their title back. And
lost to BC, 3-1, in Madison, Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hungry coming into the playoffs, real hungry, and we
thought it would be our year especially after losing the year
before,'' Armbrust said. ``We ran into Boston College and they just
outplayed us. It was the same old thing, not being able to send
those seniors out on a winning note. You kind of question your
game. Maybe you could have done something more. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the likes of Lee Goren and Armbrust and Jason Ulmer
and Brad DeFauw are the seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of guys and we had some stuff to prove, that we
could do the same things that the team last year did,'' said Goren,
who was drafted in the third round by the Bruins in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The past three years, North Dakota won the WCHA regular season
title. The last two years the Sioux then lost in the WCHA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they took the other route. They finished second to
Wisconsin in the regular season and then won the league playoffs
and carried momentum into the Regionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to tell the young guys, try to explain to them how
terrible it is to get to the NCAAs and not play your best hockey,''
Armbrust said. ``To have a chance and blow it. We don't have as
talented a team as last year but I think we work harder and we're
having a lot more fun this year. We don't feel the pressure we did
the last two years where everyone expects us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of tough losses at Wisconsin in the middle of January
may have helped as much as anything. North Dakota scored two goals
in the last seven minutes to tie the first night and then lost in
overtime. Then scored three in the last five minutes to tie the
next night. And lost in OT again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a kick in the teeth and cost us the league
championship,'' Armbrust said. ``That could have been it. We could
have thrown in the towel. But coach talked about how we played a
couple of great games. He pointed out how we played great hockey
and big deal if we don't win the league, try to win the league
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Won those. Won in the Regionals.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're back in the Frozen Four. Won this the last time they
were here, too. Something's got to give, since Maine won it all
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sioux will try to play loose again. Have some fun.
</P>
<P>
   And give Dean Blais a reason to dance another jig or two before
the weekend's over in Providence.

GARCIAPARRA STOPS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As he begins his fourth season with the Red Sox,
absent much of the controversy that cast shadows over his first
three openers here, Nomar Garciaparra sounded almost Zenlike Monday
about what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what to expect in the game,'' said the
26-year-old shortstop, who in three seasons has been American
League Rookie of the Year, runner-up for MVP in Year Two, and AL
batting champion in Year Three. ``Every year is different.
Everything is different. Who knows why things happen? They just
happen, because that's part of the game, part of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Sox begin their 100th season seldom have expectations
soared as high as they have for the Olde Towne Team, due in great
measure to the presence of the pitcher, Pedro Martinez, who will
attempt to win his third straight opener since coming to the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who complained regularly the last two seasons about
how lightly the Sox were regarded, is scornful of the
opinion-makers who now sing the team's praises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cracks me up,'' he said. ``Somebody who put us down as much
as we were put down, now they're saying we're good, but in the back
of their minds they think we're horrible. They're just waiting with
an `I told you so' attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Martinez was masterful, marvelous, and mythic in
pitching the Red Sox to their second straight berth in the playoffs
as the wild-card entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to say,'' Martinez said Monday. ``There's a
lot to do. That season is gone. That money is in the bank, what
they paid me for that season. It's up to me to do what I have to do
this season. I don't have a ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, asked if he thought it was fair to expect Martinez
to match his performance of last season, shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he goes out to pitch, you know you have to back him up,
put up some runs, play good defense,'' he said. ``You can't expect
him to go out there and strike out everybody. Sure, it happened
last year, and if it happens again, great, but you can't go out
there with the approach that it will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox begin this season against former Sox lefthander Jamie
Moyer with a new center fielder, Carl Everett, their 13th
consecutive different Opening Day right fielder, Darren Lewis, and
a 41-year-old designated hitter, Gary Gaetti, whose knees set off
metal detectors in airports.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg, who was the Opening Day catcher a year ago, is
on the bench, supplanted by Jason Varitek. Jeff Frye, who opened at
second base last season, is still on the club, barely. Jose
Offerman, who was the DH last season, is at second, with Frye a
$2.5 million backup. Bret Saberhagen, who was the No. 2 starter
behind Martinez, is back in Florida, attempting to engineer yet
another medical miracle, while last year's closer, Tom Gordon, and
aspiring starter Juan Pena are both sitting out the year with elbow
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   New faces in the rotation include Ramon Martinez, starting his
first full season with the Sox; lefty Jeff Fassero, who last season
pitched the opener for the Mariners before falling off the map; and
lefty Pete Schourek, two years after pitching the last game of the
1998 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have been uncommonly successful in openers, winning
three in a row, six of seven, and eight of their last 10. They're
also coming off a spring training in which their 11-19 record was
tied with the rebuilding Florida Marlins and those perennial
stinkers, the Milwaukee Brewers, for worst in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about it,'' Garciaparra said. ``When you
have a veteran ball club, sometimes you're not as concerned about
the results as you are about getting yourself ready for April. With
a not-so-veteran team, a young team, guys are trying to make the
team and ready from the first day of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra missed 27 games with assorted elbow, groin,
hamstring, and wrist injuries last season. He began camp this
spring by spraining a ligament in his right knee when he planted
his foot on a routine infield drill and the soft dirt gave way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird things happen,'' Garciaparra said, speaking not only
about himself but Pena, who was struck in the right wrist by a line
drive and apparently tore the ligament in his elbow. ``Think about
how you talk about the weirdest injuries that happen. You can get
hurt stepping out of your car.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he said, he doesn't make it a goal to stay
healthy. He just plays hard and hopes for the best.
</P>
<P>
   He has been around long enough that he feels at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel like a veteran? I guess in the sense that I'm
comfortable in my surroundings, I know what my surroundings are,''
said Garciaparra. ``I know how to get to Fenway and home from
Fenway. I know where the parking lot is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the personalities on this team. I know what needs to be
done. I'm not going to go and call team meetings, but the guys you
know, and have built relationships with, I know I can go over and
say something to them. Before, I didn't know how guys would
react.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, at least at the outset, is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can just go out there and play,'' he said. ``This has
been the first spring with no controversy. Think about it. First
year, `Oh my God, he's playing shortstop (instead of John
Valentin).' Second year, `He had a good rookie year, but now will
he (stink),' and the Mo (Vaughn) thing. Third year, `Oh my God,
Mo's not here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's `Hi, what's up?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now Pedro will offer the first response.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS LINKED GRILLED MEAT TO BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With barbecue season just around the corner,
scientists are offering new evidence that grilled, charred and
fried meat may pose a risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit appears to be a compound called PhIP, produced when
meat is cooked at high temperatures. Rats fed high doses of PhIP
develop tumors in their mammary glands, studies have shown.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists meeting here this week for the American
Association for Cancer Research conference are hearing about
additional evidence from a study of more than 900 women, a third of
whom had breast cancer. Those who said they ate lots of charred and
grilled meats had a two-fold greater risk of getting breast cancer
as women who rarely or never did.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, another study by German researchers reported at the
conference on Monday found that PhIP weakly mimics the female
hormone estrogen. That could explain why the chemical would do most
of its harm in breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a group of scientists at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore are reporting that women were at a greater risk for
breast cancer if they carry a gene type that speeds up activation
of PhIP and its chemical siblings, which are called heterocyclic
amines.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much new research coming out, the findings bolster the
idea that cancer is a complex disease triggered and prevented by
many different forces inside and outside the body, said Kala
Visvanathan, a research fellow at Johns Hopkins and lead author of
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not completely what individuals are exposed to, but the
combination of what they are exposed to and their genetic
profile,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists studying this potential link to breast cancer
cautioned that research in this area is fairly new and more work
needs to be done to confirm their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the evidence so far doesn't indicate that the risk of
breast cancer from eating grilled meat would surpass the risk
associated with obesity, alcohol consumption or forgoing pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Heterocyclic amines are compounds produced when amino acids _
the building blocks of protein _ react with creatine, a substance
found in muscles. The higher the temperatures, the more the
substances react.
</P>
<P>
   When meat is grilled, fat often drips onto the hot coals and
sends up flames, subjecting it to very high heat, said Rashmi
Sinha, an investigator with the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and
Genetics at the National Cancer Institute. Similar high-heat
cooking methods like broiling and frying can have the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sinha recommended braising, stewing or baking meat. If something
is to be grilled, she suggested cooking it partially first so that
it spends less time exposed to flames.

 A PAINTING IN THE BANK  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Vt. _ It hangs in a nondescript spot behind the
tellers' desk, with no plaque, no label, no fanfare. If you didn't
crane your neck, you might not even notice it _ let alone realize
that this painting of a tree, hanging in a bank, is worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But try to take the Maxfield Parrish painting from this little
branch office and _ as one art gallery discovered last winter _
you'll face the wrath of a town.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the affection Windsor's 4,000 residents hold for the
early 20th-century illustrator. And such is their determination to
keep the painting, even if they have to fight the waves of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Famous in his own time, when his whimsical figures and classical
scenes graced magazine covers, Parrish's pricey originals now hang
in posh hotels and movie stars' homes. But nowhere is he better
loved than in Windsor, where he's seen as a link to a cherished
past.
</P>
<P>
   From the height of his career to his death in 1966, Parrish
lived in an artists' colony in the woodsy hills of Plainfield, N.H.
But he conducted his business in Windsor, a small town of brick and
Colonial homes just across the Connecticut River, in the shadow of
Mt. Ascutney.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time he spent there, only one true artifact remains:
the landscape painting he gave employees of the Windsor County
National Bank in the early 1950s. He wanted to thank them for the
help they gave him, month after month, balancing his accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a clear-cut gesture of gratitude at the time, but
then, it was a simpler time. When Parrish gave the painting to
``the girls'' at the bank, Windsor County National was locally
owned and had just two branches. In 1967, it was bought by Vermont
National Bank, which itself was recently taken over by the larger
Burlington-based Chittenden National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of big mergers and financial conglomerates, the
painting on the wall has become the subject of new debate. And the
question of who owns it _ a succession of banks, or of people _
remains, to Windsor's residents, disturbingly unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Chittenden's president, Paul Perrault, is doing his best to
reassure them. He pledged last week that ``that painting is going
to stay right there in that office.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the more delicate question of ownership,
Perrault won't be pinned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a question that needs an answer,'' he said.
``Does it have to have an owner?''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the state of affairs last week, when the latest bank
merger turned official and complete. To a small town, this was a
big deal: accounts were switched, new checkbooks were distributed,
Vermont National Bank signs came down, Chittenden signs went up.
</P>
<P>
   And a group of aging residents known as The Trust, afraid for
the painting's future, held a closed-door meeting with their
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Trust, which claims ownership of the Parrish painting and
seeks to keep it in Windsor, is composed of 11 former bank
employees, most of them now retired, many of them old enough to
remember when Parrish himself came into the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Those were golden years in Windsor, a West Vermont town whose
legacy outweighs its size. In the 18th century, the Vermont
Constitution was signed here. In the 19th, a new wave of industrial
production was born in Windsor factories. And in the 20th, Windsor
was a commercial capital for an artists' and writers' community,
the famous Cornish Colony founded in New Hampshire by sculptor
Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire may have had the landscape they loved, but Vermont
had the commerce. So artists would regularly cross the local
covered bridge, beneath a sign that still warns, ``Walk Your Horses
Or Pay Two Dollars Fine,'' and go to Windsor's post office, stores,
and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything in small-town life, banking back then was a
social event, said Wesley Hrydziusko, a teller at Windsor County
National Bank in the late 1950s. ``Even if people didn't have any
bank business, they'd just stop in and chew the fat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But of all of the bank's favored customers, Parrish was among
the most beloved, Hrydziusko said. When employees saw his Cadillac
roll slowly up the street and pull up at the post office _ as it
did every six weeks or so _ they knew they were due for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute he showed in the doorway, he was greeted all over
the place,'' Hrydziusko said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish wore neat, dapper clothes and had a shock of white hair,
Hrydrziusko said. And he always told a stream of jokes, and carried
a stack of checks. Bank officials would escort him into the
cashier's office as workers settled his accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, to thank them for their help, Parrish gave
the employees a painting, titled ``New Hampshire: Thy Beloved
Hills.'' The image had been commissioned as a poster to promote New
Hampshire tourism, said John Dryfhout, chief curator at the
Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site in Cornish. But the original
painting was Parrish's to sell or give away. And it had the
trademark Parrish qualities: an ethereal, luminous glow, and the
electric-blue color the artist had copyrighted as ``Parrish blue.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the painting hung prominently behind the tellers'
desk. When Vermont National took over and built a new branch office
down the road _ a neoclassical sort of structure, with thin columns
and a portico out front _ the painting was placed in a similar
spot.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank eventually moved it to a side wall, to make room
for a promotional display. The bank was trying to standardize its
look, one former employee said, and the painting didn't fit the
motif.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was there, and Windsor's residents were satisfied.
Over the years, the painting has become part of the local
landscape, said Pam Sullivan, 55, who works in a store that sells
Parrish's artwork on tote bags, night lights, and soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have been there a long time just see it as
part of the bank,'' she said. ``It's just been there. It would be
like moving the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the painting has been a constant even as Windsor has
changed _ as factories closed, businesses left, and commerce
started moving in the other direction, from Vermont to New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But of late, Windsor has been trying to revive itself, with a
new crop of artisans, museums, and promotions. And it still has
civic pride _ a lot of it _ as residents proved in February 1999,
when the Parrish painting almost disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor Police Lieutenant Vincent Jordan remembers the morning
well; it was 7 a.m., toward the end of his night shift, when he got
the frantic call. It was a former bank employee, who had been
tipped off by a current one: Vermont National planned to sell the
painting, for $150,000, to the Currier Gallery of Art in
Manchester, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery had asked if the bank would sponsor an exhibit of
Parrish's work, said gallery spokesman David Juvet. The bank had
declined, Juvet said, but had offered to sell the painting instead.
The gallery arranged to pick it up on a Tuesday morning, Jordan
said, before the bank opened, at 8 a.m..
</P>
<P>
   But employees, past and present, didn't think it was the bank's
to sell. And they had what they considered proof: a letter from
Parrish's son, Maxfield Parrish Jr., which seemed to state the
artist's intent.
</P>
<P>
   Bank employees, the son wrote, ``made a visit by dad to the bank
a social occasion instead of a necessary chore. He appreciated it,
hence the presence there of this painting in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rushed to the bank and told gallery officials that the
painting's ownership was under dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, quite frankly, I really couldn't let the painting
leave the town,'' he said. ``I negotiated a stoppage of action.
Either that, or I take it back, and we hang it in the police
station.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank and gallery backed down, and the painting stayed. But
for weeks afterward, the town was in a tizzy. People threatened
lawsuits and boycotts. Bank officials issued an apology. And a
cadre of former employees banded together, hired a lawyer, and
formed the Trust _ filing legal documents asserting their ownership
claim.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since, the Trust and the bank have shared a cordial
detente. But, as many townspeople are quick to point out, the bank
has never given up its ownership claim. The matter has never been
litigated or settled, said Jonathan Springer, the Trust's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   And many residents say they're always ready for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll guard it with our lives,'' said Barbara Rhoad, 60, a
lifelong Windsor resident who remembers Parrish from her childhood
days. ``We're not a money-type people. That isn't important. It's a
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Trust's latest fit of consternation was overblown,
Springer insists; it stemmed from confusion about the Chittenden
merger.
</P>
<P>
   And Perrault, the bank president, said that while he intends to
get the painting ``spiffed up,'' he also plans to keep it where it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we don't need to have a big,
drawn-out battle about who owns it,'' Perrault said. ``I think
everyone's in agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but townspeople still don't feel secure, judging by
the hushed conversations in kitchens and living rooms. People still
speculate about why the painting hangs on the side wall _ does the
bank want someone to steal it? _ and talk about better places to
display it. They wonder about the bank's intentions. Some even
hatch half-serious plots about jumping over the counter and
whisking the painting away for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   And while the painting seems secure for now, Lieutenant Jordan
has considered the possibilities. So every night when he's on duty,
he drives by the bank and peeks in the window, just to check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep an eye on it,'' he said. ``Make sure it's still
hanging on the wall.''

WHEN SPORTS, LAW MEET, PROSECUTORS MUST WALK A FINE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nola Foulson is probably the only person ever to read Red Sox
slugger Ted Williams's book ``The Science of Hitting'' for its
legal insights.
</P>
<P>
   Foulson, the district attorney for Sedgwick County, Kansas, also
spent scores of hours last fall watching ESPN and CNN-Sports
Illustrated into the early morning, and not because she
particularly likes baseball, or any other sport for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I would just as soon watch grass grow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like other prosecutors across North America, Foulson
was struggling with the hazy boundary separating rule-breaking from
lawbreaking in contact sports, a debate that has raged anew since
Boston Bruin Marty McSorley was charged with assault in Canada last
month for smashing another player in the head with his hockey
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically at least, prosecutors have broad power and
discretion to bring criminal charges against violent sports
conduct. Even a hard cross-check in hockey or a beanball in
baseball could be interpreted as an assault under the laws of
Canada and most of the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet legal experts say prosecutors who must play referee often
find themselves making judgment calls without a rulebook. Athletes,
meanwhile, are given little or no guidance about what separates
conduct that could land them in the showers from conduct that could
land them in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly can be a very dangerous situation,'' said
attorney Randy Chapman, former chairman of the Massachusetts Bar
Association's Criminal Justice Section. ``Prosecutors have broad
discretion. That's the slippery slope everyone is concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Foulson's case, she had to decide last spring whether to
bring charges against Wichita State University pitcher Ben
Christensen, who it appeared had intentionally thrown a pitch at an
opponent during warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing player, Anthony Molina of Evansville University,
recently filed a $150,000 civil lawsuit alleging that he suffered
facial fractures, retinal damage, and permanent vision impairment
when the ball struck him in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Foulson found that a ``brushback'' pitch _ even
between innings, thrown at a batter who might be improperly
``timing'' warm-up pitches _ was essentially part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In her six-page report explaining why Christensen wasn't charged
criminally, she quoted no less an authority than Williams, who
wrote in his book that major league pitchers would sometimes brush
him back if he got too close to the plate during warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Foulson found that ``brushback'' pitches were tolerated under
NCAA rules and that Christensen did not intend to hit Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Foulson said she probably would have brought charges against
McSorley, which illustrates just how fine a line prosecutors walk
when sports and law intersect.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning moments of the Bruins' Feb. 21 game against the
Vancouver Canucks, McSorley hit Canucks winger Donald Brashear in
the head with his stick, sending Brashear crashing backward, his
head striking the ice. Brashear suffered a Grade 3 concussion, the
most severe kind.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, who said he meant to hit Brashear in the upper arm and
provoke a fight, was suspended for the last 23 games of the season
and lost $72,000 in salary. Because he is 36 and nearing the end of
his career, it's likely McSorley may never play in the NHL again.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors in British Columbia brought assault charges
against McSorley, however, many cried foul, including the NHL's
chief legal officer, Bruins president and general manager Harry
Sinden, and McSorley's defense lawyer, Paul Kelly, of the Boston
firm of Foley Hoag &AMP; Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement should never have been involved in this
case,'' said Kelly, a former longtime federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But equally vocal was a chorus of politicians, judges, and
prosecutors in Canada and the United States, including Suffolk
(Mass.) County District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II, who said he
``probably'' would have charged McSorley if the incident had been
at the FleetCenter in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers, the debate over the McSorley case points up
just how unevenly prosecutions are brought for conduct that occurs
during sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for instance, was McSorley prosecuted and not Christensen?
Just as the NCAA tolerates inside pitching, Kelly said, the NHL has
long tolerated fighting and tough-guy ``enforcer'' players like
McSorley and Brashear, who had fought earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer Mike Tyson, who unlike McSorley had a criminal record, was
not prosecuted for biting off part of Evander Holyfield's ear
during their 1997 heavyweight championship fight.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Limon, a high school basketball player in San Antonio,
was sentenced to five years in state prison for breaking an
opponent's nose with an elbow last year, and a 15-year-old Chicago
boy is facing charges of aggravated battery for a hit from behind
he made during a high school hockey game that left another player
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors such as Las Vegas District Attorney Stuart Bell,
whose office declined to prosecute Tyson, say a myriad of factors
go into a decision whether to prosecute, including how much
professional players implicitly ``consent'' to rough conduct in
their particular sport; whether the victimized player is willing to
press charges; and whether there is another forum for punishment,
such as a league or government agency.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Las Vegas police declined to charge Tyson criminally,
Bell said, was that the Nevada Athletic Commission was already
conducting its own probe.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous attempts by both federal and state lawmakers to
regulate sports violence have failed over the past 20 years. Kelly
said the lack of clear legal standards for prosecutors or police to
follow confuses players and allows outside factors such as
community pressure to dictate decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said his own research in the McSorley case has shown that
most prosecutions have been brought against visiting players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you should leave it solely in the hands of
judges and ambitious prosecutors,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Canada, known as ``crown attorneys,'' have even
more power than their US counterparts, said prominent Ontario
defense lawyer Richard J. Bosada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crown attorneys have a tendency to respond to community
views,'' Bosada said. ``That's the unfairness of it. The crown
attorney's personality is often a factor, and community feeling is
a factor, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal researchers say a much larger percentage of prosecutions
for on-field behavior take place in Canada _ where baseball player
Dave Winfield was arrested and charged with cruelty to animals when
his warm-up throw killed a seagull in Toronto in 1983. The charge
was dropped the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there have been numerous criminal cases brought
against NHL players, including several Bruins, but none has been
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   One NHL player, Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli, did plead guilty to
assault charges in 1988 and was sentenced to one day in jail.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, McSorley would be the first player ever found
guilty by a jury of assault.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have called the McSorley prosecution an
important ``message'' to younger players in an era where sports
violence appears to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one NHL player, the New Jersey Devils' Scott
Niedermayer, doesn't appear to be listening.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the NHL suspended Niedermayer for 10 games _ worth
more than $150,000 in salary _ for a two-handed chop with his stick
to the top of the helmet of Florida Panthers forward Peter Worrell
during a game. Worrell was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the game at home when it happened,'' said
Bergen County District Attorney William H. Schmidt. ``Certainly it
crossed the pale as conduct that warranted some action by the NHL.
But it did not rise for us to . . . an indictable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL needs to and should police their own sport. In most
instances, law enforcement authorities should not be involved.''

HARSHBARGER TAKES REINS IN CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What timing. Six months after taking the reins of
Common Cause, a granddaddy of good-government groups, Bay State
transplant Scott Harshbarger finds himself riding high on the
hottest horse in Washington, the drive for campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just a coincidence that both parties' presumptive
presidential nominees, plus some of Congress's strongest defenders
of the current money system, became born-again reformers just after
Harshbarger arrived in town. In fact, the Democrat who narrowly
lost the governor's race in 1998 says with self-deprecation that he
still doesn't get all his phone calls returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hershberger? Hamburger? It's back to the days of having to
spell my name,'' said Harshbarger, who, as Massachusetts attorney
general from 1990 to 1998, led high-profile campaigns against
tobacco, guns, legalized gambling, and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this new job _ president of Common Cause _ could be
Harshbarger's greatest challenge and opportunity. His mandate is to
energize and restore status to the 30-year-old citizens' lobby that
by most measures is showing its age. His mission is to lead Common
Cause in a year when, thanks largely to Arizona Senator John
McCain's assault on special interests, its signature issue _
getting big money out of politics _ has captured the public
imagination and has a chance to move in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary moment for Common Cause,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, who headed the group for a more than a decade. ``The
issue of campaign finance reform is attracting unprecedented
national attention, and Common Cause has been there from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiercely independent, Common Cause never has had a partisan as
president, and Harshbarger is taking pains to erase his Democratic
brand and play no favorites in the presidential race. This week he
called Vice President Al Gore's new proposal to ban unlimited
donations of so-called soft money and create a $7.1 billion
endowment to fund candidates ``a good, solid response'' to
campaign-finance abuses. But, Harshbarger added, he still has
doubts about Gore's sincerity and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are right, but how is Gore different from Bill
Clinton, how does what he says effect the 1996 presidential money
scandals, which were the biggest in history, and why should you
believe him on this issue at all?'' Harshbarger asked.
</P>
<P>
   He's no more charitable to Texas Governor George W. Bush.
Harshbarger says Bush adopted ``a phony reform proposal'' to beat
McCain in the GOP primaries and ``is not even in the same
ballpark'' with Gore because he defends soft money. And the sudden
interest by Senate Republicans in tinkering with the campaign
finance laws is aimed less at change and more at giving senators
political cover in the November elections, Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, it's a little hard to believe (Gore and Bush)
are going to pick up the reform mantle,'' Harshbarger said. ``On
the other hand, it proves they see what McCain and (Bill) Bradley
saw: that campaign-finance reform is a really salient issue in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harshbarger harbors ambitions for elective office _ another
run for governor in 2002, perhaps _ standing on a national platform
and exposing political hypocrisy isn't likely to help him win
friends in the Democratic establishment. Representative Martin
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who probably has his own eye on a
higher prize, said using Common Cause as a political stepping stone
``won't work'' for Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused of being holier-than-thou all of my
political career, and there is no point in being different now,''
said Harshbarger, insisting he likes what he's doing and ``the last
thing on my mind'' is running for office. ``As a practical matter,
it's our job to call them as we see them.''
</P>
<P>
   The job, which was offered to him by Derek Bok, Common Cause's
chairman and the former president of Harvard University, is a good
fit for Harshbarger. He said it allows him to stay in public life
and in touch with the kind of ethics issues that interested him
most as general counsel of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission, as
Middlesex district attorney, and as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave him a needed change of venue after a very
disappointing defeat in the governor's race, a bout of
post-election depression, and some career uncertainly for a
58-year-old ``former'' office-holder with a lawyer wife and empty
nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a little distance was important, so I wasn't
constantly thinking about what could have been, or what might have
been,'' said Harshbarger, who commuted to Boston each weekend last
fall but now has rented an apartment in Washington. ``I vowed I
wouldn't say anything about (Gov.) Paul Cellucci _ he won, that's
the ballgame, that's the way it is _ and besides, nobody really
wanted to hear my opinion, and nobody wants to hear you whine.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Washington was a culture shock. As a candidate,
Harshbarger said he was tuned in to the public's cynical view that
government is at best irrelevant and at worst tainted and corrupt.
Inside the Capital Beltway, Harshbarger found elected officials
tone deaf to the cry that Washington is the captive of special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable disconnect,'' Harshbarger said during an
interview in his spacious downtown office. ``People in Washington
see the world totally differently from people anywhere else in the
country. The feeling here is `the public is wrong. That's not the
way we do business here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A second surprise, Harshbarger said, was to find the community
of public-interest activists, supposedly led by Common Cause,
arguing about agenda, divided over tactics, and nursing old
grudges. How on earth were they going to win a war against the
powerful lobbyists on K Street, Harshbarger wondered, if the
reformers were fighting among themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why the other side can sleep at night,'' Harshbarger
said, recalling the industry's divide-and-conquer strategy that
defeated antitobacco legislation in 1998. ``They know their best
chance is to throw red meat out there and get the reform groups to
yell at each other and refuse to talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign, said Common
Cause was mostly to blame for the bad blood because ``like an
800-pound gorilla,'' it got accustomed over 30 years to throwing
its weight around and disregarding newer advocacy groups like hers.
``Scott has put out the peace flag, and I think it's working,''
Miller said. ``People are feeling a lot more generous these days
toward Common Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said one of his goals is to broaden the Washington
coalition of clean-government types to include civil-rights and
public-health groups and to mobilize more activists at the grass
roots. Another is to grow Common Cause's 200,000 membership and $10
million budget because both have been static for years. A third is
to use the Internet, a larger staff, and Harshbarger's
communication skills to raise the visibility of the organization
and make the arcane subject of campaign finance accessible to a
larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   He's already getting attention in some unexpected places.
Conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh recently gave
Harshbarger credit for questioning Gore's reformer credentials.
``He didn't criticize me, and he quoted me twice,'' Harshbarger
said, amazed.

lookout for oversized e-mail attachments that clog their networks.
Others seek to dissuade employees from using their systems for
personal activities. And others want to make sure employees aren't

&HT;     JUDGE SETS TRIAL FOR SUIT SEEKING TO BLOCK NEWSPAPER SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge fast-forwarded the future of San
Francisco's daily newspapers by setting a May 1 trial on and
antitrust lawsuit that seeks to block the Hearst Corp. from buying
the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker on Monday set the date for a
full trial after lawyers for Hearst proposed skipping an April 13
hearing on the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction
blocking the sale until a trial is held, which could have been
months off.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by Clint Reilly, a political consultant
who launched an unsuccessful campaign for mayor last year. The
lawsuit contends that the purchase of the locally owned Chronicle
would lead to New York-based Hearst's owning the only metropolitan
daily paper in San Francisco and would create an illegal monopoly
that would raise advertising and subscription prices.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has agreed to sell the afternoon Examiner, the company's
flagship newspaper, to the publisher of the Independent, a free
tabloid published three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and the Chronicle Publishing Co. have called Reilly's
lawsuit baseless, saying Hearst's plan to buy the morning Chronicle
and sell the Examiner would restore economic competition between
daily papers in San Francisco for the first time in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Walker last Thursday entered a temporary restraining order that
barred the sale until the April 13 hearing. Reilly on Monday posted
a required $100,000 bond to cover potential damages to Hearst and
Chronicle Publishing if his claims fail.
</P>
<P>
   Although the restraining order expires before May 1, Hearst
agreed not to complete its purchase of the Chronicle until Walker
ruled on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, the expedited trial avoids a potentially sticky
preliminary injunction and speeds a resolution to the future of the
Chronicle and Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is excellent news,'' said Timothy O. White, editor and
publisher of the Examiner. ``We're delighted that Judge Walker
recognized the urgency of this matter and was willing to be
accommodating and hold a trial on such short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's attorney, also was pleased. ``We are
more than happy about going directly to trial,'' he said. ``It's
great for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side predicted it would win at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has agreed to pay $660 million cash for the Chronicle,
Northern California's largest daily newspaper. The Chronicle's
daily circulation is 465,535, while the Examiner's is 108,968.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst separately agreed to transfer ownership of the Examiner
to the publisher of the Independent and provide a $66 million
subsidy over three years to cover costs of publishing the
newspaper. No purchaser was willing to buy the Examiner without a
substantial subsidy, Hearst has said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner and the Chronicle have published under
a joint operating agreement, an exception to antitrust laws that
lets them combine business operations and split revenue, while
maintaining separate editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is allowed under the Newspaper Preservation Act,
which was intended to keep alive newspapers with dwindling
circulation so communities would have the benefit of multiple
editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the temporary restraining order last week, Walker
ruled that Reilly had initially raised serious legal questions
about whether the proposed newspaper sales complied with antitrust
laws and met the goals of the act.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Justice Department has said that it had no
objections to the sales, and expected them to result in competing
newspapers, Walker said the department's ruling was not binding on
the courts.

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of its running length, ``Black and White'' is an
enjoyable, seemingly improvisatory mess about rich white kids who
want to be black, African-American gangsters who long to go legit,
athletes in trouble, angry undercover cops, earnest documentarians
and their gay husbands, and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to watch this highly varied assortment of curious,
dissatisfied individuals try on one another's poses and personae,
forcing their way into unfamiliar lifestyles and generally
reinventing themselves as they go along. There's a jazzy energy _
although the film is set to an insistent hip-hop beat _ to all the
sex and threat and giddy misbehavior, which is nicely underscored
by a general air of boundary-breaking acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   But after a while, writer-director James Toback finds it
necessary to impose some narrative order on all of the multiculti
shenanigans. And while the plot threads he bothers to tie up are
not uninteresting, they play as artificially as they inarguably are
against the film's vibrant mosaic of spontaneous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While the films' white folks move fluidly, if often
outlandishly, across contemporary New York's racial lines, the
African-Americans' efforts to achieve traditional success, while
spectacularly effective, are realistically fraught with more
difficulty and peril. The main plotline involves Rich Bower (played
by Wu-Tang Clan impresario Oli ``Power'' Grant), a Staten Island
crime lord who'd love to focus his energies on a music career, if
only he could convince frightened white recording studio owners to
let his crew cut a record.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's spectacular river-view condo is the site of an ongoing
party, where invited celebrities like Tyson and Method Man mingle
with teen-age crashers (Bijou Phillips leads that pack) from Park
Avenue and with the equally enthralled Sam (Brooke Shields), a
documentary filmmaker who just thinks privileged kids' fascination
with black culture is, well, fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   The film's funniest encounters are between Sam, her husband
Terry (Downey in his thousand-and-first impersonation of a flirty
homosexual) and the self-mockingly charming Tyson, who humorously
manages to steal every scene he's in. (``I'm on parole, brother,
please,'' is a typical, exquisitely timed response to one of
Terry's outrageous come-ons).
</P>
<P>
   The film's other designated sportsman, New York Knick Allan
Houston, plays a character who's in a more urgent legal bind. His
Dean, a straight-arrow college basketball star and childhood friend
of Rich's, is entrapped and blackmailed by undercover cop Mark (Ben
Stiller) into setting his friend up for a bust. Complicating this
tortured situation is the fact that Mark has a past with Dean's
girlfriend Greta, a sociology grad played by, of all people,
supermodel Claudia Schiffer (talk about no boundaries).
</P>
<P>
   There are many other subplots and relationships, none of them
particularly any more persuasive than those just illuminated, but
they're intelligently enough detailed to sustain your attention.
And this being a Toback film (his last one was the snarky ``Two
Girls and a Guy''), sex is a pretty prominent factor here. A lot of
that has its basis in stereotypical racial assumptions, but again
Toback brings solid, observational verity to the encounters that,
more often than not, give them a believable erotic charge.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Black and White'' isn't too sure about how to
characterize what Toback sees as the blending state of contemporary
racial politics. But when it's not trying to understand or explain
and just _ as the kids put it these days _ representing, this
flawed but intriguing movie manages to say quite a bit. &QL;

U.N. REPORT BLAMES POVERTY IN PART ON BAD GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
(js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After years of treading carefully around the
issue of why so many countries stay poor or get poorer, the United
Nations in a report Tuesday put a lot of the blame on bad
government, a message that many leaders seeking more aid and debt
relief do not want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the U.N. Development Program, the world's
largest aid agency, is a call to rethink traditional ideas about
battling poverty in the Third World. It reflects on a global scale
the debates within many nations, including the United States, about
why poverty persists even in an era of substantial economic growth
and political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The report elevates ``good governance'' _ the newest catch
phrase in development theory _ to the top priority in fighting
poverty by the development program's new administrator, Mark
Malloch Brown, whose organization supports a range of governance
projects. Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down
economic development and a host of other strategies will not work,
the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown, who came to the United Nations last year from the
World Bank, has drawn hostility from developing countries, which
accuse him of interfering in the internal affairs of governments.
That criticism has also been leveled at Secretary-General Kofi
Annan for suggesting that nations with human rights abuses can no
longer hide behind their borders, claiming national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is particularly important for me in terms of
skewering a particularly odd United Nations debate which flourishes
in this curious greenhouse at the East River,'' Malloch Brown said
at a news conference Tuesday, ``which is that somehow the U.N.D.P.
was getting out of poverty and into governance work. What this
report clearly demonstrates is that governance is a critical
building block for poverty reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Embracing democracy is often not enough, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having regular elections _ free and fair _ contributes to
accountability, especially if they are also held at the local
level,'' the report says. ``But such democratic forms are no
vaccination against poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, development experts now accept that local
governments, which are often neglected or nonexistent in the
developing world, must play a critical role in reducing poverty.
Historically, foreign aid has gone to central governments. When
donors could no longer ignore that aid was being siphoned off
through corruption or misuse of funds, nongovernmental agencies,
not local governments, were given the money or goods.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of development experts now believe that this
shift bred its own problems, as the private agencies invented
projects to get more money or funneled aid to meet their own
priorities, making national efforts disjointed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Big, expensive surveys of poverty are not much good either, the
report says. It recommends frequent and rapid studies to serve as
barometers of the effectiveness of programs and policies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Development Program's report, ``Overcoming Human
Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000,'' is being published as the
General Assembly prepares to review progress since the Social
Summit, the 1995 international conference on social development,
was held in Copenhagen. At that meeting member countries made three
commitments: to estimate the incidence of poverty within their
borders, to set targets for reducing or eliminating poverty and to
introduce anti-poverty plans.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying 140 of the United Nations' 188 members, the report
found that 77 percent of countries had estimated their incidence of
poverty _ including extreme poverty, measured by the inability to
buy enough food for daily needs _ but only 40 percent had
incorporated anti-poverty measures into their national planning and
29 percent had free-standing, dedicated anti-poverty projects.
</P>
<P>
   Countries with the most active and focused measures against
poverty were in the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Asia and
the Pacific regions ranked behind sub-Saharan Africa. The survey
highlights some of the successful projects found around the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report builds on the agency's pioneering annual human
development reports created by the late Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani
expert who shifted criteria for measuring development away from per
capita income figures to aspects of human life that play a role in
social and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Three categories used by the human development surveys _ adult
illiteracy, the proportion of children under 5 who are underweight
and the probability of dying before 40 _ are factored into the new
report. It shows most regions lagging on all three fronts, and
sometimes moving backward, even as democracy spreads.

(Eds: Retransmitted with Sidebar slugged Take Charge) 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Paltrow refused to submit to the cancer that burrowed
rapidly into his throat, penetrated lymph nodes and snaked around
his carotid artery.
</P>
<P>
   The film and television producer and his family plunged into the
mysterious world of cancer treatments with a literal lust for life.
They studied all the options and asked their physicians lots of
questions. Paltrow chose aggressive surgery, doubled the standard
radiation treatment and sought alternative therapies from
acupuncture to vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   The assault drove the throat cancer into remission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fistfight,'' said Paltrow, father of Academy
Award-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow. ``You have to go forward,
attack it _ do everything you can to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy won't work for everyone. But the attitude will.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow is part of a growing trend of assertive medical
consumers. Dr. David Feinberg, a psychiatrist at the University of
California, Los Angeles, predicts that within two years a wave of
assertive, informed patients will transform the medical profession,
bring foreign terms such as customer service and satisfaction into
the medical vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg, co-author of ``Don't Let Your HMO Kill You''
(Routledge; $14.95), is one of the leaders of this charge. His book
is one of several appearing on bookstore shelves that advises
patients how to manage their managed-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are already responding to the trend. UCLA's new $600
million medical center will feature warm, sunlit corridors, tasty
food and in-room family areas instead of cold, uncomfortable
waiting rooms. The hospital design is a nod to a future when
patients will have a choice on where to spend their health-care
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   HBO addresses this patient call to arms with a 2 1/2-hour
television documentary, ``Cancer: Evolution to Revolution,'' that
shows cancer patients how to take an active, aggressive role in the
treatment of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are expecting more from their doctors,'' said Joseph
Lovett, the veteran television health journalist who produced and
directed the HBO special. ``This show is not about miracle cures.
It's about knowing how to get involved, finding the latest
treatments as they develop and having as many options as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also fueling change. Medical Web sites _
government, non-profit and commercial _ make it easy for patients
to get enough information to pose intelligent questions. Doctors no
longer control all the knowledge. In fact, there is so much
information out there, most physicians can't keep up with it all.
</P>
<P>
   This health-care revolution has been a long time coming. The old
fee-for- services system sent health-care costs skyrocketing. HMOs
stepped into the picture in the early 1990s, promising _ and
failing _ to control costs. Feinberg said patients were left out of
the loop because insurers and doctors were accountable only to
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Patients didn't fit into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average patient asks four questions in a 10-minute
visit,'' Feinberg said. ``The typical physician interrupts within
19 seconds. There's not a lot of communication going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg said that companies such as Xerox that give employees a
medical allowance and let them shop for their own health plan, are
on the forefront of a new wave of medical care. Things tend to
improve when the person providing the service is directly
accountable to the customer, not to a disinterested third party
(like an employer).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Clarke, a University of Southern California physician
and co-author of ``Surviving Modern Medicine'' (Rutgers University
Press; $18), said a patient needs information and a psychological
edge to gain control of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an economic viewpoint, the supply side can treat
customers indifferently and get away with it,'' Clarke said. ``The
antidote to that is to be proactive. They don't need to be
adversarial or confrontational, but they do need to be active on
their behalf.''

&HT;     BUSINESSES WELCOME DIRECT AIR LINK TO SHANGHAI

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When United Airlines Flight 858 from Shanghai
touched down Monday at the San Francisco International Airport,
there were compelling business reasons for the airport to welcome
its arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The air link is an important milestone. It marks the first
direct, nonstop service by a U.S. carrier between San Francisco,
America's capital of high-technology, and Shanghai, China's
business capital and most populous city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reflects the great economic connection between Shanghai
and San Francisco,'' said John L. Martin, the airport director. ``I
fully expect China to be our fastest-growing market. Their economy
is improving; San Francisco's economy is booming.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is important to United, according to officials of
the Chicago-based airline. United is the leading carrier at the San
Francisco airport, where it has just over the half of the flights
and half of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is our largest international gateway,'' said
Bill Roy, United's director at San Francisco. ``We expect a lot of
high-revenue customers on this route. Most of the Silicon Valley
companies have offices in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The new flights, Roy said, will reduce flying time between San
Francisco and Shanghai, an official sister-city, to about 11 hours.
Until now, counting a change of planes at Tokyo's Narita
International Airport, it was 17 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai-San Francisco flights, now fives days a week, will
operate from the airport's new International Terminal when the $944
million structure opens Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Pacific, Shanghai opened a new
international airport last year.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses lobbied Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater for
the Shanghai service, Martin said. Some of those companies are
members of the year-old SFO Bay Area Business Coalition, a
nonprofit advisory group.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition will continue to lobby the Department of
Transportation in hopes of increasing Shanghai service from five to
seven days a week, Martin said. The Transportation Department
allocates slots to selected airlines based on negotiations between
the United States and foreign countries.

   Today is the 214th anniversary of the birth of William Rufus
Devane King, the 13th vice president of the United States. King
served only 46 days in office before dying of tuberculosis.

   Today is also the 61st birthday of movie director Francis Ford

<P>
   With this week's featured wine, let me make you an offer you
can't refuse. Think of a wine that's fruity, light and perfumed.
Beaujolais, right? And who's the self-proclaimed ``king of
Beaujolais''? George DuBoeuf. So the 1998 DuBoeuf Fleurie _ 4 stars
_ is a fine example of the bright, fruit-driven style of ``cru''
Beaujolais. As Robert Duvall (might have) said, ``I love the smell
of strawberries in the morning!'' And with warm (OK, hot) weather
approaching, put a bottle of this Fleurie in the fridge for about
45 minutes and then chill out. It costs about $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the entire range of Beaujolais, DuBoeuf also
makes other wines, such as Macon-Villages, Pouilly-Fuisse and a
Cotes du Rhone-style red called Milenage.
</P>
<P>
   A: Havana. Because of his ill health, he was forced to spend the
winter of 1852-53 in Cuba. By a special act of Congress, King was
the only person to hold one of the two highest offices in the land
who was sworn in on foreign soil.

   EUROPE-1900 (Paris) _ The art world has not escaped the tyranny

picking up one of Neff's works, the ``reader'' literally opens a

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown plunged into the stock market
in 1999 and made a killing on a series of initial share offerings
of technology companies, city records show.
</P>
<P>
   In a financial disclosure report filed Monday with the San
Francisco Ethics Commission, Brown said that he had amassed a stock
portfolio worth as much as $970,000 through a series of purchases
made last fall at the height of his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 different stocks Brown bought, 14 were computer or
Internet companies. Seven of the investments appeared to have been
initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Brown's stock picks were big winners, according to
a review of price data. The stocks in the mayor's portfolio, which
Brown said he had assembled in a series of buys between Oct. 1 and
Dec. 9, are worth more than double their purchase price, securities
data indicate.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Brown turned a 280 percent profit on an Internet
stock he flipped after holding for only two days.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, Brown said he had bought between $1,000 and $10,000
worth of stock in a Microsoft spin-off called Expedia Inc., an
on-line travel service. The stock's initial offering price was $14.
On Nov. 11, when Brown sold, the stock was trading at $53 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has done even better with two other tech stocks he
acquired when they first went public and since has held onto:
McAfee Communication Corp., which makes software to guard against
computer viruses, and Cache Flow Inc., a company that markets
computer network equipment. Both stocks have more than tripled in
value since Brown bought them.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, Brown's press secretary, said the mayor did not
have a new financial guru guiding him in his stock market foray.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he does not have a new financial adviser,'' she said.
``Like millions of Americans, he is kind of playing around on the
Internet and doing trading over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To guard against conflicts of interest, the state's Political
Reform Act requires public officials to file a report each year
outlining their investments and sources of income and gifts. The
law requires politicians only to estimate in general terms the
worth of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in his report, Brown put the value of his newly purchased
stocks at between $97,000 and $970,000.
</P>
<P>
   In other portions of the report, Brown said that he had sold the
Sacramento home where he had lived during his years as speaker of
the state Assembly. Real estate records show the house sold for
$207,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows that for the fourth year in a row Brown
was paid more than $10,000 by a Los Angeles law firm where he
moonlighted while in the Assembly. The city Charter bars mayors
from holding outside jobs, but Brown has characterized the annual
payments from the Christensen, White law firm as part of a
multiyear buyout of his San Francisco law practice.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brown took office, Stephen Besser, a former partner in the
Los Angeles firm, has become a San Francisco city lobbyist, while
his wife, Jacqueline Besser, shares $102 million in city contracts
through a management consulting firm she formed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also reported receiving more than $10,000 in stock
dividends last year from Harbor Bay Realty Inc., a company owned by
Alameda developer Ron Cowan, Brown's friend and former law client.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said in his report that he had received no gifts at all
during his fourth year as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Brown's report involved his stock buying.
According to the reports, he was buying technology stocks in the
midst of the mayor's race, even as he and other mayoral candidates
debated policy responses to the region's blistering,
technology-based economic boom, which is creating multimillionaires
but also pushing affordable housing out of the reach of many.

   CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service
has put the immigrant status of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez on the back-burner as the effort now shifts to placing the
boy in his father's custody if, and when Juan Miguel Gonzalez comes
to the United States ? which could be as early as today. But in
this 11th hour, will the Miami family give him up? And just how
does the INS plan to remove him from their home? What sort of
resistance will they run into in Miami's Cuban exile community?

must overcome what some call the take-no-prisoners ``Gates
culture'' to fashion a new settlement proposal more acceptable to

of round numbers this year. Exhibitions in Amsterdam, London and
Paris are currently celebrating the art of 1900. The aim of this

Cantet, explores class differences, corporate behavior, labor
relations and father-son strife with an unusual depth and subtlety.

   NEW YORK _ ``Get yourself around the room at least once!'' Lisa
Jo Sagolla calls out. She gazed out on auditorium where 26 pairs of
partners swayed or staggered, the graceful swan-like duos gliding
past the awkward duckling pairs. A quick-tempo jazz melody filled
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Two slow steps followed two quick steps, over and over and over
and over.
</P>
<P>
   The fox trot, after all, is a travelling dance. Sagolla's
dancing class dutifully circled the room, faces frozen in
concentration. Some even seemed confident enough to relax and enjoy
the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sagolla's class at Columbia University is a part of the latest
revival of ballroom dance, which has waxed and waned a number of
times in the past 100 years. Ballroom competitions boomed in the
1920s, and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers electrified the public
with their moves in the post World War II era. In recent years,
ballroom has achieved enough prominence to point it toward the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ballroom dance courses like Sagolla's report a boom in
registration, and even a Broadway musical, ``Swing!,'' along with
peppy Gap commercials, celebrates the smooth style of partner
dancing. And while it may be Grandma's passion, ballroom dance has
crossed the generational divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional studios have always been around,'' said Sagolla.
``Now a whole new generation is becoming aware of it and young
people are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Arthur Murray Dance Studio in Manhattan, Fred Kaviani,
the director, said enrollment has steadily grown from about 350
students last year to about 500 this year. Similarly, DanceSport
enrolls 200 new people each month, according to Candace Salas, the
studio manager. Currently, DanceSport instructs about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Students are willing to pay as much as $80 an hour to learn
shake their hips to the salsa, glide across the floor in a waltz or
throw their partners in a jitterbug.
</P>
<P>
   Zee Onuf, a graduate student in art history, is taking dance at
Columbia with her fiance to prepare for their wedding _ ``so we
don't make total fools out of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has this incredible elegance,'' Onuf said.
</P>
<P>
   More young dancers are attending competitions, too. The
Manhattan Amateur Classic, a yearly ballroom competition for the
New Jersey-New York-Connecticut area, has a division for juniors,
aged 6 to 18. About 90 junior couples from across the country
signed up this year, compared with 70 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes watch the competitions on television,'' said Karen
Seong, a student in Sagolla's class. ``It's kind of goofy. I didn't
know they were that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagolla said her 52-student class is always full. Students seem
to view ballroom dance as a safe way to meet potential dates, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are needing to reconnect,'' Sagolla said. ``A
generation of people grew up dancing apart now want physical
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Daphna Locker, co-president of the Greater New York United
States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association, cited fitness as
another bonus of ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the gym to run on a treadmill is boring,'' Locker
said. ``Ballroom dancing, if nothing else, is a partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Added dance teacher Amy Garcia of Fred Astaire Studios in
Manhattan: ``Physically you have to be using your body to its
fullest potential in terms of everything, flexibility and
endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate testimony to ballroom's popularity over
time is its candidacy to enter the Olympics. Ballroom cleared the
first hurdle in 1997 when the International Olympic Committee
recognized it as an official sport. If the IOC now accepts it for
Olympic competition, judges will score the dancers in such
categories as technique and style. Analysts say, however, that
because of the IOC's slow pace, that may take several years.
</P>
<P>
   But Locker is confident that day will come, with ballroom's
traditional image as an art form already beginning to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people don't look at dancing as a sport,'' she said.
``That perception will have to change. I think that's coming
about.''  &QL;

ASIAN COMMUNITY HAS DOUBLE VISION OF EYELID SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
 (mp)  (For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

School of Journalism at Columbia University.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Asian-Americans are identified by their eyes more
than any other feature. So for them, cosmetic surgery on the
eyelids goes to the heart of identity politics and ethnic pride.
</P>
<P>
   Among younger Asian-Americans _ especially those of Korean,
Japanese and Chinese descent _ one method of eyelid surgery has
gained significant popularity. Asian patients often request the
creation of an upper eyelid crease, or ``double eyelid,'' which
uncovers a portion of the natural eye contours, making the eyes
slightly larger, rounder and more amenable to makeup, as well as
exposing more of the eyelashes. The majority of Asians have upper
eyelids that appear to be taut from brow to lashes, rather than
segmented by a crease.
</P>
<P>
   Since non-Asians are typically born with double eyelids, this
procedure has been construed as ``Westernization,'' implying that
Asians desire a more Caucasian appearance. But many in the
Asian-American community argue that the point isn't to look
Western, but to look more like other Asians, many of whom have
double eyelids naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Westernization has sparked some criticism in the
Asian-American community. Maxine Hong Kingston and David Mura, who
write books concerning Asian-American racial identity, are
uncomfortable with the popularity of the surgery, and believe that
altering eyes, features by which Asians are so easily identified,
is an attempt to conceal or deny Asian heritage and conform to
mainstream American beauty ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evidence of internalized racism,'' Mura says. ``It really
indicates something about the way in which Asians in America are
indoctrinated by white standards of beauty. They feel less
beautiful than those who fit the Caucasian standard of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for that, Mura says, is the low representation
of Asians in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``People grow up watching the media, which is where people are
beautiful and powerful. You see very few Asian faces. The message
is: the way you look is not beautiful, or doesn't count, or doesn't
even exist,'' he says. He believes the American media also account
for much of the surgery's popularity in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the American media and American culture stretches
all over the globe, and can cause people to devalue their own
culture,'' says Mura says.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans who disagree with Mura's interpretation often
point out that a large percentage of Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese
are born with creased eyelids, although they certainly tend to be
shaped differently than those of, say, Caucasians. In fact, in some
regions, such as in southern China, as many as 70 percent are born
with them. In addition, double-eyelid surgery is enormously popular
in Asia, and has been considered attractive since well before the
infiltration of Western media. Therefore, many argue, Asians
seeking double eyelids are simply trying to look like the more
attractive members of their own race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire for double eyelids has taken on a strange idea in
the U.S. that Asian women want to look like Caucasians and that
they desire [moon-shaped) eyes,'' says Shi Kagy, editor of AsiaMs,
an online Asian beauty magazine (www.AsiaMs.net).
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, Asian women want double eyelid folds that look like
natural Asian type folds, and dislike the Caucasian type,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Eyelid surgery is the country's third most popular cosmetic
surgery, surpassed only by liposuction and breast augmentation,
according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The
society's board-certified plastic surgeons performed 120,001
cosmetic eyelid surgeries in 1998, twice the number performed in
1992. Most of the time the surgery, called blepharoplasty, is meant
to reduce signs of aging.But for 10 years, Dr. Jeffrey Ahn,
director of facial plastic surgery at Columbia University Medical
Center, has performed about 200 Asian blepharoplasties a year. He
dispels the idea that his patients have tried to obscure their
racial identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get a single patient asking to be `Westernized,''' he
says. ``A lot of doctors still call it Westernization of the
eyelid, which proves they have little understanding of the Asian
patients.'' He stresses the importance of going to a surgeon who is
accustomed to operating on Asian eyelids, because of the
fundamental differences in facial anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeon should have aesthetic appreciation of the Asian
eyelid,'' Ahn says. ``A lot of the Caucasian surgeons think making
it more like the Caucasian eyelids makes it more beautiful, and
that's where unnaturalness results.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John A. McCurdy, Jr. a plastic surgeon in Hawaii and author
of the book ``Cosmetic Surgery of the Asian Face,'' has performed
thousands of Asian blepharoplasties over the last 20 years. He
agrees that patients want to preserve their Asian characteristics _
but says that wasn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot's changed over the years,'' Dr. McCurdy says. ``It used
to be that Asian girls, especially immigrant girls, were requesting
the Westernization procedure. They wanted to look Caucasian. But
now what they're requesting is a procedure to enhance the double
eyelid while maintaining the other characteristics of the Asian
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the hourlong process of Asian blepharoplasty
involves excising a crescent- or tilde-shaped piece of skin out of
the eyelid, removing some of the underlying fat, and then stitching
the sides back together. There are different methods to accommodate
variation in the height and curvature of the desired crease.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of the surgery in the U.S. is $1,734. During
recovery, which takes about a week because of the painful swelling
and discoloration, the eyes must be treated with topical
antibiotics and cannot be washed.
</P>
<P>
   Ji Han, who had the procedure at age 15 by Dr. Ahn, is aware
that non-Asians might misunderstand her intentions. ``It's like if
a white girl got cornrows, people would say she's trying to look
black,'' she says. ``People always think they are being copied.''
</P>
<P>
   She insists that she had the surgery primarily to correct her
eyelashes and believes most Asians have the surgery for simple
aesthetic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my Korean friends had it done just because they wanted
bigger eyes,'' she says. Han, now 18, was encouraged by her
grandmother, her mother, and her aunt, all of whom she describes as
having naturally large eyes. ``Before I got mine done, we used to
look at Korean magazines or TV, and all the Korean actresses had
big eyes or had had it done. They think it's prettier,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But &UR;  &LR;  in any attempt to meet a standard, there's always a risk
of losing individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got it done, my parents said it looked nice because it
was rounder,'' Han says, ``but on the other hand something special
was gone. Uniqueness.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Han says, ``I think people look better the way they're
born.''

 By GUS G. SENTEMENTES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a slab of stone and the written word, Hali Weiss
is ready to take on the American way of death.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the design of our final resting places.
``Cemeteries today are horrible,'' said Weiss, an architect. ``The
idea of sameness in death emerged after the world wars. That notion
is convenient for cemeteries, where grave markers have to be a
certain size and graves must lie on a grid pattern'' to permit easy
grounds maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   What the traditional cemetery leaves out, Weiss said, are
stories _ those of the deceased and of the loved ones who visit the
final resting place. So, in 1992, Weiss founded Living Monuments
Inc. to try to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to work with friends and relatives to create a
tombstone that tells more about the deceased than when they were
born and when they died. It's a process that is therapeutic and
meaningful for her clients, she said _ and, she adds, too rare in
the funeral industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many other monument companies ``don't work with families to
craft a distinctive design that helps the customer come to terms
with the loss of a loved one,'' Weiss said. ``It's usually just
roses on stone. With me, if someone ended up with roses as part of
the design, they'd have to come up with a reason why roses are
meaningful to the person they're memorializing.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss has patented one design, the Scroll of Life memorial,
which takes its influence from the Buddhist prayer wheels that
surround Buddhist temples. It features a rotating black granite
cylinder that is engraved with the short biography of the
deceased's life, which Weiss helps her customers to write. She even
developed a workbook, with the help of grief therapists, that asks
the bereaved to recall the personality and accomplishments of the
loved one they are trying to write about.
</P>
<P>
   Other reminders of the deceased can be incorporated into the
design: Weiss can include pictures on the cylinder through a
photographic masking process.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who designs about 100 monuments a year, believes more
people will be looking for personalized funeral products in the
coming years. More than 77 million baby boomers will be turning 50
years old by 2015, and Weiss, a young boomer herself, believes that
more of them will take control of the death experience of their
parents and themselves _ the way they took control of the
childbirth experience in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her clients are college-educated, upper-middle-class
people from various religious faiths. With prices starting at about
$2,000 and averaging $5,000 to $6,000, a Weiss memorial is more
expensive than conventional headstones and simple markers, which
typically range from $600 to $3,000 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes clients aren't prepared for the process. ``I usually
meet with a customer four to six times. The client determines the
pace,'' said Weiss. ``But some people are overwhelmed at first and
don't come back for a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   The planning can bring up painful memories, too. Weiss remembers
one woman who wanted to design a memorial for her husband, who had
been dead for three years. The woman planned to take a picture of
the tree that they had been married under and then incorporate the
photograph into the memorial design, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She couldn't bring herself to do it,'' Weiss said. ``She just
couldn't take a picture of the tree.'' The woman never completed
the monument.
</P>
<P>
   Another client, a woman in her 70s, won't wait for family
members to design a memorial for her after she dies. She has it
already planned with Weiss, selecting the Handprints design for her
memorial. A bronze cast of the customer's hands is made while the
customer is alive, and the handprints are then incorporated into
the memorial design. Weiss made bronze handprints not just of the
woman but also of her children, who are in their 30s. The woman is
keeping the bronze hand casts on a wall in her house until she dies
_ and then Weiss will complete the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The personalized memorials have been a tough sell at some
cemeteries. Many have specific guidelines for grave markers and
memorials, and place restrictions on the size and material
composition of the memorial. Many only allow memorials and markers
made of stone, and bronze is often forbidden because thieves steal
it. Since her designs often go against the conventions of size and
materials, Weiss said she's constantly negotiating with cemeteries
to allow her memorials to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the industry, while applauding Weiss's efforts to
humanize the funeral process, think memorials are destined to get
simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a part of our society that is into conspicuous
consumption, and those are probably the people who don't mind
spending $5,000 for a personalized monument,'' said Lisa Carlson,
61, executive director the Funeral Consumers Alliance and an
outspoken critic of the American funeral industry. ``But there's
another portion of the boomers who are downwardly mobile. They're
going to find their meaning maybe in splitting up the cremated
remains among the relatives or spreading them somewhere the person
enjoyed being, like on a golf course or in a river.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you remember,'' she adds, ``the baby boomers were the ones
who made us recycle. The idea of pickling the body and sticking it
in the ground doesn't seem to be a good use of our resources.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Wall Street, the strut of men and women in
business suits tells the world that they are masters of their own
universe. But few notice the 100 or so homeless men who shuffle in
and out of a nearby unmarked doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep a low profile,'' said Joan Tappen, director of
outreach at John Heuss House, a drop-in center for mentally and
physically ill homeless men.
</P>
<P>
   When community members heard a rumor that a homeless center was
coming to their neighborhood more than a decade ago, they sued to
keep it out. But John Heuss House has managed to not only open and
survive, but to turn at least one enemy into an ally.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Huber was the owner of Delmonico's restaurant in 1985 when he
first heard about plans for the center. He imagined lines of
homeless people up and down the street, panhandling and driving
away customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen what was going on at 42nd Street and I was really
upset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the Bowling Green Association, Huber and other
local residents formed the Coalition to Advance Lower Manhattan and
sued to keep the John Heuss House out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position was basically `not in my backyard,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when John Heuss House won the court case, the Rev. Win
Peacock of Trinity Church, which runs the center, invited Huber and
others to help direct the center.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, Huber said, taught him that the homeless men
weren't lazy; they were sick and needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Huber now donates extra food like cannoli cream cake and
Manhattan clam chowder to John Heuss House from his latest
restaurant, Captain's Ketch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became one of our staunchest supporters,'' Tappen said.
</P>
<P>
   Located in a former restaurant at 42 Beaver St., John Heuss
House was founded 11 years ago by Trinity Church. It now prepares
breakfast and dinner for 100 men each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a French restaurant, I think,'' Tappen said pointing to
a wall of empty wine racks behind piles of cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, about 30 men sat in groups on steel and plastic
chairs around small, square tables in the main room. They talked
quietly and ate underneath the ceiling's bare ducts and fluorescent
lights.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4 p.m. and the men were trickling back from appointments
arranged by the center with counselors, social workers and doctors.
Snacks of macaroni and cheese, cookies and chicken were laid out on
trays.
</P>
<P>
   All of the afternoon's food had been donated from local
restaurants, but breakfast and dinner is cooked in the center's
huge stainless steel kitchen _ another holdover from the days when
it was a place of power lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's clients are bused nightly to beds at church
shelters, but some stay behind at the drop-in center, making do
with several chairs pulled together.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Polite, 32, sleeps on chairs in the center during the day
because he works at night. The chairs are uncomfortable, he said,
but if he weren't staying under Heuss House supervision, he would
``still be all screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here knows that this place is better than anyplace
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he suffers from drug and mental problems, Polite has
landed a part-time night job and has resumed studying to be a
registered nurse since coming to John Heuss House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been all improvement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the success stories at John Heuss House escape the notice of
the rest of New York's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Trading assistant Mike Dugan, 30, who was sitting in front of
the New Stock Exchange on break, said that in the seven years he
had worked there he had never heard about the homeless center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very surprising. I didn't think that they would put
something like that here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, Bill Crowe, a 35-year Wall Street veteran, was
also unaware of the center.
</P>
<P>
   But he said with an air of indifference, ``Nothing surprises me
in New York anymore.''

DATING SERVICES MATCH MEN WITH WOMEN BEHIND BARS 
</HEADLINE>

(Micahel Goldman is a master's degree candidate at the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia University.) 
 By MICHAEL GOLDMAN   
 c.2000 Columbia News Service   Ronald Bishop's marriage of 20 years
collapsed nine years ago. Since then, he says, there have been many
lonely moments.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So when the 53-year old oil-processing supervisor from Liberty,
Texas, hooked up with Carol Sevilla, he was elated. Now he has
someone to cherish on Valentine's Day, someone special to hang a
stocking for on Christmas and a partner with whom to share life's
disappointments and victories. ``She's the best thing that's
happened to me,'' Bishop says. ``We're in love.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop has never met Sevilla. That's because Sevilla, 25, is
an inmate at the California Correctional Women's Facility in
Chowchilla, Calif., where she is serving time for second-degree
robbery. She and Bishop have corresponded since he obtained her
address 10 months ago from an online dating service called
Prisonbabes.com. Bishop said once Sevilla is released they plan to
live together in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the fee he paid for the address, Bishop said, ``It's the
best $4.50 I ever spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisonbabes is one of a handful of online services that match
men with women behind bars. Most sites include pictures of the
women, as well as their biographical profiles and release dates.
Criminal records are not provided. Clients chose whom they'd like
to correspond with, then pay a small fee for the address. After
that, they're on their own, to write letters, make calls or arrange
visits.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Harris, 36, of Stockton, Calif., the founder of
Prisonbabes.com, said his service has yielded six marriages, and
many happy relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National
Organization for Women, said the sites ``attempt to exploit women
in difficult circumstances.'' Some clients also complain that they
are the ones being victimized, while some psychologists question
whether the relationships are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for Jailbabes.com, another online service, came
in a flash for Ken Kleine, the site's founder. After being fired
from his paralegal job, Kleine, 63, of Orange County, Calif., was
looking for work. When a friend who had been in prison mentioned
the loneliness she felt while incarcerated, Klein had his idea. The
former inmate offered to round up some prison friends to
participate, they passed on the word to other inmates and, in 1997,
Jailbabes was born.
</P>
<P>
   The site has since featured more than 3,000 women in 28 states.
Klein says it attracts 60,000 to 70,000 hits a day, yielding
hundreds of customers.
</P>
<P>
   The site's success can be explained in part, he said, by the
glut of young, single women in jail. The demand is fueled by other
factors. Referring to his ``jailbabes,'' Klein said, ``You don't
have to buy them lavish presents or jewelry. That's not allowed.
But you can talk about sex, politics or religion and have a chance
to see if there's any chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Habben, a clinical psychologist in the Chicago area who
specializes in men's issues, says there's a less elaborate
explanation for the attraction: desperation. ``The prospect of
going to a club or bar to meet someone,'' he said, ``is more
daunting than having a captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction might also have its roots in men's sexual
fantasies, said John Ross, a clinical professor of psychology at
Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New
York whose areas of expertise include men's sexuality and sexual
fantasies. ``The whole culture puts a kind of premium on kinkiness
and breaking all sorts of taboos,'' Dr. Ross said. ``This would be
one sort of major taboo to be broken, to be involved with a women
who's a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another explanation is offered by Wayne Myers, a professor
of psychiatry at Cornell University's Weill College of Medicine in
New York. He said that while women have been known to start
romances with murderers and other hardened criminals because of the
``danger aspect of it,'' the case of men being attracted to women
behind bars is an entirely different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much rescuing the fallen women, the damsel in
distress,'' Dr. Myers, a sex addict expert, said. ``You are saving
the women from the state she has fallen to and you're going to
bring her back from her fallen state, back to respectability. And
therefore you become very manly. There's a sense of hyper-potency
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Gary, a 34-year-old information technology
salesman from Anaheim, Calif., who declined to give his last name,
a relationship with an incarcerated woman is not very different
than any other relationship. He met Lisa, an inmate in the
Chowchilla, Calif., prison a couple of months ago while using the
Jailbabes service, and has been corresponding with her since.
``It's something that absolutely just clicked. We're attracted to
each other and I get a good sense that we want the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relationships fostered through the services, however, seem
to be on shaky ground. Bishop, the Texan, says that his mate, Carol
Sevilla, told him she is Asian, has been in prison only three years
and is to be released in December 2001, at which point she will
move to Texas to start her life anew with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Margot Bach, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Corrections, which operates the prison in which Sevilla is
incarcerated, tells a different story. According to prison records,
Sevilla is an illegal immigrant from Honduras serving an eight-year
term. Her earliest possible release date is February 2003.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Bach said that California inmates must generally
serve a three-year parole period in their counties of residence,
which in Sevilla's case is Los Angeles. But since Sevilla is an
illegal immigrant, when she does come up for parole, Bach said, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service may deport her.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise to David Smith, a 58-year old computer
programmer from Hartford, Conn., who's contacted eight or nine
incarcerated woman over the past two years using various services.
He says that although he's now found a stable relationship using
one of the services, he had been lied to repeatedly by other women.
``The big problem,'' he said, ``is that many of these girls are
writing many guys, sometimes between 15 and 20 of them, and
promising to marry five or six of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The motivation, he said, is money. Except in the case of his
current mate, every woman he has written to has asked for it in her
first letter. ``It starts with $20, which I have no problem
sending,'' Smith said. ``But by the time you write a half-dozen
letters, $20 has turned into $200, or $300.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the founder of Prisonbabes, said he does not check the
accuracy of the claims made by women on the service, but regrets
any dishonesty on their part. Klein, the operator of Jailbabes,
said he makes inquiries only when he comes across information that
appears ``suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes no difference to Bishop. When told of the
discrepancies between what the California Department of Corrections
and Carol Sevilla say about her record, Bishop said, ``looks like
the service ought to have dug a little deeper rather than just
taking her word for it.'' But even if Sevilla lied, ``I can
understand that,'' he said. ``There are things I haven't wanted to
tell her either. This really doesn't change nothing.''

VEGANS HAVE A SWEET TOOTH, TOO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Birthday parties. Holidays. Weddings. When it comes
to such occasions, it's hard to imagine not clearing the table to
make room for dessert. But for the ever-growing vegan population,
the usual sweets just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Vegans, or strict vegetarians, eat no animal products
whatsoever. Not only must they stay away from dairy products, they
must avoid treats made with certain brands of white sugar, which is
often processed with bone char. And they can forget about eating
anything with gelatin in it. A contingent of vegans also eliminate
honey from their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Now bakers across the nation hoping to tap this market are
offering treats that eschew animal products _ so that vegans don't
feel left out of any special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Rivers started her own vegan bakery business in the
Seattle area nearly three years ago just because so few vegan
treats were available in mainstream stores. Rivers specializes in
cookies and brownies, but she can also be persuaded to make wedding
cakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other product out there that meets my standards
for what I choose to eat,'' said Rivers, who was a vegetarian for
11 years before going vegan three years ago. ``Ninety percent of my
diet is organic, and most of my products are organic.''
</P>
<P>
   These options are essential, said Tiffany Refior, who lives in
Montclair, N.J., and is listed on about.com as the guide to
vegetarian cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having a wedding cake would be a big deal for some
people,'' Refior said. ``In that sense, they would feel left out of
the tradition. So they try to find bakers who can make something
that looks like a traditional cake, but is strictly vegan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Simmons, a vegan baker in South Euclid, Ohio, said she
can customize a wedding cake to suit vegan specifications without
compromising the taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``When non-vegans eat my vegan chocolate cake, they don't
realize there's anything different about it,'' Simmons said. ``The
vegan white cake does taste a little different than a regular white
cake because of soy milk,'' she said, but ``it still tastes very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Another vegan baker, Leena Isac of Penfield, N.Y., has received
four orders for vegan wedding cakes since January. A vegan herself,
Isac said she understands the rationale used by many brides and
grooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people go vegan for ethical reasons, so they don't
want to serve dead animals at their wedding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Or other holidays, for that matter. Throughout the year _ and
especially around Valentine's Day _ Pangea Vegan Products of
Bethesda, Md., sells a gourmet Belgian chocolate assortment that is
popular among vegans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``These chocolates contain no dairy, egg albumin, honey or other
ingredients that are unsuitable for the vegan lifestyle,'' said
Shari Kalina, a spokeswoman for Pangea.
</P>
<P>
   Having that option is a good thing, said Matt Ball, the
executive director of Vegan Outreach, an advocacy group based in
Pittsburgh, Pa. But he insisted it's not the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that since there have been vegetarians throughout
history, there have always been people who have sought out
non-flesh-based meals,'' Ball said. ``I enjoy making a
`traditional' meal for Thanksgiving and Christmas, using seitan'' _
wheat gluten _ ``as a substitute for flesh. But even though I enjoy
`traditional' things, I have never felt that holidays were about
any particular food or material item.''

 MUSICIAN BRINGS THE SOUNDS OF CHINA TO THE U.S.   (For use by New
York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as desired)  
(C.M. Lanzillotti is a master's degree candidate at the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia University.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Atop a narrow flight of steps on the third floor of a
midtown New York building is a modestly stocked Chinese souvenir
shop, managed by one of the most famous musicians China has ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   But the musician, Wei Zhang, has given up a life of fame and
fortune to fulfill his musical dream: the fusion of his ancient
traditional-sounding wind instrument with jazz and rock.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang plays the sheng, one of the oldest wind instruments in the
world and one of the most difficult to play. In China, he was a
teacher at the prestigious Jianjin Conservatory of Music and played
to audiences around the country. But he came to the United States
three years ago at the invitation of the Tung Ching Chinese Center
for the Arts in New York, and decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay and learn about Western music,'' he says, and
plans to remain in the States a few more years. ``For 20 years I've
tried to modify my music _ I'm following the new Western styles to
bring it back because that's what young people in China like.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang learned to play the sheng, a two-foot-tall instrument
consisting of 19 pipes and 24 fingerholes, when he was 11,
encouraged by his parents to find a vocation that was safe from the
purges of the Cultural Revolution. Now 43, he is one of fewer than
100 musicians who have mastered the instrument. Its history goes
back 4,500 years, and its sound is closest to that of a flute with
many pipes.
</P>
<P>
   He has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and many
universities but most often at the New York Chinese Cultural
Center, where he is a member. But to support himself and his goal
of combining the Western and Chinese sounds, he works at the
souvenir shop, where Chinese tourists come not only to buy relics
of America, but to meet someone they've only heard or seen on radio
or TV. But even in China, the instrument was a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Sook San Ho, 25, a student from Singapore who is of Chinese
descent and grew up with a familiarity of both Eastern and Western
music, had never seen the sheng before seeing Zhang play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' she says. ``It's
bulky and fat, unlike other wind instruments. Surprisingly good
music comes out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She says it reminds her of the ``sounds of home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's audiences are still overwhelmingly Chinese, said Chan
Suey Ping, 48, who has seen Zhang play at the Chinese Cultural
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Westerners probably don't know how to appreciate this
music,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But fans say the musician must nurture his Chinese audience in
the United States and then gain interest with Americans if he is
ever going to realize his dream of fusing Eastern and Western music
and making it popular.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Wang, 43, who has seen Zhang play at Queens College, says
the key is capturing the attention of young Chinese-Americans _ who
appreciate rock 'n' roll more than traditional tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang says he wants to appeal to both Chinese and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Americans learn about my music,'' he says, ``the more
we can understand each other, and have a strengthening of ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Westerners are still very surprised by this instrument,''
he said. ``They've never seen it before, and they find it very
strange.''

   TOKYO _ Their prime minister was lying in the intensive care
unit of a local hospital, kept alive by a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   The media was full of stories about how their elected
representatives had lied about the gravity of his condition in
order to put in place a succession plan before critics could raise
their voices. The very legitimacy and credibility of their
political system had been thrown into question.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese people barely shrugged. ``I am from Kagoshima
prefecture, where a former governor collapsed and the prefectural
officials hid it for some time,'' said Yoshiko Sano, a 48-year-old
housewife hurrying through Ginza, Tokyo's premier shopping
district, who described herself as a ``typical'' Japanese.
``Everything here is always hidden behind a veil, which means that
even if they make timely announcements, I am doubtful about the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden stroke that put a sudden end to Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's tenure and focused world attention yet again on the
back-room horse-trading that determines how this country _ the
world's second-largest in terms of economic muscle _ functions
politically has elicited little more than a shrug from most
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of outrage that in the West might have greeted the
deliberate obfuscation that surrounded Obuchi's illness and the
peremptory manner in which elders of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party determined his successor was treated as business as usual by
Japanese interviewed on the streets. ``Hiding important things is
done everyday,'' said Reiko Inoue, a 49-year-old housewife. ``And
it doesn't matter who becomes prime minister. Nothing will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some even expressed a bit of understanding about the way news of
Obuchi's tragedy has been handled by the political leadership. ``I
suspect that they may be concealing a lot more, but there are a lot
of things probably only the insiders can understand,'' said Kiyoshi
Kojima, a 54-year-old salary man. ``You know we salarymen, even
among ourselves, there are a lot of things that are hard to explain
to outsiders.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many had assumed from the beginning that they were being lied
to. Obuchi fell ill after a meeting with Ichiro Ozawa, the leader
of one of the ruling party's coalition partners who has a
well-known history of ``kumogakurei,'' literally ``hiding behind
the clouds,'' when faced with adversity. Ozawa had told Obuchi that
he and several members of his party intended to abandon the
coalition, and many people assumed that the prime minister had
simply reached into Ozawa's bag of tricks and done a disappearing
act in response to the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the news that he was in the hospital, I
doubted that it was really true,'' said Masashi Higuchi, 30, who
works at a trading company. ``I suspected he had simply fled to the
hospital to hide after his meeting with Ozawa.''
</P>
<P>
   Makiko Ezoe, 24, said she initially assumed the same thing.
``When I heard his secretary had said he didn't know where he was,
I thought of Ozawa and his habit of kumogakurei,'' she said. ``But
then I had second thoughts. Mr. Obuchi is not the kind of person
who would do that. He seems too kind-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several of those interviewed expressed a tender fondness
for their soon-to-be former prime minister that was often lost in
characterizations of him that compared him to ``cold pizza'' and an
``oji-san,'' or old, bumbling man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that Mr. Obuchi was really kind and gentle to the
people around him,'' said Goro Takano, 33, a literature major at a
local university. ``Probably his life was shortened because he
worried too much about taking care of others. In that sense, I feel
sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, many yearned for a different kind of
leader, someone less concerned with the traditional effort to
promote consensus and harmony and more of an activist, someone more
like Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara. ``Personally, I want someone
like Ishihara, who has strong leadership and solid beliefs,''
Higuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiro Mori, the secretary-general of the ruling party and the
man widely reported to be Obuchi's successor, is a polar opposite
of Ishihara, whose recent success in passing a bill that will levy
a special tax on big banks has made him something of a folk hero
among city residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want somebody who is young and fresh and can exercise
leadership to replace Mr. Obuchi,'' said Shinji Yamada, a
55-year-old salaryman. ``But I can't have such great expectations
about Mr. Mori. There's nothing new and fresh about him.''

GORE SAYS CUBAN BOY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO FATHER ON U.S. SOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In anticipation of the arrival of Elian Gonzalez's father in the
United States, Vice-President Al Gore said Tuesday that the father
should get custody of his son if he declares in this country that
Elian should go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore said that Elian and close family members from
Cuba should be granted permanent residency status in the United
States until a legal battle is resolved over the boy's future. But
Gore said his comments Tuesday were not a change from his earlier
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the father says on free soil that he believes that the son
should go back to Cuba with him, that of course is likely to be
determinative, but he has to be allowed to say that free of
intimidation,'' Gore said on NBC's ``Today'' show. The father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, should have the chance to state his position in
family court, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore re-asserted his previous position, saying that Elian, his
father and close family members should be given permanent residency
while the issue of where the boy belongs is settled in family
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, I have said that, at heart, this is a
custody matter that should be handled in a domestic relations court
with expertise in these matters,'' Gore said in a written statement
after his ``Today'' show appearance. ``This court's guiding
objective should be the best interest of the child _ not diplomacy,
not politics, not immigration precedents.''
</P>
<P>
   Both President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno endorse
the boy's return to Cuba as soon as possible with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumed Democratic presidential candidate, has been
criticized by his likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, over his handling of the Elian issue. Bush has accused the
vice president of switching positions on the issue _ and breaking
ranks with the White House _ in order to cull favor with
Cuban-Americans, an important voting bloc in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statements Tuesday came a day after the State Department
issued visas for Gonzalez and five other Cubans that would allow
them to fly to the United States to reunite with Elian.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Elian was discovered by fishermen in an inner-tube
off the Florida coast, one of three survivors of a capsized refugee
boat. His mother and 10 other Cubans drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was given temporary residency and placed in the care of
his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, in Miami. But like many
Cuban-Americans whose families fled President Fidel Castro's
communist regime, Lazaro Gonzalez does not want to see Elian
returned to Cuba. He has filed an appeal with a federal court in
Atlanta to compel the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
grant the boy an asylum hearing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal officials resumed negotiations with Lazaro Gonzalez
Tuesday to try to persuade him to surrender Elian to the boy's
father, at least temporarily, if the father comes to retrieve him.
As a condition of the handover, the father would have to stay in
the United States through the appeals process, Maria Cardona, an
INS spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said he would allow Elian's father to come to the United
States alone if he could bring the boy back immediately, or to come
with an entourage of 27 other Cubans if they had to wait through
the appeals process. The 28 visa applications were submitted on
Monday morning to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Officials
granted visas to Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his second wife, their
infant son, one of Elian's favorite cousins, the boy's kindergarten
teacher and a pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, a State Department spokesman, said on Monday
night that the other 22 applications are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives said
that even if Elian's father came to Miami, they would not let him
take custody because of potential ``psychological harm'' to the
boy. But on Monday morning, Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami
relatives, said that his clients would like to meet with the father
to discuss the issue ``as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez could arrive in the United States as early
as Tuesday. So far, the Cuban government has not said whether the
father will have to wait until the State Department issued the
other 22 visas. Castro's proposed entourage includes Elian's
teachers, classmates and relatives, as well as psychiatrists and
other medical personnel and a high-ranking official, Ricardo
Alarcon..
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Interests section in Havana will be submitting a list
of questions to the Cuban government concerning these requests for
visas to determine the merits of the individual cases,'' Rubin said
in a written statement on Monday.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The Sabbath: Make it what you will
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I was sitting in church Sunday morning,
listening to the sermon and feeling pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the preacher was telling us about Jesus. And I
love to hear the story, the old, old story.
</P>
<P>
   For another, my two newest grandchildren _ both boys and both
born in January _ were at church as well, to the extent that they
were in the church nursery. You got to start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That's an old, old story in itself. Our small folk of
grandchildren, four in all, represents the fifth generation of my
family to attend services at the First Baptist Church of Lufkin. No
use to stop now.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, the subject was Jesus, from the Book of John,
sixth verse, recounting how He had healed a man on the Sabbath _
``Take up your bed and walk,'' Jesus commanded _ and, as a
consequence, had raised holy hell with the Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard this story before. I think I've heard them all
before. Each time, though, if I listen, I'll get a little something
different from it.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the part of how the sick would sit beside a certain
pool of water, waiting for the surface to be stirred by an angel,
the signal that the water now contained healing powers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bit beyond my comprehension. Best that I leave it to
those who better understand miracles, forms of which still happen
even unto today, some people will tell you. I wouldn't argue
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus singled out the individual that he did because, sick as he
was, the man had no way to drag himself into the water, crowded as
the banks were with others in need of healing.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it often works. Just when it seems you have lost all
hope, suddenly, everything turns out exactly as you dreamed it
would.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe something like that has happened to you. Maybe you called
it a miracle. Maybe you were right. I wouldn't argue otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus' problem with the Jewish leaders was that He had broken
the law. The law said you didn't work on the Sabbath. Healing was
work. The law was the law.
</P>
<P>
   Here's something I learned from the sermon that I didn't know
before: That the details of the law were such that if you so much
as dug your foot into the dirt while just sitting there, otherwise
doing nothing, that was considered a form of cultivating the soil
and you were guilty of breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   When the religious leaders confronted Jesus on a similar issue,
what He said was this: ``The Sabbath was made for man, not man for
the Sabbath.'' I wouldn't even begin to argue with that. Neither
could they, which made them even madder.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus said so many wonderful things about human rights that were
perfect not only for the times in which He lived, but for all
times.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, as you may know, so admired the philosophy of
Jesus that he whittled down his Bible so that it included only His
words and stories. But he had to keep it hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Because in the time of Thomas Jefferson, it was against the law
to alter the Bible, and you could go to jail for doing so even in
the privacy of your own home.
</P>
<P>
   We've progressed somewhat. But even in our times, my wife _ good
church woman that she is _ won't attend a movie on Sunday for
anything. That's the way she was raised, that's the way she raised
our daughters and that's likely the way they'll raise our
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that my wife allows that it's OK to watch movies on
TV in the privacy of your own home.
</P>
<P>
   If that makes sense to you, you're likely as good a church
person as she is.
</P>
<P>
   What would Jesus do? I don't think He would argue with her
either.

SHAD ROE REQUIRES A SOFT TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shad roe is something like foie gras: rich, filling
and delicious, as long as it is' prepared gently and not
overcooked. Too often, though, it is sauteed, and for so long that
it tastes as gritty as a bag of sand.
</P>
<P>
   With such a short season, from now through May, it deserves to
be cooked carefully. Shad, the largest members of the herring
family, migrate to the rivers of the East Coast every spring. It is
a big, bony fish (filleting it properly is an increasingly rare
skill), with moist flesh that is not unlike that of salmon. But its
huge egg sacs, which come in pairs held together by a thin
membrane, are the real attraction. They are filled with millions of
eggs, which if properly cooked are creamy and rich, almost like
fine organ meat. As a bonus, the exterior membrane becomes slightly
crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Most people try to saute shad roe, a process that too often
leaves the eggs separate and grainy. My technique is not sauteing,
nor quite poaching. I use a nonstick pan and cook the roe in a
little butter, but gently, just enough to guarantee good flavor and
a nicely browned crust. The cooking time is about three minutes on
a side, just long enough to firm up the roe to the equivalent of
medium-rare. You can cut into it to check the doneness, but you can
also tell by how firm it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most heavy, rich foods, shad roe is best finished with
something sharp, like capers, vinegar or mustard. The recipe here
produces a fast mustard sauce, but you can use the same technique
with a tablespoon or two of capers or vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most luxury ingredients, shad roe is not all that
expensive _ $6.99 for a large pair at Citarella last week. One pair
will serve two people.
</P>
<P>
   SHAD ROE WITH MUSTARD
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 large pair shad roe, about 12 ounces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley for garnish, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat an 8- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for a
minute or two, then add the butter. When butter melts, gently lay
the shad roe in the pan and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Cook
for about 3 minutes, or until the underside is lightly browned.
</P>
<P>
   2. Turn very gently with a large spatula, and season the cooked
side. Cook another 3 minutes or so, again until the underside is
lightly browned. By this time the roe should be firm to the touch;
if it is still soft, cover the pan and cook a minute or two longer,
cut into it to check. When done, the center will be red and the
area surrounding it pink.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove the roe to a warm plate, and stir in the mustard and \
cup of water. Raise the heat to high and stir with a wooden spoon
until the sauce is smooth and thick. Spoon over the roe, sprinkle
with parsley if you like and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: For shad roe with bacon, omit the butter and begin by
cooking 4 thick slices of good bacon over medium heat until the fat
is rendered and the bacon is done; remove the bacon and keep warm.
Cook the roe in the bacon fat, as above. Serve the roe and bacon
with lemon wedges, garnished with parsley.

   NEW YORK _ Almost 30 years ago James Beard was complaining about
the asparagus available in the supermarket. ``Nowadays,'' he wrote
in ``American Cookery'' (Little Brown, 1972), ``it is cut
shockingly long _ obviously to increase the weight _- and the waste
is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed. A pound of asparagus yields only about half
a pound of edible stalk. Your chances of getting a better yield,
not to mention better flavor, are directly proportional to how far
the asparagus have traveled.
</P>
<P>
   The best asparagus is always from your own garden, or at least
from a field within a couple of hours of the market. Just like
corn, those beautiful spears begin to lose their sweetness and
tenderness the moment they are picked.
</P>
<P>
   From March to May their fresh bright spring flavor is at its
peak. This is the time of year for people who don't want to load up
on cream and butter to make things taste good. Naked asparagus
spears rival peanuts for their can't-eat-just-one quality, but they
have even more advantages for good eating.
</P>
<P>
   They never appear on the Hit Parade of meganutritious vegetables
like broccoli or carrots, but they are little storehouses of some
important vitamins that are not easy to get enough of, particularly
some of the B vitamins. A 6{-ounce serving contains a little more
than the entire daily recommended daily intake of vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   Team asparagus with a roasted red pepper salsa and you not only
increase the Vitamin A but you also add significant amounts of
Vitamin C. I'd give up carrots for asparagus any day.
</P>
<P>
   Asparagus is one of the better sources of folate or folic acid,
which helps reduce the risk of two birth defects, spina bifida and
anencephaly. A portion of asparagus, 6{ ounces, provides 256
micrograms of the nutrient, more than half of the recommended daily
intake of 400 micrograms a day.
</P>
<P>
   Folate and Vitamin B6 have also been shown to reduce the risk of
heart attacks. And while the levels of Vitamin B6 are not great in
asparagus there is some along with two other B vitamins, thiamin
and riboflavin.
</P>
<P>
   A serving of asparagus also has 4 milligrams of vitamin E, about
half the daily recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   When you are in the market for asparagus look for fresh green
stalks with tightly budded tips. Stay away from shriveled bunches
and choose spears of the same thickness so they will cook evenly.
Steaming is best, and fastest.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Red, White and Greens'' (HarperCollins, 1996)
Faith Willinger suggests soaking the trimmed tender spears in
sugared water for 30 minutes before cooking. And it does restore
sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Don't combine asparagus with a dressing containing vinegar or
lemon juice until just before serving; it will make the spears turn
yellowish gray-green.
</P>
<P>
   And no, asparagus does not have to be peeled as long as the
tough end of the stalk has been removed by bending it at the point
where it snaps off naturally. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ASPARAGUS WITH ROASTED RED PEPPER SALSA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 roasted red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 tiny hot red pepper, like a bird pepper or Thai pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 medium clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons minced red onion
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 pound asparagus
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped cilantro. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Slice red peppers into [-inch-wide strips. Trim and seed hot
peppers and mince. Combine roasted peppers, hot peppers, garlic and
onion. Add lime juice, a little at a time, until desired tartness
is achieved. Set aside if using immediately, or cover and
refrigerate until serving time. (Salsa can be made a day ahead;
remove from refrigerator before cooking asparagus.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Trim tough part from asparagus by breaking stems at the point
where the tender part meets the woody stem. Wash thoroughly. Steam
asparagus 3 to 7 minutes, depending on thickness. Drain and arrange
on a serving plate.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mix cilantro into salsa, and spoon over asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.

`BLACK AND WHITE' TACKLES N.Y. CULTURE CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of James Toback's restless drama most obviously
comments on the collision and commingling of two cultures on the
streets of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A group of white high-school kids reject the affluence of their
upper-class existence and redefine themselves by appropriating the
elements of hip-hop street culture. These uptown teens dress down
and head downtown to hang with a group of gangstas, drug dealers
and aspiring rappers, who are trying to redefine their lives in the
opposite direction, out of the streets and into the world of
businessmen, deals and lawyer-speak.
</P>
<P>
   Toback thrives on the contradictions that define these
characters, setting them off with provocative bravado and a jagged,
in-your-face style.
</P>
<P>
   His performers _ Elijah Wood and pop-singer Bijou Phillips as
the leaders of the high-school wannabes and rap producer Oli
``Power'' Grant as a gangsta-turned-impresario _ are naturals. Even
better is mighty wild card Mike Tyson playing himself, musing about
his parole, flaring up at an unwanted flirtation, and doling out
dubious, lethal advice to Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Toback seems to have just discovered this cultural phenomenon
but he manages a surprising degree of easiness in the milieu,
finding his insights not in the clash but in the mix of opposites.
The scenes are driven with an immediacy and uncertainty, as if
anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   His camera bobs and weaves like an episode of ``NYPD Blue,'' his
actors riff in improvisations and busy ensemble scenes, and he
swirls it together in impressionistic chunks a la Robert Altman.
Problem is, he's no Altman.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating around this urban core like so many satellites are a
hackneyed collection of hangers-on, traitors and unwanted
trespassers. Ben Stiller is a suspicious, self-loathing sleaze;
Allan Houston is an opportunistic college basketball star in a jam;
and Claudia Schiffer drones glib sociological theories with all the
cred of a stumbling supermodel. Brooke Shields wanders through it
all as a pushy L.A. filmmaker verbalizing Toback's themes with a
pithy running commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Where the contradictions of the urban characters are charged
with a lived-in awareness and a ``take it as it is'' attitude,
these morally compromised figures feel designed to show that there
is no ``black and white,'' only shades of gray. But they're so
contrived that Toback undercuts any street credibility he may have
earned with his jittery, sexually charged cultural mix.
</P>
<P>
   Black and White. Directed and written by James Toback. Cast:
Robert Downey Jr., Bijou Phillips, Oli ``Power'' Grant, Raekwon,
Claudia Schiffer, Brooke Shields, Ben Stiller, Mike Tyson, Elijah
Wood. Screen Gems. 100 minutes. Rated R for nudity, violence and

 &HT;    COLLEGE STUDENTS COLLABORATE ON A BETTER SCOOTER FOR THE INFIRM
 &HT;    440&AMP;add. For release Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Someday, frail elderly and disabled people may ride
in a motorized scooter designed by three college students.
</P>
<P>
   The trio, all students of the Rhode Island School of Design,
took on the challenge of building a better scooter three years ago.
Their unique ``PentaRay Scooter'' recently received a Gold Award
from the American Society on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the PentaRay and the dozens of other
models on the market today is its five-wheel design, for which the
students are seeking a patent.
</P>
<P>
   By using five wheels instead of the more common four or six,
their scooter has a 2-inch smaller turning radius than any scooter
now available, said Mathew(cq) L. Chin, 22, of Branford, Conn. That
means it's more maneuverable in tight spaes.
</P>
<P>
   The developers claim other advantages for their machine, which
is not yet commercially available.
</P>
<P>
   They say the PentaRay has more traction than most front-wheel
design scooters because the drive train is in the middle,
underneath the seat. That gives the scooter a greater ability to
climb steep grades, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Other unique design features include a curved front column for
more leg room, ergonomically designed throttle levers that can be
used with either the thumb or fingers, and padded thigh rests to
give the user more support and protect the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature is the design of the dial that controls the
scooter's maximum speed. Most such dials turn left or right like a
radio dial and require some manual dexterity. The PentaRay uses a
wheel that can be rolled forward or backward with the palm of the
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more intuitive position and easier to use,'' Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   Storage pouches for small items such as a wallet and keys are
provided beneath the arm-rests. The pouches replace pockets, which
are difficult for seated people to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding force behind the project was 22-year-old Jonathan
Friedman of Chicago, whose father was scooter-bound since Jonathan
was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of grew up with scooters in the house and moving them
around,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman enlisted Chin and Aaron von Eigen of Baltimore when the
three were sophomores. They were able to obtain grant money, which
is available to students in the health care design field, to help
cover the $2,000 cost of the project and help pay their school
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of opportunity in this field,'' von Eigen said,
noting that as the Baby Boomer generation ages there will be more
need for products to assist them.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Before making the first of hundreds of design drawings, the
three spent several weeks researching the market and assessing what
techniques worked and which ones they thought they could improve.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to make a more maneuverable and powerful scooter,
and they wanted to make it nice-looking as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to meet the psychological needs of the users, not
just the physical needs,'' Chin said, adding that people should not
``feel like they are outcasts'' because they are in a scooter.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a wheelchair and a scooter, von Eigen
chimed in, is that ``you're in a wheelchair, you ride a scooter,''
and that manifests itself in the way the user feels about himself
or herself and the way they are treated by others.
</P>
<P>
   For their work, the students, who are graduating this spring,
earned straight A's in their design classes. Now they face an
uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   They have been discussing the possibility of marketing the
PentaRay with several scooter manufacturers, either as a complete
unit or incorporating various features into other scooters.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the prestigious ASA award ``will get us in the door''
with scooter manufacturers, Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   If they are able to market the PentaRay, they don't expect it to
be commercially available for at least two years. They predict it
would retail for about $3,000 to $4,000.

FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS.  MOVING IN THE
``E'' AND ``K''
 CATEGORIES.  ALSO CHANGING SPELLING OF ``KAHN'' TO ``KHAN'') 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Live''? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the `washington Post' and the `New York Times'. ''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The Next Generation) to the current version (``Star Trek:
Voyager''), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment: Earth,'' sent an agent from the future into
Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the arms
race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled ``The Wrath of Khan''.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next
Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next'' ``Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are mailing in their census forms at a
rate well below what federal officials had hoped for, raising
concerns that getting an accurate population count will take longer
and cost more than it should, the chief of the Census Bureau said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide response rate, 55 percent as of Monday versus the
61 percent that the bureau had anticipated by now, is ``not a good
indicator of civic responsibility in this country,'' Dr. Kenneth
Prewitt, the census director, said at a news briefing in which he
alternated between optimism and worry, exhortation and mild
scolding.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he still hopes for a torrent of mail in the next
few days, so that the mail-in response target of 70 percent _ 5
percentage points higher than the mail-in rate from the 1990 census
_ can be reached by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   After that, counters will go to households that did not respond,
at a cost estimated at $35 per visit. For each percentage point
that the response rate rises, 1.2 million fewer household visits
will be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the census is in the hands of the American
people,'' Prewitt said, calling on his countrymen to ``reverse a
long tide of civic disengagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The census of 1990, which had a mail-response rate of 65
percent, is acknowledged to have undercounted the population by
several million, and census officials dearly want to avoid a
similar failure this time.
</P>
<P>
   Federal aid to schools, money to cities for anti-poverty
programs, the locations of new roads, sewers, banks and shopping
centers _ all those and many more features of American life are
linked one way or the other with census data, Prewitt reminded a
news conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So is representation in Congress. Though Prewitt did not mention
it on Monday, many population experts believe that some states
missed out in the 1990 census because of an overall undercount of
several million people. California, which has 52 seats in the House
of Representatives, might well have 53 if the last census had been
more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1990 and before, states in the South and Southwest lagged
behind the rest of the country in response rates, Prewitt said.
South Carolina had a response rate of 47 percent, for instance, and
Mississippi 46 percent. The District of Columbia had a response
rate of 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of the people in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma
responded, and 51 percent of those in Arizona. Alaska had the
lowest response rate among the states, 42 percent, but the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had by far the worst record: 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio had the highest response rate, 62 percent, followed by
Nebraska and Iowa at 61, then Michigan and Pennsylvania at 60
percent. California, which has so much to gain, or lose, depending
on the census results, had a 57 percent response rate.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said low response rates can be explained, at least in
part, by demographics and attitudes. States that have a high
proportion of hard-to-reach rural dwellers, or in which many people
distrust the government, tend to have low response rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said much of the mistrust, ``ill-founded but
understandable,'' is in the hearts of recent immigrants, who do not
understand or simply will not believe what is true under the law:
that information gleaned by the census is not passed on to law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt acknowledged some dismay at recent remarks by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,
expressing concern about possible invasions of privacy in questions
on the census long form, sent to one in six households.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the long form's more personal questions, about indoor
plumbing or disabled people in a household, are vital if deserving
Americans are to get the assistance they need, the director said.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau plans a barrage of ads in the days just ahead
in regions where response has been low. Anyone who lost a form can
still get one by calling 800-471-9424, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt found some reasons for optimism in the results to date.
The bureau's electronic scanners have worked almost flawlessly in
processing more than 25 million forms, he said, and 58,000 forms
have been done on the Internet _ something almost inconceivable a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he urged people who are visited by census takers not to
hide or be uncooperative. ``These are not federal bureaucrats,
these are Americans,'' he said. ``Neighbors.''

LANGUEDOC GETS ITS DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ERIC ASIMOV    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Languedoc, which curls around the southern coast of France, is a
fount of French civilization, but as a winemaking region it hasn't
gotten much respect. On maps of wine regions, it is sometimes
simply labeled ``Other.'' But now, Languedoc is gaining credit for
its assortment of interesting, well-priced red wines.
</P>
<P>
   The bad rap used to be deserved. Languedoc produces an ocean of
insipid wine, most of it destined for blending. That, in a sense,
is liberating to the current generation of Languedoc winemakers,
who are free to re-evaluate just about everything, including
feverishly experimenting with different grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The region's traditional grape, carignan, may be the most widely
planted in France, mostly because of its sturdiness and high
yields. Often it is blended with other regional favorites, like
cinsault and grenache. Today, producers are supplementing these
grapes with Rhone varieties, like syrah and mourvedre, and even
grapes from Bordeaux, like cabernet sauvignon and merlot.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than the debate over grapes has been the
improvement in grape growing and winemaking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   With more modern techniques, winemakers are even succeeding with
the old grapes, producing delightful wines, like the Domaine de
Fontareche, that are fruity and easy to enjoy. On the other end of
the spectrum are concentrated, powerful wines like Prieure de
St.-Jean de Bebian. Either way, Languedoc will never just be
``Other'' again.

FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS.  MOVING IN THE
``E'' AND ``K''
 CATEGORIES.  ALSO CHANGING SPELLING OF ``KAHN'' TO ``KHAN'') 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Live''? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the `washington Post' and the `New York Times'. ''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The Next Generation) to the current version (``Star Trek:
Voyager''), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment: Earth,'' sent an agent from the future into
Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the arms
race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled ``The Wrath of Khan''.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next
Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next'' ``Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' ''

   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled ``The Wrath of Khan''.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next
Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next'' ``Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' ''

ARGENTINA IS COMING OUT OF ITS SHELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Argentines are a proud people, not given to hiding their
many assets. Except when it comes to wine.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is one of the great wine-producing nations, right up
there after France, Spain, Italy and Spain. But hardly anyone knows
this. Well, maybe a few people do, but they are mostly in
Argentina. Why? Because it was a closed-in country, an economic and
political basket case for 40 years. Isolated by paranoid leaders
and killing tariffs, the Argentines had little choice but to go
their own way. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a stretch of stability that looks as if it just might
last, they are catching up fast, and nowhere faster than in the
wine business.
</P>
<P>
   The wine trade in Argentina has a long history. The first
commercial wineries were developed by missionaries in the 16th
century, using vines brought over the mountains from Chile and
Peru. Wine was an artisanal trade until the arrival in the late
19th century of hundreds of thousands of Italian immigrants, most
of them amateur winemakers, more than a few of them professionals.
Many settled in Mendoza, 600 miles inland from the Atlantic and, to
this day, a city more Italian in feeling than parts of Italy
itself. Those immigrants and their children made Mendoza, both the
city and the province, the center of the Argentine wine industry,
producing 70 percent of the country's wine.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial vineyard areas can also be found 500 miles to the
south at Rio Negro, in Patagonia, and some 700 miles to the north
in Salta and in Jujuy Province, not far from the Bolivian border.
</P>
<P>
   While Argentina's wine production has dropped in recent years,
it remains immense, but almost all of it is consumed domestically.
Even so, yearly consumption has dropped precipitously, from about
25 liters a person in the 1960s to 10 liters today. Like the rest
of the world, Argentines have discovered beer and soda, and so the
industry has been forced to develop an export market.
</P>
<P>
   Though Argentine vineyards still supply millions of gallons of
cheap wine to northern Europe, the home market in the cheap stuff
has all but died away. The world is drinking less but drinking
better wine, and that's what the Argentines are beginning to make.
</P>
<P>
   As in Chile, there has been a trend toward expensive, limited
production wines. While I'm not sure who will pay $50 for Catena's
Algelica Vineyard Malbec or Trapiche's Iscay malbec-merlot blend,
there are dozens of new, reasonably priced releases that are worth
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governments of Juan Peron and a succession of military
juntas, the wine industry operated in virtual isolation, not unlike
the South African wine industry during apartheid. Not until trade
and political barriers were lowered did winemakers or consumers
have an idea of how winemaking had improved worldwide. The growers
began a program of pulling out old vines and replacing them with
fewer but better European varieties like cabernet sauvignon, merlot
and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Malbec, once an important Bordeaux grape and still the favorite
grape of Cahors, in southwestern France, is also Argentina's most
prominent red wine grape. At its best, it makes a better wine in
Argentina than it does in France.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly because of political and economic difficulties in the
1970s and 1980s, Argentina got a slow start in the race with Chile
for a share of the burgeoning world market for fine wine. But there
is a widely held perception that Chile has yet to fulfill its early
promise as a source of truly great wines and that Argentine
winemakers have been steadily narrowing the quality gap between the
two.
</P>
<P>
   What the Argentine domestic market consumed in vast quantities
was mediocre wine made from the pedestrian criolla grape. Thousands
of acres of criolla were ripped out. It had been replacing malbec,
which is less economical to grow. But the malbec produced the
country's best wine, so with the possibility of a new export market
looming, hundreds of acres of malbec were replanted.
</P>
<P>
   The return of a degree of economic stability has lured
investments. Pernod-Ricard from France, Allied Dome from Britain
and Kendall-Jackson from California have been putting money into
Argentina that, a decade ago, might have gone into Chile. In fact,
even the Chilean winemakers are getting into the game: both Concha
y Toro and Santa Carolina have invested in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, rose wines were more popular than reds and
whites in Argentina. But the recent interest in better wines,
particularly among the new middle class, has shown a preference for
whites. It is a preference unlikely to spill over into the export
market because Argentine whites are not a distinguished group. The
torrentes grape, a Spanish import, is Argentina's unique white
wine, the Spanish having pretty much given up on it. It makes a
fruity wine with nice structure, but the Argentines, like everyone
else, seem drawn to chardonnay. And they seem to be making the same
boring chardonnays as almost everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's future would seem to be tied closely to red wines.
Until recently, even its best were not contenders. They were heavy
and unbalanced. Which, not coincidentally, was the way Argentine
consumers liked them. Fortunately, Argentine winemakers are eager
to learn international styles.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the venture capital has come a small army of French,
Italian and American winemakers. A British wine writer, Fiona
Beckett, has said that Bodegas Norton in Mendoza is working with
six clones of cabernet while another producer, Leoncio Arizu, is
growing eight varieties in an experimental vineyard, with each
variety planted six different ways. The results have been
impressive _ and not just from those forward-looking producers.
</P>
<P>
   Bodegas Etchart, now owned by Pernod-Ricard, has two lines of
inexpensive wines that are remarkable values. From Mendoza
vineyards, the Rio de Plata line offers four wines: the usual
suspects, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay, plus malbec,
each at about $7. The wines are one dimensional but full bodied and
fruity, with the malbec and the cabernet out front.
</P>
<P>
   From Andean vineyards at Cafayate in the north, the Etchart
wines include a delicious cabernet sauvignon at about $9 and, for
anyone who wants to try something different, a torrentes white at
the same price. These wines are all 1999's.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro Correas, one of the oldest and most distinguished
Mendoza wineries, has been in the American market for many years.
Its Malbec and its Private Selection Cabernet Sauvignon, at about
$12 each, are good buys. I tried the 1994's; younger wines should
be available soon.

FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS.  MOVING IN THE
``E'' AND ``K''
 CATEGORIES.  ALSO CHANGING SPELLING OF ``KAHN'' TO ``KHAN'') 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Live''? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the `washington Post' and the `New York Times'. ''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The Next Generation) to the current version (``Star Trek:
Voyager''), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment: Earth,'' sent an agent from the future into
Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the arms
race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>

REMEMBRANCE OF CHILDHOOD HIGHLIGHTS IS IMMUNE TO SKEPTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I taught my grandma to drive. Really, I did. I was just a little
kid, maybe 6 or 7 years old at the time. She was in her late 50s,
which to a kid is like being a prime candidate for the Rocking
Chair Brigade. Now, I consider that age as the prime of life, but
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, my grandma somehow managed to make her way around the
farm and down to the Jefferson General Store without ever learning
to drive. With all those children of hers and lots of friends and
family around, I guess it just wasn't an issue. Then everyone grew
up and moved away, and she started to experience transportation
problems.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I came along. See, my grandma and I spent a good
part of the summer together every year. And as much as I loved
watching the garden grow and listening to the cows moo, every once
in a while I wanted to go to the Dairy Queen in town and get an ice
cream cone. So when someone suggested that my grandma needed a car,
I became a lobbyist for the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigmama,'' I said. ``I think it's a great idea for you to get
a car. Then we can go to the mall in Marshall on the weekends. We
can go fishing down at the Lake O' the Pines and we can go visit
all of your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandma mixed that thought up with her snuff and chewed on it
awhile. Finally, she spat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, I reckon I do need a car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was it. When she spoke, things happened. A few days later,
one of my uncles turned up with a lovely green four-door car. It
was used, but it ran well.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is possible that there was some driving instruction
given, but I did not witness it nor did I see much evidence of it
on our first trip down the narrow, bumpy roads of East Texas. Have
you seen those kids on the bumper cars that just kind of go
straight until they hit something? Well, we didn't hit anything,
but it wasn't for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   This saga occurred long before seat belts were mandatory but
even as a second-grader I knew that I needed to be tacked down to
that car seat.
</P>
<P>
   She caught on to the accelerate-and-brake thing pretty quickly.
It wasn't much different from the tractor, I suppose. But you have
a little more room to maneuver a tractor. I wasn't afraid, mind
you. I've always had a great sense of adventure. But, in
retrospect, I should have been afraid.
</P>
<P>
   I remember getting all dressed up to go to town. She would rev
up the engine a few times and off we'd catapult down her long, dirt
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   I usually started the lesson with, ``Watch out for the mail box,
Bigmama.''
</P>
<P>
   The mailbox was leaning anyway so it wouldn't have been a great
loss if we'd hit it, but I didn't want anything postponing my
parfait.
</P>
<P>
   A mile or so later, I'd say, ``You're doing fine, Bigmama, but
there's something in the road ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in the road?'' she'd ask without ever slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back through the rear view mirror, I'd reply, ``It was a
possum. Now it's somebody's dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   We'd chuckle and keep on trucking. Folks would wave from their
porches as we drove by. If we weren't near a curve in the road, I'd
take a chance on releasing my death grip on the dashboard and wave
back. Fortunately, we always reached our destination and we never
hit anything larger than a possum. Yep, I'm pretty proud of my role
in my grandmother's driver's education.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. You're not going to believe what just happened.
</P>
<P>
   My mom called and I was telling her this story and she said,
``You didn't teach Mama to drive. Mama learned to drive in 1948.
Her blood pressure was real high at one point and she stopped
driving for a long time. Then she started driving again when you
were a little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   That's messed up. I had this wonderful memory, and it's all
wrong. Well, partially wrong.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I considered starting this column over but then it
occurred to me that there's a lesson here. This is the reason we
cannot simply rely on oral history to pass on our family legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Right. OK, that's that. But let me just add one more thing: I
don't care what my mother says, there is no way that my grandmother
had a driver's license. She didn't need one because she never wrote
checks and everyone in town knew her.
</P>
<P>
   So there.

   Bill Muller takes a quick look at some current magazine issues
and a website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; movie-list.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching those trailers while people are still finding
their seats and rattling their popcorn bags? Then Movie-List is for
you. The site features theatrical trailers for all the hot movies
coming out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers trailers and so-called teasers (shorter versions
of the trailer) in Quicktime. They are available in high-resolution
or low-resolution formats, depending on the speed of your
connection and how long you want to wait for a download.
</P>
<P>
   Recent additions to the site include trailers for ``The Hollow
Man,''which features Kevin Bacon as a not-so-nice invisible man,
``The Filth and the Fury,'' a documentary about the British punk
band the Sex Pistols, and ``Dinosaur,'' a Disney film about
prehistoric creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There also is ``Battlefield Earth,'' a new John Travolta flick
based on an L. Ron Hubbard book and ``Gone in Sixty Seconds,'' the
remake of the '70s movie of the same name, starring Nicolas Cage
and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   So, grab some popcorn and soda, and take a gander. &QL;

 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BOY'S LIFE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Published by the Boy Scouts of America, this magazine is fun for
Scouts and non-Scouts alike, offering easy-to-read articles,
age-appropriate advice, cartoons and puzzles. My favorite how-to
this month is a primer on replacing a bike tire inner tube. Such
knowledge is especially useful in Arizona, land of the angry thorn.
There is also a Q-and-A on camping, which counsels Scouts to pack
out their garbage and avoid scratching their names on trees or
burning down the forest. Keep in mind that the magazine does have
some religious overtones. This issue includes a short story on
Scouts visiting churches, chapels and temples to learn more about
other religions. With baseball season starting, there also is a
reprint of the Thayer poem, ``Casey at the Bat,'' and a short story
on a light-hitting Little Leaguer who saves the day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ESQUIRE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Answers the burning question, ``What's on Heather Graham's
Mind?'' which, after reading the story, we have to conclude is
``not much.'' Still in all, it's an amusing if self-conscious story
about the winsome actress, whose appearance in ``Austin Powers 2:
The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has vaulted her to instant cult status,
especially among the denizens of the Internet. It's funny to learn
that she first appeared in film as a dead junkie in ``Drugstore
Cowboy.'' In that inexplicable ``Esquire''-think, the magazine
lists the 18 most important golf courses in America, and then tops
the list with the Old Course at St. Andrews, SCOTLAND. They're
trying to be cute here, but it just doesn't work. There is also a
piece on golfer John Daly, he of the thunderous swing and alcohol
problem. Again, we have to wade through all the self-serving pap
about the writer palling around with Daly until we get to the real
story: Daly is losing but happy. I wonder if that is his final
answer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``OUTSIDE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the camping issue, but hey, isn't every issue? Worth
picking up for story on the ``Surf Chimp,'' a long-armed surfer
dude named Jeff Hakman who dominated his sport, founded a
multimillion-dollar surfwear company and then lost it all to a
heroin addiction _ twice. Now he's competing on the surfing
equivalent of a senior's tour. Who knew? There also is an
interesting piece on those so-called adventure races where people
scale cliffs and navigate rapids so they break their arms and legs
and are shown weeping on the Discovery Channel. Article wonders
aloud if it's all just becoming too commercial. Surely not. Being
on TV has nothing to do with making money, does it? Also includes a
nicely done piece that suggests leaving behind all your techno
stuff _ phones, pagers, Iridium satellites _ when you head out to
the wilderness, so you can forget about civilization. What was that
again? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``REASON'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian magazine goes after _ surprise! _ Bill Clinton
this month, noting that he's survived scandals not because he's
innocent, but because he's an expert at managing the news and
handling internal crises. Interesting piece offers ``a five-step
program for surviving endless scandal,'' noting that Clinton
doesn't feed scandals and uses his office to distract the public,
mostly by having the military blow something up.
</P>
<P>
   There's another piece on agronomist extraordinaire Norman
Borlaug, the father of the so-called Green Revolution and a Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who is still teaching at Texas A&AMP;M at age 86.
Borlaug is widely credited with increasing wheat yields in the late
1960s and saving millions from starvation in Mexico, India and
Pakistan. There also is a good piece noting that this year's
presidential election will be less about issues than any election,
ever. &QL;

FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS.  MOVING IN THE
``E'' AND ``K''
 CATEGORIES.  ALSO CHANGING SPELLING OF ``KAHN'' TO ``KHAN'') 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Live''? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the `washington Post' and the `New York Times'. ''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The Next Generation) to the current version (``Star Trek:
Voyager''), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment: Earth,'' sent an agent from the future into
Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the arms
race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled ``The Wrath of Khan''.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next
Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next'' ``Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' ''

LOBSTER A LA AMERICAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the sixth of eight columns by Christian Delouvrier, the
executive chef at Lespinasse in Manhattan. They are being written
with Melissa Clark.) 
(jt) 
 By MELISSA CLARK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I first learned how to make this dish, I was a
young assistant sauce chef at Cafe de la Paix in Paris. The head
sauce chef, a man named Charles Lejay, was very particular about
this preparation, a classic of French cooking called lobster a
l'americaine. In fact, I had to watch him make it for months before
he would let me near the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The dish is entirely about building a sauce: every step adds a
layer of depth and complexity. The lobster is simmered in the
shell, which releases its flavors into the base of the sauce. The
simmering liquid _ a heady base of wine, tomatoes, shallots, garlic
and herbs _ builds and condenses, and is set aflame with Armagnac.
The innards of the lobster (the tomalley and, if it is' a female,
the coral) are whisked in for their briny nuance, and the sauce is
finished with a nugget of butter and more Armagnac.
</P>
<P>
   The result is light and satiny, nothing like the thick glaze you
might expect. The balance of aromatic, acidic and sweet ingredients
stands up to and harmonizes with the lobster, while the butter adds
smoothness and softness.
</P>
<P>
   My version here is even lighter than the preparation I was
taught, or the one I make now at the restaurant. There, I can use
many more lobsters to make the sauce (the meat from some goes into
other dishes, like lobster salad). Using more lobsters means I can
simmer the sauce longer and develop a deeper flavor. If you
simmered the sauce that long at home, it would extract more flavor,
but it would ruin the wonderful lightness. I choose delicacy over
potency.
</P>
<P>
   I have also made the dish simpler in other ways. I use a good
chicken stock instead of a fish stock (Chef Lejay insisted on stock
made with only sole bones). I serve the meat in its shell, and
sometimes I ask the fishmonger to cut up the lobster for me.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at home I pair the lobster with the simplest of
partners _ rice, crusty bread or just a spoon. You won't want to
miss a drop of the sauce, or compete with its dazzle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOBSTER A L'AMERICAINE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 lobsters, about 1{ pounds each, claws separated from bodies
and cracked, tails cut into 1-inch medallions, bodies split
lengthwise, innards and roe reserved (your fishmonger can do this)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons Armagnac
</P>
<P>
   { cup sliced shallots (2 to 3)
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs tarragon
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 celery stalks, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 small leeks, white part only, sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   12 plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Chopped herbs, like parsley and tarragon, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large skillet at least 2{ inches deep, heat 1 tablespoon
olive oil until smoking. Add lobster claws and salt and pepper to
taste, and saute until shells turn bright red, about 10 minutes.
Transfer claws to a plate, and add another tablespoon of oil to
pan. Add tail medallions and salt and pepper, and cook until meat
is browned and the shells are bright red, about 7 minutes. Transfer
medallions to a plate and repeat with lobster bodies, cooking until
shells turn bright red all over, about 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Return claws and medallions to pan with bodies, and add 2
tablespoons Armagnac; flame with a match or by shaking the pan over
a high flame until it ignites. Let flames die down, then transfer
claws and medallions to a plate, leaving bodies in pan. Add
remaining olive oil, shallots, garlic, tarragon, thyme, carrots,
celery and leeks. Saute until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes.
Add tomato paste and wine and cook, stirring, until liquid
evaporates. Add chicken stock and tomatoes, and let mixture simmer
until thickened, about 40 minutes. Let cool, then strain through
sieve, pressing hard on solids.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a bowl, mash together butter, reserved lobster innards and
remaining Armagnac.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place sauce in a large clean skillet and add claws and
medallions. Heat sauce over medium heat until lobster pieces are
hot. Whisk in lobster butter, cayenne and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve lobster in sauce garnished with chopped herbs.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ We're known as the chef's secret source,'' said Judi
Arnold, co-owner of Dufour Pastry Kitchens, bakers of hors
d'oeuvres that look as if a chef made them herself. ``We never
divulge the names of our clients. If I ever told which caterers,
hotels or clubs ... .'' Arnold didn't need to finish the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were serving one of Dufour's delicious little blue corn
empanadas filled with a gently spicy mixture of black beans,
jalapenos and cilantro at one of my dinner parties, I would tell
anyone who asked. This is not 1952, when women were judged on the
lightness of their cakes and the daintiness of their canapes.
People are lucky if they have time to cook the main course.
</P>
<P>
   There's no stigma in store-bought appetizers or desserts. If it
was a choice between seeking help from a professional or not having
friends to dinner, I would opt for a little strategic help. And I
wouldn't try to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some prepared foods in New York these days are so good,
I will even boast of having bought them. Others are so unusual that
they qualify as conversation pieces at a party. A careful shopper
can find sweets and savories to fit every meal from lasagna with
garlic bread to rack of lamb with potatoes Anna.
</P>
<P>
   These days, you can even buy individual hot souffles, made with
the richest dark chocolate, sold frozen and ready to bake. They are
available either in returnable ramekins or disposable foil ones for
$8 each at William Poll, 1051 Lexington Avenue, between 74th and
75th Streets in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to take more responsibility for the dessert, try
subtly flavored licorice meringue disks that can be topped with
raspberry sorbet and garnished with whipped cream. They are $2 each
at Payard Patisserie, 1032 Lexington Avenue, between 73rd and 74th
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The licorice arrives as a surprise aftertaste and pairs
perfectly with Payard's sorbet. You supply the whipped cream, but
please don't do as an Upper East Side hostess who said whipping
cream was too much trouble and used the stuff that comes in the
can.
</P>
<P>
   No work beyond cutting is needed with a dacquoise, layers of
meringue and creamy, buttery filling, covered with toasted almonds.
A six-inch cake is $20 at Marquet Patisserie, 15 East 12th Street,
between Fifth Avenue and University Place; order two days in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   A dessert called caffe latte is one of the few whimsical sweets
whose taste matches its good looks: the handsome coffee cup with
handle, made of chocolate and filled with light but rich espresso
mousse. Good to the last drop. Each is $6 at Black Hound, 170
Second Avenue, between 10th and 11th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Creme brulee is not hard to make, but Bouley Bakery sells a
silken version in a round of almond pastry that would be hard to
duplicate at home. Each one is ready to eat and $5 at the bakery,
120 West Broadway, between Duane and Reade Streets.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to buy old-fashioned petits fours, the only ones I
have ever eaten whose taste is worthy of their handsome looks are
from Divine Delights in San Francisco, available by e-mail
(divinede(at)wenet.net). They are filled with truffle creams,
butter creams and fruit fillings and enrobed in white chocolate
tinted different colors. A dozen are $25.50 from (800) 443-2836 or
(415) 382-7585.
</P>
<P>
   Hors d'oeuvres don't have to have the eye-catching appeal of
desserts; they just have to be easy to eat and flavorful. Quirky is
good, too, like the world's most elegant pigs in blankets, wrapped
in phyllo from William Poll and ready to bake. You could even pair
them with Poll's intriguing bake-and-serve kataifi (shredded
phyllo) wrapped around a piquant mixture of Parmigiano-Reggiano,
Swiss, feta, goat and mozzarella. Each tray of 12 to 14 pieces is
$25.
</P>
<P>
   Just as unusual are roasted carrots and potatoes to serve at
room temperature on toothpicks. The garnishes and the cooking
elevate them beyond homemade. The carrot chunks come with slices of
preserved lemons and bits of olives, a luscious blend of sweet,
acidic and salty.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel London Foods, 22A East 65th Street, near Madison Avenue,
sells them for $10 a pound. Then, there are the potato chunks
roasted in some of the world's most delicious cooking fat _ chicken
_ that can also be served warmed. They are $7.95 a pound at Eli's
Manhattan, 1411 Third Avenue, at 80th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Toasted wedges of paratha, Indian flatbread suffused with
fenugreek leaves, also make an easy and unusual cocktail nibble.
The heated bread even perfumes your kitchen with the scents of
India. A package of four rounds, about the size of pitas, is $2.99
at Kalustyan, 123 Lexington Avenue, between 28th and 29th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian-style alternative worlds away from American-style
pizza is the pizza bianca from Sullivan Street Bakery, 73 Sullivan
Street, between Broome and Spring Streets. The thinnest, crispest
dough, not much thicker than a cracker, is scented with rosemary or
topped with thin slices of potatoes or mushrooms. Slices about the
size of a typical pizza slice are $1 to $2 and can be cut into
smaller strips for serving.
</P>
<P>
   As for those Dufour hors d'oeuvres __ earthy wild mushrooms with
crunchy walnuts creamy mascarpone enlivened with Roquefort,
Thai-flavored Chinese cabbage with peanuts or those black beans _
the only problem is that you will want to taste one of each in
ready-to-bake phyllo, puff pastry or tarts.
</P>
<P>
   They are $8.85 to $11 a dozen at Dufour Pastry Kitchens, 25
Ninth Avenue, at West 13th Street.

 &HT;    VISA-LESS ENTRY PROGRAM MAY BE MADE PERMANENT
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The practice of allowing foreigners to enter the
United States for a short stay without a visa could become a
permanent program, a House committee voted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, visitors from 29 countries may enter the United
States by showing only a passport or other proof of identity.
Americans may also enter those countries under similar conditions.
The 1986 law that established the program on a temporary basis, and
has been extended several times, is scheduled to expire April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``A permanent program will be a long-term benefit to the travel
and tourism industry,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of
the subcommittee on immigration and claims and the bill's primary
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   A country is eligible for the U.S. visa wavier program if fewer
than 3 percent of its visa applications are rejected by the State
Department annually. In addition, any country that participates in
the program must offer American travelers similar privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved Tuesday by the full Judiciary Committee on a
voice vote, also would require all countries participating in the
program to have machine-readable passports by October 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that the ``principal argument against a permanent
visa program has been the failure of the (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) to establish a credible system for
calculating or estimating overstay rates.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes a number of provisions that would help the INS
keep track of arrivals and departures of foreign travelers without
visas, such as an automated entry-exit database, by October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to the Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the Justice Department said the legislation's
deadlines were ``overly ambitious'' and asked for more time to
implement the record keeping program.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben,
also asked the committee to consider a provision that would allow
the attorney general to temporarily suspend a country's
participation in the wavier program for law enforcement or national
security interests.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved after a brief debate about alleged
discriminatory practices associated with rejecting a country's
request to participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, a co-sponsor of the bill, said
U.S. officials may use a form of ``profiling'' to deny visa waivers
to people from developing countries or ``countries of color.'' She
said Nigeria was an example of a country whose citizens have not
been able to obtain visa in order to visit family or attend
funerals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is racially biased, and has a racist system of
determination,'' said Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote, the committee adopted an amendment by
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., that would prohibit the visa wavier
refusals on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation and
disability.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Muller takes a quick look at some current magazine issues
and a website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; movie-list.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching those trailers while people are still finding
their seats and rattling their popcorn bags? Then Movie-List is for
you. The site features theatrical trailers for all the hot movies
coming out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers trailers and so-called teasers (shorter versions
of the trailer) in Quicktime. They are available in high-resolution
or low-resolution formats, depending on the speed of your
connection and how long you want to wait for a download.
</P>
<P>
   Recent additions to the site include trailers for ``The Hollow
Man,''which features Kevin Bacon as a not-so-nice invisible man,
``The Filth and the Fury,'' a documentary about the British punk
band the Sex Pistols, and ``Dinosaur,'' a Disney film about
prehistoric creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There also is ``Battlefield Earth,'' a new John Travolta flick
based on an L. Ron Hubbard book and ``Gone in Sixty Seconds,'' the
remake of the '70s movie of the same name, starring Nicolas Cage
and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   So, grab some popcorn and soda, and take a gander. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MAGAZINE REVIEWS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BOY'S LIFE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Published by the Boy Scouts of America, this magazine is fun for
Scouts and non-Scouts alike, offering easy-to-read articles,
age-appropriate advice, cartoons and puzzles. My favorite how-to
this month is a primer on replacing a bike tire inner tube. Such
knowledge is especially useful in Arizona, land of the angry thorn.
There is also a Q-and-A on camping, which counsels Scouts to pack
out their garbage and avoid scratching their names on trees or
burning down the forest. Keep in mind that the magazine does have
some religious overtones. This issue includes a short story on
Scouts visiting churches, chapels and temples to learn more about
other religions. With baseball season starting, there also is a
reprint of the Thayer poem, ``Casey at the Bat,'' and a short story
on a light-hitting Little Leaguer who saves the day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ESQUIRE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Answers the burning question, ``What's on Heather Graham's
Mind?'' which, after reading the story, we have to conclude is
``not much.'' Still in all, it's an amusing if self-conscious story
about the winsome actress, whose appearance in ``Austin Powers 2:
The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has vaulted her to instant cult status,
especially among the denizens of the Internet. It's funny to learn
that she first appeared in film as a dead junkie in ``Drugstore
Cowboy.'' In that inexplicable ``Esquire''-think, the magazine
lists the 18 most important golf courses in America, and then tops
the list with the Old Course at St. Andrews, SCOTLAND. They're
trying to be cute here, but it just doesn't work. There is also a
piece on golfer John Daly, he of the thunderous swing and alcohol
problem. Again, we have to wade through all the self-serving pap
about the writer palling around with Daly until we get to the real
story: Daly is losing but happy. I wonder if that is his final
answer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``OUTSIDE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the camping issue, but hey, isn't every issue? Worth
picking up for story on the ``Surf Chimp,'' a long-armed surfer
dude named Jeff Hakman who dominated his sport, founded a
multimillion-dollar surfwear company and then lost it all to a
heroin addiction _ twice. Now he's competing on the surfing
equivalent of a senior's tour. Who knew? There also is an
interesting piece on those so-called adventure races where people
scale cliffs and navigate rapids so they break their arms and legs
and are shown weeping on the Discovery Channel. Article wonders
aloud if it's all just becoming too commercial. Surely not. Being
on TV has nothing to do with making money, does it? Also includes a
nicely done piece that suggests leaving behind all your techno
stuff _ phones, pagers, Iridium satellites _ when you head out to
the wilderness, so you can forget about civilization. What was that
again? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``REASON'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian magazine goes after _ surprise! _ Bill Clinton
this month, noting that he's survived scandals not because he's
innocent, but because he's an expert at managing the news and
handling internal crises. Interesting piece offers ``a five-step
program for surviving endless scandal,'' noting that Clinton
doesn't feed scandals and uses his office to distract the public,
mostly by having the military blow something up.
</P>
<P>
   There's another piece on agronomist extraordinaire Norman
Borlaug, the father of the so-called Green Revolution and a Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who is still teaching at Texas A&AMP;M at age 86.
Borlaug is widely credited with increasing wheat yields in the late
1960s and saving millions from starvation in Mexico, India and
Pakistan. There also is a good piece noting that this year's
presidential election will be less about issues than any election,
ever. &QL;

 FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Liv''e? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star
Trek''.``''
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the ``Washington Post'' and the ``New York Times''.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The'' ``Next Generatio''n) to the current version (``Star
Trek: Voyage''r), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment:'' ``Earth,'' sent an agent from the future
into Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the
arms race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of'' ``Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled `The Wrath of Khan.`
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next''
``Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Countr''y),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' '' &QL;

<P>
   The title of Jayne Cohen's new cookbook, ``The Gefilte
Variations'' (Scribner, $35), sounds as if it might be a
composition for the Klezmatics, but it reveals the author's
frequently playful approach to Jewish food. Though there are riffs
on gefilte fish, including versions made with salmon and even one
using chicken, they are just one element in a book that reworks
typical Jewish cooking with improvisational flair.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a food writer with a degree in literature, observes that
Judaism itself is open to constant interpretation. So why not its
food? She is an irrepressible improviser, and in that respect my
kindred spirit. I was not surprised to discover that like me, she
tinkered with the horseradish sauce to serve with gefilte fish, for
example, using carrots instead of the usual beets.
</P>
<P>
   She has also come up with delicious inspirations, like seasoning
and toasting egg matzoh to make Passover ``cinnamon toast,''
flavoring a carrot kugel Moroccan-style with cumin and mint or
using a potato pancake batter to coat fish fillets before frying.
She also infuses olive oil with fried onions to give it the flavor
of chicken fat, makes latkes inspired by Chinese scallion pancakes
and puts flanken on a bed of broccoli rabe, a vegetable many Jewish
grandmothers never even knew about.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all this invention, none of her clearly written
recipes violate the spirit of Jewish cooking traditions. And they
are strictly kosher.
</P>
<P>
   There is a succulent Iranian stuffed chicken poached in soup and
eaten with fresh herbs. A duck and white bean cholent could stand
in for cassoulet. And among many excellent tips is to float lettuce
leaves on top of a simmering pot of chicken soup to prevent excess
evaporation after the soup has been well skimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the book is organized according to courses:
starters, soups, fish, meats and so forth. The next section gives
recipes for holidays throughout the year, starting with Rosh
Hashana. Then there are suggested menus and a glossary.
</P>
<P>
   Threaded throughout are the author's lively and loving
recollections, little stories about her mother's fried cauliflower
or her grandfather's appetite for pastrami even as he lay dying.
Some of her experiences, like eating especially silky chopped liver
in Paris and trying to reproduce it, add to the highly personal
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   These tidbits alternate with well-researched historic and
religious details to illustrate the recipes: the symbolism of the
pomegranate or how ``wily Jacob knew the value of adding chestnut
to foods.'' In discussing ingredients, she notes that Jews have
maintained a taste for some of the world's most ancient Old World
foods, like onions, dates and barley.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections explain the rules of kosher cooking and Jewish
food customs. They serve as guides to the rituals of certain meals,
especially for the Sabbath and Passover. Cohen finds much to write
about matzoh, including how to flavor it, and ways to be creative
with matzoh balls.
</P>
<P>
   I loved reading how Cohen's grandmother would tease her and call
her a ganef, meaning a thief, for trying to grab matzoh balls from
the kitchen and then how, many years later, Cohen found an old
cookbook that referred to a kind of matzoh ball actually called a
ganef. Cooked on top of a stew, the big, puffy dumpling sopped up
the other flavors, literally stealing them. She gives that recipe,
too.

   WILD MUSHROOM-POTATO KUGEL
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Gefilte Variations''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 3\ hours, including soaking and cooling
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil, plus oil
for pan
</P>
<P>
   3 cups thinly sliced onions
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds baking potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs, beaten.
</P>
<P>
   1. Soak mushrooms in 2 cups hot water for 1 hour, until soft.
Strain through a sieve lined with a paper towel or coffee filter
paper; reserve soaking liquid. Rinse mushrooms, pat dry and chop
coarsely.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add
onions and saute, stirring, until lightly browned, about 15
minutes. Transfer to bowl and season with salt and pepper. In same
skillet, place mushrooms, garlic and mushroom liquid. Cook over
high heat, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates. Season
to taste with salt and pepper, and remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Generously oil bottom and sides
of a heavy baking dish (like a 13-by-9-inch lasagna pan),
preferably enameled cast iron.
</P>
<P>
   4. Grate potatoes in a food processor using coarse grating disc,
or with a hand grater. Transfer to colander, rinse well, drain,
then squeeze out as much liquid as possible with your hands.
Combine potatoes in a large bowl with eggs, fried onions and a
generous seasoning of salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place baking pan in oven a minute or two, just until oil is
sizzling. Remove pan from oven and spread half the potato mixture
into it. Spread mushrooms over, then add remaining potatoes,
smoothing the top. Drizzle a little olive oil on top.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bake about 50 minutes, until top is golden and crisp. Remove
from oven and let stand until it reaches room temperature, at least
30 minutes. Reheat 15 minutes at 350 degrees before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 to 10 servings.

   NEW YORK _ Making coffee may not be rocket science, but the way
it is done at Avra, a new Greek restaurant in Midtown, it looks
like an archaeological dig in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Stavros Aktipis, the restaurant's managing partner, is using
what was originally a baptismal font as a coffee maker. It is
filled with sand, which is heated by a burner underneath rather
than by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   A Greek copper coffeepot, a briki, which has an hourglass shape
and a long handle, is filled partway with ground coffee, water and,
often, sugar and set into the hot sand until the mixture begins to
boil, about a minute. The pot is lifted out of the sand, stirred to
settle the coffee, and embedded again in the sand. The coffee is
allowed to come to a boil twice more.
</P>
<P>
   All Greek _ and Turkish _ coffee is boiled three times to
guarantee that it will be properly thick, with ample foam, or
kaimaki, on top. But Greek coffee is not often made in the sand.

that they started the custom of coffee drinking as we know it. &QL;

   JAPAN-POLITICS (Tokyo) _ Japan's Cabinet resigned en masse on
Tuesday, setting the stage for a rapid political succession, two
days after a life-threatening stroke incapacitated Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi. The resignation, which was formalized in a brief,
final Cabinet meeting Tuesday evening, is expected to lead to the
nomination of a candidate by the governing Liberal Democratic
Party, as early as Wednesday morning, to succeed Obuchi. A
parliamentary vote to ratify the party's choice, which is already
widely reported be the ruling party's second-ranked official,
Yoshiro Mori, would be held almost immediately afterwards. By
Howard W. French.

<P>
   MEDICARE-DRUGS (Washington) _ Seven months before Election Day,
the struggle over expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs
for the elderly is escalating, with both parties maneuvering
furiously on an issue with immense significance for a critical
group of voters. As the budget debate began in the Senate Tuesday,
for example, Democrats were pushing for an amendment that would
require the creation of a Medicare drug benefit before any tax cut
could take effect. President Clinton declared that their amendment
was ``good policy, the will of the American people, and addresses a
long-standing unmet need.'' Nu Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-STATUS (Washington) _ Americans are mailing in their
census forms at a rate well below what federal officials had hoped
for, raising concerns that getting an accurate population count
will take longer and cost more than it should, the chief of the
Census Bureau said Tuesday. By David Stout.

   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ There was sound. There was fury.
But what stock market investors wanted to know after Tuesday's
bizarre bungee-jump in share prices was, what does it signify?
Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in stock market
history, the Nasdaq composite index had plunged 634.31 points,
shearing 13.6 percent off its value. Had it closed there, it would
have been the worst one-day decline in Nasdaq history. But a flood
of buying rescued the composite, bringing it to close with a loss
of only 1.72 percent on the day. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-SUITS (Undated) _ The ruling against Microsoft in the
federal antitrust case potentially opens the door to a flood of
private litigation against the company by equipping potential
plaintiffs with a legal finding that it is an abusive monopolist.
In addition to a trickle of class-action suits that had already
begun, the decision could embolden major companies _ not only
rivals but in some cases customers of Microsoft _ to take action
against it. By Steve Lohr.

   SCI-HORMONE-REPLACEMENT (Undated) _ Women in a large study of
the effects of hormone replacement therapy have been told that
researchers have found a slight increase in risk for heart attacks,
stroke and blood clots. The study is not being halted but adds more
fuel to recent debate over whether estrogen therapy actually helps
the heart. Researchers said women should talk with doctors and
discuss treatment if they are taking the therapy in hopes of
reducing heart attack risk. By Gina Kolata.

They choose to free their dinner plates of animal products for a

seemed on the surface. (Includes 2-column B&AMP;W photo of Lancaster in

not all right. (Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)

John Lennon as detailed in Jon Wiener's new book is a fascinating

   SITTING IN SAFETY: Too big for most child car seats and too
small for standard seat belts, children from preschoolers to
third-graders are literally being put in harm's way. According to
recent pediatric and highway safety recommendations, children who
are under 9 years old and weigh less than 80 pounds should use
either a booster seat or a ``youth'' seat when riding in a car.
Experts say that at least half of the approximately 500 children a
year who died in auto accidents from 1994 to 1998 might have
survived if they had been properly restrained. (Includes 4-column

   A SEASON ON THE LAND: More flue-cured tobacco is grown in Pitt
County, N.C., than anywhere else in the nation. The culture and the
economy are rooted in tending the leaf, and in the self-reliant way
of life such labor demands. Yet as court rulings, public opinion
and pressure from Washington alter the fortunes of tobacco, change
has made its way into the fields.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TOBACCO PRIMER: In their infancy, tobacco plants look like
tiny shamrocks. As many as a million plants have taken root in the
warmth of W.C. Moore's greenhouse. The green fuzz sprouting in the
seed crates doesn't look like much, but with an average price, the
half-million pounds of leaf it will grow into could net $850,000.

   SITTING IN SAFETY: Too big for most child car seats and too
small for standard seat belts, children from preschoolers to
third-graders are literally being put in harm's way. According to
recent pediatric and highway safety recommendations, children who
are under 9 years old and weigh less than 80 pounds should use
either a booster seat or a ``youth'' seat when riding in a car.
Experts say that at least half of the approximately 500 children a
year who died in auto accidents from 1994 to 1998 might have
survived if they had been properly restrained. (Includes 4-column

with a megabucks television deal, stock-car racing probably will

   A SEASON ON THE LAND: More flue-cured tobacco is grown in Pitt
County, N.C., than anywhere else in the nation. The culture and the
economy are rooted in tending the leaf, and in the self-reliant way
of life such labor demands. Yet as court rulings, public opinion
and pressure from Washington alter the fortunes of tobacco, change
has made its way into the fields.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TOBACCO PRIMER: In their infancy, tobacco plants look like
tiny shamrocks. As many as a million plants have taken root in the
warmth of W.C. Moore's greenhouse. The green fuzz sprouting in the
seed crates doesn't look like much, but with an average price, the
half-million pounds of leaf it will grow into could net $850,000.

IN BOOKS FOR KIDS, ELLERBEE SENDS STRONG MESSAGE: GET REAL, AND BE
YOURSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casey Smith is a world-class journalist stuck in an
11-year-old's body _ an outspoken, opinionated loudmouth who wants
to right wrongs and ask all the tough questions. Megan O'Connor is
her popular and perpetually perky classmate _ a Mary Richards of
the preteen world whose sticky sweetness hides her backbone of
steel. Together the two are surviving their first year of middle
school, reviving the defunct-since-the-'80s school newspaper and
learning to get along with each other and their quirky newspaper
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Megan aren't real _ they're products of the
imaginative mind of world-class journalist Linda Ellerbee, and the
lead characters in her new series of novels for 8- to 12-year-olds
titled ``Get Real.'' Ellerbee, 55, whose life has taken some
unexpected turns from outspoken TV journalist to broadcast anchor
to TV producer and children's news show host, has now turned her
attention to promoting a simple message for kids: You don't have to
do what other people expect you to do. Be real.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee certainly looks ``real'' today. She's wearing jeans, a
black pullover shirt with a zipper and red Converse hightops. It's
the casual uniform of her series' hero, an 11-year-old girl with
bigger things than fashion on her mind. Ellerbee is in town as part
of a brief promotional tour plugging her books in major U.S.
cities. She's speaking to a Fort Worth audience of businesswomen
and their daughters, who look a bit like Casey and Megan. Ellerbee
is telling the dressed-up crowd at the Fort Worth Public Library a
little about her books but more about her own life.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee has two grown children, a daughter and a son. One plays
in a rock band and the other is a television producer.
</P>
<P>
   When she tells people this, Ellerbee explains, ``Invariably, the
next question is, `What instrument does your son play?'''
</P>
<P>
   So what instrument does her son play?
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee smiles. ``My son is a first-rate television producer,''
she says. ``My daughter plays lead guitar in a rock band.''
</P>
<P>
   Going against expectations _ what other people expect you to do
_ has been the story of Ellerbee's life, and now she's making it a
challenge for children. The executive producer, writer and host of
Nickelodeon's ``Nick News'' spent years surprising people in her
work as a journalist _ first as a correspondent and anchor at NBC,
later as the writer and anchor of an ABC historical series, and in
her current role as a strong and intelligent voice in children's
television. Through her company, Lucky Duck productions, Ellerbee
has also produced weighty and informative specials for children and
adults, dealing with AIDS and the environment, politics and current
events. Her award-winning work has been sometimes controversial and
almost always right on target.
</P>
<P>
   Now her work at Nick has helped to bring her to something new
again: writing a series of books about smart kids, for smart kids
ages 8-12. Through ``Nick News,'' Ellerbee has spent years talking
to children and learning what they care about. She's learned, she
says, that kids are more intelligent than most adults give them
credit for. They care about the world around them and they want to
change it, whether they're publishing a newspaper or producing TV
shows or playing in a rock band. With the ``Get Real'' book series,
Ellerbee is showing them how they can.
</P>
<P>
   The first two ``Get Real'' books arrived in stores in March. The
series shows a group of offbeat and intelligent sixth-graders
solving mysteries and putting out a school newspaper that uncovers
every bit of scandal and controversy their small Massachusetts town
can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Megan are both good role models for her preteen
readers, Ellerbee says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both strong girl characters; they're just very
different,'' she says. ``And often when we give young girls images
or messages of what they need to be, we give them only one kind of
message, and it's almost always the `Megan' message: It's OK to be
strong as long as you dress perfect and you're appealing and
people-pleasing. I wanted to give (readers) the message that it's
really OK to be who you are _ period _ end of story.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong girl characters help build strong girl readers, Ellerbee
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help give girls role models their own age that
they could look at them and say, `Hmm, maybe I'm in there _ maybe
part of that one is me _ maybe I'm part of this one,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Ellerbee found her own role models in books. When
she grew up in the 1950s, she said, girls weren't expected to have
ideas and opinions and adventures. But when she found Jo March in
``Little Women'' and Nancy Drew _ young women who were expressing
their ideas and solving mysteries and cutting off their hair _ ``It
was a way for me to see a world of possibilities,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, in a culture so different from 1950s America,
Ellerbee says girls need strong role models desperately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that around (age) 11, little girls' self-esteem starts
to drop,'' she says. ``Up until then, they feel powerful, they feel
they have voices _ and around 11, they start getting a message: If
you use those voices you won't be popular.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the theory psychologist Mary Pipher made popular with
``Reviving Ophelia,'' a 1994 book that discusses what Pipher calls
a ``girl-poisoning,'' sexist culture that erodes girls' spirit and
sense of value as they enter adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee says this problem is best solved by tearing down walls
between men and women _ and boys and girls. The ``Get Real'' series
is one of her personal strikes against those walls.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Casey and Megan are strong in different ways,
but Casey is the one with adventure in her blood. In the first
``Get Real'' book, ``Girl Reporter Blows Lid Off Town!,'' Casey
uncovers a paper mill's illegal pollution of the river that runs
through her town. In the second book _ ``Girl Reporter Sinks
School!'' _ she figures out who's been selling answers to tests at
her school, and discovers the pressures that sometimes lead
students to cheat. These stories go straight into the school
newspaper, ``Real News,'' and the students learn they have the
right to ask questions and the power to change things.
</P>
<P>
   The books are about kids working together, taking action and
learning that the world isn't black and white. They're not strictly
about girl power.
</P>
<P>
   The girl characters in the ``Get Real'' series, she says, can
provide role models for boys, too. And there are plenty of smart,
adventurous boys in the series.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the idea that books ``about'' girls are books ``for''
girls is part of the cultural problem, Ellerbee says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you no one says to (''Harry Potter'' series
author) J.K. Rowling, `Now, are these books only for boys?' '' she
says. ``And nobody ever said it to Mark Twain, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's television has led the way, Ellerbee says, in showing
that stories about girls can appeal to both sexes. Shows such as
Nickelodeon's ``Clarissa Explains It All'' and ``Alex Mack,'' with
female main characters, have attracted both male and female
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Books are now making the same progress. Boys are lining up to
buy Ellerbee's ``Get Real'' series as fast as girls, she says _
``which says to me that we have come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows that we (women) have all been given books with
little boy characters, and nobody thinks a thing about the fact
that little girls read `Tom Sawyer' or `Huck Finn' or `Harry
Potter,''' she says. ``But there's always been this myth that
little boys wouldn't read books where the lead characters were
girls. We've come to a place where that's finally changing; as long
as the characters themselves are strong, and the stories are good,
little boys will read them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was growing up in Houston, Ellerbee said, girls didn't
talk about careers. ``It was always about who you were going to
marry _ were you going to be the architect's wife, or the doctor's
wife or the ditch-digger's wife?'' she says. ``The idea was that
who your husband is defines who you are. Here it is the year 2000,
and we know... that much of that still exists _ that many parents
still encourage their little boys to be doctors and their daughters
to be doctors' wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Megan probably both have higher goals than simply
marrying a doctor. But although Ellerbee especially hopes girls
find inspiration in her strong girl ``Get Real'' characters, she's
writing the books for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write stories about kids who aren't perfect, who
make mistakes, who aren't always likable but who have a passion
about something,'' Ellerbee says.
</P>
<P>
   Boys and girls _ and even world-class journalists. All doing
what you might not expect them to.

`HUMAN RESOURCES': A WHITE-COLLAR INNOCENT IN BLUE-COLLAR
TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Human Resources'' begins innocently enough as the story of an
eager beaver fresh out of business school who returns from Paris to
his home in the provinces to take a white-collar job at the factory
where his father has worked for 30 years. In these opening scenes,
Frank (Jalil Lespert), the pride of his blue-collar family, is a
veritable Boy Scout: a little overconfident perhaps but also a
model son and, once he lands a job in the factory's human resources
division, a dutiful, enthusiastic employee bursting with new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``Human Resources'' goes along, it slowly and
deliberately spirals its ingenuous hero down a treacherous rabbit
hole of duplicity and corporate politics that eventually threatens
to put Frank and his father (Jean-Claude Vallod) on opposite sides
of a war between management and labor. As it burrows into its
subject, this smart, coolheaded and ultimately wrenching film,
directed by Laurent Cantet, explores class differences, corporate
behavior, labor relations and father-son strife with an unusual
depth and subtlety. The story it tells might be described as a
naive young man's unsentimental education.
</P>
<P>
   As schematic as it becomes, ``Human Resources'' never loses its
poignant human dimension. It is so beautifully acted that the cast,
especially the nonprofessional actors playing the embattled factory
workers, seems plucked from the streets of a provincial French
town. Lespert brings just enough eager-beaver unctuousness to his
part so that Frank never seems heroic. Although the movie doesn't
stridently take sides, its sympathies tilt toward the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's unhappy lesson in labor relations begins when he
suggests to his bosses that the workers be polled on the
desirability of a 35-hour workweek. What better way, he imagines,
could management demonstrate to the assembly-line workers that they
have a voice in how things are done? But the tough, grizzled union
representative, Amoux (Danielle Melador), immediately smells a rat.
Frank is devastated when the results of the survey become a
justification for more layoffs. When he discovers that his own
father is on the list of those to be dismissed, he is faced with
excruciating choices. His wildly impulsive responses only compound
the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As anguished as ``Human Resources'' becomes, it is wise in the
ways of the workplace, and the movie could be read as a cautionary
primer for those entering the labor force. Frank is so eager to
prove himself that he initially ignores the chain of command and
steps on a few toes. He also learns that his relationship with his
friends on the assembly line is compromised by his new status, and
he finds himself resented and feared.
</P>
<P>
   Pathetically susceptible to the flattery and manipulation of his
boss (Lucien Longueville), he also learns you can't be on both
sides of a labor war. But his most painful lessons have to do with
being the son of a man who sacrificed to send him through college
so that he could become a white-collar manager and in effect the
enemy. The crowning irony of Frank's ``success'' is that it
alienates him from the father who made it possible. The movie's
dramatic climax is a father-son confrontation of stunning cruelty.
Although the movie stops short of outright tragedy, it is suffused
with a grief born of rifts that may never be mended.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore and Cuban boy
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore said Tuesday that Elian Gonzalez's father should be
allowed to take his son home ``if the father says on free soil that
he believes the son should go back to Cuba with him.'' Gore also
said a family court should be involved. In doing so, Gore denied
that he changed course last week when he broke with the
administration by saying the 6-year-old should be allowed to remain
in the United States with permanent residency status while his
custody case is heard in family court.
</P>
<P>
   A BUS WITHOUT THE `STRAIGHT TALK' LOGO
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month after giving up his presidential effort, John
McCain was back on a campaign bus Tuesday urging New Yorkers to
elect his ``soul mate,'' Rudy Giuliani, to help reform big-money
politics. In Giuliani, ``I think I will have a staunch and strong
ally in the United States Senate for campaign finance reform,''
McCain told a town hall meeting of more than 100 people at an
American Legion post in Northport. Giuliani agreed with McCain on
campaign funding, even though Giuliani aims to raise $20 million,
some of it in soft donations, in his battle against Hillary Rodham
Clinton. ``I have to be competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   THE `MOTHERHOOD PENALTY'
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said Tuesday that he would make Social Security more
fair for women who take time off from work to raise children. The
current Social Security formula is based on average earnings over
35 years of work. Because millions of women take several years to
raise their children, the typical woman works 27 years. Those years
raising children do not count toward Social Security earnings,
effectively creating a ``motherhood penalty.'' Gore said his
proposal would allow parents to take credit for up to five years of
earnings if they take that time to raise children. That would
increase Social Security benefits for those women by about $600 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   SOFT MONEY IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Two watchdog groups, Common Cause and Democracy 21, filed a
complaint Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission charging
that special accounts established by the political parties to
benefit Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rudy
Giuliani are illegal. The complaint targets accounts set up by the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National
Republican Senatorial Committee to accept unlimited soft money
contributions from unions, corporations and individuals who are not
permitted to give directly to individual campaigns. The Democrats
said the accounts have been used in Senate elections for years. The
Republican committee did return calls from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   SPARE THE ROD
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at a high school near Philadelphia on Tuesday,
George W. Bush promised to work for local control of education and
for a ``teacher protection'' law barring lawsuits against teachers
or principals who enforce reasonable discipline. ``I don't want to
be the federal superintendent of schools,'' he told a group of
teachers, parents, school administrators and student and community
leaders. ``I trust local people to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG PROFIT FOR NONPROFIT
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit group allied with the House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas) raised $1.3 million in 1998 from five donors, including
one that contributed $1 million, according to an investigation by
the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call and the Washington Post. Under
the tax code, the Virginia-based group, U.S. Family Network, run by
Robert Mills, a former campaign manager for DeLay, need not
publicly disclose the names of donors, though their contributions
are not tax-deductible. Public records show the group has lobbied
Congress for four years on issues such as school prayer, although
Roll Call reported that U.S. Family Network officials did not
formally register as lobbyists until February.
</P>
<P>
   DELAYED CRITICISM
</P>
<P>
   Roll Call also revealed some unsavory spending habits of the
U.S. Family Network, the right-leaning nonprofit group with close
ties to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas). Expenses shown on
the group's 1997 and 1998 tax forms include more than $100,000 in
salaries for former DeLay staffers and their families, as well as
$149,000 for a 15-year lease on an unspecified stadium skybox.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL TRAVEL RULED OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Fox News Channel reported that the Bush campaign has decided
for now that there will be no foreign travel for George W. There
were discussions about going to Europe, then to Latin America,
according to Fox. But, ``campaign advisers have decided that such a
trip might only call attention to the governor's lack of foreign
policy experience,'' Fox said. The cable channel also said that
Bush has stopped chatting off the record with reporters on the
campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   PLENTY OF PENNSYLVANIA
</P>
<P>
   Six Pennsylvania Democrats are competing Tuesday for the chance
to challenge Republican Sen. Rick Santorum in November. But the
primary winner can expect an uphill battle in the fall: No Democrat
has won a full six-year Senate term in Pennsylvania in 38 years.
The primary was too close to call among Rep. Ron Klink, former
state Labor Secretary Thomas Foley and state Sen. Allyson Schwartz.
The three others failed to register beyond single digits in any
poll. Santorum had no competition on the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL DIVIDE, DONATION DIVIDE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore talked in Atlanta about getting technology into the
hands of those who can't afford it, then turned to fund-raising
among those who can afford it. ``Computers and an Internet hookup
are as vital to education in this century as a blackboard and chalk
were in the last generation,'' Gore told students and civil rights
group members at Morehouse College. But Cox Newspapers' Kathey
Pruitt reported that it was definitely the ``haves,'' not the
``have-nots,'' who spent the latter part of the evening with Gore.
He participated in a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser at a
home in Atlanta's fashionable Buckhead section, where the going
rate for entry was $100,000 a couple. The event was expected to
raise up to $2 million for the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE THEY SHOULD COPYRIGHT THEIR SPEECHES?
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a phrase George W. Bush, used a week ago, Al Gore said
in his Morehouse College speech in Atlanta on Monday that Americans
should consider bad schools a ``national emergency'' _ and insisted
he was the first to use the phrase. ``We need to treat the
existence of failing schools as a national emergency. I used that
phrase a year ago.'' Gore reiterated his promise to have every
classroom and library linked to the Internet by the end of his
first term. He also supports funding for computer-equipped
technology centers in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   GIVE TILL IT HURTS?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and wife Laura donated $334,000 to charity in
1998, the same year he sold his interest in the Texas Rangers
baseball team. Al Gore and wife Tipper gave away a little more than
$15,000 in 1998, but it was a larger share of their taxable income.
The Gores' contributions amounted to almost 7 percent of their 1998
taxable income of about $224,000, while the Bushes' donations
represented just under 2 percent of their taxable income of $18.4
million. Bush got more than $14 million when he sold his interest
in the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   A WIN, A LOSS AND A TIE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore had a double-digit lead over George W. Bush in a new New
York poll, while Bush had the advantage over Gore in a survey taken
in traditionally Republican Indiana. The two were tied in a new
poll that came out in Wisconsin. In New York: Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion (4 percentage point error margin),
Gore up 49 percent to 38 percent. In Indiana: Indiana University
Center for Survey Research (4.5 percentage point error margin),
Bush up 54 percent to 36 percent. In Wisconsin: St. Norbert College
poll (4 percentage point margin error), 46 percent apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ONE-SIDED ETHNIC POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Democratic senatorial candidate Jon Corzine accused a
spurned would-be campaign worker of trying to blackmail him by
threatening to go public with more ``dirt'' about supposed slurs
against Italian-Americans. Meanwhile, Sen. Robert Torricelli
appeared with Corzine in Newark and made it clear he supports
Corzine over ex-Gov. Jim Florio. Corzine, of Italian extraction
himself, apologized last week for making joking remarks about
cement shoes to an Italian-American contractor. Corzine said the
threats came from Michael Cino, a co-chairman of an
Italian-American Democratic club who had sought a job with the
Corzine campaign for several months.
</P>
<P>
   A RIDGE TOO FAR
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman stood mute last week as George
W. Bush answered a question about whether she could be his running
mate. But Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, when couldn't stop talking
about not talking when Bush was asked the same thing about him: ``I
just say this with great respect. First of all, it is the
governor's call, pure and simple, and the last thing in that very
important process he needs is other elected officials running
around saying, `Hey, I got a call, I got a call, I'm on the list.'
Secondly, it's not fair to the individuals, it won't be fair to the
person that the governor ultimately selects, so I'm just going to
lay it all out: I'm never going to tell you,'' Ridge added.
</P>
<P>
   HERE COMES THAT CONSPIRACY AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton said Rudy Giuliani is tapping into a
network of right-wing, non-New Yorkers to help pile up his
fund-raising lead in their Senate contest. ``He is playing on their
fears and sending out these direct-mail requests,'' said Clinton,
who has raised $12 million to Giuliani's $19 million. Giuliani's
fund-raising letters are ``more in line with the right wing of
America than the mainstream of New Yorkers,'' she said. Giuliani
campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum responded: ``Mrs. Clinton is
obviously disappointed in her campaign and its ability to attract
more support, so now she's reverting to that old Clinton ruse of
blaming the vast right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE TO THE UN-TERM-LIMITED
</P>
<P>
   Why would someone like Elaine Bloom, who has been a fixture in
the Florida House of Representatives, an outspoken Democrat who has
served at various times as deputy majority leader, speaker pro tem,
and chair of the health and tourism committees, give that up to run
an uphill campaign against popular 10-term Republican Rep. E. Clay
Shaw Jr.? Two words: term limits. In the early 1990s, 18 states
placed a limit in the early 1990s on the number of years that
legislators and many other state officials could serve. So
situations like Bloom's are a consequence that few of the advocates
foresaw when the term-limit measures were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER ASBESTOS?
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos legislation in Congress is the latest subject to find
its way into issue advertising in this year's campaigns. In
Minnesota, a coalition of labor, environmental and consumer groups,
along with trial lawyers, is behind a TV ad against Republican Sen.
Rod Grams. Grams co-sponsored a bill to set up a system to screen
asbestos victims and essentially allow only the seriously injured
to be compensated. The ad flashes a 1964 photo of Minneapolis plant
workers, a dozen of whom have since died from asbestos-related
disease, and accuses Grams of ``pushing legislation to let the
asbestos companies off the hook.'' Grams campaign manager Pat Fiske
would not comment.

 &HT;    McCAIN PLANS MICROSOFT HEARINGS
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain and
other lawmakers called Tuesday for congressional hearings on the
Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the role of Congress to assess two things,''
McCain, R-Ariz., said on NBC's ``Today'' show one day after U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft
broke federal antitrust laws. ``One, the impact on the consumer of
such action that might have to be taken on the part of Microsoft;
and, two, what is the impact on this incredible engine that's
driving America's economy?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., a member of the Commerce Committee,
said he believed Congress should hold hearings to learn more about
Microsoft, but not to prepare for legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legitimate to look into anything that impacts the public
to this extent,'' Cleland said. ``But I would want to keep the
hearings more in the realm of informational, because it's ticklish
for Congress to get involved with a subject that is in the process
of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the case for now is being decided in the courts and in
private talks among litigants, several Republican lawmakers seemed
eager to get involved as advisers to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas urged Microsoft to
appeal the ruling because ``the government's case stands on the
shifting sands of a rapidly changing marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said in a statement that the Justice
Department ``clearly wishes to destroy the world's most successful
software company.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R- Ga., agreed with that assessment and added
that Congress may eventually take action. ``I am afraid that this
ruling might ultimately necessitate congressional action to clarify
antitrust laws,'' he said. ``This may be the only way to curb the
excesses of the Justice Department's destructive barrage of
regulations. ``
</P>
<P>
   But reaction to the Microsoft ruling was not entirely along
partisan lines. For example, Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, a Microsoft critic, also promised hearings and said
in a statement that he ``was surprised that Microsoft did not heed
the advice of so many to seize the opportunity to admit to its
wrongdoings, recognize that the law does apply to Microsoft, and
put its past behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats were more inclined to support the Justice
Department, they were not united. Among the Democrats most
disappointed by the court's ruling was Sen. Patty Murray, who
represents Microsoft's home state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, she said that ``if upheld, this ruling will
throw a wrench in the gears of competition.'' Murray added that
Microsoft ``will prevail because the government's attorneys have
not convincingly proven the case that Microsoft's actions harmed
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee, refused to comment on Microsoft, saying, ``I
do not think it's appropriate to discuss the specifics of a matter
that is pending before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic counterpart, Vice President Al Gore, issued no
statement.

Department ``clearly wishes to destroy the world's most successful
software company.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R- Ga., agreed with that assessment and added
that Congress may eventually take action. ``I am afraid that this
ruling might ultimately necessitate congressional action to clarify
antitrust laws,'' he said. ``This may be the only way to curb the
excesses of the Justice Department's destructive barrage of
regulations. ``
</P>
<P>
   But reaction to the Microsoft ruling was not entirely along
partisan lines. For example, Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, a Microsoft critic, also promised hearings and said
in a statement that he ``was surprised that Microsoft did not heed
the advice of so many to seize the opportunity to admit to its
wrongdoings, recognize that the law does apply to Microsoft, and
put its past behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats were more inclined to support the Justice
Department, they were not united. Among the Democrats most
disappointed by the court's ruling was Sen. Patty Murray, who
represents Microsoft's home state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, she said that ``if upheld, this ruling will
throw a wrench in the gears of competition.'' Murray added that
Microsoft ``will prevail because the government's attorneys have
not convincingly proven the case that Microsoft's actions harmed
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee, refused to comment on Microsoft, saying, ``I
do not think it's appropriate to discuss the specifics of a matter
that is pending before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic counterpart, Vice President Al Gore, issued no
statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first course arrives like a spring still life, a
shallow white bowl containing a tangle of pea shoots and mint and
an artful scattering of fresh peas. Then the waiter appears,
bearing a shining copper saucepan filled with a hot, clear broth.
He gently pours it over the vegetables, and before your eyes the
dish comes to life: so fragrant, limpid and beautiful that it
hardly deserves such an ordinary name.
</P>
<P>
   Pea soup.
</P>
<P>
   It is a striking and unexpected beginning to a meal, and it owes
everything to a simple trick of presentation: a two-step process
that elevates the first course from commonplace to nearly haute
cuisine. Unlike many pleasures of restaurant dining, the technique
is perfect for entertaining at home.
</P>
<P>
   The garnishes can be arranged on the plates hours ahead, the
soup served hot at the table from a tureen or a pitcher, without
the risk of sloshing over a shallow rim on the way to the dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants everywhere are serving soup this way. In Manhattan,
Quince, Sea Grill, Cello, Palladin, Jean Georges and Thalia are
just a few of them. But no one is certain where the style
originated. Eberhard Muller, the chef and an owner of Lutece, said
he first saw it in Paris, possibly at L'Archestrate, a Michelin
three-star restaurant, which was owned by Alain Senderens.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the 1970s, when nouvelle cuisine was coming into
vogue, and classic tableside service from rolling carts was
replaced by dishes artfully placed on oversize dinnerware in the
kitchen. A few chefs like Senderens began putting only the garnish
in the dish, which was topped with a ladleful of soup at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese chefs, like Tadashi Ono of Sono and Nao Sugiyama
of Sugiyama, have also become devotees of this style, but Ono said
it is not really Japanese. ``I learned it in France,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Lutece last winter, Muller's waiters spooned cauliflower
cream over a hillock of tiny cauliflower buds, glistening with
osetra caviar. At the Sea Grill in Rockefeller Center, diners who
order asparagus soup this spring are presented with a large bowl
laid out with a precious mound of sauteed morels, ramps, fava beans
and asparagus tips. Then a verdant asparagus puree is poured in.
Either dish would work beautifully at home.
</P>
<P>
   A little trickier is what Michael Otsuka has devised at Thalia:
a consomme of fresh tuna, ladled over slivers of raw tuna with
crisp Japanese vegetables. The broth cooks the fish no more than it
needs, which is perhaps better than if the entire dish had been
finished in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But the presentation is less about efficiency than theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can present something pretty, almost festive, instead of a
plain white bowl, and it grabs the diner's attention, making it a
special occasion,'' said Morgen Jacobson, the chef at Quince. In
addition to clear pea soups, he also serves a silky Japanese
pumpkin soup over a green apple and salmon garnish.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner party, the main advantage, apart from the visual
effect, is that soup can always be prepared in advance, often days
or weeks before, if there is space in the freezer. And the
garnishes can be arranged hours before company arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Something as simple as good homemade chicken soup can be ladled
over garnishes like slivers of avocado and pieces of crab meat
seasoned with lime juice and cilantro or over hedgehog mushrooms
and roasted garlic with bits of crackling pancetta. The soup is
greater than the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   A mushroom or beef consomme or a gossamer vegetable puree,
zapped Thai-style, with lemon grass, ginger, lime and a splash of
chili oil, can be ladled over small shrimp seasoned with cilantro
and basil. Chili, garlic and bold herbs can always be used to
season the garnishes because the soup will dilute their impact.
</P>
<P>
   Because the garnishes are spare, no more than a tablespoon or
two for each guest, it is possible to indulge and add a few sauteed
morel mushrooms, shards of truffle, dicings of barely cooked fresh
foie gras or a ration of caviar. All ingredients, regardless of the
cost, should be arranged attractively in the bowls. Using shallow
soup plates will show off the garnish and guarantee that it will
not be submerged by the soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You set up a small portion of the food and make it look
pretty, like it's ready to eat.'' Jacobson said. A little tepee can
be made of asparagus tips standing over a few plump morels, or a
rosette made of radish slices under tiny avocado cubes, with a tuft
of radish sprouts on top.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs also pay attention to textures, and many garnishes add
crunch. Try tossing in tiny croutons fried in olive oil with tender
diced mushrooms. Julienned radish, daikon, carrot, turnip or apple
can contribute a crisp note.
</P>
<P>
   Cold soups work well, too. Consider putting the diced garnish
for gazpacho in chilled bowls first, or serving dessert soup this
way, especially with ice cream as the garnish. ``If you try to put
a cold fruit soup in a bowl with some ice cream or sorbet in the
kitchen, it will melt by the time it comes to the table,'' Muller
said.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's a warm fruit soup, like the buttery pineapple rum
broth that Marc Murphy spoons over rum raisin ice cream at La
Fourchette, there's no other way. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Madison Avenue were in charge of marketing chard
(alias Swiss chard), copywriters would no doubt have coined some
catchy slogan, like ``two vegetables for the price of one.''
Unfortunately, vegetable marketing is not nearly that
sophisticated, and most cooks think chard is simply spinach with
ruffled leaves and thick stems.
</P>
<P>
   Chard leaves can be used in most recipes calling for spinach
(salads are the exception, since chard leaves are too tough to eat
raw), but the ``chard equals spinach'' formula ignores the fact
that the stems of the two vegetables are very different.
</P>
<P>
   Spinach stems are stringy and fibrous and don't make very good
eating. Chard stems have a delicious, earthy flavor and a
distinctive texture that is silky and meaty when cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Given its versatility, chard deserves more attention. But the
somewhat confusing name it goes by here, Swiss chard, does not
accurately reflect its culinary heritage. Unlike Belgian endive,
which really is a Belgian specialty, Swiss chard is most popular in
France and Italy, not Switzerland. (In fact, how it acquired this
label is one of food history's mysteries.)
</P>
<P>
   Another name for chard, leaf beet, is more helpful in
understanding it, as this member of the beet family is bred to
produce copious amounts of greens rather than swollen bulbs.
Chard's familial ties explain its slightly sweet flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Most supermarkets carry two varieties of chard: one with white
stems and veins running through the leaves (the so-called white
chard) and another with bright red stems and veins. Red chard is
often labeled rhubarb chard or ruby chard.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' markets and specialty stores sometimes sell chard with
pink, purple, orange or yellow stems and veins. These brightly
colored varieties, marketed as rainbow or Bright Lights chard, are
slightly sweeter than white chard, but all types can be used
interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   Most chard recipes use either the leaves or stems, so the first
step when preparing chard is to separate the two. It's easiest to
do this machete-style with a chef's knife. Hold each leaf by the
stem end with the leaf pointing down, and slash on either side of
the stem to cut away the leafy green portion.
</P>
<P>
   The thickest part of the rib that travels up the leaf will come
off at the same time. Like all greens, chard can be gritty and
needs washing in successive bowls of cold water. Stem blemishes
should be trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to cook chard leaves is in a deep, covered pot;
make sure to leave some moisture clinging to the leaves. Saute some
aromatics like garlic, onions or leeks in oil first, add the damp
chard, cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until wilted _ no
more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil and sauteed garlic are the classic Italian flavorings,
embellished with toasted nuts, anchovies, raisins or hot red pepper
flakes. But chard works well with a range of seasonings, everything
from chilies and cilantro to mustard seeds and ginger.
</P>
<P>
   For something a bit more exotic, wilt some chard leaves, squeeze
them dry, then season with sweetened soy sauce and sesame, or
perhaps a little lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Serve the
chard chilled as a refreshing first course.
</P>
<P>
   The greens also make an excellent addition to pasta sauces
(chopped, blanched chard is delicious with garlicky beans and
orecchiette) as well as soups and egg dishes. Large leaves can be
blanched and stuffed with cooked grains, meat or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Stems are best simmered in water or stock until tender, about 10
minutes, and then covered in a sauce and baked in a small gratin
dish. A classic treatment is bechamel sauce and cheese, although
lighter options, like tomato sauce and a dusting of Parmesan,
better highlight the flavor of the chard.
</P>
<P>
   For more richness, dot blanched stems with several tablespoons
of butter, and sprinkle generously with Parmesan or Gruyere.
Another delicious option is to layer chard stems with browned
onions and cream. Top the dish with bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Stems can also be braised or stewed. Cook garlic and anchovies
in a little olive oil, add some diced canned tomatoes and trimmed
chard stems, cover and cook until tender. Or simply boil the stems
until very tender (preferably in stock, for added flavor) and then
dress like asparagus, maybe with lemon and butter, or herb
vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Chard is available year-round, but spring through fall are its
prime seasons. Avoid bunches with ragged-looking or torn leaves.
The stems should be firm and a bright white or red. Chard should
smell fresh and earthy, not musty or sour.
</P>
<P>
   If you need another reason to buy chard, consider this: chard,
like spinach, is loaded with iron, calcium and beta carotene, but
because it has less oxalic acid, our bodies more easily absorb its
nutrients. Two vegetables for the price of one, plus superior
nutrition. It's hard to resist that pitch. &QL;

   BAKED CHARD STEMS WITH TOMATOES, GARLIC AND PARMESAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound chard stems (about 12 large stems), bruised parts
trimmed, halved crosswise
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for baking dish
</P>
<P>
   2 medium garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 14{-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { cup grated Parmesan cheese. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bring several quarts of water to
a boil in a large pot. Add chard stems and salt to taste. Cook
until stems are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, cook oil and garlic in a medium skillet over
medium heat until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes
and simmer until sauce is almost dry, about 5 minutes. Stir in
parsley and salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cover bottom of a lightly greased 8-inch-square baking dish
with a single layer of chard, cutting stems as necessary to make
them fit. Spoon a little tomato sauce over chard and sprinkle with
a little cheese. Repeat this process two more times, alternating
direction of stems for each layer and using remaining tomato sauce
and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bake until chard is very tender and top layer is lightly
browned, about 25 minutes. Remove pan from oven and let settle for
5 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings as a side dish. &QL;

`JUST SIX NUMBERS': GETTING DOWN TO EARTH WITH THE ASTRONOMICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Famous cosmology books that offer to explain the universe to the
astronomically inept like myself have always ended up disappointing
me. Stephen Hawking's ``Brief History of Time'' may have been the
least understood best seller of all time. Steven Weinberg's ``First
Three Minutes'' didn't sell as well as Hawking's book, but it
competed with it in the difficult-to-wrap-your-mind-around
sweepstakes. In light of that, I opened Martin Rees' ``Just Six
Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe,'' another
astronomical overview for laymen, with some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   I needn't have. Rees' book is not easy; portions of it are even
quite elusive. Still, it manages to be both a deep and an
accessible book, and it answers a lot of the questions produced by
natural wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea of ``Just Six Numbers'' is that the universe is
amazingly fine-tuned, and that if certain basic features were
mathematically just a little bit different, we wouldn't be here,
and neither would much else in the present universe. The force that
holds the atomic nucleus together _ Rees' epsilon _ is one example,
since, if it were just a bit larger or just a bit smaller, there
would be no stars. Or, if the force of gravity were only slightly
different, the universe would never have come into existence. Rees,
an English cosmologist who holds the title of astronomer royal at
Cambridge University, explains why these various numbers account
for the universe as it formed over the last 10 to 12 billion years
_ and he gives us some sense of what will happen to it in the
future (a prediction based on another of his six numbers).
</P>
<P>
   Most compelling, Rees also shows the deep and powerful
connections between ourselves and everything else, the way our
existence and the nature of the universe are part of one consistent
picture. Perhaps it is obvious to some that if the Andromeda Galaxy
weren't there, neither would we be, but to me that revelation
brought a mystical, almost spiritual frisson. We are, Rees tells
us, quite literally made of stardust. ``We cannot understand our
origins without the cosmic context,'' he writes at the beginning of
his cosmological-mathematical-philosophical rumination. If you
apply yourself at something more than a casual level to his
nontechnical, layman-friendly prose, you can pretty much understand
what he means even when the concepts get, as it were, pretty
stratospheric.
</P>
<P>
   Rees answers basic questions like this: Why could we exist only
in a very big universe? If the universe weren't something on the
order of 10 billion light years across, life on earth would be
impossible. This is because it took some 4.5 billion years for
human life to develop here on earth from the original single cell
organisms, and it took just as long for the earliest stars to have
produced the materials that make up our life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very hugeness of our universe, which seems at first to
signify how unimportant we are in the cosmic scheme, is actually
entailed by our existence!'' Rees exclaims. ``The expanse of space
is not an extravagant superfluity; it's a consequence of the
prolonged chain of events, extending back before our solar system
formed, that preceded our arrival on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Rees then gives a capsule history of cosmic formation, showing
how the original element, hydrogen, transmuted into all of the
others, up to the biggest, most complex naturally occurring one,
uranium. ``Supernovae have created the `mix' of atoms that the
earth is made of and that are the building blocks for the intricate
chemistry of life,'' Rees writes. When they exploded, they showered
the universe with the debris that, eons later, ended up in the
gaseous swirl that, eons after that, formed the sun and the planets
of our solar system. This cosmic history explains why there is a
great deal of carbon and iron in the world but very little gold. It
is because the elements in their natural state exist in the same
proportions as they were created during the eventful life cycles of
the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers that Rees introduces demonstrate the almost
fantastic concatenation of cosmic characteristics that enables us
to have come into being. Not everything here is crystal clear. The
concept of antimatter could have used a bit more explanation, for
example, and, I'm sorry to say that the theory of superstrings _
``that the various subnuclear particles are different modes of
vibration'' _ continues to elude me.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, despite several readings of the relevant passages, did I
quite understand the connection that Rees asserts between the force
that holds protons and neutrons together _ his epsilon _ which is
0.007, and the percentage of the mass of the helium atom that turns
into energy in the process of fusion, also 0.007. Perhaps a more
adept reader will have no trouble with this.
</P>
<P>
   Even I got the reason that the figure 0.007 is indispensable. If
it were stronger, protons would bind together so readily that all
the hydrogen in the universe would quickly mutate into heavier
elements, and without hydrogen the stars would be without the
nuclear energy that enabled them to create the other building
blocks of life. If it were weaker, then larger atoms would have
been unable to stay together, with the result, as Rees explains
this, that ``we would have a simple universe composed of hydrogen,
whose atom consists of one proton orbited by a single electron, and
no chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, Rees introduces some theological speculation. Does
the fine-tuning of the universe presuppose a universe-tuner, a
beneficent creator? His answer to that question has to do with the
possibility that there may be multiverses, separate universes that
``cooled down differently, ending up governed by different laws and
defined by different numbers.'' That is highly speculative, Rees
acknowledges, but the six numbers that he uses to describe the one
universe we can see are not speculative at all, and they have been
made accessible to ordinary intelligence by this marvelous little
book.

 (Dining)  
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hostess hovered over the table, making sure her
green-bordered place cards with calligraphy were at the proper
settings. Nearby, in the glow of the fireplace, her guests mingled
over drinks.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, the final touches were being put on the Chilean
sea bass that had been marinating in acacia honey and soy sauce.
When the five-course dinner was actually served, the setting and
mood had the elegance and intimacy of a Park Avenue apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But the candlelight dinner party Regine Traulsen and her
husband, William J. Diamond, gave recently was not in their home,
but in a private dining room at a restaurant, upstairs at Cello, on
the Upper East Side. Like more and more New Yorkers, the couple had
taken their entertaining to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that private rooms were the exclusive domain of
the rich and well connected. Only a few of the best restaurants had
them _ Le Perigord, ``21,'' Le Cirque _ and they were out of reach
for the average diner.
</P>
<P>
   But today, restaurants at all levels are building private rooms
of all descriptions, from imitation manor houses, like Cello's, to
refitted bank vaults, like Vine's, in the financial district. And
New Yorkers, eager to entertain but short on time, are filling
them. Sometimes even before the restaurants have opened.
</P>
<P>
   Private dining rooms have taken on the cachet of the chef's
table in the kitchen. It's no wonder: some of the rooms are truly
remarkable. At Metrazur, the private room is perched above Grand
Central Terminal, eye-level with one of the enormous glittering
chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   Guastavino's velvet room looks over the entire restaurant;
Lupa's private rooms are as intimate and charming as a Tuscan
farmhouse. Even older places like Le Bernardin are reconfiguring
their spaces to add them on (its new room is scheduled to open in
October).
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the novelty of the private rooms, entertaining in a
restaurant has another attraction: there's no opportunity for
guests to size up the hosts by address, decor or the contents of
the medicine cabinet. And the hosts gain all the pleasure of a
party, from setting up the guest list to planning the menu and the
wine, with none of the pain of cooking and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike at a party in the main restaurant, the host can
control virtually every aspect _ personalized menu cards and table
settings, family linens, the selection of music and even how loud
it's played.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can live in a dungeon and entertain like you're in a
country manor,'' said Adam D. Tihany, the restaurant designer. His
firm designed Le Cirque 2000 and Jean Georges, both with private
rooms (library-like at Le Cirque, hotel-room impersonal at Jean
Georges), and just added a small private dining room to the Sea
Grill at Rockefeller Center that gives the effect of being in a
glass box.
</P>
<P>
   The three private dining rooms at Kings' Carriage House, on the
Upper East Side, a restaurant popular as a party spot, have held
lunches or dinners for Rosie O'Donnell, Leona Helmsley and Frank
McCourt as well as for brides-to-be, secretaries and investment
bankers whose names never appear in boldface.
</P>
<P>
   Like the restaurants themselves, private rooms range widely in
price. The Traulsen-Diamond dinner at Cello cost $250 a person for
food, including tip (but not wine), but other dinners in the same
room have cost $130 a person. In less elaborate restaurants, the
bill can be less than $50 a person.
</P>
<P>
   At Kings' Carriage House, where the rooms feel as if they're in
Virginia horse country, a three-course lunch _ perhaps warm
Camembert in puff pastry with lingonberry sauce, pan-seared salmon
and dark Belgian chocolate truffle cake _ is $27 a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost felt like we were in a country house,'' said Cathy
Klauber Cooper, whose grandmother Lillian Klein gave a luncheon
there. ``But of course, when you stepped outside, the sound of the
taxis kind of ruined it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dining rooms can be booked for as few as two (at Picholine, near
Lincoln Center) or as many as 200 (at Vine, which opens next week).
The 50s modern private room at the Brasserie, in Midtown, can seat
40; Eleven Madison Park's can seat 54.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Second Avenue Deli has the Molly Picon Room in the back
that holds 50, with walls covered with pictures from the Yiddish
theater. The Tonic devotes more space to private dining than to the
main restaurant: it has three private rooms with private entrances
and bars that hold 25 to 180 each.
</P>
<P>
   David H. Koch, the oil executive, often entertains in the
private room upstairs at La Grenouille, in Midtown, even though he
and his wife, Julia, live in the apartment once owned by Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis and have a French chef on their staff. Koch said he
actually prefers going there to going to someone's home. He said
the food was a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he said, ``we can entertain about 12 to 20 people
comfortably and maybe 30 people if we move the living room
furniture _ but who has the energy to move the furniture?'' The
private room at La Grenouille can seat 40 and has a working
fireplace and is full of artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are happy to oblige people like Koch, at least
partly because it is so profitable. With a private dinner, if there
are choices at all, they are limited, usually two choices for the
main course and maybe one vegetarian option.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Menin, one of the owners of Vine, put it this way:
``Before the dinner, you know you're going to order 50 filets
mignons. If they don't eat it, well, they paid for it. In the
restaurant itself you never know if people are going to show up for
their reservations or how much they are going to order.'' The
restaurant also knows exactly how many waiters and bartenders to
have on duty.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the party is too small to pay its way with the dinner bill
alone, there is often a flat fee for the room, which can easily run
into four figures.
</P>
<P>
   Vine, in an 1898 building on Broad Street, with private rooms in
bank vaults once owned by J.P. Morgan, is another restaurant with
more event space than restaurant space: six private dining rooms
totaling more than 6,000 square feet. The private rooms will have
sofas for smoking after-dinner cigars, martini and single-malt
scotch bars and a private entrance. Prices start at $120 a person,
and 40 parties are already booked, Menin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the bottom line,'' added Menin, a former
corporate lawyer who spent several years researching the food
industry. ``For every $100 you book in catering, you should bring
$40 to the bottom line. That's so much higher than in the
restaurant business, where it's more likely that you would bring 10
to 15 percent to the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, diners would have had to book the whole restaurant
for a private party. But restaurateurs are reluctant to do that
anymore, with business booming in their main dining rooms as well.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of La Goulue, on the Upper East Side, said they had
had so many requests for private dining that their new location, in
the former Mortimer's, will include a secluded private room for 40
when the space opens, in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good restaurants have known for quite a while that there's a
good chunk of business in private dining,'' Tihany said, ``but the
question always comes up about can we find the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Freiser, 34, who runs an art gallery in Chelsea, booked a
room at Vine for May. He can't fit 30 people in his apartment, but
he is not looking for a homey environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be sexy to eat among safe-deposit boxes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Booking a private dining room is also a way to get into a hot
new restaurant before it even opens. On a recent Saturday night,
Ann Dexter-Jones, a writer married to Mick Jones, the lead
guitarist of the rock group Foreigner, reserved a room at Commune,
a restaurant that opens Wednesday in the Flatiron district.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner in honor of her sister, Rosalyn Dexter, guests dined
on tuna tartare with waffle potato chips and lime ginger dressing,
spit-roasted leg of lamb with Parmesan pudding and raspberry lime
cake, for $75 a person, including wine.
</P>
<P>
   The room was spare, with one gigantic piece of modern art
hanging behind the long rectangular table and lighting by
hand-carved Turkish candles. The 20 guests included Jones'
daughters Samantha and Charlotte Ronson, and the musician Duncan
Sheik, all shouting in conversation across the table and taking
pictures with a Leica digital camera. On the sound system, Jones
put on a new song, a compilation by her daughter and Sheik.
</P>
<P>
   For the Joneses, it was like entertaining at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Dexter-Jones said, ``isn't it nice now and again not to
have to wash up?'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining in a private room in a restaurant has its own rules
of etiquette. Here are a few: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dos for the host: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get to the restaurant before the guests. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greet the guests as if you were in your home, so they feel at
ease. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take place cards. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ask the restaurant to print a menu. Include a vegetarian
option. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take care of the bill in advance (a 20 percent tip is generally
included). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Send written invitations if you have time; otherwise just call. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don'ts for the guests: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't order a drink till asked. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't order special food. (If you don't eat meat, ask the host
if there is an alternative; if not, don't fuss.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't bark orders at the waiters. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't take your cellular phone. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't cancel _ the host still has to pay. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't move the place cards. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't take hostess gifts to the restaurant, but also don't
forget to send a thank-you note the next day, and maybe some
flowers. &QL;
</P>

   NEW YORK _ Maybe it will never rain again. That is probably the
only thing that could console the regular customers at what is
thought to be the city's last umbrella store, Uncle Sam Umbrellas
and Canes, which is to close next Tuesday after 134 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, its owner and employees say, the store has
counted presidents, performers and writers among its clientele.
Sarah Delano Roosevelt haggled over the price of canes for her son,
Franklin. Charlie Chaplin bought whangees, flexible bamboo canes.
John Steinbeck liked to stop in mornings to chat. These days,
Harrison Ford is a regular.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of walkers, Uncle Sam is for those who prefer to
strut, whether holding a $350 Brigg umbrella with a cigarette
lighter concealed in its polished Malacca handle, a bright red
umbrella built for two, or a pointy-topped pagoda. But when the
building that houses the shop, across from Carnegie Hall on West
57th Street, changed hands, the owner, Sandra Schwartz, decided the
business begun by her great-grandfather could not sustain a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't seem to care about umbrellas anymore,'' Schwartz
said. ``It's been a very dry year.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then the gray sky, feinting rain, drove a small horde of
customers into the shop. As they bought, they expressed dismay to
learn that the store would soon close for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been buying umbrellas here for 30 years,'' said John
Wilson, a coated, hatted, wingtipped Upper East Sider. ``I went to
Bloomingdale's. You can't even buy an umbrella there. Except the
folding kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gaumond, who has worked at Uncle Sam for 14 years, showed
Wilson a sturdy, shallow model. ``Sixteen ribs, that's the most
ribs an umbrella can have.'' Wilson investigated the GustBuster,
vented to prevent the wind from turning it inside out. In the end,
Wilson chose a cheaper model that opened with near-lethal force at
the touch of a button. But first he wanted to know if its ribs
could be repaired. ``It's a little too late now,'' Gaumond replied.
``We're closing next week.'' Wilson bought two.
</P>
<P>
   In a back room, another employee, Gilbert Center, makes and
repairs umbrellas. Center, 76, learned his trade in his father's
umbrella shop on the Lower East Side. When umbrellas began to be
mass-produced, the craft began to die out. ``The problem is,''
Center said, ``everything is made in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam was started in 1866 by a German immigrant, Adolph
Simon. He named the store for his son and Schwartz's grandfather,
Sam, who passed the store to his son, Norman. When the market for
quality umbrellas faltered, Uncle Sam stayed in business by making
props for magicians and Broadway shows. Center said he had made
umbrellas that were intended to turn inside out and one that shot
out of a gun. He made several parasols for the current run of ``The
Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the inventory might not last until the last day. Amy
Hall, an editor for Vanity Fair, bought a silver umbrella for a
photo shoot with the hotelier Ian Schrager. After a quick browse,
she found something for herself too. It was a giraffe print with an
octagonal Lucite handle, one of Schwartz's creations from the '60s,
when she had her own line, Sandi for Uncle Sam, that was sold at
Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Duque came in to replace a folding model she had lost. A
frequent misplacer of umbrellas, she wondered what she would do the
next time. ``I always say to myself, `I hope Uncle Sam's is still
there,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Center speculated that Uncle Sam was the last umbrella store to
survive in New York. The peculiar nature of the business, he said,
is that modern solutions won't save the store. People don't think
to buy umbrellas until they get wet. ``You don't have a walking
city, you don't have an umbrella shop,'' Center said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it on the Internet, you say, `I'm inside, I don't need
it,''' said Henry Schwartz, Schwartz's husband. ``Malls don't work,
because it's indoors. You're the last blacksmith. There's no
question about it.''

   NEW YORK _ ``What's that?'' Sidney A. Neff Jr. exclaimed, with
the tone of concern that a mother might express when she has just
noticed a blemish on her baby's face. Neff was peering inside
Volume III of his five-volume-and-counting ``Angling in Hibernia,''
an elaborately crafted homage to Irish trout, as the work was being
prepared for display at the American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   A mote not quite the size of a fleck of finely ground pepper sat
on the white paper beneath 158 trout flies that seemingly floated
in a kind of shadowbox built into the back of the goatskin-wrapped
book. With a deft touch of a pinky nail, Neff _ a detail man's
detail man _ removed the contaminant.
</P>
<P>
   Neff, 61, who calls himself a piscatorial bibliophile, has taken
his personal library of rare books on fishing and, using the book
binder's art he took up 14 years ago, transformed them into desktop
fishing expeditions. By picking up one of Neff's works, the
``reader'' opens a series of doors to explore an elegantly tooled
world of trout, insects and iris-lined riverbanks, all wrought in
dyed African leathers, Japanese paper and gold.
</P>
<P>
   While he calls himself a piscatorial bibliophile, essentially a
lover of books about fishing, that fancy self-description hardly
hints at the depth of his devotion to the angling tradition and
books, or at the results of those wedded passions.
</P>
<P>
   Five dozen works from his collection, which he has vowed never
to sell or split up, are displayed in an exhibition that opened at
the natural history museum on Saturday (the first day of the
trout-fishing season in New York state) and runs until June 25. The
show then moves to the American Museum of Fly Fishing in
Manchester, Vt., and in the fall to the New York State Museum in
Albany. Some of the books are conventional volumes on fishing that
have been given new exteriors and encased in elaborate handmade
boxes; others are hardly books at all. Instead they are miniature
autobiographical museums that display mementos and photographs
accumulated by Neff in four decades of casting flies in rivers from
Ireland to the Catskills to the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Bookbinding and fly fishing are arts that require fastidiousness
and untold patience, so it is not surprising that someone like Neff
exists. Even so, he tends to astonish even the most accomplished
experts in both fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about fly fishing that breeds obsessives,
but Sid's done things that no one else has done before,'' said Nick
Lyons, the owner of the Lyons Press, a publishing house in
Manhattan that specializes in books on angling. ``There is nobody
who has ever done individual bindings that remotely approach his.
No one has the patience or the devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, Lyons added, there is the extraordinary fact that
these works _ other than an occasional museum show _ exist only to
please their creator. Years ago Lyons persuaded Neff to create a
limited edition of a dozen of so books so he could sell them to
collectors. ``The discussion went on for awhile but eventually
broke down,'' he said. ``He wouldn't even think of doing such a
thing now.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harvey, the vice president for exhibitions of the museum,
which has large collections of fishing artifacts and books, said he
was displaying Neff's work for various reasons, not all related to
natural history.
</P>
<P>
   Neff, he said, through a peculiar confluence of skills and
singlemindedness, has joined a small but distinctive class of
artists who, in isolation, have created works that resonate with a
broader audience. Among them he cites Joseph Cornell, who spent
years in a basement workshop making shadowboxes containing cutouts
of birds, metal rings and other objects _ works that now grace the
collections of most major museums of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Neff began fly-fishing and tying flies at the age of 15 and
bought his first 19th-century fishing book at 20. In middle age,
mainly to preserve some of the more tattered volumes in his
expanding library, he began learning how to restore, and then
altogether reconceive, books.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to bookbinding in the latter stages of a 25-year
career as a graphic designer and, with a hand and eye seasoned by
years of precision work, evolved a binding style all his own.
``He's created his own niche and vocabulary,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   In many works, he adds raised sections of leather to the outside
of the book or its box to depict objects ranging from fishing reels
to a fish itself, shaped in basswood and covered in a colorful
collage of goatskin to produce the appropriate pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The technique was originally refined by the French, Neff said.
``But,'' he added, ``I've made it into a masochistic experience.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is not on one of the several dozen fishing trips he
takes each year, Neff can be found in the studio of his century-old
house in Sewickley, Pa., where he lives with his wife, Sue, a
retired art teacher and a practitioner of origami.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His time-worn tools include a sliver of cow bone used to turn in
the edges of finely shaved goatskin as well as handmade brass
implements that are heated, touched to wet cotton to test the
temperature _ ``there is a certain sizzle that is just right,'' he
said _ then pressed into the leather to create a groove that can be
left unadorned or filled with gold or a gossamer strip of dyed
leather.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the content of the books as much as the quality of the
construction that catches the eye. Robert H. Boyle, a sports
writer, angler and book collector from the Hudson River Valley,
said that Neff had been able to inform every detail with hidden
meaning. ``There are some binders who never even bother to read the
book they're binding,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   For the box containing ``Catskill Rivers: Birthplace of American
Fly Fishing,'' by Austin M. Francis, Neff created a swirling
yin-yang image of a brook trout and brown trout.
</P>
<P>
   The design works well enough as a beautiful image of two species
found in the streams of the region, but the meaning goes deeper.
The brook trout, diving downward, is meant to depict the decline of
that species when loggers cleared the Catskills in the 19th
century, raising stream temperatures. The brown trout, leaping
upward, symbolizes how that species, imported from Europe, came to
thrive in the warmer waters.
</P>
<P>
   In many works, Neff has taken a volume with great personal
significance and surrounded it with references to his own related
experience.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most elaborate examples is the ``environment'' he
created in 1992 for a bibliography of works by and about the
English angler Izaak Walton, who wrote ``The Compleat Angler'' in
the 17th century and was one of the progenitors of piscatorial
literature. Neff's book can be reached only by opening a set of two
boxes, he said, so that the experience will be somewhat akin to
time travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus begins the trip,'' he said, as he gently opened the
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The outer box is decorated with a raised green leather cypher
melding Walton's initials with those of Charles Cotton, his friend
and fellow chronicler of the angling art. The cypher recalls the
initials above the doorway to the Fishing House on the River Dove,
a retreat built in 1674 in Dovedale by Cotton and used by Walton as
a base for fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   An inner box covered with a glowing green and powder-blue
landscape shows the house in the background, wrapped by the
legendary river. In the foreground, perched on a waterlily, are
some of the insects prized by the local trout.
</P>
<P>
   Within are the bibliography itself and a folder containing
photographs from a clandestine visit that Neff made in 1968 to the
angling shrine, which is on private land. ``I had to climb a wall
to get there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A panel decorating the bibliography portrays a 17th-century
angler on the riverbank, while another portrays Neff himself in the
same pose in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted the work to celebrate how the river had
retained its beauty over the centuries. The only hints of the 20th
century are his sunglasses and his Land Rover, discreetly tucked
into the background and _ like everything else in the image _
outlined in gold.
</P>
<P>
   Once he finished setting up and celebrating the opening of the
show, Neff said, he was eager for just two things: to go fishing,
and to return to his workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got at least 10 years of books to bind,'' he said.

 &HT;    Try these tips to battle birds, stop mildew or find drapes
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The toughest reader questions for me to answer
are the ones that ask basically, ``Is product A better than
products B, C and D?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the experts are usually the manufacturers and
sellers of products A, B, C and D, and the manufacturers naturally
are biased in favor of their own products.
</P>
<P>
   I currently am trying to find reliable, unbiased opinions on
fiberglass doors, catalytic alloy water softeners and some others,
but it's slow going. If you've asked me a question and haven't
gotten a final answer, that doesn't mean I'm not still on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few questions I was able to answer:
</P>
<P>
   HITCHCOCK WAS RIGHT ABOUT `THE BIRDS'
</P>
<P>
   K.B. sent an e-mail asking how he could get rid of the birds
that try to nest under his patio eaves. It's nice to have nature
close by, but having birds trying to protect the area where you'd
like to relax outside your home is a bit too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions: Holly Coovert, living-museum coordinator at the
Boonshoft Museum of Discovery, said most people don't want to
disturb a nest once the birds have laid eggs. So if you've got
birds trying to move in, you need to react quickly to keep the nest
from being fully established. If the place where the birds are
nesting is easily accessible, reach up and pull out the nesting
materials and throw them away. You'll probably have to do this
several times before the birds get the hint and move on.
</P>
<P>
   On less accessible places _ places you have to set up a ladder
to reach, for instance _ you can make one trip to the site and
place a product call Tanglefoot in the area where the birds perch.
Tanglefoot is available at home and garden stores, and it makes a
place uncomfortable for birds to land. For birds nesting under
eaves or other openings, close the hole. You can tack up netting
over the opening to keep the birds from getting in.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes artificial owls help. These decoys sold at lawn and
garden centers have big eyes, reflective surfaces and parts that
move in the breeze. They scare birds, but sometimes the birds
eventually figure out the decoys are not real, and they come back.
Loud noises also can frighten away birds. But again, sometimes
birds figure out that a loud noise is not really a threat. Also in
a city or suburban setting, loud noises might upset your neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK SPOTS MAR EXTERIOR PAINT
</P>
<P>
   P.D. said her house has been painted several times in the past
seven years, and each time a pattern of tiny black spots develops
on the white walls, ruining the look of the paint job after a
couple of years. She wants to know how to keep the walls white
without the expense of repainting so often.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: The problem appears to be mildew, a fungus that
grows on surfaces, including exterior paint. Mildew and mold are
common problems that can be persistent. According to my experience,
it's possible to get rid of mildew and slow down its recurrence,
but if the conditions are right it eventually returns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem-solving Web site for Benjamin Moore Paints
(www.benjaminmoore.com) says mildew discoloration is prevalent in
warm, moist exposures and can occur in most climates. Keeping the
siding dry may help, as does exposing it to regular sunlight, so
keep the nearby hedges and tree branches trimmed. Mold and mildew
spores are microscopic particles transported by the wind, and, once
the spores land on your wall, they can remain dormant until
conditions are favorable for them to grow. Mildew usually looks
similar to dirt accumulation. However, on some surfaces, as in
P.D.'s case, it might appear as dark spots or be concentrated in
clusters. To tell if it's mildew and not just dirt, drop a small
amount of bleach on the discolored surface. If mildew is present,
bleach will destroy it and lighten the spots. If discoloration is
dirt, bleach will have no effect.
</P>
<P>
   If your wall is mildewed, you must get rid of the mildew before
repainting. If you simply paint over the mildew, it will grow
through paint films rapidly, which may be P.D.'s problem. Benjamin
Moore says the only way to deal with mildew that has grown through
a coat of paint is to strip off the paint to attack the mildew
underneath. Wash all mildew-stained surfaces with a solution of 1
or 2 cups of household bleach per gallon of warm water shortly
before painting, or you can use commercial mildew-removing
chemicals. You might need to clean the wall a few times to
completely remove the discoloration. As soon as the surface is dry,
repaint the wall with mildew-resistant paint. Benjamin Moore says
multiple coats of quality paints resist mildew growth longer than
single coats. You can start with a coat of primer designed to
discourage mildew, then finish with one or more coats of paint.
Latex paints resist mildew better than oil paints in most cases. In
the years after you've painted, inspect the wall regularly and wash
it with a cleaning solution containing bleach.
</P>
<P>
   IN SEARCH OF OLD-STYLE DRAPERIES
</P>
<P>
   G.B. said a Beavercreek company installed draperies in his home
20 years ago, and he's ready to have them replaced. He'd like to
get the exact same type of drapes he bought 20 years ago, but he
couldn't get in touch with the company he worked with originally.
He wants Beauty Pleat or Springcrest draperies, a type of drape
that has pleats formed by a spring running through the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: The company that G.B. used 20 years ago is no longer
active, but the drapes he wanted are still available, and he's
ordering a new set from a Cincinnati company. Donna Jackson of
Donna's Drapery Workroom, a Beavercreek drapery shop, said her
company occasionally installs spring-pleated draperies. She said
the draperies come in wide panels of fabric that are folded into an
accordion pattern but not pressed. A metal spring with a wavy
pattern is inserted into the top of the drape, and the folds in the
fabric help the drape follow the pleat pattern in the spring.
Traditional pleated draperies have gathers at the top that help
pull the fabric into a pleated pattern.

 &HT;    A PARADE OF PROTESTERS WILL FILL THE CAPITAL'S SPRING WEEKENDS
 &HT;    780&AMP;add. With MARCHES-LIST. For release Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a seasonal rite as predictable as cherry
blossoms and class trips, the nation's capital is preparing for a
spring parade of parades.
</P>
<P>
   Within the coming month, the District will be besieged by labor
unionists demanding global economic justice, gay and lesbian
activists demonstrating for equal rights, environmentalists
rallying against global warming. and moms marching for gun control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities ranging from Leonardo DiCaprio to Ellen DeGeneres to
Rosie O'Donnell will lead assemblies totaling hundreds of thousands
of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations will begin on April 16 and 17 with the
``Mobilization for Global Justice,'' whose organizers have
threatened to shut down international meetings of the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although organizers say their blockade will be peaceful, police
are bracing for trouble, since the movement includes many of the
groups involved in last year's melee at the World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow another breakdown like that in Seattle,''
vowed D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   The following weekend, legions of environmentalists are expected
to celebrate the 30th annual Earth Day on the Mall with a giant
science fair and a stage show hosted by DiCaprio and featuring
Carole King, Clint Black, David Crosby, Keb' Mo', James Taylor and
other entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, the ``Millennium March on Washington for Equality''
will promote civil rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgender Americans. Although there has been bickering between
some leaders of the movement, tens of thousands of activists are
expected for the Sunday demonstration and for a Saturday night
concert featuring Melissa Etheridge, George Michael, Garth Brooks,
k.d. lang and other singers.
</P>
<P>
   The month of marches will conclude on May 14 _ Mother's Day _
with the ``Million Mom March'' demanding ``common-sense'' laws for
gun control. TV talk show host O'Donnell said she and other mothers
from across the nation will be coming to Washington ``for the
future safety of all children.''
</P>
<P>
   These crusades are clustered on the calendar, but are hardly
unexpected, said Earl Kittleman, a spokesman for the National Park
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly used to dealing with large-scale
demonstrations,'' Kittleman said. Marches, demonstrations and
vigils have been commonplace ever since the federal government
moved to the District of Columbia in 1800, he explained. Each year,
the Park Service issues permits for about 3,000 ``public
gatherings'' on federal property in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location is a traditional public forum for free speech,''
Kittleman said. And in the television age, familiar public
buildings such as the White House, Capitol, Washington Monument and
Lincoln Memorial provide ``ideal backdrops'' for mass rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Weather has a significant impact on turnout and media coverage
of mass demonstrations, Kittleman noted, so spring is popular with
protesters as well as with tourists and school groups.
</P>
<P>
   Washington rallies are organized to appeal both to a group's
members and to the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   Staging these events ``is a very good means of keeping (members)
involved'' in a cause, said Lee Sigelman, chairman of the political
science department at George Washington University. ``It gives them
a chance to strut their stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``there's an arms race aspect to the demonstrations,''
said Sigelman, an expert in political behavior and popular culture.
Competing causes _ anti-abortion vs. abortion rights, for example _
don't want the other side to seem to be more popular, so both hold
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators come to Washington because they want to
influence Congress, the president and the federal regulatory
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to show those in power that a group or cause has
substantial support outside the Beltway,'' Sigelman explained.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a Washington campaign is high in terms of effort but
relatively low in dollars, especially when compared to a national
television campaign. The demonstrations are traditionally held on
weekends, a good time for bringing in supporters and for attracting
media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the demonstrations help shape national policy, such as
the 1960s marches against the Vietnam War and for civil rights laws
protecting racial minorities. Even when no governmental action
results, the demonstrations almost always focus national attention
at least momentarily on a cause, as in the Million Man March and
Promise Keepers rallies in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Size counts in mass rallies, of course, so crowd estimates are
often controversial.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, the National Park Service stopped
issuing such calculations after complaints by organizers.
</P>
<P>
   These counts ``were never more than estimates'' and ``were
almost always challenged,'' explained Kittleman. The agency doesn't
have the sophisticated cameras and other equipment needed to
provide accurate crowd counts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service permits are required for organized gatherings of
more than two dozen people on federal property in the District, but
organizers are not required to post bonds or otherwise financially
insure against damages. Courts have ruled that such requirements
are hindrances to free speech, Kittleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only reason a permit would be denied is if another
group had applied earlier for same site at same time,'' he said.
Since applications cannot be made more than a year in advance, some
groups apply for next year's demonstration immediately after
holding one year's event.

U.N. OFFICIAL VISITING CHECHNYA REPORTS EVIDENCE OF ATROCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Despite an unusually restricted tour of the ruined
Chechen capital of Grozny on Monday, the U.N. high commissioner on
human rights, Mary Robinson, said Tuesday that she had heard and
seen ``shocking'' evidence of extensive human rights atrocities by
Russian military forces in Chechnya. But she also reported a
``constructive'' ending to her trip, saying she had received a
pledge from Russian leaders to consider setting up an independent
national inquiry to investigate the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``there must be a day of reckoning regarding the
situation in Chechnya,'' Robinson indicated that Moscow was not
likely to end its isolation in the international community over its
brutal campaign to subdue the Northern Caucuses without purging its
own ranks of those troops and commanders found to be guilty of
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference here after touring the parts of
Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan affected by the war, Robinson
said, ``I found it devastating to see Grozny, and I was very
affected by the depth of misery and distress'' there.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazran, the refugee center in Ingushetia, Robinson said she
met eye-witnesses who relayed ``truly shocking accounts'' of
summary executions, rape, looting and other attacks on civilians
during the seven-month military campaign by Russian forces. She was
told of the bodies of war victims being ransomed to families and
extortion against civilians passing through checkpoints. ``I
believe Russia and Russians have to take ownership of the
responsibility for addressing the scale of human rights
violations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But during her tour, Robinson, the former Irish president, was
not able to visit a number of neighborhoods and villages in
Chechnya where alleged atrocities occurred. She was accompanied by
Vladimir Kalamanov, the human rights envoy to Chechnya appointed by
President-elect Vladimir Putin. On Monday, Kalamanov seemed to
clash with Robinson over issues of her itinerary. Robinson said on
Tuesday that she had ``requested to visit a number of different
detention centers'' where hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Chechens
have been held without charge. But she was only allowed to visit
one facility where two Chechen women were being held on looting
charges.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said her visit had ended on a ``very constructive''
note. In a meeting Tuesday morning with Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, she said she had urged the Russian leadership to consider
``the importance of establishing an independent, national
commission of inquiry as a special measure that recognizes the
scale of human rights violations in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, she said, indicated that Moscow was interested in the
proposal, pledged to examine it further and also agreed to accept
further information from the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
regarding ``models'' that could be used for such an investigative
body. Ivanov formally invited Robinson to return to Russia in two
or three months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russia also signed an agreement Tuesday accepting the services
of human rights experts from the Council of Europe. The experts
will be assigned to Kalamonov's staff of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia facing further condemnation both in the Council of
Europe and the U.N. Human Rights Commission, which is meeting this
month in Geneva, incremental steps like those Moscow took Tuesday
may be somewhat diversionary. Since the beginning of its Chechen
campaign, Russia has rejected interventions from human rights
organizations as unwarranted interference in its ``anti-terrorist''
action. In a foreign ministry statement, Ivanov again rejected
outside interference, and he denied there had been ``systematic
human rights violations by federal forces.'' But he also said
Russia was ready to ``resolve the Chechen problem openly, in
cooperation with the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that atrocities had been committed on both sides
of the Chechen conflict, Robinson said she hoped that rebel leaders
guilty of atrocities could be brought to justice, but emphasized
that her primary mission was to investigate the Russian
government's compliance with international human rights conventions
and laws.
</P>
<P>
   It was also conspicuous that Robinson did not meet with Putin,
though she denied that any meeting had been set and canceled.
Rather, she said her return to Moscow on Monday was delayed by fog,
leaving no opportunity for a meeting with the Russian president.
Tuesday, Putin, wearing a black arm band, attended a memorial
service in Moscow for three officers of the Federal Security
Service killed in last week's ambush in Chechnya that left 43
policemen and paramilitary servicemen dead.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson she said she hoped to see Putin when she returns.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking in Geneva, backed
Robinson's call for an independent national inquiry in Russia. ``I
think she was right,'' Annan said, ``I think it is even in the
interest of the Russian government to carry out an inquiry into
these kinds of serious allegations.'' (js)

`BLACK AND WHITE': TALK THE TALK, THEN STEAL THE LIFE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Jim,'' his 1971 standing-in-the-shadow-of-negritude
biography of the football great Jim Brown, the white
writer-director James Toback wrote, ``If there were a black boy
anywhere in America whose vision of boyhood excluded both sports
and entertainment, he was a freak, a mutation of consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   In his newest film, ``Black and White,'' Toback expands his
observation to include the white kids of privilege who have
swallowed hip-hop culture whole and wear its approximations with
pride. They're the ones who don't make you cross the street in
trepidation when you see them flood the boulevard in loose-fitting
jeans, chanting all of the malevolence out of some Big Pun song.
This is a stimulating movie that's full of ideas _ it's bursting
with them _ and that grafts Dostoyevskian obsession to the
distancing journalistic clarity of rap.
</P>
<P>
   The movies haven't explicitly confronted the white worship of
black culture in some time. Toback hits it with a chain saw, and
chunks go flying noisily. He dashes through more melodrama and
moral crises than you'd see in an entire season of ``E.R.'' He dips
in and out of story lines like samples on a 12-inch single.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the group of white kids trying to roll black, who are
being followed by a documentary filmmaker, Sam (Brooke Shields, in
dreadlocks), and her husband, Terry (Robert Downey Jr.), who, in a
film filled with striking characters, serves as Toback's muse.
Their travels intersect with those of Rich Bower (Power), a brother
trying to step away from the hard-knock life, moving from his role
as shot caller on the streets to the recording studio as a producer
(Power's real-life role with the Wu Tang Clan).
</P>
<P>
   As the film quotes the hip-hop diva L'il Kim, ``Can you be
ghetto without living in the ghetto?'' The wild young white things
in ``Black and White'' are out to bounce ghetto fabulous. ``They
think they're gonna get some life force,'' Rich observes of the
white kids circling him. ``I'm trying to get a little bit of
information'' from them.
</P>
<P>
   Key among them is Will (William Lee Scott), described as ``some
white boy trying to be'' black by the African-American college
basketball star Dean (Allan Houston of the Knicks in his stab at an
acting debut). Will goes further, and sinks deeper, than any of the
other white hip-hoppers manques in trying to embrace the thug life.
He wants to be like Mike: Tyson (who appears in the film as
himself), not Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's all good for Rich and Dean, his boyhood friend,
until Dean is entrapped in a point-fixing scheme by Mark (Ben
Stiller), a nervous cop, and told he can shake free only by setting
Rich up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' sends out some messages with semaphores.
Every scene featuring an upright white family seems to be set in
stately Wayne Manor, where classical music plays to anesthetize the
inhabitants. Charlie (Bijou Philips), the poor little rich blond
girl, fires up a blunt in her bedroom, an oasis of muted Laura
Ashley. Despite the speed bumps of exposition, the movie is a
hard-driven, fascinating affair. Toback's ear for music generates a
buzz, from doo-wop to the muscular discourse of the spinmasters the
X-ecutioners (formerly the X-Men) and of course Wu Tang Clan member
Raekwon, who plays Rich's right hand, Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Some cast members, like Houston, seem to be feeling their way in
the dark. Though he has enormous waves of physical confidence _ he
walks into every room as if he owned it _ he's at a loss at keeping
up with the true actors who have total belief in their ability to
sell a line. (And it doesn't help that he looks a little old for a
college player.) In the case of poor Claudia Schiffer, the German
supermodel, who plays Dean's lover, the movie stops to applaud her
efforts to wrestle English to the floor and pin it, as she plays a
student of anthropology. She seems to have been matched with
Houston for their consonant lack of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the actors, like Phillips, with her head fixed on a
homegirl swivel, are a source of continual surprise. The natural
authority of Power puts him front and center. He has the sheer
effrontery of a movie star. Toback is attracted to danger and to
performers who like to slam the sound meter straight into the red.
Fortunately for him, he has the services of that most audacious of
actors, Downey, who seems to be out to startle himself as well as
the others in the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Downey has two scenes that will rank among the best in movies
this year. In one, he cruises an extremely resistant young man on
the Staten Island Ferry. ``I'm going to see my girlfriend,'' the
young man snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Downey trills: ``Oh? What's his name?'' with the sweet optimism
of the tortoise running the hare. In the other scene he floats
around Tyson like a lavender-scented cloud, trying to wheedle an
assignation that creates tension because of Downey's wide-eyed
appetite; he's the deer who longs to be caught in the headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a delight, too. Here he's the Yoda of the underworld,
trying to counsel Rich while remaining a cubic centimeter away from
invoking his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. He
has the restless intensity of the autodidact, using words as if he
were showing off expensive baubles with the price tags still
dangling. ``This is what I'm deciphering from your vernacular,'' he
says in his high, soft voice.
</P>
<P>
   By the end the movie departs from the hip-hop world and settles
into drama right out of the Yiddish theater: a son's need to make a
connection with his dad. Joe Pantoliano steps in the senior role.
He plays a rigid prosecutor who's drawn into Will's problems. The
reprobate cop Mark turns to him as well, seeking official
approbation and a father figure. The story turns into one about the
curative power of family, be it the Wu Tang Clan on Staten Island,
its Fortress of Solitude, or literal family, a recurrent theme in
Toback's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' often operates as a paroxysm of excitement,
crackling with the pixilation of pop. It's another of Toback's
quick-talking autobiographies that, like the best pop, have a clock
running on their expiration dates. Better catch it before it goes
stale. Most important, despite being about youth, the movie has an
adult take on constantly shifting loyalties and envy. Tyson's
character sums it up best: ``It's the age-old story. Deceit and
treachery.''
</P>

 &HT;    Landscape-designing couple agrees, `our gardens are our
children'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, April 6.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Hugh and Mary Palmer Dargan step into their back yard, they
see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   He pauses to scan it, smiling at how nicely the design flows
from den to pergola to garden, just as they planned it.
</P>
<P>
   She, on the other hand, zooms in for a closer look, ecstatic
that the delicate creeping Mazus she planted between pathway stones
is blooming.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh is big picture; Mary Palmer is details.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the husband-and-wife team of Atlanta landscape
architects are married to the land, consumed by plants and head
over heels in love with design. The Dargans, considered among the
country's leading historic landscape preservationists, have created
or restored hundreds of gardens from Florida to California in their
15-year partnership and Hugh's 12 years before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our gardens are our children,'' says Hugh, a South Carolina
native. ``It's sad when their homes are sold, and you lose contact
on how they develop. It's like they grow up and move away.''
</P>
<P>
   Their passion for landscape architecture touches every aspect of
their lives. They met at a garden lecture, were married in a
garden, honeymooned while studying gardens _ and saw their
livelihoods nearly wither in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Dargans were working in Charleston in 1989 when Hurricane
Hugo destroyed many of the city's historic gardens. ``We had no
work in South Carolina for four months,'' Hugh recalls. ``It was an
emotional disaster for me, not to mention our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of their ``children'' drowned in the tidal surge, were
burned by the salt water or left inundated by harbor mud. But many
of the gardens rebounded, and the demand for work followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dargans' designs span the spectrum of garden styles, from
casual English country to formal Italianate. But they are best
known for their preservation efforts, especially during the years
they spent in Charleston before moving to Atlanta in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a candy shop of design,'' Mary Palmer (who prefers that
double Southern name) says of the city with its quaint walled
gardens. ``Every piece of stone was laid more than 200 years ago
for a specific purpose, and each has mellowed with age. The place
left an indelible impression on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, they became lecturers, because teaching is as
much a part of the Dargans' work as design. They believe part of
their mission is to educate clients about how buildings and
landscapes interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just giving them good gardens but also an
appreciation for them,'' says Graham Pittman, a landscape architect
in their firm. ``That's where they excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Their projects and presentations have fueled celebrity images
along the Southeastern gardening circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do Charlotte,'' Hugh says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do Nashville,'' Mary Palmer says of her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do the two join forces on one design because, as they put
it, someone has to be in charge. Yet each knows enough about the
other's projects to be able to step in in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   When they do conspire, they insist there are no egos, no
artistic tempers, no disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one exception was Hugh once said we'd never work for
neighbors,'' Mary Palmer recalls. ``But I said, `Hugh, I'm already
doing three.''
</P>
<P>
   One unanimous decision was moving their business, Hugh Dargan
Associates, to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other place like it for gardening,'' Mary Palmer
says. ``It's so deeply rooted here and at the same time, so global
in terms of so many varied interests in gardening. People from
China are coming here to see gardens. It's fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A niche for history
</P>
<P>
   The move was the fourth for Hugh, whose career took him from the
South Carolina town of Darlington to stops in Camden and Columbia,
where Mary Palmer joined the firm in 1985. The couple met at a
meeting of the Southern Garden History Society, an organization
Hugh help found that's dedicated to garden preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking and never stopped,'' he says. ``We realized
we thought so much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Their expertise in preservation drew them to projects in
Charleston, where they decided to marry, becoming a rare duo in
their field. Appropriately, they held the ceremony and reception in
a romantic parterre garden they had just designed on the Battery.
``From that experience, we learned to never design a garden with a
party deadline,'' Hugh recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Between projects, the Dargans taught design, often for
fund-raisers for preservation efforts. Lectures and tours _ they
estimate they've visited some 600 gardens _ are what keep their
ideas fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The Dargans spent part of their honeymoon studying landscape
restoration at the National Trust in Sussex, England. Their niche
soon earned them projects ranging from a master plan for the Earl
of Wemyss in Gloucestershire to a renovation at Brookgreen Gardens
near Murrells Inlet, S.C. Historic Preservation magazine named them
among the top four preservation landscape architects in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Hugo hit, and our whole career was blown away. I spent
four months just holding clients' hands,'' Hugh says of the
aftermath and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The garden where they were married had been under 5 feet of
water. The tidal surge was so strong it bent a 1790s iron gate.
</P>
<P>
   But Charlestonians rebuilt, not only their homes but also their
prized gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone began to ring off the hook,'' Hugh says.
</P>
<P>
   Blooming in Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, architect Norman Askins invited the Dargans to work
on some of his projects.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of clients grew, the couple decided to relocate,
settling in Peachtree Heights with their three cavalier spaniels.
There, they've combined all their favorite ingredients to create
their own garden, a popular stop on tours.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, they opened an office in Buckhead, where the
staff includes seven landscape architects.
</P>
<P>
   Developing plans is only part of their day. Mary Palmer
frequently appears as a guest on HGTV shows. They're publishing a
series of design books based on their teachings. And they're
designing a line of cast-aluminum garden furniture they plan to
sell online.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes us enjoy living and working together 24 hours a day
is simple _ our love for our work,'' Hugh says.
</P>
<P>
   They make all business decisions together _ ``usually at 3 in
the morning,'' Mary Palmer says _ but each approaches work
differently.

   ``I'm the one who fixes the lawn mower,'' his wife says. ``I

rarely turned off.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dargans have learned to escape the deadline demands by
hiking in the mountains of North Carolina, where they've bought a

 &HT;    Troupe of monks perform for peace, harmony and to raise
awareness of Tibetan homeland
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They sing. They dance. They love the Hawks, ESPN, and they play
soccer in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
   But sports, TV and the arts are only a small part of the world
of the Mystic Monks of Tibet _ nine Buddhist lamas in residence at
Emory University. On loan from the famed Drepung Loseling Monastery
in India, the monks are touring the country on an unusual mission:
seeking at once to celebrate Tibet's culture and warn of its
impending disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Their two-hour performance ``The Mystical Arts of Tibet: Sacred
Music Sacred Dance for World Healing'' is at Glenn Memorial Church
tonight as part of Emory's five-day celebration of Tibetan culture.
The Mystical Arts tour has played three dozen cities in the past
six months _ from Carnegie Hall to the Hollywood Bowl _ to rave
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But Geshe Lobsang Tenzin, director of the Drepung Loseling
Institute at Emory, said he hopes the performances do more than
introduce Americans to ancient Tibetan arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasize two things in our performance,'' he said over
morning tea in the institute's sanctuary near Emory. ``Our primary
objective is to contribute to world peace and harmony, and we hope
people who come to see us will be inspired to find kindness in
their hearts and take it to a deeper level. The second thing is
that we hope people who don't know about Tibetan culture and
civilization, and its current situation, will see that Tibet is at
very edge of its extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenzin, who will lead tonight's performance, said the tour will
continue through the end of the year, when eight of the monks will
return to India. From the 3,000 resident monks, eight replacements
will travel to Emory for the next tour. It's a rotation they
undertake with a mixture of joy, resignation and bittersweet
sadness _ traveling by van from town to town, attempting to rise
above the novelty-act coverage they're often given.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan monks first brought a show to North America in 1988 to
keep Tibetan culture alive and the heat of public opinion on China,
which occupied the mountain nation in 1959, sending its leader _
the Dalai Lama _ his government and more than 100,000 Tibetans into
exile in India. The Loseling Institute at Emory, which runs the
Mystical Arts tours, was founded as the North American seat of the
monastery soon after Tenzin arrived here in 1991 to study liberal
arts. Other Tibetan monks are based in California and New York.
Today, Tenzin teaches Tibetan culture and organizes weekly programs
to teach Atlantans about Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   When they're not touring, the monks spend their days studying in
the institute's library, meeting with Atlanta visitors or
meditating in the institute's quiet sanctuary, adorned with
pictures of the Dalai Lama and vibrantly colored ``thankas'' _
tapestries depicting Tibetan virtues and values.
</P>
<P>
   The monks are also a not-uncommon sight around town _ in their
flowing burgundy-and-gold robes and close-cropped hair. ``We like
to play soccer together,'' Tenzin acknowledged with a grin. ``We're
not very good, but we have fun.'' They also take in Hawks games,
movies and shows around town. (Tenzin notes ``The Matrix'' is one
of his favorites: ``It had a very Buddhist theme,'' he says, ``the
mind creating reality.'')
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a nondescript office building on Briarcliff, the
Loseling Institute is a living museum of Tibetan culture nestled
among the tree-lined neighborhoods of northeast Atlanta. Only a
small paper sign hung on the doorway heralds its presence. Once
inside, visitors can examine pictures of the Dalai Lama's former
Tibetan home, hung like sacred art pieces on the walls, read about
the historic struggles of the nation's people, finger Buddhist
prayer beads called ``malas'' or meditate in the shrine, where the
monks chant and lead teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Tenzin, one month shy of his 40th birthday, is patient with
Westerners, explaining in a calm, deliberate voice the plight of
his people and Loseling's goals. ``We came here to develop an
understanding of the Western mind and philosophy,'' said Tenzin,
reflecting on his reasons for choosing Emory. And in the past
decade, the city has come to feel like home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' he said. ``And I have something to do here:
My main purpose is to create a place where people can meditate,
relieve the stresses of everyday life, create love and find some
meaning in life _ all the universal values Tibetans have always
had. The whole spirit of the last 1,300 years has been to cultivate
those values.''

 &HT;    Courage of hip-hop convictions best of `Black and White'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What happens when you mix it up?'' That's the tagline for
``Black and White,'' which answers that question pretty quickly:
You get energy, attitude and a big sloppy mess of a movie. For
better and for worse.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest from writer-director James Toback, a hit-or-miss
auteur. Hit: the screenplay for ``Bugsy.'' Miss: his last movie,
``Two Guys and a Girl,'' which got press mainly for one sex scene.
He plays that same card in the opening minutes of ``Black and
White,'' showing gangsta-turned-rap impresario Rich (Oli ``Power''
Grant) having a stand-up, three-way grope in Central Park with two
teen girls, including poor little rich girl Charlie (Bijou
Phillips). As with ``Two Girls,'' this scene got press because it
had to be trimmed to get an R rating. (Do we see a pattern here?)
</P>
<P>
   It's the look-at-me opening gambit of a movie that's all about
striking a pose, showing off and trying to provoke. The core of the
largely improvised drama is young white teens' fascination with
black hip-hop culture. Charlie and school pal Raven (Gaby Hoffmann)
hang out with Rich and his rap pals and mimic their lingo. Charlie
even wears a clip-on gold tooth, to the horror of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Other homeboy wannabes include their schoolmate Wren (Elijah
Wood) and two sons of the district attorney (Joe Pantoliano). The
kids capture the attention of a dreadlocked documentary filmmaker
(Brooke Shields) and her sexually ambiguous husband (Robert Downey
Jr.), who follow them around for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating subject, and you can see what attracted
Toback and his cast to explore it. But ambition and willingness
don't translate into insight. Some of the rambling, impromptu bits
provide some memorable sights, like Mike Tyson, playing himself,
putting the flirtatious Downey in a headlock, or reacting with
delicate pleasure when Shields calls him ``gorgeous.'' Toback
ultimately tries to generate some plot momentum by devising a
police sting and a revenge killing that seem to belong in a
B-movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' probably won't help Tyson's public image,
since it shows him endorsing this (fictional) gangsta killing. In
his own words, ``A bug needs to be stomped on.'' Unfortunately,
that ``bug'' is one of the movie's few sympathetic characters, a
rising basketball star (Allan Houston) who gets blackmailed by Ben
Stiller, playing a motormouthed creep with a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the characters verge on caricatures, including Charlie's
stuffy family, complete with investment-banker dad and
quail-serving mom (played by in-joke Marla Maples). Most of the
white characters, including the unimpressive Claudia Schiffer as a
man-eating graduate student, are seen as venal, foolish or impotent
compared with the black characters. The movie seems to buy into the
notion that white women want to have sex with Rich and other black
men because they glean some ``life force'' from them. In pretending
to examine vital racial issues, the movie really just reinforces
some stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, ``Black and White'' is defeated by its structural
shapelessness, and a down-with-it attitude that glosses over the
script's lack of any real analysis of hip-hop's cultural influence.
Instead of trying to reach a real conclusion, the movie comes to an
abrupt end, offering a few tacked-on glimpses of its characters
``six months later.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the funny part. No, it's not a very good or intelligent
movie. But it's a topical powderkeg likely to launch arguments and
discussions more complex and sophisticated than ``Black and White''
itself. And that's worth something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bijou Phillips, Oli ``Power'' Grant, Robert Downey Jr.,
Brooke Shields, Allan Houston, Ben Stiller. Rated R for violence,
sexuality and language. One hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An ambitious mess that's all attitude and no
insight.

 &HT;    Details bring out true beauty of small, romantic gardens
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, April 6.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Water spews from the pair of fountains, drowning out the distant
grind of mowers and blowers.
</P>
<P>
   English ivy blankets one wall, softening the brick of the
neighboring townhouse, while tightly clipped boxwoods flanking the
French doors lend a mood of formality.
</P>
<P>
   Even the electric meter and other reminders of everyday life are
hidden to enhance the notion that the small courtyard is in
romantic Tuscany, maybe historic Charleston _ not suburban Sandy
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about details,'' said Brooks Garcia, the Atlanta
garden designer who created the haven. ``You can't fudge on them
when you're dealing with a tight, small space.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because courtyards and small gardens are designed up
close and personal so they can be enjoyed from indoors as well as
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The little retreats have become popular solutions for both
intown and suburban homeowners wanting to lose the maintenance of a
large back yard while gaining a small outdoor space that's
multifunctional. It's got to be large enough for entertaining
friends but intimate enough for escaping the daily grind. A place
to share a meal, relax with a book or marvel over a few favorite
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As children leave home and people travel more and more, they
tend to want tighter spaces with more hardscaping and less
upkeep,'' said Mary Palmer Dargan.
</P>
<P>
   She and husband Hugh, both Atlanta landscape architects, have
designed everything from large country estates to tiny Charleston
courtyards, and all have at least one thing in common _ intimacy.
``Everything we do is small, regardless of the size property,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In dense urban neighborhoods, surrounding structures often lend
the ready-made sense of enclosure necessary for creating the small
garden.
</P>
<P>
   But in sprawling suburban yards, the Dargans solve the dilemma
by divvying up the site into areas with specific functions.
</P>
<P>
   They refer to four major elements: the ``approach'' (the
driveway entry), the ``house'' (the views from rooms), the
``pause'' (small garden spaces tied closely to the house) and the
``destination'' (the view of other areas of the property).
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Gail O'Leary had plenty of reason to pause behind the
Buckhead house they built two years ago: It had only about 8 feet
of yard that dropped some 16 feet into wooded valley.
</P>
<P>
   With about 15 truckloads of earth and a stone retaining wall,
landscape architect Graham Pittman extended the bluff into a
pie-shaped plateau large enough for entertaining large groups. Yet
a breezeway between the house and a rear garage provides a quiet
spot for enjoying conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a French country feel, a kind of Old World look,
so we used irregular crab orchard stone in the terraces,'' Pittman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny pockets between stones were left unmortared for growing
thyme and other creeping plants that give the terrace an aged look.
Individual stones were set in the brick breezeway to blend it with
the terrace.
</P>
<P>
   These details give small gardens a live-in look.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Stuart and Kathleen Kamille. After two previous designs, the
Sandy Springs courtyard Garcia created fits their low-maintenance
townhouse lifestyle. The dining room's French doors open into the
15-by-45-foot walled garden, allowing guests to spill into another
space or simply admire the view from the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become another room in their house,'' Garcia said.

U.N. REPORT BLAMES POVERTY IN PART ON BAD GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 2nd graf to change `era' to `regions'; 4th graf to add `a
Briton') 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After years of treading carefully around the
issue of why so many countries stay poor or get poorer, the United
Nations in a report Tuesday put a lot of the blame on bad
government, a message that many leaders seeking more aid and debt
relief do not want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the U.N. Development Program, the world's
largest aid agency, is a call to rethink traditional ideas about
battling poverty in the Third World. It reflects on a global scale
the debates within many nations, including the United States, about
why poverty persists even in an regions of substantial economic
growth and political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The report elevates ``good governance'' _ the newest catch
phrase in development theory _ to the top priority in fighting
poverty by the development program's new administrator, Mark
Malloch Brown, whose organization supports a range of governance
projects. Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down
economic development and a host of other strategies will not work,
the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown, a Briton who came to the United Nations last year
from the World Bank, has drawn hostility from developing countries,
which accuse him of interfering in the internal affairs of
governments. That criticism has also been leveled at
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for suggesting that nations with human
rights abuses can no longer hide behind their borders, claiming
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is particularly important for me in terms of
skewering a particularly odd United Nations debate which flourishes
in this curious greenhouse at the East River,'' Malloch Brown said
at a news conference Tuesday, ``which is that somehow the UNDP was
getting out of poverty and into governance work. What this report
clearly demonstrates is that governance is a critical building
block for poverty reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Embracing democracy is often not enough, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having regular elections _ free and fair _ contributes to
accountability, especially if they are also held at the local
level,'' the report says. ``But such democratic forms are no
vaccination against poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, development experts now accept that local
governments, which are often neglected or nonexistent in the
developing world, must play a critical role in reducing poverty.
Historically, foreign aid has gone to central governments. When
donors could no longer ignore that aid was being siphoned off
through corruption or misuse of funds, nongovernmental agencies,
not local governments, were given the money or goods.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of development experts now believe that this
shift bred its own problems, as the private agencies invented
projects to get more money or funneled aid to meet their own
priorities, making national efforts disjointed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Big, expensive surveys of poverty are not much good either, the
report says. It recommends frequent and rapid studies to serve as
barometers of the effectiveness of programs and policies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Development Program's report, ``Overcoming Human
Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000,'' is being published as the
General Assembly prepares to review progress since the Social
Summit, the 1995 international conference on social development,
was held in Copenhagen. At that meeting member countries made three
commitments: to estimate the incidence of poverty within their
borders, to set targets for reducing or eliminating poverty and to
introduce anti-poverty plans.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying 140 of the United Nations' 188 members, the report
found that 77 percent of countries had estimated their incidence of
poverty _ including extreme poverty, measured by the inability to
buy enough food for daily needs _ but only 40 percent had
incorporated anti-poverty measures into their national planning and
29 percent had free-standing, dedicated anti-poverty projects.
</P>
<P>
   Countries with the most active and focused measures against
poverty were in the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Asia and
the Pacific regions ranked behind sub-Saharan Africa. The survey
highlights some of the successful projects found around the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report builds on the agency's pioneering annual human
development reports created by the late Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani
expert who shifted criteria for measuring development away from per
capita income figures to aspects of human life that play a role in
social and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Three categories used by the human development surveys _ adult
illiteracy, the proportion of children under 5 who are underweight
and the probability of dying before 40 _ are factored into the new
report. It shows most regions lagging on all three fronts, and
sometimes moving backward, even as democracy spreads.

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ The next important step in the
Microsoft antitrust suit won't take place in the courtroom, but in
two separate meeting rooms. The Justice Department and the 19 state
attorneys general must agree on what penalties to recommend to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, and Microsoft officials
must overcome what some call the take-no-prisoners ``Gates
culture'' to fashion a new settlement proposal more acceptable to
the government. (Glass, Cox News Service). 22.

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The urge to entertain can strike suddenly, without
warning, in unexpected ways. In my case, it was a tarte flambee
that did it.
</P>
<P>
   It was an Alsatian classic, encountered at L'Actuel, wafer-thin
and crunchy, spread with a layer of smooth creme fraiche and
fromage blanc, and topped with thin loops of browned onion and tiny
chunks of smoky bacon. It reminded me of a similar tart that my
wife, Nancy, had made on a whim one weekend years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we should make that again,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better yet,'' she said, ``we could do a whole Alsatian meal
and have people over.''
</P>
<P>
   The dinner-party instinct is irrational. More often than not,
entertaining involves blood, sweat and tears. It can be a one-way
ticket to recrimination and regret. For the guests, of course, it's
a sweet deal. They bring a bottle of wine or a bouquet and,
presto!, they're inside the velvet rope, ready for a stress-free
evening of food and wine. For the hosts, the point can seem more
obscure, especially an hour before the guests arrive, and more
especially an hour after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   But still the urge strikes, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   This time it struck hard. After nearly a year of eating out day
and night, I was dying to make food instead of ordering it from a
menu. I wanted to eat in my own home, with a few friends, liberated
from the rituals of a restaurant. I wanted an excuse to splurge on
wine. I wanted to show off a little. In short, I wanted to
entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Easy to say, not so easy to do. Especially for me. When I throw
a dinner party, I set the bar high. I don't simply want to please
my guests, I want to dazzle them. I want to explore new culinary
territory, to learn something from the dinner. If truth be told, I
also want admiration and applause. Add it all up, and the result is
a high-pressure occasion, ratcheted up several notches these days
because of my job. If guests leave the table unhappy, it's not just
embarrassing. It's a professional disaster.
</P>
<P>
   I have five principles of entertaining. First, the food must be
superior. No one can lay on a meal to equal the work of a
professional chef supported by a kitchen staff, of course, and some
of my worst dinners have been the ones when I tried to do just
that. (I dimly recall an Indian feast so elaborate that the guests
became sodden with drink by the time we managed to get the chapatis
on the table.) But I despise the notion that, if the company is
agreeable, guests will be happy with roast chicken, a glass of
pinot grigio and a scoop of ice cream surrounded by Pepperidge Farm
Milanos. I become seriously depressed when it turns out that the
host cannot cook.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I like the evening to have a theme or organizing
principle. It should educate guest and host alike, in a subtle way.
Alsace, one of the few parts of France I've never visited, offered
the opportunity to study up a bit, try some different dishes and
ingredients, and explore great, underappreciated wines.
</P>
<P>
   Third, I believe that good dinner parties entail risk. It's
boring to serve old standbys, no matter how delicious. Fail-safe
food does not energize an evening. To bring out the unexpected, and
pull it off with flair _ that's the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Principle No. 4: a successful evening begins at the beginning
and ends at the end. In other words, you don't welcome guests by
waving them vaguely toward the liquor cabinet when they hold their
hands out for a drink. (I once scored a hit by serving a tray of
Bamboo cocktails, an American classic of the 1890s.) And you don't
let the meal trail off weakly with coffee. Serve those chocolates
and liqueurs. Extract the last possible ooh and aah.
</P>
<P>
   My fifth principle amounts to life insurance. Buy excellent
wines. They disarm criticism of the food. Serve a good Champagne at
the beginning of the evening, and the battle is half won.
</P>
<P>
   Our Alsatian evening began, as all dinner parties do, with that
enchanted couple of days when anything seems possible. Like
travelers fantasizing about a trip, or scholars drawing up a
reading list for a long-term project, we floated in a dreamlike
state, surrounded by cookbooks. I was tempted by the foie gras au
torchon in Thomas Keller's ``French Laundry Cookbook.'' It involves
the de-veining, membrane-stripping, marinating and squeezing of a
duck liver in cheesecloth until it becomes a compact,
heart-stopping mass of fat and flavor, served cold with pickled
cherries. What a coup it would be to set that on the table. Too
fussy and complex, I decided. It sounded more like microsurgery
than cooking.
</P>
<P>
   We both leaned heavily toward a dish from Le Crocodile in
Strasbourg: lamb fillets wrapped in leaves of Swiss chard spread
with chicken mousseline. But history, a stern teacher, has shown
that one sure-fire way to botch a dinner is to crowd the menu with
too many dishes that have to be finished at the last minute. Guests
do not want to spend the evening watching the hosts run back and
forth to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, our menu looked like this: tarte flambee followed by
warm rabbit salad with truffle vinaigrette, and, for the main
course, venison stew with hedgehog mushrooms, fettucine, and
steamed green and white asparagus. Dessert would be an Alsatian
farmhouse cheesecake surrounded by a mixed-berry coulis. Naturally,
after-dinner confections would follow.
</P>
<P>
   It looked good. Not too frou-frou, but several notches above
everyday fare. Even after a year of reviewing restaurants, I found,
my approach to constructing a meal has remained more or less
unchanged. My standards have risen, though, and thanks to constant
exposure to highly talented chefs, I have looked within and
discovered untapped reserves of humility.
</P>
<P>
   With the menu drafted, the real work began. By Internet, I
ordered venison and rabbit from D'Artagnan. Over the telephone, I
ordered a black winter truffle and mushrooms from Urbani Truffles.
The dinner was scheduled for a Thursday night. The Sunday before, I
made a concentrated beef stock for the stew. A quick check of
glassware and table settings turned up gaps. I drew up a list.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday I hit the wine stores, checking out the
selection of Alsatian wines. I bought wine glasses and a pizza
stone for the tarte. On Wednesday I gathered the first round of raw
ingredients: assorted lettuces and fruits from Grace's Marketplace,
as well as fresh fettucine, although not without a twinge of guilt;
in an ideal world, the fettucine would have been homemade spaetzle,
but I foresaw precious moments spent pushing dough through a
colander. (My sixth, hidden, principle of entertaining is that
strategic shortcuts must be taken to ensure the greater good.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I procured both slab bacon and double-smoked bacon from Astoria
Meat Products. Creme fraiche we'd make ourselves, adding a little
buttermilk to cream and letting it ripen overnight, but Nancy and I
both worried about whether the starter for the fromage blanc would
take properly. As insurance, I bought back-up cheese, along with
heavy cream, eggs and butter, from Ronnybrook Farm in the Grand
Central Terminal market. Then it was uptown to Le Pain Quotidien
for an old-fashioned crusty baguette and to the Payard
Patisseriefor fruit jellies and chocolates. Finally, I stopped at a
couple of florists to fill one vase with daffodils and another with
an assortment of parrot tulips and sweet pea.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday dawned all too soon. The day was given over to an
all-out assault in the kitchen, with the usual division of labor. I
did most of the knifework, prep work and heavy lifting. Nancy did
the finesse stuff. Unusually, the campaign seemed to move forward
according to plan. The worst had already happened. We had survived
a meat crisis when D'Artagnan ran out of venison shoulder. Urbani
turned out to carry it as well. Overnight, the meat, cut into
cubes, had bathed in a simple marinade. Now it glistened
tantalizingly. Inevitably, the fromage blanc failed to thicken
properly, but we had that back-up. Now it was simply a matter of
following the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy made the cheesecake and a bright, piquant coulis of
raspberries, strawberries and blueberries. We braised the rabbit,
then made a mustardy vinaigrette from the braising liquid. Its
sweetly piquant aroma rose like an offering to the gods. I browned
the venison, covered it in stock and wine, and set it in the oven
to bubble away. Another heady scent filled the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be good,'' Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, as dinner hour loomed and she began rolling
out the tart dough, she was singing a different tune. ``My back is
killing me,'' she groaned.
</P>
<P>
   Our guest list, in living form, materialized at the doorstep. In
sketching out the preparations for the meal, I omitted the drafting
of this list, although it is as important to the evening as
organizing the menu. The fine art of shaping the human material for
a dinner party has always stumped me, perhaps because human beings
are far less reliable than food. Invite people who know each other
too well, and you risk a dull evening. Spice things up with fresh
faces, and personality clashes can arise, or the group, like our
fromage blanc, can fail to coalesce. Matchmaking is definitely out.
I learned that the hard way, setting up two people who instantly
developed the kind of mutual hatred that normally takes many years
of married life to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   This evening, the guests were carefully selected from a pool of
unwitting candidates, most of them artists with whom Nancy had
shared studio space at one time or another. Artists make good
dinner guests in one respect, unreliable ones in another. They tend
to have a keen appreciation of the finer things. Too keen, in some
cases. I well remember one guest who would slump forward, as the
evening wore on, a cigarette in one hand and a drained wine glass
in the other. Like a mechanical figure in the town clock, he would
signal dessert time by bumping his nose softly on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The other downside of an artistic gathering is the ever-present
threat of disputation. Abstract painters, in their heart of hearts,
have nothing but contempt for figurative artists, who, they
believe, belong on the ashheap of history. Figurative painters
bristle at being lumped with the likes of Andrew Wyeth. Both groups
detest installation artists, conceptual artists and performance
artists but, five minutes into a spirited attack on the common
enemy, they can turn on each other without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Our group of seven, all well-mannered bon vivants, looked just a
little dicey. In addition to three figurative painters _ Nancy,
Patrick Webb and Anne Schaumburger (her mosaic bears appear on the
walls of the BMT Fifth Avenue subway station) _ there was one
abstract painter, Nancy Olivier; one artist with possible
conceptual leanings, Joseph Karoly; a choreographer, Brian
Kloppenberg; and myself, the soul of reason. If I could just keep
them away from the topic of art, everything would go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   And so it did. The wine flowed freely, and the talk did too. The
rieslings, juicy and concentrated, elevated minds and turned the
conversation to loftier themes.
</P>
<P>
   True, there were a couple of gaffes along the way. The films of
Peter Greenaway popped up, for reasons I cannot recall. My wife
snorted. ``Has he ever made one good film?'' she asked. Karoly
reared up indignantly. Greenaway, it turned out, ranks above John
Ford and Alfred Hitchcock in his personal pantheon. Whoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe it?'' Schaumburger asked about an
acquaintance. ``He's actually a Republican.'' She made it sound
like a neo-Nazi snakehandling cult.
</P>
<P>
   Karoly bristled. ``I'm a Republican,'' he announced. Oh.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a good moment to bring out the cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   And the food? In the cold light of morning, Nancy and I
performed the traditional postmortem. She is ruthless and
unsentimental when it comes to her own cooking. The tart she
pronounced a major disappointment; the dough had not been rolled
out thinly enough, so it seemed like a cross between true Alsatian
tarts and American thin-crust pizza. The rabbit salad was excellent
in most respects, but we failed to get the servings arranged on the
plates quickly enough, and what was supposed to be a warm salad
ended up cool. Also, we were too stingy with the truffle. On the
other hand, the venison stew, voluptuous and deeply flavored, could
not have been better, underlining the truth that time spent making
stock pays off in rich dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The cheesecake, too, was beyond criticism, although Nancy
insisted that a previous version, made with cottage cheese, was
lighter and better. I liked the denser texture of the fromage
blanc. It had a sour tang to it that played off nicely against the
berry coulis. The wines made a major statement, except for the
late-harvest riesling, which seemed awfully thin. Later I
discovered why. In a mixup, I had poured a dry riesling instead of
the intended dessert wine.
</P>
<P>
   But all in all, a good meal.
</P>
<P>
   Two stars.

   ALSATIAN FARMHOUSE CHEESECAKE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Bistro Cooking,'' by Patricia Wells (Workman
Publishing, 1989) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2{ hours plus overnight chilling  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fromage blanc or small-curd cottage cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 cups yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Sweet pastry dough (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs

   4 ounces blueberries
</P>
<P>
   Sugar to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kirsch.
</P>
<P>
   1. The day before, puree fromage blanc and yogurt together in a
food processor. Transfer mixture to a large sieve lined with
dampened cheesecloth, and set over a bowl. Drain at room
temperature overnight, until mixture is very dry and firm.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare sweet pastry, then carefully roll out dough on a
lightly floured surface, forming a 12-inch circle. Transfer dough
to a 10{-inch springform pan, lining bottom and bringing pastry
halfway up sides of pan. Carefully press pastry into pan. Trim with
a knife. Prick bottom of shell with a fork. Chill for at least 20
minutes, or wrap well and chill for up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line shell loosely with
heavy-duty foil, pressing well into edges. Fill with pie weights,
dry rice or beans, making sure you get all the way into edges, to
prevent shrinkage. Bake until pastry begins to brown around edges,
about 20 minutes. Remove weights and foil, and continue baking
until lightly browned all over, about 10 more minutes. Cool on a
rack. Leave oven on.
</P>
<P>
   4. While pastry bakes, transfer drained cheese mixture to the
bowl of an electric mixer. Add eggs, one at a time. Beat in the
creme fraiche and sugar until well blended. Pour mixture into
cooled pastry shell. Bake until firm in center, 35 to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. While cheesecake bakes, make coulis: Clean fruit and puree
it, adding sugar to taste and kirsch.
</P>
<P>
   6. Cool cheesecake on a rack. Unmold and serve at room
temperature, spreading puree on plate around each slice

   On Tuesday, snow flurries fell in Chicago and other portions of
the Middle West as brisk winds imported unseasonably cold air into
the region. On Wednesday, much warmer conditions will reach the
Middle West on strengthening breezes from the southwest. Indeed,
air warming on descent from the Rockies will combine with abundant
sunshine to propel temperatures well into the 80s as far north as
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Colder air will surge into the Northeast behind a departing cold
front. Clouds will be common over the interior while considerable
sun will be found near the coast. After a chilly start with patchy
frost, high pressure will bring ample sunshine to the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Generally dry conditions will cover the western states. Cooler
weather will filter into the interior Northwest while patchy
morning clouds will shroud the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SPATE OF EXTREMES
</P>
<P>
   During the past few months, Cold Bay, Alaska, has been a target
for weather extremes. It is situated near the beginning of the
Aleutian archipelago, and strong weather systems are usually
moderated by surrounding waters before reaching the area. However,
last year ended with the coldest December ever measured there. In
January, blizzard conditions occurred on a record 13 days, and the
temperature dropped to a record low of 13 degrees. After a
comparatively tranquil February, the spate of severe weather
resumed when the tiny town had its wettest March on record.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The art world has not escaped the tyranny of round
numbers this year. ``Prague 1900: Poetry and Ecstasy,'' a show at
the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam this winter, will soon travel to
Frankfurt. ``1900: Art at the Crossroads,'' recently at the Royal
Academy in London, will be at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in
New York from May 19 through Sept. 10. And, having just opened in
Paris, ``1900'' can be seen at the Grand Palais through June 26.
</P>
<P>
   But, one might ask, beyond the obvious, why celebrate 1900 in
art? Certainly 1900 was no avant-garde landmark. At most it was a
bridge, nicely decorated by Art Nouveau, between far more important
art movements. The aim of this year's shows, though, is not to
present great art as such but to convey something of the mood of
the times. And there was indeed much going on, nowhere more than in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its own glory as well as the turn of the century,
France organized a World's Fair that engendered scores of ornate
national pavilions along the banks of the Seine. Electric lighting
came to the city's public thoroughfares for the first time, while
the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais, the Metro system, the Pont
Alexandre III and the Gare (now Musee) d'Orsay were all inaugurated
for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the Exposition Universelle, as it was known, was a
vast survey of French art, with one section covering from the
Middle Ages to Watteau and another, the Centennale, from 1800 to
1889. Simultaneously, a contemporary art exhibition called the
Decennale, covering 1890 to 1900, presented 6,543 paintings and
sculptures by 3,223 artists from 29 countries. Clearly, as the
capital of Western art, Paris had no rival.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years later, however, it was London and New York
rather than Paris that decided to recreate that moment in ``1900:
Art at the Crossroads.'' Wisely, though, its organizers have not
been too literal in evoking the Decennale since much of the
painting chosen by official national committees was frankly
mediocre. Thus, of the 180 artists (with 252 works) in ``Art at the
Crossroads,'' only 67 were part of the Decennale. The rest are
artists of the day who would prove their worth later.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both the good and the bad have been organized around a series of
themes like portraits, self-portraits, nudes and bathers, men and
women, landscapes, religion and still lifes. The result is an
interesting study in aesthetic anthropology. Above all, hung
alongside long-forgotten works, there are paintings by Degas,
Cezanne, Munch, Klimt and Monet as well as by such newcomers as
Matisse, Kandinsky, Mondrian and Picasso that remind one that these
artists were exceptions to the prevailing rule of Romantic,
academic, allegorical and frequently kitsch art.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in a sense, it is the corny art that  &UR; makes &LR;  the show
since it best illustrates what 1900 was really like. For instance,
Cezanne had already begun work on his revolutionary ``Grandes
Baigneuses'' series, but the chocolate box image of bathing maidens
in Paul Chabas' ``Joyous Frolics'' (1899) was probably closer to
public taste. Similarly, it says much for the era that Leon
Frederic was acclaimed for ``The Stream,'' a triptych portraying
hundreds of naked babies and children pouring down some allegorical
stream of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the vast melting pot that was art around 1900 came the
many interweaving and sometimes contradictory strands that would
make up the history of 20th-century art,'' explained Norman
Rosenthal, exhibitions secretary at the Royal Academy, who was one
of the show's organizers. He added: ``In the case of `1900: Art at
the Crossroads,' the challenge must be to identify what, before
modernism was born, still looks modern today.''
</P>
<P>
   The new centennial show in Paris has a different focus. Since
1900 was preceded in Paris by Post-Impressionism and Symbolism and
followed by Fauvism, Expressionism and Cubism, the organizers of
the Grand Palais exhibition opted to present more architecture,
photography, furniture, jewelry, illustrated books and ceramics
than painting and sculpture. Interior design in particular was
under the sway of Art Nouveau. (The Victoria and Albert Museum in
London is holding its own show, ``Art Nouveau: 1890-1914,'' which
opens Thursday and runs through July 30.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``1900'' dwells on neither Art Nouveau nor even the Belle
Epoque, which ended abruptly in 1914. Rather, with some 400 art
objects on display, it portrays the last turn-of-the-century as
crowded with a great diversity of visual languages and forms of
expression, variously inspired by old notions like nationalism and
Naturalism and new notions like science and technology and
urbanization. The search for the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total art
form, was frequently the ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The show's opening section, ``The Union of the Arts,''
illustrates how new concepts of design, strongly influenced by the
natural, almost botanical forms of Art Nouveau, were present in
everything: furniture, textiles, crockery, window frames and book
illustrations. And yet, as one sees in a chair and cutlery designed
by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, modernism is also struggling to make
itself felt.
</P>
<P>
   Photography too reflected this ambivalence: Gertrude Kaesebier's
``Heritage of Motherhood,'' is unabashedly romantic, while Alfred
Stieglitz's ``Hand of Man'' celebrates the steam engine.
</P>
<P>
   A section called ``Modernism and Traditions'' elaborates on this
theme, with special attention given to architectural drawings, a
nod to the proliferation of grand palaces _ museums, railroad
stations, town halls _ across Europe and the United States. A
search for national identity through architecture and interior
design was notable in Central Europe. In contrast, ``Fin de Siecle
and New Dawn'' shows how Western Europe was beginning to look
ahead. Already in 1894, for instance, Munch's painting ``Anguish''
spoke to another age.
</P>
<P>
   In Amsterdam the Van Gogh Museum has been taking a longer look
at 1900. In 1992 it organized ``Glasgow 1900: Art and Design,'' and
it followed up in 1997 with ``Vienna 1900: Portrait and Interior.''
Now ``Prague 1900: Poetry and Ecstasy,'' on display at the Museum
of Applied Art in Frankfurt from May 11 to Aug. 27, moves the
spotlight to the capital of Bohemia, part of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire in 1900 but nonetheless marked by a strongly cultural
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which has some 100 paintings, drawing and sculptures
and 200 items of decorative art, traces the struggle of Czech
artists to assert their independence from Vienna, starting in 1896
with the so-called Prague Secession, which represented their break
with salon painting. Their work exuded nostalgia for a pre-Hapsburg
era, with Symbolists like Jan Preisler and Maxmilian Svabinsky
frequently using Czech literary classics as the inspiration for
their sensual often mystical oils.
</P>
<P>
   But they also looked west to counter Vienna's influence, with
Paris celebrated in 1902 with exhibitions of works by Rodin and by
French Impressionists. A 1905 Munch show had an even greater
impact, further encouraging artists like Karel Hlavacek toward
darker, more tortured, forms of expression. Similarly, Czech
craftsmen adapted French and Belgian Art Nouveau to their own
furniture, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and glassware.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, then, a great melting pot was swirling. Yet this
moment of synthesis would not last long. The artists of 1900 may
have felt they were stepping into the 20th century, but they still
carried the 19th century with them. Then, within barely a decade,
first Expressionism then Cubism shattered every existing mold.
Modernism had struck and the 19th century finally ended.

&HT;     THE BOY SCOUT PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On April 26 the Supreme Court will hear an
especially provocative case on whether the Boy Scouts of America
may continue to prevent gay men from becoming troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The legal issue is whether the group is a public organization
that is forbidden in most states to discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation or a private institution free to choose its own
leaders by its own criteria.
</P>
<P>
   This is a close call with legitimate points on both sides. The
organization is actually a quasi-public, quasi-private group.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways it operates like a private club, taking in
schoolboys of a certain age who promise to behave themselves, wear
uniforms, work for merit badges and profess faith in God. But it
does not admit (horrors!) girls or unknown boys who wander in off
the streets. Meetings are closed, and membership is strictly up to
the discretion of the scoutmasters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Boy Scouts also use taxpayer-financed facilities in some
places and often get public support in troop sponsorship and
charity donations. National membership is so broad it can hardly be
called exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue here, however, is one of civil rights. And the
question is whether the Scouts hold such a venerable place in
shaping the character of young boys that they belong in a special
immune category. It is not a close call at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts organization does not approve of homosexuality.
It claims that being gay is incompatible with the Scout obligation
to be ``morally straight'' and ``clean.'' Its officials fear that
gay leaders would be the wrong role models for its good little
boys.
</P>
<P>
   But modern science has come a long way toward proving that being
gay is a matter of biology rather than a wickedly chosen corrupt
lifestyle. California and National Institutes of Health studies
suggest that homosexuals have a different structure in some parts
of the brain than heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   No, this case is not about protecting the public against the
spread of inherent immorality. It is not even about preventing
pre-teen boys from associating with gays since they could meet them
in many other places including church.
</P>
<P>
   It is about the intolerance of a major youth organization toward
behavior it does not understand. It is about social disapproval of
men discredited because of the sexual category to which they
belong, without any regard to their individual merit. And that
sends a message the high bench should not endorse.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts are hiding behind a claim of ``freedom of
association,'' based on the constitutional right to unregulated
expression of beliefs and ideas. A fine principle. We like to pal
around with other people who are just like us. Diversity makes for
awkwardness and sometimes uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   But this right of choice has long been abused as an excuse to
arbitrarily exclude minorities from activities and organizations
that benefit the majority. Wisely, the courts have steadily
stripped it away in a series of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen's groups like the Jaycees and Rotary Clubs raised
similar objections in defense of barring women, as did groups that
sought to perpetuate the segregation of blacks. When they lost, the
republic did not fall. Gender and racial integration has not been
perfectly smooth, but it has not had the crippling impact the
affected groups predicted. To the contrary, it has strengthened
both the country and the institutions involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts can similarly survive the acceptance of gay
leaders without mental and moral collapse, although thus far the
Scouts have been a preferred, pampered group. Local courts have
been divided on previous challenges to scouting's exclusionary
policies toward gays. By contrast, atheists who wanted to belong
have decisively lost in court and so have women, although the
Scouts were magnanimous after the latter victory, changing their
policy to allow female scoutmasters.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout supporters contend that James Dale, an expelled former
New Jersey Eagle Scout now committed to gay causes who is the focus
of the suit, wants simply to disrupt scouting by promoting his own
agenda. But the real test should be whether he would make a good,
decent scoutmaster, and specific performance should determine that.
</P>
<P>
   He can't prove his worth unless the high bench gives him the
opportunity. The Supreme Court has a tendency to punt rather than
hit a home run on sensitive issues like this that pit cultural
tradition against human rights. It would be good if the justices
faced up to this one.

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooke Shields knew what she was getting herself into _ a
non-scripted role in a low-budget, high-concept film. She would
share billing _ and dressing room space _ with plenty of non-actors
and would receive no star frills.
</P>
<P>
   All of which was fine with Shields, who wasn't looking for
safety or comfort. She had had comfort with her NBC sitcom,
``Suddenly Susan,'' which was on its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   So in writer/director James Toback's ``Black and White,'' a
story of interracial relationships that opens today, Shields got
back to basics, which for actors means improvisation. All of her
scenes in the film _ including those with Robert Downey Jr. and
boxer Mike Tyson _ were entirely unscripted. That meant no written
dialogue, just the intention of a scene _ get from point A to point
B. How you do it is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Actors are accustomed to playing improv games in theater
classes, but the free-form character-building developed for ``Black
and White'' by Toback was no exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really didn't harken back to anything I'd ever
experienced,'' says Shields, speaking from New York. ``There's a
safety if there's scripted dialogue. But with the level of anxiety
and energy that were throughout all of our scenes, nobody could
fall into the safety of the written word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Toback) I would be willing to do it providing he would
push me, that he would constantly ask me to give him more of a
commitment to this type of an environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He pushed, she committed, and the results, according to Toback,
were splendid.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was remarkable in her inventiveness, in her energy, her
capacity to surprise,'' said Toback, whose last film was ``Two
Girls and a Guy.'' ``I got from her, in what was potentially a
fascinating role only if the actor contributed in making it so,
every bit that I could have hoped for and more.''
</P>
<P>
   When the words are related back to her, a grateful Shields says
``Wow! Could I have that laminated? That is so generous and so
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   And she returns the compliment, calling Toback a smart and
trustworthy director with a point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jim was going for a documentary feel, a slice-of-life
approach and the shock value that comes from situations rather than
scripted dialogue. I think, to coin the phrase, he really wanted to
keep it real.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Shields' goal as well. She plays a documentary
filmmaker fixated on a group of white kids immersed in New York's
African-American hip-hop culture. To the Manhattan-born Shields,
``Black and White's'' setting and themes were a type of cultural
homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such an interest and a very unbiased view,'' said
Shields. ``Having been very accepted by black culture since I was
younger, based on my friends, my dance class and my music, I had a
very liberal view. That lack of judgment is what (my character)
needed to have so that Jim could present both black and white
without bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Working as she is, in an ensemble project _ and one with
challenging themes _ Shields says she is pleased to encounter
questions about her views on race and sexual identity more than
about stalkers, past or current romantic interests or her
ex-husband, Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in reading about me personally,'' she says,
adding that with ``Black and White,'' ``I've been asked some
intelligent questions for the first time in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm inspired to talk about hip-hop and about how fascinating
these kids are. This is a movie that parents need to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's format and Shields' role will invariably inspire
critical barbs that her character, Sam _ even under the dreadlocks,
nose ring and black nail polish _ is another example of Shields
playing herself. It's a statement Shields has heard before, most
recently during her four years as the perky magazine writer in
NBC's ``Suddenly Susan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're really referring to when they say, `Oh, of
course, she's playing herself,' is an image or a preconception that
has been written about for so long that it's become part of the
vernacular and the assumed reality,'' says Shields, who claims she
is selective about which press clippings she reads. ``You see it
enough and that sets the precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ceases to amaze me, the assumption that is made. I
think it could stem from being in the business for as long as I
have. However, I would believe it is impossible to assume that
anybody knows me the way it has been written and claimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers trying to get to know Brooke Shields will now have to do
so through something other than a Monday night sitcom. Despite word
from the the network that ``Susan's'' fate won't officially be
decided until May, Shields says the show is ``done. We're
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   She is pleased that the show will make it into syndication, but
says that an ever-juggling time slot and unsteady promotion caused
a loss of viewers, particularly in its last season.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it reached its fourth and final season, ``Suddenly
Susan'' was practically a new show, says Shields, who was its
co-producer as well its star. By then, it no longer had enough
support or momentum to go further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad, for sure, to have it end, but I think it had a
wonderful life.'' she says. ``We were a hit show with talented
actors and we made it into syndication where so many shows don't
even see the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a cameo in the Chris O'Donnell film ``The Bachelor,''
Shields plays a bitter divorcee who orchestrates a girls-only
weekend in Palm Springs in the upcoming ``The Weekend'' opposite
Gena Rowlands. The drama ``After Sex'' with Jonathan Schaech is
complete but does not have a release date.
</P>
<P>
   No longer in search of specific roles or projects, Shields says
she now goes with the flow, whether that leads her to film or back
to television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really all about the work, about the actual character and
finding a part that I feel could show a different aspect of

 &HT;    LARGE ISSUES STILL LOOM FOR MICROSOFT AND GOVERNMENT
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-CONGRESS. Moving in Washington (w) and financial
(f) categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will feuding antitrust officials be able to speak
with one voice when they return to a federal courtroom to seek a
fit punishment for Microsoft Corp.?
</P>
<P>
   Will Microsoft soften its legendary hard-charging culture to
strike a deal with the government and head off the threat of a
court-imposed breakup?
</P>
<P>
   Both these questions loomed large Tuesday, the day after a
sweeping verdict by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
that branded Microsoft as a rogue monopoly that had illegally
bullied its rivals, stifled software innovation and harmed
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following Jackson's sweeping decision, Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, continued to take a hard line.
In a series of interviews, he stressed that the ruling could be
reversed on appeal and voiced confidence that the software giant he
co-founded in 1975 as a Harvard dropout would prevail in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense stands on our side,'' Gates told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   While Gates's wallet is billions of dollars lighter since
settlement talks collapsed last weekend, he may feel buoyed by his
invitation to play a featured role Wednesday at a White House
conference on how technology is changing the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have both taken a
neutral stance on the antitrust case, even as Attorney General
Janet Reno continues to broadly condemn Microsoft's monopolistic
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Mr. Gates has much to offer in terms of his point of
view,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic
Council. ``We aren't endorsing or necessarily disagreeing with all
sorts of things people are going to say'' at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs that Microsoft was feeling slightly more
conciliatory after the settlement failure, the hostile verdict and
a big drop in the market value of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer, who has succeeded Gates as Microsoft's chief
executive officer, told reporters: ``Our intense focus on moving
forward has at times been threatening and our passion for this has
been misinterpreted. We can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Such contrition may lead in time to a more forthcoming
settlement offer from Microsoft than the one rejected by the
Justice Department even before it was reviewed by the state
attorneys general who act as equal partners in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, who heads the
Justice Department's antitrust division, sought to put the best
possible face on his team's disagreements with the attorneys
general, which Gates said had stymied the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, by and large, we have seen eye to eye on matters,''
Klein said. ``But at a given time, there may be some disagreements.
Honorable people, people of good faith, on occasion will find
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has told the plaintiffs privately that when the time
comes to suggest remedies he expects them to submit a unitary
brief.
</P>
<P>
   One person who does not expect new flexibility from Microsoft is
James Barksdale, the star government witness at the antitrust
trial, who accused Microsoft of seeking to illegally divide the
Internet market with Netscape Communications Corp., which has since
merged with America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft should apologize for breaking the law,'' Barksdale
said. ``Instead, they've lost the basketball game by 110 points,
and all they can do is boast about the five field goals they
made,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change the spots on this leopard,'' he concluded.
``I don't think they're evil people. I just don't think they
appreciate the law.''

TAKE A NICE, DEEP BREATH, THEN LET GO OF YOUR MONEY  
</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pardon me if I yawn, but I was up late last night cleaning out
my garage. I'm getting ready to launch my own business _ selling
empty boxes on the Internet _ and I want to make sure I have plenty
of room. I expect orders to be quite brisk.
</P>
<P>
   My boxes won't be completely empty, of course. There will be air
inside. Lots and lots of air. That's my product, in fact. Air.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, I know. You're thinking I'm an idiot. But I happen
to know that some people are willing to pay money _ darned good
money _ for air these days.
</P>
<P>
   I began research and development on this idea three years ago.
That's when newspapers in New York City, Los Angeles and other
major cities began reporting on the emergence of ``oxygen bars,''
trendy little hangouts where patrons routinely pay through the nose
for the privilege of breathing.
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: Customers stick surgical tubes up their noses
and inhale 96-percent to 98-percent pure oxygen. For this, they pay
about $1 per minute, with the typical sitting lasting 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   These bars are now spreading around the country, according to a
recent story in the Tampa Tribune. As one oxygen barkeeper told the
Trib, air is the ``next bottled water.''
</P>
<P>
   People sit around oxygen bars doing pretty much what they do at
regular bars, except there's no liquor, no beer and _ in deference
to the oxygen tanks _ no smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled air comes in a variety of scents, including peppermint
passion, tangerine twist, tropical punch and, for the smoker,
``coughdrop.'' While they're partaking the Big O, customers also
can sip on fruit juice, vitamin-laced beverages called ``smart
drinks,'' or super-oxygenated glasses of water known as ``oxygen
cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   Some bars have themes. In one establishment, patrons pop tubes
in their noses and relax by watching tropical fish swim around in
an aquarium. (This sounds an awful lot like a badly run nursing
home to me, but I reckon the action picks up, especially around
feeding time.)
</P>
<P>
   A few bars also offer ``oxygen facials,'' which involve blowing
oxygen on customers' skin. The cost? A mere $120. (I haven't had
one myself, but I gather this would be like going into a regular
bar's restroom and turning the automated hand-dryer on my face.)
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen inhalers say their sniffing works wonders. They claim
they have more pep in their step and boast that their hair is
fuller, their skin more supple, their love lives breathier.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors aren't imbibing so deeply, though. They point out that a
healthy person's blood really can't absorb any more oxygen than it
already does. In fact, some docs warn that people who suck down
pure oxygen regularly run the risk of irritating their lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you may think these folks are real airheads, but I'm not
passing judgment. The way I see it, if they have that much spare
change, they must have worked hard for it. They've earned the right
to breathe easy, no matter how much wind it may take out of their
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a few entrepreneuring souls have stepped forward
to help them suck air through a straw is, I think, exactly the sort
of thing that makes this country great.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not much of a businessman. I have a head better suited
for inhaling helium than figuring up oxygen profits. I can't
possibly hope to compete with the sharp minds running these bars,
so I'm simply hoping to carve out a little niche for myself in the
mail-order market.
</P>
<P>
   Since I can't afford to buy 98 percent oxygen, I'm offering used
air _ or, if you will, ``pre-breathed air'' or ``vintage air.''
Tonight, I'm heading home to begin packaging special concoctions of
oxygen, carbon dioxide, eau de litterbox and whatever else I manage
to trap in the boxes in my garage.
</P>
<P>
   If this thing really goes airborne, and I have no reason to
believe it won't, I expect to unveil a whole new line of products
in a matter of days. In fact, I'm currently approaching a couple of
nationally known politicians about joining me in creating special
autographed boxes of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   I welcome the opportunity to speak with investors. For
information, call me directly or visit my Web site at

HAZARDS AMONG THE HEADLINES

<P>
   If you think working on the copy desk of a daily newspaper isn't
hazardous duty, then you probably aren't the author of one of these
real, honest-to-goodness headlines reprinted in Richard Lederer's
book, ``More Anguished English:''
</P>
<P>
   Drugs And Crime Are Overrated
</P>
<P>
   _ However, sex and violence are not.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Aims At Illiteracy
</P>
<P>
   _ But presumably misses due to the fact that it couldn't read
the loading and firing instructions.
</P>
<P>
   6 Found Slain In Miami; Missing Toddler Sought

<P>
   _ This headline was goofy 20 years ago. Nowadays, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Man Shot, Stabbed; Death By Natural Causes Ruled
</P>
<P>
   _ Must have been a Miami resident.
</P>
<P>
   Another Body Found Missing
</P>
<P>
   _ Maybe they should hire somebody to keep an eye on these found
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery Allows People To Be Buried By Their Pets
</P>
<P>
   _ Dog-owners will presumably be buried much faster than
snake-owners.
</P>
<P>
   Father Of 9 Fined $100 For Failing To Stop
</P>
<P>
   _ I'd jump off a cliff if I had nine children, but I still don't
think it's right to fine people for having large families. Besides,
what's $100 to a guy who's going to have to put nine kids through
college?
</P>
<P>
   Girl Becomes Methodist After Delicate Operation
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes theology by itself just doesn't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Fencing In Your Swimming Pool Can Save A Child's Life
</P>
<P>
   _ It's hard to see how, unless the kid's afraid to jump into the
pool with all those sharp swords whipping about.
</P>
<P>
   Court Escapee Still On The Lamb
</P>
<P>
   _ Well, he couldn't have gotten too far unless he's riding one
of those genetically engineered lambs.

</P>
<P>
   _ Really? Seems to me like he should be congratulated.
</P>
<P>
   House Declared Haunted By A Manhattan Appeals Court
</P>
<P>
   _ That would be spooky. All those old guys in robes doddering
around in the middle of the night, bumping into furniture and
arguing with each other over the finer points of case law. I'll
take a good, old-fashioned poltergeist any day.
</P>
<P>

essentially a child's toy. Besides, these days most states have
switched over to lethal injection.

<P>
   Astronaut Takes Blame For Gas In Spacecraft
</P>
<P>

the bright idea of freeze-dried bean burritos anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   School Board Agrees To Discuss Education
</P>
<P>
   _ What have they been discussing before now? The Ken Griffey,
Jr. trade? Kathie Lee Gifford's retirement? The creepy guy on Who

GROWING NUMBER OF COMPANIES MONITOR EMPLOYEES' E-MAIL

 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Quinn, a systems manager for a toy company near Montreal,
is starting to learn more about his fellow employees than he had
ever wanted to know. He has found that one co-worker has a penchant
for herbal remedies, another likes jokes about women drivers and
another checks the lottery numbers each morning.
</P>
<P>
   He knows these things because, about a month ago, Quinn
installed a new piece of software on the computer network that
enables him to monitor not only every Web site that his employees
browse, but every e-mail message that they send or receive. With a
few clicks, he can open a window on a computer screen and see the
senders, recipients and subject headings of each message. Those
details, he said, help him figure out exactly what is straining his
e-mail server, which has been crashing at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy, he's sending e-mail to his girlfriend,'' Quinn said
as he scrolled through messages sent by employees of his company,
Ritvik Toys, on a recent afternoon. ``But this message here, that's
for business. And that one's for business, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To office workers elsewhere, Quinn's surveillance might sound
like Big Brother in action. But if they think it is of no immediate
concern to them, they should think again. Ritvik Toys is one of
hundreds of companies that are looking at workers' correspondence
on a routine basis. And the number of companies doing so is
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market for e-mail monitoring has basically doubled in size
over the last year,'' said Abner Germanow, a research manager at
the International Data Corp. ``And we anticipate it to grow very
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Company managers give a variety reasons for installing such
software. Some, like Quinn, are on the lookout for oversize e-mail
attachments that clog their networks. Others seek to dissuade
employees from using their systems for personal activities. And
others want to make sure employees are not sending harassing e-mail
messages that could cause trouble for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the snooping raises ethical questions.
Should managers really be peeking into people's private lives like
this? And what should they do with sensitive information that, if
disclosed, could jeopardize an employee's career?
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's original purpose in installing the software, called
SuperScout, was to manage his mail server more efficiently. But he
has since grappled with the privacy issue, deciding against
programs that would let him store and review the text of messages,
rather than just the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's none of my business,'' said Quinn, an amiable computer
guru with a hint of a Scottish accent, abundant freckles and a
beeper on his belt. ``I'm not just sitting here to watch people.
But if there is a problem, I want to be able to pinpoint it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, electronic monitoring applied mostly to Web
browsing. It was easy for managers to look through logs of Web
sites visited by employees. By contrast, tracking e-mail meant
sitting in front of an e-mail server for hours, watching lines of
text stream by. Few managers bothered.
</P>
<P>
   But the last six months, software has become more advanced,
enabling companies automatically to record, filter and sort every
word that streams through their networks. SuperScout, a product
made by SurfCONTROL, for example, can generate bar charts showing
the 10 people who receive the most e-mail, the top 10 who send the
most e-mail and the top 10 who send the biggest messages. Another
product, xVmail, made by xVault, enables managers to view and
search the text of messages. Symantec Corp. and GFI Fax and Voice
have also introduced e-mail monitoring products the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said employees' habit of sending personal e-mails never
bothered him him _ until the messages overwhelmed Ritvik's
electronic network. ``It's all about bandwidth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritvik, which employs about 700 people year-round and 400 more
in the summer and fall, is a decidedly old-economy company. A
showroom in its headquarters just west of Montreal displays dozens
of models, from castles to cowboys, that can be made with its
colorful plastic blocks, called Mega Bloks. Huge molding machines
whir and hiss on the building's first floor, where the toys are
made seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   But like most manufacturers, Ritvik relies more and more on the
Internet to get the job done. Its 200 salaried employees now file
purchase orders, do product research and make sales calls by e-mail
and on the Web. A few years ago, the company put in a
high-bandwidth telephone line, known as an ISDN, and will move to
an even faster line, a T1, this month. But even then, Quinn said,
the stream of data will probably fill those pipes until bigger ones
come along.
</P>
<P>
   So, he said, ``Instead of just buying more bandwidth, we decided
to address the problem.'' This week, a month after installing the
software, Ritvik planned to instituted a new policy requiring
employees to use discretion in their use of the network. It will
also warn them that their e-mail messages may be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Such disclosure is a good business practice, according to the
American Management Association. At some point, it may be required
by law in much of the United States. One bill in the works, for
example, would make secret monitoring illegal in California.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is hoping disclosure will be a powerful deterrent. From
what he has seen, at least 50 percent of the company's e-mail is
not related to work. And, he says, certain names keep appearing on
lists of heavy e-mail users, including an employee he has nicknamed
the herbal-remedy guy, who has spent hours looking at the Web site
of Deepak Chopra, the author of spiritual books, and sending
messages about herbal therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Others send jokes. ``Look at this guy,'' he said, as he pointed
to a subject heading titled, ``Joke of the Day'' and another titled
``Women Drivers.'' He scrolled further, displaying even more jokes
all sent by the same employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all he's been doing for the last hour,'' Quinn said,
throwing up his hands. It is not his responsibility to monitor
employee productivity, he said, but he cannot help but wonder how
such people get their work done.
</P>
<P>
   Ritvik employees had mixed emotions about the planned policy.
``It is a breach of your privacy, I guess,'' said Karen Trainor,
the company's North American distribution supervisor. ``If someone
knows everything you are writing, that's not really fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, she had heard that the company was trying to
shore up its networks and might need to check e-mail traffic to do
so. Besides, she has known Quinn for years and trusts him. ``If
that's what they are doing, I guess they have a reason to do it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For all its usefulness, though, e-mail monitoring raises the
question of who exactly should be put under the lens. The
technology department at the Southern California Edison Federal
Employees Credit Union, for example, recently installed GFI Fax
software. But while one employee was reprimanded for sending 150
e-mails in one day, said Tony Salse, director of information
technology, the credit union's senior managers and board members
need not worry about a similar fate. ``We'll probably exempt them
from that kind of scrutiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the delicate question of how hard to clamp down.
After all, most people send out the occasional personal greeting or
joke to family members and friends, and banning that would be
overkill, in the view of Chris McNierney, the manager of
information systems at Seaboard International, a lumber wholesaler
in New Hampshire. McNierney installed xVault software on his
network in January to track the origins of viruses and offensive
messages.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``People are going to have friends and make
relationships in an office. Obviously you are going to have e-mails
going back and forth, and I'm not sure you want to suppress that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, his goal was to spot ``questionable e-mail''
before it gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can head things off before we have to make an example of
somebody,'' McNierney said.
</P>
<P>
   Once monitoring becomes routine, it also falls into grayer areas
of the law, according to some lawyers familiar with workplace
privacy issues. A few lawyers have argued that a casual e-mail
exchange is more like a telephone conversation than a printed memo
and should be protected in the same way that wiretap laws prohibit
government agencies and some businesses from secretly listening to
personal conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you entrust the government with this kind of
information?'' asked Jeremy E. Gruber, legal director for the
National Workrights Institute at a recent New York Bar Association
discussion on electronic privacy. ``Why do we think that employers
will use it in a wonderful way?''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn acknowledges that monitoring systems can be abused. For
example, he has no trouble imagining a network manager who takes
offense at an e-mail message most people would consider innocuous _
and who makes life difficult for the sender as a result. ``You have
to ask: whose opinion draws the line?'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has become a true believer in his company's new
tracking software. Among other benefits, he says, it has helped him
plug a security hole he might not otherwise have spotted: hackers
who have sneaked into Ritvik's e-mail server and are using it as
their in-box.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he is,'' Quinn said, pulling up a list of e-mail
messages from someone using an account at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio. He said he plans to install a fire wall this month to
keep such impostors out.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn pulled up a bar chart of the top-10 e-mail senders for the
afternoon. ``And, the winner today is . . .'' he said with a
flourish. The top bar, in blue, showed the name of a Ritvik sales
representative. ``OK, that's legit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the hacker in Ohio? Pointing to the screen, Quinn said, ``He
only came in fourth.'' &QL;

   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ There was sound. There was fury.
But what stock market investors wanted to know after Tuesday's
bizarre bungee-jump in share prices was, what does it signify?
Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in stock market
history, the Nasdaq composite index had plunged 634.31 points,
shearing 13.6 percent off its value. Had it closed there, it would
have been the worst one-day decline in Nasdaq history. But a flood
of buying rescued the composite, bringing it to close with a loss
of only 1.72 percent on the day. By Gretchen Morgenson.

   JAPAN-POLITICS (Tokyo) _ Japan's Cabinet resigned en masse on
Tuesday, setting the stage for a rapid political succession, two
days after a life-threatening stroke incapacitated Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi. The resignation, which was formalized in a brief,
final Cabinet meeting Tuesday evening, is expected to lead to the
nomination of a candidate by the governing Liberal Democratic
Party, as early as Wednesday morning, to succeed Obuchi. A
parliamentary vote to ratify the party's choice, which is already
widely reported be the ruling party's second-ranked official,
Yoshiro Mori, would be held almost immediately afterwards. By

   ORE-ADOPTION-RECORDS (Albany, Ore.) _ The continuing legal
controversy over a law passed by Oregon voters in 1998 giving any
adult adoptee access to their birth records, which had been sealed,
so that they may try to track down their birth parents and/or
half-siblings. The legal issue, of course, pits their ``right to
know'' versus the confidentiality the state at one time promised to
women who decided to give children up for adoption. The law, the
first such measure approved by voters in any state, has been stayed
ever since by a legal challenge from six anonymous birth mothers.
Now it's coming to a head before the Oregon supreme court. By Sam

   MEDICARE-DRUGS (Washington) _ Seven months before Election Day,
the struggle over expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs
for the elderly is escalating, with both parties maneuvering
furiously on an issue with immense significance for a critical
group of voters. As the budget debate began in the Senate Tuesday,
for example, Democrats were pushing for an amendment that would
require the creation of a Medicare drug benefit before any tax cut
could take effect. President Clinton declared that their amendment
was ``good policy, the will of the American people, and addresses a
long-standing unmet need.'' Nu Robin Toner.

   SCI-HORMONE-REPLACEMENT (Undated) _ Researchers have informed
about 25,000 women taking part in a federal study of hormone
replacement therapy that, far from protecting the heart as many
researchers had assumed, the therapy may put them at slightly
higher risk from heart attacks and strokes. The study, known as the
Women's Health Initiative Hormone Trial, is the first large scale,
controlled clinical trial to test hormone replacement therapy for
post-menopausal women. But in letters sent out Friday, participants
are told that those who had been randomly assigned to take estrogen
were having slightly more heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots
in the lungs than those who had been assigned to take dummy pills
for comparison. While the effect was not sufficiently pronounced to
stop the study, the researchers themselves were taken aback. By

   MICROSOFT-SUITS (Undated) _ The ruling against Microsoft in the
federal antitrust case potentially opens the door to a flood of
private litigation against the company by equipping potential
plaintiffs with a legal finding that it is an abusive monopolist.
In addition to a trickle of class-action suits that had already
begun, the decision could embolden major companies _ not only
rivals but in some cases customers of Microsoft _ to take action
against it. By Steve Lohr.

   SIERRA-LEONE-U.N. (Daru, Sierra Leone) _ This town, attacked 59
times during a nine-year civil war, had been left for dead,
deserted by its residents. Now, a few weeks after U.N. peacekeepers
arrived, life has begun to stir again. The peacekeeping operation
in Sierra Leone will be watched closely, especially as the United
Nations Security Council considers sending troops to Congo, a much
larger country whose conflict has drawn in half a dozen nations. By

 &HT;    MORE CENSUS ADS PLANNED IN SOUTH AS RESPONSE LAGS
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Census officials, increasingly concerned about the
relatively low response in Southern states, will launch a new ad
campaign Wednesday to convince more people to return their
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 55 percent of households had responded to the census
by Tuesday, less than what federal officials had hoped for. In the
South, the response rate was generally lower, with Georgia at 53
percent, Florida at 52 percent and Texas and North Carolina each at
51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Census numbers are used to apportion congressional seats and
distribute billions of dollars in federal spending, and many
Southern governors and mayors have organized campaigns to encourage
residents to return their forms.
</P>
<P>
   The new census radio and television ads aimed at the South open
with the words ``This is an urgent message.'' They begin airing
Wednesday in Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia,
New Mexico and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, the latest phase of a $167 million national
advertising strategy, comes amid a public debate over privacy
concerns as the census conducts its once-a-decade poll of America.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republicans, including presumed GOP presidential
nominee Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi, suggested last week that Americans need
not answer all the questions on the detailed long form if they find
some objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   While census official have no hard evidence to suggest that the
privacy controversy has swayed Americans against answering the
census, ``in the middle of the census, any negative publicity about
the census is harmful,'' director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized what he termed ``cheap shots'' against the census
and urged all elected leaders to promote the head count.
</P>
<P>
   With a week remaining before census workers begin their
door-to-door survey to find people who have not responded, Prewitt
remained hopeful that Americans would ``reverse a long tide of
civic disengagement,'' a reference to declining mail-in rates since
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials had hoped that 61 percent of Americans would
have responded by Monday. Prewitt said he hoped a rush of forms
would arrive at the Census Bureau's four national processing
centers in the next few days, boosting the count. Officials suspect
that many Americans did not fill out their forms until April 1, the
date designated as ``Census Day,'' and mailed them on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Census Bureau has set a mail-in response target of
70 percent for the 2000 census, five percentage points above the
1990 rate.
</P>
<P>
   Among Southern states, Mississippi ranked the lowest Tuesday,
with only 47 percent of households responding, and Virginia was
highest, with 59 percent. Across the nation, Ohio and Nebraska had
the highest percentage of residents returning their forms, each at
62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, the South and Southwest have lagged behind
the rest of the nation in their response rates. Census officials
have dubbed it the ``Southern factor,'' forcing them to spend more
resources in those states to convince people to mail in their
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons demographers suspect for the
lower-than-average response in the South and Southwest:
</P>
<P>
   _ A traditional mistrust of federal government.
</P>
<P>
   _ A proportionally higher number of immigrants and minorities
who may be suspicious of the census and who may not fully
understand the form and its intent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A newer, more mobile Sunbelt population that is more difficult
to count compared to regions such as the Northeast and Midwest,
where populations are more firmly settled.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to convince Southerners and other Americans to
respond by mail has an effect on the Census Bureau's bottom line.
Counters must go door to door at households who fail to respond at
an estimated cost of $35 a visit. Raising the mail-in response rate
just one percentage points represents 1.2 million households that
would not need to be visited.

   ALBANY, Ore. _ It is just a piece of paper that Berry Price
wants, one locked away by the state all these years, one the
55-year-old machinist thinks may help him finally ``fill in some of
the blanks of my life.'' He wants his birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   So does Heidi Landtiser, a 32-year-old adoptee from Scappoose.
``It's hard not to know the answer to that basic question about
your background, where you came from,'' she said. ``It's like we
just appeared on earth, and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   For these two adopted adults, the quest to know more about their
births puts them on one side of the tumultuous legal debate here
over the nation's first voter-approved law granting adoptees access
to long-sealed birth records. But for many birth mothers on the
other side, the law they are fighting to block is bringing
``flashbacks and nightmares,'' as one woman described it. They say
it flatly violates the promises made by counselors and adoption
agencies years ago, that their identities would never be revealed
against their will to the children whom they gave up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The law, known as Measure 58, was passed by Oregonians more than
a year ago, but it has been on hold because of a legal challenge
filed by six birth mothers, all of whom have remained anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Oregon Supreme Court having recently upheld
lower-court rulings that birth mothers have no constitutional right
to keep the records confidential, the state is on the verge of
releasing the records to the more than 2,000 adults who have
requested them. Opponents have until Tuesday to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, and as that date nears, anxiety on both sides has
been heightening.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the debate here seems outdated. Experts agree that
a social sea change in recent years has removed much of the stigma
of pregnancy outside marriage, and many births these days are
``open adoptions,'' under which birth parents maintain contact with
the children and the parents who are raising them. Moreover,
thousands of women and men who gave up children for adoption have
eagerly placed their names with registries, leading to joyful
reunions with children whom they once assumed they would never see
again.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue in Oregon, and in the many other states where
proponents of so-called adoptees' rights are hoping to carry their
cause, is something different, since it centers on those women who
have maintained an adamant desire over the years to have no contact
with the children they gave up. Some say they are petrified that
their husbands or children will discover a long-held secret that
could cause enormous ruptures in their families. Some say they were
raped, and that a call from the person who resulted from that act
would cause them singular trauma.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone agrees these women were generally assured of
privacy when they decided to give children up, it is not clear that
such assurances are legally binding. That is the crux of the issue
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complicated debate, because you realize there are
rights on both sides,'' said E. Wayne Carp, a history professor at
Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash., who is the author of
the book ``Family Matters: Secrecy and Disclosure in the History of
Adoption'' (Harvard University Press, 1998). In Oregon at least,
the promise of confidentiality, he said, was ``an assumed promise
that was never fully articulated in law.''
</P>
<P>
   So whose right trumps? The adoptees argue for the right to
answer such a basic question about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know that there's a piece of paper in a courthouse
concerning you,'' Price said, ``concerning an event that took place
between you and another party, your birth mother, and you're not
even allowed to see it, I just think that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Price, who has only partially put together the story of
his birth, concedes that he can understand the other side. An aunt
told him that his birth mother was a Portland woman with other
children who had committed an indiscretion during World War II,
apparently when her husband was in the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see her point of view,'' said Price, who was raised an
only child. ``Maybe she never, ever, wanted her husband or her
children to know about this. But what about me? I've apparently got
a bunch of half-siblings out there, and I'd like to meet them. It
would be nice to be able to see somebody that resembles me
physically. Maybe they'd get a kick out of meeting me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Whalley, 68, a retired postal worker in Albany who has also
sought his records, has had heart and lung problems and wants to
find out more about his birth parents' medical histories. He knows
his mother is probably dead, but believes he has biological
half-siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really want is the medical background, whether my own
kids could inherit some condition we should know about,'' said
Whalley. ``It would be a bonus if there was a positive desire for
contact, but I don't want to put pressure on my siblings.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth mothers in this debate have not been identified,
though one, called ``Mary,'' recently published an article in The
Oregonian, the state's main newspaper, in which she wrote of the
fear she and other women felt as the law neared taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon, for $15, the state may simply hand over your identity to
the adult you placed for adoption as an infant 21-plus years ago,''
she said. ``In a few days, the very promises we built our lives
upon may be up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are now saying that no such promises were ever
made,'' she said. ``Yet as young women, we were counseled by
doctors, lawyers and clergymen _ professionals who were
unquestionably convinced that the law guaranteed us the choice of
privacy. We made life decisions based on those assurances. Now we
are being left with our trust shattered, our hearts broken and the
threat of our lives being changed forever without our consent.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the birth mothers, Franklin Hunsaker, the father
of five adopted children, said many of his clients were dumbfounded
when the measure got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rejoice when there are reunions,'' said Hunsaker. ``But a
reunion has got to be based on mutual consent.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The law does allow a woman to attach a statement to the original
birth certificate attesting that she does not want to be contacted,
but there are no legal prohibitions against an adoptee who ignores
those wishes. (In 1957, the state Legislature in effect sealed all
original birth certificates for adoptees and directed the state to
create new ones carrying the names of adoptive parents.)
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is unique in having a voter-approved open-records law,
and there is no question that the measure represents the most
determined push yet by adoptees to gain full rights to see their
birth records. Still, it remains unclear whether the law or the
enormous attention on the debate here will propel significantly
higher percentages of adoptees to initiate the search.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, nearly all states have solid prohibitions
that keep adoptees' birth records, or at least the names of their
birth parents, sealed. But in Kansas and Alaska, where there has
never been an explicit privacy protection, officials do not report
discernibly higher levels of adoptees who seek out birth parents.
In Tennessee, courts have established an adoptee's right to
retrieve birth records, but the state can penalize an adoptee who
contacts birth parents against their will.
</P>
<P>
   About two of every three adoptees do not seek out birth parents
and about 80 percent of those who do are women, said Carp, the
professor from Pacific Lutheran University.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Oregon, the voters and three layers of courts have sided
with the right of the adoptees to know. Any appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court is considered a long shot, though Hunsaker said it
was under strong consideration.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Carp said, ``It appears we're going to have a giant
social laboratory. All of a sudden a lot of people are going to get
their birth certificates and then they will search and they'll have
reunions with their birth mothers, whether the mothers want them or
not. If there's a lot of social turmoil that emerges, I think
that's going to strengthen the case for adoption registries'' _
under which reunions occur only by mutual consent _ and privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if this kind of social turmoil fails to come up,'' he
added, ``then you really have a strong case that there is not a
problem, and records should be open.''

TAINTED FILES ON KOHL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Helmut Kohl, who served as Germany's chancellor for 16 dramatic
years, deserves the disgrace brought on by his refusal to obey the
law and reveal the names of donors to slush funds his Christian
Democratic Union acquired while he was in office.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Kohl's countrymen should resist any temptation to
use information about the campaign finance scandal that derives
from the secret police files of the vanished communist state in
East Germany. All material generated by the infamous Stasi, be it
from telephone taps or from agents and moles, ought to be
considered tainted.
</P>
<P>
   There are empirical reasons to regard the Stasi files as
tainted, and there is also a matter of political and ethical
principle.
</P>
<P>
   The files should be off limits not merely because informants to
the East German intelligence services often lied or exaggerated in
their reports. Even if some of the information given to the Stasi
about the donors to Kohl's slush fund might be accurate, the open
society of contemporary Germany risks injecting an old poison into
its bloodstream once it allows material collected by a police state
to be presented as legitimate information.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, German newspapers have already released some
material from the East German secret police archives, and there is
a danger that members of parliament will try to get around a ban on
using such material by drawing on it to pose questions in
parliamentary inquiries into Kohl's fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Hard as it might be for legislators to refrain from exploiting
old Stasi phone taps for the sake of a headline-making question,
they must resist the temptation, for the sake of German democracy.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true, as the daily Berliner Zeitung reported Monday,
that Kohl's government had some Stasi files destroyed before German
unification in 1990 in order to keep his slush fund secret, such an
act would also partake of the communist penchant for defining truth
as that which serves the interest of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   The Stasi files can poison those who destroy them as much as
those who would release them.

TAMING MICROSOFT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ringing condemnation that
Microsoft had put ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive
fortune,'' will be remembered as long as there is antitrust law.
Although there now may be years of appeal, Jackson has put a new
industry on notice that there are rules to competition that must be
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Now begins the hard work: figuring out how to punish a corporate
giant and seeing if the punishment will stick. Microsoft may
consider that time is on its side, with a new administration coming
in next year and with a war chest to fight on indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Using the language of apple pie entrepreneurism, Microsoft
promises to ``focus on creating the next generation of innovative
software that benefits consumers, the high-technology industry, and
the American economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates made the seemingly common-sense argument that the
``incredible pace of technological change is the clearest evidence
of the competitive environment in which Microsoft and every other
company must operate . . .''
</P>
<P>
   One extension of this logic: There's no need for legal remedies
because innovations could end Microsoft's dominance. Plus some
opportunities are wide open. There is no software king, for
example, in the world of handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. These possibilities are dwarfed by current
realities. Microsoft's Windows operating system is in a whopping 95
percent of Intel-compatible personal computers. Jackson's ruling
points out a history of predatory practices. Even consumers sitting
at home putting up with Windows' glitches can't help but wonder if
more competition would have led to a more stable operating system.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft has been accused of trying to get an iron grip on
the server market by making Windows 2000 slightly incompatible with
the encryption standard. (Servers provide a service, usually
information such as Web pages, to users.) Microsoft says it isn't
at fault, that the standard is evolving.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, when Standard Oil was fielding lawsuits about its
overbearing hold on the industry, the court's view of monopolies
was blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disinterested mind,'' said Supreme Court Chief Justice
Edward White, ``can survey the period in question without being
irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that the very genius for
commercial development and organization . . . soon begat an intent
and purpose to exclude others.'' The massive oil company was given
six months to dissolve itself.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this history along with the breakup of AT&AMP;T has prompted
passionate cries to cut Microsoft into pieces. One approach is to
split off the Windows operating system component and divide this
into three competing companies.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case the next step isn't that simple.
</P>
<P>
   First, Microsoft has reason to gamble on an appeal. Jackson's
ruling is definitive. But in 1998, the appeals court sided with
Microsoft in a dispute over a consent degree. The appeals court
said that a practice many saw as predatory _ adding a Web browser
to Windows _ was OK if the company could show some benefit to
consumers. The appeals court could smile at Microsoft again.

<P>
   Second, breaking up Microsoft could damage the chemistry that
has made an undeniably powerful contribution to the economy. And it
would require the courts to make the unsettling move of telling a
business how to operate.
</P>
<P>
   So-called conduct remedies, having Microsoft agree to fairer
practices, could help to some extent. But this would force the
courts to play czar, spending time and money to become a virtual
regulatory agency in charger of making sure that Microsoft played
by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal solution is to pursue a settlement that would end the
anticompetitive behavior. Talks between the company, the US Justice
Department, and 19 states' attorney generals broke down last week,
but they should continue.
</P>
<P>
   A multifaceted settlement could offer substantial relief. Fines
would penalize the company for past predatory practices. Customers
would gain if Microsoft were required to share its source code,
enhancing competition in the software market.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Microsoft wins this appeal, it could face future
lawsuits. The wiser move for the sake of the company and American
legal precedent is for Microsoft to make concessions, to become a
far more conciliatory architect of its future.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the courts decide, the arduous proceedings around
United States of America v Microsoft Corp. will show other
companies that there are high costs to anticompetitive behavior
even in the new economy of the age of globalization.

A LIVE TV DRAMA IN BLACK AND WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., Fail Safe and Fail-Safe are CQ as they appear) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Television's golden age in the 1950s featured live
dramas like ``Marty,'' ``Requiem for a Heavyweight'' and ``Days of
Wine and Roses.'' But by the end of that decade the networks had
veered away from live drama in favor of weekly series, often about
cowboys and cops, that were filmed. Then the move in the 1960s to
Los Angeles from New York as a base for television shows
accelerated the decline of live drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an excitement and danger about live television drama
that was never recaptured,'' said George Clooney, the actor, seated
in his cluttered office at the Warner Brothers studios in Burbank.
``Why not bring back that excitement and danger? Why not stick your
neck out?''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney is, most certainly, sticking his neck out. He is
producing and starring in a highly unusual live drama, ``Fail
Safe,'' based in the 1962 best-selling novel by Harvey Wheeler and
Eugene Burdick. It is about a U.S. bomber that has been
accidentally ordered to deliver a nuclear strike against Moscow.
The novel was also made into an acclaimed film, in 1964, directed
by Sidney Lumet and starring, among others, Henry Fonda and Walter
Matthau.
</P>
<P>
   In the new version, a top-flight cast of actors will appear live
in the drama on CBS on Sunday from 9 to 11 p.m. The same show,
mistakes and all, will be shown on the West Coast, on a delayed
basis, at 9 p.m. local time. (To coincide with the live version of
``Fail Safe,'' Turner Classic Movies will show the 1964 film on the
West Coast at 11:30 p.m. after the live CBS version on Sunday and
on the East Coast at 2:30 a.m. on Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   The new live drama, directed by Stephen Frears (``High
Fidelity,'' ``The Grifters''), includes Noah Wylie ( Clooney's
former co-star on ``E.R.''), Richard Dreyfuss, Hank Azaria, Brian
Dennehy, Harvey Keitel, Don Cheadle, James Cromwell, Sam Elliott
and John Diehl. The show was written by Walter Bernstein, who also
wrote the original screenplay. ``Actually, the movie lends itself
to television,'' Bernstein said. ``There are no big exterior action
sequences. A lot of the scenes are in a bunker, an office or a
cockpit of a plane. The story is the same. The antagonists are the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   By every account, Clooney has been consumed for years with the
notion of doing ``Fail-Safe'' as a live television drama. As a
successful television and film star he finally had the clout to get
the project rolling. ``OK, my stomach, I'm sure, will be in a knot
when we do this,'' he said. ``But the only real downside for me is
one day being 75 years old and sitting in my bed and going, `You
know, I was once this 800-pound gorilla for about five minutes and
I had the opportunity to try and do new things and I was too afraid
to take risks.' My feeling is, `Why not try?'''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, 38, said he first saw the 1964 film as a child and has
since watched it more than 100 times on videotape. ``It's my
favorite film, a brilliant film about a sacrifice that's almost
biblical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he asked his friend Leslie Moonves, president and
chief executive of CBS Television, to pitch a live version of
``Fail-Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney said: ``He goes, `OK,' and then there was a pause, and I
said, `It's got to be in black and white.' And then Les sort of
groaned a little and then laughed, and said: `OK, but you've got to
be in it too. You can't just produce it.''' Clooney plays a
somewhat secondary role as a pilot, Col. Jack Grady. (Edward Binns
played the part in the 1964 movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Moonves acknowledged that he was nervous about the show. It cost
about $4.5 million, somewhat more than a conventional television
film. ``You're going in without a net, there could be mistakes
made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm doing this is George's passion for it,'' he
added. ``As a producer, he's delivered everything he's promised. We
have a cast _ and a director _ that we never would have gotten if
we were doing a movie-of-the-week. They're doing it because it's
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said that CBS was now planning a live version of another
drama, ``On Golden Pond,'' starring Julie Andrews, late this year.
``There's no reason we can't do a live drama every year,'' he said.
He said that live television appeals to well-known actors who would
ordinarily avoid television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fail Safe'' is to be broadcast from two sprawling soundstages
on the Warner Brothers lot. One will house the sets of the war room
of the Strategic Air Command as well as a Pentagon office. The
other soundstage includes the bunker of the president, who is
played by Dreyfuss, and the cockpit of a bomber. During the
broadcast, some technicians and camera crew members will be dressed
in military uniforms just in case they inadvertently step before a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ziskin, a film producer, said that the live drama was by
necessity far different from the television shows 50 years ago.
``There's a contemporary audience that expects something visually
and cinematically interesting,'' she said. ``It's a bigger
undertaking. Most of those shows were not anywhere near as
ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   If an actor forgets a line or trips over a wire? ``You
proceed,'' she said. ``It is what it is. In that way, it's
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Frears, whose latest film, ``High Fidelity,'' opened on Friday,
said he took over the staging of ``Fail Safe'' because ``it was an
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been done very often,'' he said. ``My concerns are,
of course, that an actor will fluff his lines or face the wrong
camera. But there's nothing I can do about that. And we have very
good actors.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that underlying the project was a powerful sense of
admiration among the cast and crew for the live dramatic shows
shown on television in the 1950s. ``What they did was
extraordinary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie, who plays a translator for the president, said that the
rehearsal process was more like working in theater than in films or
television. ``You're able to give an uninterrupted performance,''
he said. ``You're doing it completely in continuity. If you stay in
character without distraction you can give a pretty cohesive
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wylie was in the highly publicized live broadcast of ``E.R.'' in
1997. That show was criticized for being more gimmicky than
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work,'' said Clooney, who had pushed for that live
episode. ``It shouldn't have been in color. We shouldn't have tried
to replicate the show. OK, I'll take the knock, fair enough. But we
gave it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been obsessed with live television since his
childhood, when his father, Nick Clooney, who is now a host on the
American Movie Classics cable network, worked for a television
station in Cincinnati. ``At 12 I was a floor director and my sister
was the cue card girl and my dad was doing a live variety show,''
said Clooney. ``I remember standing next to the cameras while he
was reading off these old teleprompters and there was this horrible
thing in my mind which said, `If I wanted I could go right in front
of the camera right now and yell the most unprintable things.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not worried about the prospect of on-camera
mistakes. ``Actors have a good survival instinct,'' he said.
``We've all done theater. We've all made mistakes onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, you know, you just can't walk off. You figure it
out and get out of it somehow. More than likely the audience won't
know you made a mistake. At least I hope they won't know.''

   BLACK-PHOTOGRAPHERS (Washington) _ ``Reflections in Black: A
History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present,'' an
exhibition through June 30 at the Arts and Industries building of
the Smithsonian Institution here, is a history with a provocative
notion at its core: that at various times, but especially in the
first several decades of the 20th century, American blacks used
photography to resist the image the dominant culture imposed on
them. Without a common program, perhaps even without a fully
conscious intent, people all over the nation devised a way to see
themselves as they were or wished to be, no matter what white
society had in mind. By Vicki Goldberg. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   JOE-GOULD'S-SECRET-FILM (Undated) _ ``Joe Gould's Secret'' is an
odd book to want to make a movie of. It is a classic of sorts, by
one of the most revered of the old New Yorker writers, Joseph
Mitchell; and until the book-length version was republished
recently by the Modern Library, copies of the original magazine
articles, bleary from over-Xeroxing, were passed around in certain
circles like samizdat. Stanley Tucci, produced, directed and star
in ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' which opened Friday. He and his
screenwriter, Howard A. Rodman, have created a film version that is
earnest and intelligent and, for the most part, painstakingly
faithful to the facts. By Charles McGrath. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DUCHOVNY-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ It's a Tuesday morning on the set
of ``The X-Files'' and David Duchovny is working three jobs. He has
just changed out of his FBI agent suit _ the uniform for the
brooding but sartorially conformist Fox Mulder _ into an orange
T-shirt and jeans, director chic. A Princeton undergraduate, Yale
graduate, Manhattan, Scots-Jewish, Leo, he enjoys contact sports
and yoga. At this point no one knows for sure how much longer
Duchovny will be a part of ``The X-Files,'' Fox's most popular
drama series, or even if this is the show's last season altogether.
They just know he's been spending a lot of time publicizing his new
movie, ``Return to Me,'' a romantic comedy about a heart
transplant. Is film his future? Or can he never escape the
identification with Mulder, a strangely emotionless man obsessed by
government conspiracies, space aliens and his sister? And most
important, is he a truly talented actor or just a really lucky guy
who got cast as the one character he was born to play? By Anita
Gates. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE-FILMS (Undated) _ Midway through ``Erin Brockovich,''
I began to peel off from that hugely likable movie and consider its
curious new genre, whose template has already hardened. Once again,
as in ``The Rainmaker'' and ``A Civil Action,'' a David law firm
was suing a Goliath corporation on behalf of the company's victims.
Once again, the corporation was responding with a conspiracy of
silence and intimidation. And once again I had that uneasy feeling
that something was missing: a credible, complex opponent. By
Phillip Lopate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OM-PURI-FILMS (New York) _ Although Om Puri has appeared, by his
own estimate, in something like 140 films in his 24-year screen
career and has been characterized by one expert on Indian cinema as
``the finest actor of the post-independence generation,'' he does
not expect to be recognized on the streets of New York. But when he
and I step out for a cigarette in front of the SoHo Grand Hotel, a
middle-aged man and woman strolling up West Broadway look startled,
walk a few steps farther up the street, and then, after a fast
conference, return to tell Puri how impressed they had been by his
performance in ``East Is East'' (opening Friday), which they had
seen in Israel. By Terrence Rafferty. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ZE'EVA-COHEN-DANCE (New York) _ The dances of the Israeli-born
choreographer Ze'eva Cohen focus on women, contemporary, ancient
and mythical. Some of the women are feisty, some are noble. All,
ultimately, are tragic: they dance as an act of resistance against
straitened circumstance or passing time, as if they were singing
private songs in a desert. Five of the 40 works Cohen has
choreographed since 1968, collected under the title ``Female
Mythologies,'' will be performed at Danspace Project in St. Mark's
Church in Manhattan from Thursday through Sunday. By Mindy Aloff.

<P>
   HAYLEY-MILLS-THEATER (Undated) _ Given her theatrical pedigree,
Hayley Mills must be aware of more than a few show business maxims.
For example: try to avoid following a tough act, and, there is no
tougher act than a cute kid. But what happens when you're your own
toughest act to follow? In one way, Mills has already found out,
having worked on the London stage for the last 30 years. But in
this country she is still best known as that saucer-eyed little
girl in such popular Disney films as ``Pollyanna'' (for which she
won a special 1960 Academy Award), ``The Parent Trap'' (1961) and
``That Darn Cat'' (1965). If Mills has her way, her New York stage
debut will begin the third act of what has already been a long
career. The London-born actress, who turns 54 next week, opens
Monday at the Lucille Lortel Theater in ``Noel Coward's Suite in
Two Keys,'' an evening of two one-act plays directed by John
Tillinger. By Steven Drukman. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WILD-PARTY-THEATER (New York) _ In the summer of 1926, Joseph
Moncure March, something of a rebel at 26, sat down at a battered
kitchen table in his airless $20-a-month walkup on West 14th Street
in Manhattan to write a narrative in verse about ``a lot of people
getting drunk at a party,'' a subject he had come to know very
well. The result, ``The Wild Party,'' is, as almost everyone knows
by now, the source and title of two musicals this season: one, by
Andrew Lippa, ends its run this Sunday at the Manhattan Theater
Club at City Center; the other, co-produced by the Joseph Papp
Public Theater, is to open on Thursday at the Virginia Theater on
Broadway. With music and lyrics by Michael John LaChiusa and
directed by George C. Wolfe, it stars Mandy Patinkin, Toni Collette
and Eartha Kitt. By Maura Spiegel. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

music from France, with its murky chromatic harmony and langid
sensuality. By Anthony Tommasini.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARLAND-WORLD-MUSIC-BOOK (Undated) _ The Garland World Music
Encyclopedia, a projected 10-volume series of telephone-book-size
reference works from Routledge started appearing in 1998. Six
volumes have been published; the two volumes just released, on
Europe and South Asia, are up to the level set by their
predecessors, on Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific
Islands and South America, Mexico, Central America and the
Caribbean. Don't spend too much time fussing here about the loaded
term ``world music.'' In this case it is not a naive stand-in for
``music that North Americans consider foreign''; it literally means
music made all over the world, including here. By Ben Ratliff. &QL;

<P>
   EXIT-ART-CENTER (New York) _ In New York, some seemingly
well-financed art centers flounder or disappear even after
presenting good, memorable shows. And then there are the offbeat,
sometimes more impulsive art outposts that pop up and, despite the
odds, hang on for years and unexpectedly become important, even
treasured institutions. Exit Art/The First World is one such
irascible survivor. Now, with a retrospective exhibition entitled
``The End: An Independent Vision of Contemporary Culture,
1982-2000,'' the nonprofit arts center that has become an essential
stop for many art professionals and art enthusiasts alike is
celebrating _ and dutifully analyzing _ its own history since its
founding 18 years ago. By Edward M. Gomez. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FACT-FICTION-ART (San Francisco) _ At a time when ``based on
real-life events!'' and ``a true story!'' are the most popular
come-ons for everything from memoirs to movies, an entertaining
show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art investigates
contemporary artists' fascination with the opposite tactics of
fakery, disguise and deceit. The exhibition, titled ``Fact/Fiction:
Contemporary Art That Walks the Line,'' presents 82 works that
embrace the appearance and techniques of realism, yet delight in
exposing realism as just another deception. ``Fact/Fiction'' runs
through next Sunday. By Tessa DeCarlo. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   CHINESE-STOOLS-ART (New York) _ William Lipton remembers the
first time he saw Chinese stools. It was the late 1950s, and he was
5. A pair of barrel-shaped stools, in blue and white porcelain,
flanked the sofa in his grandmother's parlor in Dallas. Lipton has
no idea today what became of the stools, family heirlooms that were
trophies of a trip around the world made by a
great-great-grandfather in 1887. Then, on a first visit to China in
1979, when Lipton was a textile designer working for Jim Thompson
Ltd. in Bangkok, stools loomed large again. In Beijing he saw a
towering pile of weathered wood stools, with elegantly carved
aprons and legs, with hoof feet, scrolled feet and flat feet
protruding here and there from a stack that looked like a bizarre
offering to the gods of good taste. The memory of that scene stayed
with him. He became an antiques dealer in 1989, ultimately
specializing in Chinese furniture. Four years ago he began to
assemble as many examples of stools ``with personality'' as he
could find for a show on a form of furniture that is the most
humble and versatile of all in China but is rarely exhibited. He
selected 92 of them for ``The Wondrous and Amenable Chinese
Stool,'' an exhibition at his shop, William Lipton Ltd., in
Manhattan, through April 22. By Rita Reif. &QL;

   OLSHER-RADIO-SHOW (New York) _ Most radio shows are as

listeners by following his own fancy. Olsher, a former cultural
correspondent for National Public Radio, will be the host of ``The
Next Big Thing,'' a one-hour weekend program that will go on the

</P>
<P>
   TV-MEN-COMEDIES (Undated) _ Men in a growing number of comedies
are depicted as rude, crude, sex-crazed, sexist, childish and
blindly egotistical. The curmudgeonly title character of ``Becker''
(Ted Danson), a middle-aged doctor, says things like: ``If you want
to know about women, you don't ask a woman. If you want to know
about meat, do you ask a cow?'' On ``Friends,'' Joey eats steak
with his fingers at Ross's wedding reception. Prime time gives us
grown men who can't stop giggling in church, bawdy male magazine
publishers married to women half their age and men who stick
Montblanc pens up their noses in order to meet women in the
emergency room. Anyone who watches television regularly could get
the impression that one of the two sexes on this planet is not only
dimwitted and uncouth but darned proud of it. By Anita Gates. &QL;

   REGULAR GUYS? THEY'RE BACK
</P>
<P>
   Executives at TBS Superstation , which 25 years ago was Ted
Turner's first foray into the television business, are plotting an
image makeover for their cable network in an attempt to draw the
disenfranchised American male.
</P>
<P>
   TBS executives plan to announce Wednesday that the
general-interest station will be repackaged as a haven for average
men who, the executives maintain, have been left out of the recent
marketing frenzy that is targeting societal niches that were
neglected back when everything was directed, in fact, at regular
guys.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover will begin with a advertising campaign intended to
make these men associate the station with their tastes and will
continue with new programming deemed attractive to men.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, these regular guys were sort of Americana, if you
will,'' said Constance Barkley-Lewis, senior vice president for
marketing at TBS. ``Everybody has been very niche-focused, and
these guys got lost in the mix. The regular guy wasn't very cool
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, is fine by the regular guy because ``he doesn't
aspire to be cool anymore; he just wants to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has really simple needs and we want to fulfill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the ``regular guy'' label may sound slightly amorphous _
for instance, he is not given an exact age range _ the network's
president, Dennis G. Quinn, said he had a good idea about who this
guy was.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real, regular guys,'' Quinn said. ``You know, when
you hang around your buddies and you say, `What's Charlie like?,'
and it's, `Ah, he's a regular guy.' A regular guy would be the guy
who would be married to the soccer mom. I would have to say that
they're B students.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Terry Bradshaw meets Tim Allen, he said. A bonus for
advertisers, he said, is that these men watch television with their
families, so the network will be viewed by them and their wives and
children.
</P>
<P>
   TBS, the highest-rated cable network among adults, was already
drawing in these John Does with wrestling, NBA games, auto races
and the ``Movies for Guys Who Like Movies'' franchise. Next year
the executives plan to add reruns of supposedly regular-guy shows
like ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``The Drew Carey Show,'' ``Home
Improvement,'' ``Friends'' and ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   The TBS campaign will promote masculine network programming and
feature the tag line ``It's your world. We're just programming
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is to outline this strategy for advertisers Thursday.

   FRATURDAY TOONS
</P>
<P>
   The WB network, which quickly established itself as the leader
in the arena of child viewers of Saturday morning cartoons,
announced a new lineup Tuesday that once again emphasized just how
important one segment of the children's audience is to network
programmers: boys.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new cartoons being added by WB on Saturday are a
series based on the acrobatic action pyrotechnics of the movie star
Jackie Chan, a new show about the popular X-Men taking cartoon
teen-agers into a world of genetic mutations, and, in a first, an
action cartoon with an African-American superhero.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Donna Friedman, the senior vice president of
Kids WB, as the network's children's programming department is
known, announced an expansion of the network's Saturday morning
franchise into a new area: Friday afternoons. ``We're saying that
Saturday morning begins on Friday afternoon,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   The network introduced a schedule of four new cartoons, anchored
by a spinoff of its breakout hit ``Pokemon,'' to play from 3 to 5
p.m. on Fridays. Friedman said the new programming block was being
called ``Fraturday'' to emphasize the connection to Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   It is not meant to evoke a frat house mentality, she said except
``in the way that it's all about fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Friday programming is supposed to be ``gender
neutral,'' as she put it, while the powerhouse Saturday lineup
continues to be ``boys first, with girls right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday shows are heavily skewed toward ``action and
adventure,'' she said, which she said targeted young male
audiences, while Friday shows are ``more about heart and character,
which appeals to girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday shows already included such action-oriented shows
as ``Batman Beyond,'' ``Max Steel'' and ``Men in Black.'' Added to
that will be ``Jackie Chan Adventures,'' in which the cartoon
version of the star will share ancient Chinese wisdom, and
acrobatic action, with Chan's 11-year-old tomboy niece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Static Shock'' will feature the adventures of Virgil Hawkins,
a black teen-ager with electromagnetic superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays and Fridays will include editions of ``Pokemon GS,''
the spinoff of the big children's hit, which will get a sendoff in
a new ``Pokemon'' movie this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``gender-neutral'' Friday shows are to include
``Cardcaptors,'' a combination of ``Pokemon'' and ``Harry Potter,''
about a 10-year-old girl named Sukura and wizards and magical
cards. Another new show is ``Generation O,'' about the lead girl
singer of a rock group. The third is ``The Zeta Project,'' about a
renegade robot.
</P>
<P>
   The WB's Saturday morning ratings have grown this year with the
network surpassing Nickelodeon as the leader with child viewers on
Saturday mornings.

<P>
   DIVERSITY CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   CBS on Tuesday became the second network to name an executive to
be especially in charge of diversity issues when it elevated Josie
Thomas from vice president for business affairs for CBS News to the
new position of senior vice president, diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In March, NBC named Paula Madison, the news director for its
station in New York, WNBC, as vice president for diversity. Madison
will remain in her position at Channel 4, however.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS spokesman said that Thomas would also remain an adviser to
Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, for business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both positions were created as part of the networks' extensive
agreements with the NAACP to seek solutions to hiring and
programming issues involving minorities.

&HT;     HOUSE REPUBLICANS AGAIN FOCUS ON LATE-TERM ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans geared up Tuesday for an
election-year fight over abortion as they prepare to vote for the
third time on whether to ban a controversial late-term procedure
called ``partial-birth abortion'' by its critics.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation appears doomed again this year because President
Clinton has pledged to veto any late-term abortion measure, as he
did in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This expected fate has led some Democrats to accuse Republicans
of raising the issue again so that they will have an attractive
political issue this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who opposes the ban, said Republicans
are bringing the measure up before the elections for ``purely
political'' reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they know they're going to lose, why are they doing this?''
Lowey said. ``It's clearly because they want a political issue. By
discussing this and showing the pictures (of the procedure), they
are appealing to the emotions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote is expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   House debate over the procedure is always passionate and
graphic, with supporters of a ban arguing that the method is
gruesome and unnecessary and likening it to infanticide. The
late-term abortion targeted by the bill involves a surgical
procedure where the skull of the fetus is crushed while still in
the womb, killing the fetus. The body is then extracted through the
birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters say the procedure is rare and that
the legislation is too vaguely worded and would weaken Roe v. Wade,
the Supreme Court's 1973 decision establishing a constitutional
right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, insisted
Tuesday that the vote is more than symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot in good conscience not have this vote, given the
strong feelings we have,'' Armey said. ``There is a nation full of
people that are appalled by this procedure and Congress is
committed to stopping it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a January CNN-USA Today Gallup Poll of 1,027
people, 64 percent of respondents said they favored a law banning
``partial-birth'' abortion, while 31 percent said they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he objects to the legislation on the basis that it
did not include adequate exceptions to protect the health of the
mother. The House overrode both of Clinton's earlier vetoes but the
Senate fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for an
override.
</P>
<P>
   The surgical procedure, known by doctors as dilation and
extraction, involves partially extracting a fetus through the birth
canal, collapsing the skull and draining its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be a line somewhere _ and this is over the
line, in my opinion,'' said House Judiciary Chairman Henry J. Hyde,
R-Ill. ``This is really indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., who has crusaded for the ban since
Republicans took over the House in 1995, conceded the chances of
the measure becoming law this year are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand it's an uphill battle in the Senate and it's an
uphill battle with the president,'' Canady said. ``We're going to
give this our best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow the procedure only to save the woman's
life. Earlier versions of the legislation would have followed a
more liberal rule, allowing the procedure when the woman's health
was endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone performing such an abortion in violation of the law could
face up to two years in prison.

&HT;     THE BOY SCOUT PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On April 26 the Supreme Court will hear an
especially provocative case on whether the Boy Scouts of America
may continue to prevent gay men from becoming troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The legal issue is whether the group is a public organization
that is forbidden in most states to discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation or a private institution free to choose its own
leaders by its own criteria.
</P>
<P>
   This is a close call with legitimate points on both sides. The
organization is actually a quasi-public, quasi-private group.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways it operates like a private club, taking in
schoolboys of a certain age who promise to behave themselves, wear
uniforms, work for merit badges and profess faith in God. But it
does not admit (horrors!) girls or unknown boys who wander in off
the streets. Meetings are closed, and membership is strictly up to
the discretion of the scoutmasters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Boy Scouts also use taxpayer-financed facilities in some
places and often get public support in troop sponsorship and
charity donations. National membership is so broad it can hardly be
called exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue here, however, is one of civil rights. And the
question is whether the Scouts hold such a venerable place in
shaping the character of young boys that they belong in a special
immune category. It is not a close call at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts organization does not approve of homosexuality.
It claims that being gay is incompatible with the Scout obligation
to be ``morally straight'' and ``clean.'' Its officials fear that
gay leaders would be the wrong role models for its good little
boys.
</P>
<P>
   But modern science has come a long way toward proving that being
gay is a matter of biology rather than a wickedly chosen corrupt
lifestyle. California and National Institutes of Health studies
suggest that homosexuals have a different structure in some parts
of the brain than heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   No, this case is not about protecting the public against the
spread of inherent immorality. It is not even about preventing
pre-teen boys from associating with gays since they could meet them
in many other places including church.
</P>
<P>
   It is about the intolerance of a major youth organization toward
behavior it does not understand. It is about social disapproval of
men discredited because of the sexual category to which they
belong, without any regard to their individual merit. And that
sends a message the high bench should not endorse.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts are hiding behind a claim of ``freedom of
association,'' based on the constitutional right to unregulated
expression of beliefs and ideas. A fine principle. We like to pal
around with other people who are just like us. Diversity makes for
awkwardness and sometimes uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   But this right of choice has long been abused as an excuse to
arbitrarily exclude minorities from activities and organizations
that benefit the majority. Wisely, the courts have steadily
stripped it away in a series of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen's groups like the Jaycees and Rotary Clubs raised
similar objections in defense of barring women, as did groups that
sought to perpetuate the segregation of blacks. When they lost, the
republic did not fall. Gender and racial integration has not been
perfectly smooth, but it has not had the crippling impact the
affected groups predicted. To the contrary, it has strengthened
both the country and the institutions involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts can similarly survive the acceptance of gay
leaders without mental and moral collapse, although thus far the
Scouts have been a preferred, pampered group. Local courts have
been divided on previous challenges to scouting's exclusionary
policies toward gays. By contrast, atheists who wanted to belong
have decisively lost in court and so have women, although the
Scouts were magnanimous after the latter victory, changing their
policy to allow female scoutmasters.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout supporters contend that James Dale, an expelled former
New Jersey Eagle Scout now committed to gay causes who is the focus
of the suit, wants simply to disrupt scouting by promoting his own
agenda. But the real test should be whether he would make a good,
decent scoutmaster, and specific performance should determine that.
</P>
<P>
   He can't prove his worth unless the high bench gives him the
opportunity. The Supreme Court has a tendency to punt rather than
hit a home run on sensitive issues like this that pit cultural
tradition against human rights. It would be good if the justices
faced up to this one.

&HT;     TEXAS FARMERS TO LOBBY IN WASHINGTON FOR WATER FROM MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A battle over water rights between Texas and Mexico
has prompted angry farmers from the Lone Star State to come here to
lobby lawmakers and State Department diplomats on Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texans will urge the officials to prod Mexico into giving
drought-stricken American farmers in the Rio Grande valley water
they say the nation owes them.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992 Mexico has transferred to the United States less than
half the water it should have under a treaty between the two
countries. As a result, Texas farmers have lost an estimated $400
million a year from crop failures, according to JoJo White, a
farmer from Mercedes, Texas, which is about five miles from the
Mexico border. White is also chairman of the Water Treaty Committee
for the Water Districts Managers Association, which apportions
water for the lower Rio Grande valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are screaming for water, and they're not letting it go
through,'' he complained in a telephone interview Tuesday before
leaving for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He and four others will discuss the problem with State
Department officials and with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas,
and Democratic Reps. Ruben Hinojosa and Solomon Ortiz and
Republican Rep. Henry Bonilla, all of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A 1944 treaty allotted water from parts of the Colorado and Rio
Grande rivers in the United States to Mexico. It also guaranteed
the United States at least 350,000 acre-feet of water a year from
Mexican tributaries that feed into the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   An acre-foot is 325,889 gallons, enough to cover one acre of
land with one foot of water.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, each country transfers certain required amounts
of water by the end of a five-year period except in cases of
extreme hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997 Mexico transferred 41 percent of the water
mandated by the treaty, saying it could not transfer the rest
because of an ``extraordinary drought.'' It said in 1997 that it
should be able to repay its debt over the next five-year period
ending Oct. 2, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by the R.J. Brandes Co., an Austin-based engineering
consulting firm specializing in water resources, said last December
that Mexico had received 81.4 percent of its average rainfall
between 1992 and 1997 and had extra water in its basins during
those years.
</P>
<P>
   Several calls to the Mexican embassy here and a consular office
in Chicago failed to elicit a response to questions about the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Mexico has argued that it is undergoing a worse
drought now than it did in the prior five-year cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, however, it transferred 41,000 acre-feet of water
to Texas. Also, the International Boundary and Water Commission,
which oversees treaty compliance, announced that Mexico had agreed
to transfer another 97,000 acre-feet of water soon.
</P>
<P>
   But White said that since 1997 Mexico's water debt has grown
more than 400,000 acre-feet to a total debt of 1.44 million
acre-feet, Rio Grande farmers fear Mexico may not be able to repay
them fully by the 2002 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge volume that is now owed us is rapidly growing, and if
they don't start paying it, they will be in a (definite) treaty
violation,'' White said. ``We need a minimum of 400,000 acre-feet
right now to prevent serious economic losses,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday that ``Mexico needs to live up to its obligations
under the treaty.'' He said U.S. diplomats have reminded the
Mexican ambassador and Mexico's undersecretary of foreign relations
of this obligation in recent meetings.

   DARU, Sierra Leone _ This town, attacked 59 times during a
nine-year civil war, was left for dead, deserted by its residents.
Its strategic airstrip was protected by forces loyal to the
government but surrounded by brutal rebels who controlled the rest
of eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with United Nations peacekeepers here, life has begun to
stir again in Daru. Shops have opened as thousands have resettled
here, some returning from refugee camps in Liberia, where many
people fled.
</P>
<P>
   Others have stopped here in the hope of eventually heading to
their homes farther north in the heart of Sierra Leone's diamond
mining region, an area that the rebels have so far guarded fiercely
from the U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back there, but not yet,'' said Salifu Din, 42,
who is from a village near the diamond mining city of Koidu and who
arrived in Daru more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Din, who spent two years in a Liberian refugee camp with his
wife and two children, has set up a small stand in the market here,
selling nails, hammers and other tools that people are buying so
they can rebuild. He said he would try to go home when the U.N.
troops moved into that area.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers have slowly started pushing into rebel-held
territory, like the area around Daru, providing the first glimpse
into regions that for years were inaccessible to most outsiders
except soldiers and mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the peace accord signed last July, more than half of
Sierra Leone remains effectively under the control of the
Revolutionary United Front, the group that waged a campaign of
terror by chopping off ordinary citizens' hands, arms and feet.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers are part of a U.N. mission that will bring more
than 11,000 troops to this West African nation by July. Already
7,400 troops are here, but many are the Nigerian soldiers who were
already in Sierra Leone as part of a West African peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   The operation will be watched closely, especially as the U.N.
Security Council considers sending troops to Congo, a much larger
country whose conflict has drawn in half a dozen nations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Sierra Leone peace agreement, the nation should now be
one entity. But the reality is far different. The government
controls the area around the capital, Freetown, while the rebels
retain authority in the north and east.
</P>
<P>
   Two other groups _ former soldiers who were allied with the
rebels and a civil defense militia known as the Kamajors who backed
the government _ are ensconced in other parts. Of the 45,000
estimated combatants, only about a third have been disarmed and
demobilized.
</P>
<P>
   The main rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, has proved
the most resistant. The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan,
recently criticized its leader, Foday Sankoh, saying he was
hampering progress with his ``often negative and confusing
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated assurances by Sankoh that U.N. peacekeepers can
go anywhere in the country, his soldiers have continued to block
their advance. In January the rebels stole significant amounts of
weapons and equipment from Guinean and Kenyan peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The harassment has also delayed the delivery of aid for
civilians in rebel-held territory. The World Food Program, a U.N.
agency, has yet to make deliveries in the far east and did not
begin distribution in the north until March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a test,'' said Julie Thoulouzan, a program coordinator
for the program in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After a battalion of Indian peacekeepers arrived in Daru in
February, more than 100 troops were able to move recently to
another eastern town, Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a great deal of difficulty getting to this area,''
said Lt. Col. Amit Sharma. ``The RUF set up barricades. They would
allow us through now and then. One day they would say, `Peace,
peace, peace.' The next day they would stop our convoy. The same
men, the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter ride from Freetown to Daru provides a view of
endless forest, the monotony broken by the occasional town and
village, whose lands have largely been left uncultivated because of
the war. Along rivers about 20 miles west of here in a town called
Kenema, people could be seen toiling in water-filled holes, mining
for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond mining is mainly done along riverbeds in Sierra Leone
and is mostly illicit. In Kenema, military officials said, Lebanese
merchants sell water pumps, which diamond prospectors use to fill
holes with water so they can look for diamonds, as if they were
panning for gold in the American Old West.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds have fueled the conflict, as they have in Congo and
Angola, providing the warring parties the means to buy arms.
Diamond trafficking has been particularly important to the main
rebel group, which has ties to Liberia's president, Charles Taylor.
It has financed its war with diamonds smuggled out through Liberia
and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, even as Sankoh has professed his commitment to
peace, his soldiers have remained armed. They have not allowed
peacekeepers to move into the areas with the richest diamond mines,
which are centered on Koidu.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. military observers who have visited the area escorted by
rebel soldiers said people could be seen digging feverishly for
diamonds _ apparently doing as much mining as possible before the
rainy season starts in April and makes it impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll try to hold on to it until before the
elections,'' one military observer said, expressing the commonly
held opinion that Sankoh is not fully committed to peace and is
preserving a military option.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement, Sankoh joined a power-sharing
government and is chairman of a government commission in charge of
the nation's mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was criticized by human rights organizations for
granting blanket amnesty to Sankoh and others widely believed to be
guilty of crimes against humanity. It allowed the rebels to become
a political party that will be able to offer candidates in the
presidential and legislative elections scheduled for early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and international aid agency officials based in
Freetown say they believe that Sankoh has been amassing money for
his future political efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They also suspect that he may try to win the elections by simply
threatening to resume the fighting if he loses _ the same approach
used successfully by Taylor, a former rebel who won an election in
Liberia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who pushed for early elections during the peace talks,
has denied delaying the peace. Recently he even blamed the
peacekeepers for impeding the distribution of aid to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials reject the accusation and contend that Sankoh is
responsible for the delays in bringing peace to the area. Oluyemi
Adeniji, the U.N. special envoy to Sierra Leone, said in an
interview that the delays might ``have an effect on the timing of
the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Adeniji, a Nigerian, added that the United Nations would not
endorse elections held while one or more of the warring sides
remained armed. ``Of course, the U.N. would not want to get
involved, either in providing logistics or observing elections that
may be fundamentally flawed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Daru, the slow process of rebuilding has begun. Capt.
Sandeep Shah, a munitions expert, has collected four tons of
unexploded bombs inside two concrete buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He found many of the explosives strewn across Daru. In a third
building are stacks of rifles collected from the 500 former
combatants who have passed through Daru's camp for what is called
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, or DDR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't despair,'' said Maj. Gen. Vijay K. Jetley, the
commander of the peacekeeping troops. ``I find there is a lot of
hope. While DDR is going slowly, I think it's a matter of time. Two
months ago there was not a single person in the camp in Daru.''

   NEW YORK _ Diana Ross and the Supremes are back, at least in
name. The trio is to tour arenas this summer with two singers who
joined the Supremes after Ross left the group in 1970. The
reconstituted Supremes are to perform '60s hits like ``Where Did
Our Love Go,'' ``I Hear a Symphony,'' ``Baby Love'' and ``You Keep
Me Hangin' On.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Grand Central Terminal Tuesday, Ross
announced an arena tour to start on June 14 in Philadelphia and end
on Aug. 15 in Las Vegas; it plays Madison Square Garden on July 6.
Ross, who has sung medleys of Supremes songs on her solo tours,
said she would be performing the songs complete for the first time
in 30 years. ``It was hard for me to step back into being part of a
group,'' she said. ``But people said it looked easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross took pains to say that the tour was not a reunion. The
backup Supremes, Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne, joined the
group in 1971 and 1973 respectively. Mary Wilson, who founded the
group as the Primettes with Ross in 1959 and had stayed in
successive lineups of the Supremes, is not part of the tour; nor is
Cindy Birdsong, who replaced the Supremes' other founding member,
Florence Ballard, in 1967. ( Ballard died in 1976.) Birdsong is now
a minister in Los Angeles. She and Wilson last sang with Ross for
the ``Motown 25'' television special in 1983. Ross had not
performed with her new Supremes until they taped an appearance on
Oprah, to be broadcast Wednesday. They will also perform together
on VH1's ``Divas 2000'' tribute to Ross, to be broadcast on
Tuesday. Further tour information is available on the tour's Web
site: www.dianarossandthesupremes.net.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Glasgow, where she was performing,
Wilson said she had not been contacted until months after she began
hearing about plans for a Supremes tour last year. After she
complained to her manager and the tour's promoters, TNA
International Ltd., Ross called her. ``I was very offended that she
had not called me in an entire year to say, `Hey, don't you want to
do this tour?''' Wilson said. ``She said we should get together,
but I said we should work out the business first.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she had been offered $2 million to join the tour,
and then $3 million, ``take it or leave it.'' ``I don't think
that's the way you approach someone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she thought she deserved a larger proportion of the
performance fees, which she believed were $15 million to $20
million. Arthur Fogel, the president of TNA, said that those
figures were incorrect but declined to specify them, saying his
company never publicly discussed deal terms. ``Over several weeks
we conducted a sincere attempt to come to terms with Mary,'' Fogel
said. ``We all tried our best, and sometimes it just doesn't
happen. We feel we were fair and reasonable and respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said: ``I've been the keeper of the Supremes for 30
years, maintaining it on such a high level that she could come back
and have a reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired these two women in the 1970s,'' she said, referring to
Long and Payne. ``I taught them, I invested in the gowns, I did
everything.'' She later sued to prevent them from touring as the
Supremes without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends said, `Girl, you should just take the
money and run,''' Wilson said. ``But my heart has been broken. I've
turned the cheek many many times. I don't need to get back in that
same situation and make myself unhappy. That would have killed me
like it killed Florence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said: ``The tour is not about me, it's not about
individuals. It really is a celebration of the music.''

 &HT;    WOMEN TELL OF BEING FORCED INTO SEXUAL SERVITUDE
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE

   WASHINGTON _ Her face obscured by a large scarf and her eyes
hidden behind dark glasses, a soft-spoken Mexican woman told a
Senate panel Tuesday of her nightmare that began when, at age 18,
she had been lured into Florida with the promise of a job. Once
there, she was brutally beaten and forced to become a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Hers seemed only a rare and horrible story in 1998 when law
enforcement officials discovered the trailer-brothels, where Maria,
as she calls herself, and 16 other women were heavily guarded and
constantly moved around Florida and South Carolina to service
migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   But such sexual servitude is no longer seen as a rarity,
witnesses told the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near
Eastern and South Asian Affairs. It is now a growing worldwide
trend which is highly profitable and rarely prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is profoundly troubling,'' William R. Yeomans, chief of
staff for the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department.
``We are talking about slavery _ slavery in its modern
manifestation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although exact numbers are not known, officials believe that at
least 700,000 women and children are transported for involuntary
prostitution worldwide each year. In the United States, the number
is thought to be 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a phenomenon that doesn't really look like anything
we've seen before,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a
conservative who called the hearing along with a liberal ally, Sen.
Paul Wellstone, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the darkest aspects of the globalization of the
world economy,'' Wellstone said in pledging to join efforts behind
legislation to crack down on traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Current laws don't have enough teeth to bring perpetrators to
justice, Yeomans and others told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, delivered through translation, Maria said she
disguised her identity out of fear of her former captives, most of
whom remain free. Six, including ringleader Rogerio Cadena, were
convicted in federal district court in West Palm Beach, Fla., last
year. But at least 10 more are thought to live near her family in
Veracruz, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia P. Coto, who is the lawyer for Maria and 13 other
victims of the Cadena trafficking ring, said current laws didn't
provide stiff enough sentences. ``Two defendants got two years for
enslaving these girls,'' said Coto, who works with the Florida
Immigrant Advocacy Center in Miami. ``That's really disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Coto read testimony from another of Cadena's victim, who told of
being 14 years old in Veracruz when a man came to her home and
convinced her that she could find a good job in the United States.
She was smuggled to Orlando, where she told of being raped
repeatedly by her smugglers and forced into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel shame,'' she read from the statement. ``I was a
decent girl in Mexico. I used to go to church with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of its tragedy, the Cadena case is considered relatively
successful because at least some of the criminals were prosecuted.
In another exceptional case, the leader of an Asian prostitution
ring pleaded guilty in Atlanta last January to forcing Asian women
and girls into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   But such examples are still the exception, both in the United
States and in other countries that are the ``destinations'' for
sexual trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Senate hearing, two Russian victims, who also kept their
identities secret, said that they had also been tricked into going
abroad in search of better jobs. One was lured to Israel, the other
to Germany, and both were forced to become prostitutes before they
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really pains me is those responsible remained completely
unpunished,'' said Marsha, from southern Russia, who was in a
brothel when German police raided it. She was never given a chance
to explain that she was there under duress. ``Instead, I was
charged with prostitution and held in a jail cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Russian authorities act to stop human trafficking, the
senators were told by Khodyreva Natalia, the director of a Crisis
Center for Women in St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they would like to see happen now, Maria told the
hearing her wish was ``to help protect young women like ourselves''
by halting the trafficking and publicizing the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let mothers know so they will protect their young children,''
she said.

BEST PROFESSIONAL ADVICE: STAY CALM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karen Oslo, a legal secretary at Ropes and Gray &UR;  &LR; in Boston, has
been checking the markets every hour on the Internet since the
Nasdaq Composite index began its wild ride two weeks ago. Despite
losses on some high-tech stocks in her portfolio and concerns about
a technology-heavy mutual fund in her 401(k) plan, she is holding
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been talking about what to do,'' she said of her
colleagues in a similar position. ``But nobody here is going to
pull their money out right now. This might change the way we do
some things in the future, but it doesn't seem smart to panic right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Oslo is a financial planner's dream. Her response to
Tuesday's stomach-turning day in the stock market _ doing nothing _
is exactly what most specialists recommend. That was hard to do as
the Nasdaq index dropped more than 13 percent at one point, only to
rally and close down less than 2 percent for the day. The Nasdaq,
home to most technology stocks, fell 7.6 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The professionals say investors should stay calm, take a deep
breath, and avoid sudden moves they may later regret. ``My main
advice would be not to panic,'' said Ned Riley, a longtime tracker
of the stock market and chief investment strategist at State Street
Global Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Like the games in the recent NCAA basketball tournament, the
stock market is virtually impossible to predict, even for the most
sophisticated among us. As a result, say the planners, investors
should avoid extreme bets and be prepared to cope with whatever the
market offers up.
</P>
<P>
   What else should investors do? A group of stock market veterans
interviewed made the following suggestions. They said you should:
</P>
<P>
   --Use the current period of volatility to reassess your
holdings. ``If the events of last two days will make it hard for
you to pay your mortgage, you don't have the right portfolio,''
said Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Scudder Kemper Investments,
a mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are inherently risky, especially in the short-term, and
investors who can't handle that risk _ either financially or
emotionally _ need to make adjustments. John Burk knows that
feeling. A local record company executive, he got out of high-tech
stocks after he was burned on one bad investment. ``I found out I
don't have the time or stomach for high-tech,'' he said. ``I leave
that for people who are willing to stay on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure you are diversified. Diversification is the golden
rule in investing. Don't have all your eggs in one basket. It is
boring advice, but sound advice, say planners. Since no one can
accurately forecast which sectors of the market will do best, it
pays to have some money in different areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Glovsky, president of Mintz Levin Financial Advisors, notes
that many old-economy stocks have rallied over the past two weeks,
even as high-tech stocks have been heading in the opposite
direction. ``This has been a perfect illustration of why you need a
balanced portfolio,'' said Glovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Planners say this is no time to bail out of technology,
altogether. Over time many technology stocks will perform
splendidly and investors want to benefit from that performance. The
trick is not to be so overweighted in technology that you subject
yourself to excessive risk.
</P>
<P>
   Planners recommend a blend of not just old- and new-economy
stocks, but small-company and large-company stocks, and domestic
and international stocks. Most mutual fund companies have
recommendations on their Web sites for how to apportion assets.
</P>
<P>
   --Think long term. Glovsky tells clients they should not be in
the stock market unless they are willing to stay invested for at
least five years. ``Anything less and you should not be in the
market in the first place,'' he said. Over most, though not all,
long stretches of time, stocks have outperformed other types of
investments. It is worth pointing out that even after the decline
of the past week, the Nasdaq index is up 62 percent over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Riley says the extreme ups and downs of the past few weeks may
have taught investors a lesson that has been forgotten in the
euphoria of the past few years: That stocks can go down and up, and
that there is risk and reward in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   That was a lesson that Jon Burk, a Boston record company
executive, learned even before he watched Tuesday's market plunge.
Like many investors trying to ride the Nasdaq's coat tails, he
acted on a tip from a friend and put $5,000 into a local computer
company startup, only to say the stock go into the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got burned, and I found out I don't have the time or the
stomach for high-tech,'' he said. ``I don't want to be in having to
check on how it's doing day by day and hour by hour. It's too much
like gambling. I leave that for people who are willing to stay on
top of it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   While he kept some money in higher-risk stocks, he switched most
of it to blue chips before the markets' wild see-sawing began early
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer the pragmatic, cautious approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's plunge may have a similar effect on legions of other
investors who have trolled the technology stocks for fast, easy
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wring out some of the casino mentality, that will be a
good thing,'' Riley said.

SCOTTSDALE BUSINESSMAN SHARES ELIAN'S DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSE CATALAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Like Elian Gonzalez, I was six when I left
Cuba alone for Miami. I arrived, not clinging to a broken raft,
thank God, but aboard a Pan Am prop aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   I was alone. My parents could not afford to take care of both my
2-year-old brother and me on Papa's $20 a week and Mama's
occasional sewing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1950, nine years before Fidel Castro came to power, my
family's life in Havana was not too different than it is today for
most people in Cuba. If you're born poor, you die poor.
</P>
<P>
   My parents hoped that by sending me to Miami to live with my
``rich'' aunt and uncle, I would find a better life. I remember
Mama and Papa crying at the airport, repeating, ``Pepito, you'll
have a better life there.'' At six, I did not know what a better
life meant, particularly without my parents.
</P>
<P>
   All I remember about those days in Miami was going to the beach
practically every day, which I loved for about one week. ``We've
much better beaches in Cuba,'' I told everyone who would listen.
Most of all, I hated the food. Hamburgers and french fries was
about all I ate.
</P>
<P>
   I remember crying day and night while my aunt and uncle tried to
understand this Cuban kid who spoke only Spanish and refused to say
even ``yes,'' much less ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   They would take me to the movies to watch a comedy and I would
cry. At the restaurants I would scream. In the supermarket, I would
throw temper tantrums. I was far from adorable yet I knew exactly
what I was doing. I wanted to go home to my parents.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, my frustrated aunt and uncle sent me back to
Havana, suntan and all. Likely as it will be with Elian, I was
happy to return to Cuba. I was back to our one-room home in a
run-down building in Old Havana, near prostitutes and pimps. The
toilet and shower, which we shared with five other families, were
down the hall, just where I fondly remembered. I could go back to
eating ``arroz con frijoles,'' and from time to time a piece of
chicken. I was back in heaven, my heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later I was longing for hamburgers and fries, for
carefree days on the beaches of Miami. For a toilet I did not have
to share with 20 people, especially when I had to go really bad. It
took me this long to admit that this Havana I returned to was not
as great as I remembered. I had had a taste of life in America and
I wanted it back!
</P>
<P>
   I started a plan. In school, I would be the best student of the
English language, which was a challenge. I began to write nice
letters to my aunt and uncle, using the English I was slowly
acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, I started working days to save money and going to school
at night. I kept up with life in America watching ``I Love Lucy''
on TV. It was not exactly as I remembered life in America but
that's what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, Castro came to power on New Year's Day.
Everyone thought our worries were over. He promised us poor Cubans
a life of dignity and freedom. No more poverty, too, my parents
believed. I still wanted to leave Cuba. To that Bali Hai I called
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The process of leaving Castro's Cuba became a horrendous ordeal.
My parents decided I needed to leave first because, at 15, I was
approaching military age. Mama arranged for a religious group to
assist with the expenses, which for us was insurmountable. They
coordinated all of the contacts with the Cuban and U.S.
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Every step of the way the Communist bureaucracy made sure we
felt like outcasts. ``Gusanos _'' worms _ they called us. Standing
in long lines at the passport office, my mother and I endured angry
protesters who dared us to return their insults, knowing full well
that, if we did, we would be automatically jailed for disrupting
the peace and banned from leaving the island. The lines and insults
were repeated every step of the way, including the KLM airline
ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, at age 16, I finally left Cuba to re-join my aunt and
uncle, who were now living in Puerto Rico, a U.S. possession. I was
still without my parents, but by now I appreciated the opportunity
they and the American government were offering me.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about Elian's ordeal, his mother's brave attempt to get
him out of Cuba, and the dispute between both sides of the same
family, it is difficult for me to know what is right.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I do know. At age 6, all I wanted was to go back to my
parents. Probably I would do the same if I were age 6 again. In
retrospect, however, I can understand why so many Cuban-Americans
feel so strongly against returning Elian to Cuba, even to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, when I was 6 all I wanted was to return to the love of my
parents and young brother. I wish I could have understood what a
mistake I was making, but I was only a small child.
</P>
<P>
   Like me, I am certain Elian, will yearn to come back to
hamburgers and fries soon enough. Like me, he will someday
appreciate the magnitude of his American aunt and uncle's efforts
to keep him here. He will someday thank the American people for
trying to do ``the right thing.'' Let's pray that if Elian is
returned to Cuba he will not be so desperate to take the same route
his mother and countless others have attempted.
</P>
<P>
   I am forever in debt to this country for giving me so many
opportunities. Most of all, I am grateful to my parents for their
selflessness that allowed them to give me up twice so that I could
have a chance for a better life. &QL;

MICROSOFT CASE STRENGTHENS ROLE OF REGULATORS, COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Software is no longer untouchable here.
</P>
<P>
   The government's stunning win in Round 2 of the Microsoft Corp.
trial shows that antitrust regulators can now reach into the heart
of the software world _ a capability that was in doubt when the
trial began 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And it topples the notion that software is too complex for
judges to scrutinize. In 1998, a panel of the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia famously wrote in a previous Microsoft
case that ``the limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech
product designs'' should make judges ``wary'' of second-guessing
software engineers.
</P>
<P>
   But Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson brushed aside
that concern, issuing a broad ruling Monday that analyzed the
software industry at length and concluding that Microsoft's
software design had a harmful effect on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely the ruling will embolden antitrust regulators at the
Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to become more
aggressive and to challenge other high-tech companies, several
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That stance contrasts with the Justice Department's preferred
mode of action only five years ago, when it was less likely to take
on the risks of litigation in order to enforce the antitrust laws.
More often, the department sought to alter a company's behavior by
settling cases out of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you'll see in the near term is an increased willingness
to litigate and a harder line in negotiating,'' said Thane Scott,
an antitrust lawyer with Palmer &AMP; Dodge in Boston. ``Those of us
who go and meet with these agencies following one of these
victories see that you face a different group across the table,
different in that they can point to a ready example of success and
take more leverage in negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust regulators not only police anticompetitive behavior by
companies, but try to block or alter the terms of mergers that
would harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 victory energized the Federal Trade Commission and made
it more aggressive, said Scott. In a case with local impact, the
FTC that year successfully went to trial to block the proposed $4
billion merger of Office Depot Inc. by Westborough-based Staples
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest Microsoft victory, ``it looks like the high-tech
industry, like every industry, can be subjected effectively to the
antitrust laws, but we'll see,'' said Ed Black, president of the
Computer and Communications Industry Association. The group favors
the toughest sanction against Microsoft: breaking the company up.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case is only one area where government has stepped
with new engery into business regulation and antitrust enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Congress was derided as behind the times when a large
bank and a giant insurer, Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.,
announced a merger that was partly illegal under federal law at the
time. Congress had tried unsuccessfully for two decades to update
the law, which generally barred mergers among banking, insurance
and brokerage firms, even though those combinations are common in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Citicorp merger was seen as an example of markets racing
ahead of the government's ability to regulate. But last year,
lawmakers finally updated the banking laws.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress could approve sweeping new regulations for
the managed health care industry. And it has begun grappling with
rules of the road for the Internet, taking on such questions as
whether to tax online sales and whether digital signatures have the
same legal force as traditional signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that judges should stay out of the software business
has been prevalent enough that Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law
professor whom Jackson asked to provide guidance in the Microsoft
case, went out of his way to urge Jackson not to be afraid to
scrutinize software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apparent feeling among a number of courts and commentators
is that (software) code is different: that the task of evaluating
design decisions involved in technological products is uniquely
beyond the ken of federal courts,'' Lessig wrote in a February
brief for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is a mistake to fetishize code this way,'' Lessig
said, adding that software is too crucial to society for courts to
turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson appears to have listened to Lessig's advice, as his
ruling Monday discussed how Microsoft linked one of its products,
its Windows operating system, to another, its Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson issued broad rulings and analyses of software markets,
said Scott, ``to convince the appellate court that, `I (Jackson)
understand the markets, I understand the products, I understand the
law, and I am capable of developing a solution.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have moved quickly to create a role for themselves
after Jackson's ruling. Leaders of the Senate's judiciary and
commerce committees said separately in the past two days that they
would hold hearings on the public policy implications of various
penalties that Jackson might apply to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the role of Congress to second-guess or to
critique a judge's decision,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of
Arizona, who leads the Senate Commerce Committee, said on the NBC
program ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``I think it is the role of Congress to assess two
things: One, the impact on the consumer of such actions that might
have to be taken on the part of Microsoft; and two, what is the
impact on this incredible engine that's driving America's
economy?''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said it was premature to talk
about the most serious penalty: breaking the company into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that any remedy of that kind makes sense for
people to be talking about,'' Gates said on the ``Early Show'' on
CBS. ``Even taking what the district judge said, that kind of
remedy is not resposive to what he talks about there. So, I think
it's definitely reckless for there to be talk of that.''

SOME CUBANS SEE DISGRACE IN ELIAN PROTECTION EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In Spanish, in English, and in a smattering of both, the
voice of reason came through over cups of thick Cuban coffee
Tuesday: Sad is sad, but the law in a democratic society is the
law.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, why many of the exiles who have remade Miami
in their own image risked everything to come to America, and why
they continue coming.
</P>
<P>
   As Jose de Junco, 78, explained, throwing up his arms in
exclamation as well as exasperation, ``Of course we'll accept what
the court says. We are in a country governed by laws we can
understand. But it is a shame, and I am ashamed of the whole free
world for playing into Castro's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the retired de Junco, none of the men and women nursing
cafe con leches or snacking on sugar-glazed pastries liked the idea
of sending any boy back to Cuba, especially into Fidel Castro's
eager arms. But the late-morning patrons at a popular Little Havana
cafe liked the idea of being viewed by the rest of the country as
immigrant ingrates, as more loyal to anti-Castro ideology than to
their adopted homeland, even less.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before an angry crowd Tuesday pushed through a
metal barricade and surrounded the house where the 6-year-old at
the center of the custody storm has been staying with relatives
since he was pulled from the sea in November, they cafe patrons
said they would watch little Elian Gonzalez return to his father in
Cuba with great sorrow, but without the violence that some in their
community have threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The hardliners, the ones who turn out to protest Cuban bands
performing in Miami and shout down politicians who dare speak
against their no-trade-with-Cuba cause, are in fact a minority of
Cuban-Americans, community observers said. They number no more than
7,000, a tiny and mostly older segment of the 800,000 or so Cubans
in Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates, like those at the cafe Tuesday, tend to skew
younger, although they cut across demographic and economic lines in
a place where the Hispanic community alone is more diverse than
some other entire cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is so large that you can have a small percentage
turn out and still get attention,'' said Lisandro Perez, director
of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International
University. ``It doesn't take much to surround a house in Little
Havana.''
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez's small entourage in
Miami seemingly imminent, negotiations over the logistics of
delivering Elian to his father broke down Tuesday. Led by his
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's Miami relatives are appealing
a federal court ruling. That decision upheld an Immigration and
Naturalization Service order that Elian be sent home to Cuba. In
the interim, the relatives have agreed to give Juan Gonzalez
``temporary care'' of his son if he promises to remain in the
country until the court rules.
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house, where demonstrators briefly and
erroneously feared federal authorities were about to take Elian
away, real estate broker Rene Iturrey tried to sum up his side of
the debate, an argument that emphasizes non-violence until the
possibility of defeat is considered. ``We're not criminals,'' he
said, surveying the hundreds praying aloud for Elian. ``We want the
court to decide. . .If federal marshals show up here, there will be
dead old ladies and children standing in front of them, but they'll
have to get past me first.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a short drive but an ideological chasm away, at the
Versailles cafe on Calle Ocho, Little Havana's main street, a
businesswoman who identified herself only as Maria shook her head
at such inflamed rhetoric. She said she loathed the image of the
Cuban-American community as ultra-conservative extremists, and that
she was as shocked as anyone by the sometimes ugly statements
coming from Elian's most ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be very emotional, but also very American,'' said Maria,
54. ``The thought of that child going back _ and to what, except to
be used as a puppet _ breaks my heart. But absolutely he should go
back if that's what is decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Maria, whose parents sent her to Miami alone as a teenager
and joined her later when they could, many Cuban-American exiles
understand almost innately that any chance at freedom must be
taken. Of course a boy should be with his father, they said, but a
boy should also be free.
</P>
<P>
   Their words, political sounding, were also personal. At one time
or another, most of them have left loved ones behind or been left
behind. They gave up good jobs and grandparents, they said, home
ownership and happy homes, to start anew with nothing but the
certainty that they would fare better under democratic rule than
under a communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gonzalez household, no relation to the family fighting
over custody of Elian, was divided over whether the boy found
clinging to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day should be repatriated
to Cuba if the court orders it. Nelson Gonzalez, 48, said yes.
Maria Gonzalez, 45, said no. But both agreed a good father would
let his son stay in this country. They themselves said they came to
Miami 15 years ago for the sake of their own children, two
daughters now 19 and 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``A father who wants a better life for his son does the right
thing for his son,'' said Maria Gonzalez, a secretary who, like her
husband, was a professor of medicine in Cuba. ``In Cuba we are
something. Here we are nothing. But we are better off here.'' Added
Nelson Gonzalez, now a video game repairman, ``It's the point of
coming here. It's liberty of expression and action. . .The father
deserves his day in court, but I feel sorry for the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans and Cuban-Americans in Miami are particularly
interested in hearing what Juan Miguel Gonzalez has to say for
himself and Elian once he is on US soil. For now, they believe, he
is speaking mostly for Castro, a mouthpiece for a country that gags
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   And their hearts are not with him. Almost everyone interviewed
in turn asked the same questions: Where was the father when Elian
was recovering in the hospital? Why was he not at his son's side
all these months? They insisted it could not have been Castro, who
would have seen a public relations coup in a father's racing to
Miami, then voluntarily returning to Cuba with the son his former
wife had taken without telling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father didn't care in the beginning, how do we know he
cares now?'' said Norma de Junco, retired like her husband, and
living in the United States for 30 years, 10 of them in Miami.
``What he is saying is what Castro says to say. In Cuba, the chief
of the family is Castro. I brought my two children here for
freedom, Elian's mother brought him here for freedom. The father
should know that, even if the court doesn't.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven months before Election Day, the struggle over
expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs for the elderly is
escalating, with both parties maneuvering furiously on an issue
that matters, deeply, to a critical group of voters.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over the Republican budget resolution began in the
Senate Tuesday, for example, Democrats were pushing for an
amendment that would require the creation of a Medicare drug
benefit before any tax cut could take effect.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared that the amendment was ``good policy,
the will of the American people, and addresses a longstanding unmet
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans asserted that, as a spokesman for the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, put it, ``Republicans are committed to
providing this benefit,'' and would reserve the money to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In poll after poll, expanding Medicare to cover prescription
drug benefits for the nation's elderly _ a third of whom lack any
drug coverage at all _ ranks near the top of voters' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Border wars over prescription drugs are erupting to the north.
Democratic candidates for Congress have been traveling to Canada to
underscore its lower drug prices; a coalition led by the
pharmaceutical industry is countering with a major advertising
campaign on the failures of the Canadian health care system. ``They
wait longer for new cures,'' an announcer warns, in television ads
that began running last week across the northern United States _ a
clear reaction to the public's concern over drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the political pressure for legislation this year is
great, according to a variety of analysts and politicians. But so
is the level of partisan mistrust on the issue, as well as the
philosophical disagreement over how to deal with it. As a result,
many politicians say the odds are still against a benefit being
enacted this year, but as one administration official put it,
``it's such a hot issue, and in an election year on a hot issue
things can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have
been campaigning for prescription drug benefits for more than a
year, and the rhetoric is expected to escalate, with a series of
speeches and events planned for this month's congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the single most potent issue we have back home,''
declares Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, who heads the House Democratic
Caucus. ``People really do care about this and the Republicans are
clearly not going to do anything of consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, leaders in the Republican-controlled House are
scrambling to produce a prescription drug plan of their own, having
already set aside $40 billion over 5 years in their recently passed
budget resolution for Medicare ``reform'' and a drug benefit. The
Senate Finance Committee, whose Republican chairman, William V.
Roth Jr. of Delaware, is in a tough race for re-election, is in the
early stages of writing a bill to tackle the issue. And the
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush promises to address prescription
drugs when he gives a series of health care speeches this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In their more partisan moments, Democrats assert that
Republicans are simply looking to neutralize the prescription drug
issue; Republicans counter that some Democrats want a political
weapon, not a law.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, who heads the House Republican
Conference, declared of his Democratic colleagues, ``I'm afraid
this is another one of those issues where they don't want good
policy, they want politics,'' adding that he nevertheless remained
optimistic that a law would pass.
</P>
<P>
   The politics are, in fact, compelling to both parties. In the
last presidential election, Americans over 65 voted at twice the
rate of 18-to-24-year-olds. They are heavily represented in the big
states that are expected to be battlegrounds this fall, including
Pennsylvania, Illinois and Florida. Their concerns are important to
their middle-aged children, many of whom not only worry about their
parents but are close enough to their own retirement to take the
issue personally, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   And neither party can take the retiree vote for granted. Long
considered a dependable part of the Democratic coalition, the
over-60 vote was carried by the Republicans in the last three
congressional elections _ by a margin of 10 percentage points in
1998, according to exit polls. (Clinton and Gore have fared better,
carrying the votes of older Americans in the last two presidential
elections.)
</P>
<P>
   When a net pickup of just six seats could give the Democrats
control of the House, some strategists say they cannot afford to
lose the elderly vote again _ certainly not by the margin they lost
it in 1998, when it may well have kept them from regaining control
of the House, said Mark Gersh, a Democratic analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The economic and health policy implications of the issue are
also powerful, at a time when both the costs and the use of
pharmaceuticals keep climbing. Prescription drugs have become a
prime tool in treating many of the ailments of aging, from high
blood pressure to osteoporosis; the elderly account for 13 percent
of the population but more than a third of the nation's drug
expenditures. Yet Medicare, developed 35 years ago for a profoundly
different era of medicine, generally fails to cover outpatient
prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   While two-thirds of the elderly have some form of drug coverage
through employer-sponsored plans, health maintenance organizations
or other means, such coverage ``varies widely across plans, is
often limited and is expected to decline in the future,'' as the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group,
recently put it. Lawmakers say they routinely hear of elderly
constituents straining _ and often failing _ to meet their drug
bills, as well as the other costs of living.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to enact a prescription drug benefit was also
increased by last week's rosy report on the financial health of the
Medicare hospital trust fund; one of the major arguments against
new benefits has been that Medicare could barely cover the existing
ones. ``I think the report adds a great deal of momentum for a
prescription drug benefit within Medicare,'' said Rep. Benjamin L.
Cardin, D-Md., on the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, the prescription drug issue is no longer
simply a sideshow to the debate over restructuring and modernizing
Medicare, which it appeared to be 18 months ago. In fact, some
lawmakers worry that it will be far easier and politically
appealing to enact a new drug benefit than to restructure Medicare,
and thus the effort to make Medicare more efficient and financially
solvent before the baby boomers retire will be left to languish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do prescription drugs and don't do reform, you'll never
get reform,'' said Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., who headed a
bipartisan commission on Medicare that ended in a deadlock last
year. ``It's the classic dessert before the meal analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan links drug benefits with a broader
restructuring of the program, and Republican officials have long
been committed to ``modernizing'' Medicare, although those elements
could be pared down in the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the forces pushing legislators to act this year, there
are huge hurdles. The task of creating a prescription drug benefit
touches on some of the most profound disagreements in health
policy: Should the benefit be universally available and subsidized,
as other core benefits are under Medicare, or essentially directed
to low-income people, as some Republicans have suggested? How much
of a role should the federal government play in designing,
delivering and regulating the benefit _ and how much of a role
should the private insurance industry play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be legislative action this year,'' said
Cardin. ``Whether it will be enacted into law is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Democratic strategists say that with the House
so close within their grasp, it does not make sense to settle this
year for a bare-bones benefit. The political calculus, though, is
complicated: Clinton, looking toward his legacy, has one set of
interests when it comes to the decision to compromise. Gore and
House Democrats, looking toward the potential of a new
administration, may have different views. ``This is not the year
when Democrats ought to be accepting half a loaf on any important
policy prescription,'' said one Democratic strategist on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another big variable is the pharmaceutical industry, which has
been warning for months now that any new prescription drug program
that relies on the government to hold down prices will have dire
consequences for research. Now, in the face of all this momentum in
Congress to act, the industry not only has to decide what the best
deal is, but when to try to strike it, which means assessing the
odds of a Democratic House and a Democratic administration next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesmen assert that Democrats have been trying to
``demonize'' them for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In their campaign to highlight the burden of prescription drug
costs on the nation's elderly, some House Democrats have begun
issuing studies suggesting that pets get a better deal than
retirees on the cost of some medications. Such efforts clearly
touch a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, president and chief executive officer of
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said, ``The
sponsors of this so-called study know that it costs far more to
develop a drug for a person than for a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In short, the political wars over prescription drugs rage on,
with an avid audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely important reference point to older
voters, and remember, it's a big change in the debate,'' said
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. ``For the better part of the
last decade, we've been talking about how to cut back on benefits
to seniors in terms of Medicare and Social Security. This is the
first debate in a while about how we extend new benefits to older
Americans. And seniors are very receptive to that.''

AUSTRALIANS CLONE NERVE CELLS IN LAB EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In a step toward harnessing human embryo cells to repair damaged
brains and other organs, Australian scientists say they have coaxed
uncommitted embryonic ``stem cells'' to turn into nerve cells in a
laboratory dish.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic demonstration shows how quickly scientists are
learning how to direct development of these stem cells, taken from
days-old human embryos, into different types of cells that could
become new body parts or used to treat neurodegenerative diseases
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   One US stem cell expert said the report from the Monash
Institute of Reproduction and Development ``is exciting because
there has been a question about whether stem cells can
differentiate into useful cells in a culture dish.'' The American
researcher, James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin, said
that he and others had done similar work but hadn't yet published
it.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells in the developing embryo and fetus become bone or
liver or skin or other kinds of cells in response to signals from
their surroundings. Scientists are learning how to direct their
development in the laboratory by altering the fluids they're
cultured in.
</P>
<P>
   Although they're believed to have enormous potential for medical
benefits, stem cells are controversial because they must be
obtained from human embryos only a few days old, and removing them
destroys the embryos. The federal government has proposed
guidelines allowing government funding for research applying stem
cell technology to medicine, but would not allow federal funding
for obtaining the cells: that would have to be done with private
money.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells could also be harvested from embryos created for the
purpose by nuclear transplantation, the method that generated Dolly
the lamb from cells of an adult sheep. The resulting embryo and its
cells would be compatible with the donor, so that cells taken from
the embryo could be grown into desired tissues and used to repair
disease or injury in the donor, without fear of immune rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``therapeutic cloning,'' the technique is currently
outlawed in Great Britain but news reports this week said that a
government panel of experts will soon recommend legalizing it.
``That report was sheer speculation,'' said Ruth Deech, who heads
Britain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in a
telephone interview. A spokesman for the authority said that the
advisory panel is expected to issue a recommendation within a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael West, CEO of Advanced Cell Technology in Shrewsbury,
Mass., said that if the report from Britain is true, ``they are
brave souls and are to be commended for leading on this'' issue.
``They have done a lot of research into the potential uses of
therapeutic cloning and have been weighing the ethical
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   ACT is pursuing therapeutic cloning using private funds, and
says it hopes to develop the technology to repair many different
kinds of body parts.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian research did not use therapeutic cloning but
instead apparently used embryos that had been created during in
vitro fertilization treatment, but were not implanted into the
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work was done at the Medical University of
Singapore. A US scientist, Dr. John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, speculated that the embryos that provided
the stem cells were obtained in Singapore, as that type of embryo
research is outlawed in Australia. Then the cells were flown to
Australia to be studied in the lab, Gearhart speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Gearhart downplayed the significance of the Monash research,
saying that US scientists ``have gone far beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is cutting-edge in the field now, Gearhart said in an
interview, ``is putting these cells into animal models and getting
them to function. We have been talking about this stuff for the
past nine months at different meetings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments have already shown, said Gearhart, that nerve cells
derived from embryonic stem cells can be implanted into the brain
or spinal cords of animals ``and they will differentiate into the
appropriate kind of nerve cell for that region.'' These findings
suggest that the cues from the implanted cells' surroundings are of
crucial importance in determining the stem cells' fate, he said.

SWITZERLAND PROBES ILLICIT ACCOUNTS LINKED TO LATE NIGERIAN RULER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss authorities have brought the first charges in a
case involving at least $654 million in bank accounts here that
were connected to the late Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha, his
family and associates.
</P>
<P>
   A businessman was charged last week with faking documents to set
up an account in a Geneva bank for the Abacha family, the city
prosecutor, Bernard Bertossa, confirmed Tuesday. Under Swiss legal
rules, names of the accused are kept confidential but people
following the case identified the businessman as Dharam Vir, of New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's new democratically elected government is seeking
return of the money, scattered in 140 accounts in 11 banks in
Geneva and Zurich, contending that Abacha looted the money from his
country. Swiss officials have frozen the accounts and are carrying
out a criminal inquiry to pinpoint how the money was transferred
out of Nigeria and into Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Vir supposedly used false documentation saying the money was to
pay Russia for building a steel plant in Nigeria to divert an
undisclosed sum of money from Nigerian government accounts to the
Swiss accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount in the accounts uncovered so far is even more
than the most notorious previous similar case _ the $550 million
that the longtime Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos hid through
a series of foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The impoverished Philippines began a 12-year effort in 1986 to
regain the money said to have been stripped from the country's
coffers and concealed in Swiss accounts. Beginning in the
mid-1990s, an embarrassed Switzerland changed its banking rules.
Swiss banks now are not allowed to accept money from foreign
dictators, and they are required to ascertain the source of large
amounts deposited.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha is reported to have stowed the money during the five
years he was Nigeria's dictator, before dying at age 54 in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities say they are planning further indictments and
have asked Nigeria and other European countries for legal help in
tracking down suspects who live outside of Switzerland, Bertossa
said. Although he declined to name the European countries,
plundered funds have also turned up in Luxembourg, where they are
frozen, and in Belgium. Lawyers are also trying to block funds in
Germany and suspect there is additional money in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person is charged for the moment, but we expect to bring
money laundering charges against more people,'' Bertossa said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the Abacha hoard has provoked an outcry in official
Switzerland, with its finance minister telling Parliament in March
that he was furious to find out that such accounts existed and that
the scandal could damage the country's image as a financial center.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial portion of the funds were deposited in
Switzerland's two biggest commercial banks, Credit Suisse and UBS.
In 1995, two years after Abacha took power, Credit Suisse is said
to have accepted $200 million in the name of Abacha's son,
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian government contends that Abacha systematically
embezzled money from the country's central bank through a system of
false invoices. Enrico Monfrini, Nigeria's lawyer in Geneva,
contends that the money was withdrawn from the central bank and
deposited in local banks or offshore companies controlled by the
Abacha family in a scheme orchestrated by the country's former
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Documents handed over to Swiss authorities indicate that Abacha
personally authorized the transfer of sums of money to overseas
accounts in his name and the names of 14 others, Monfrini said. In
addition, there was a network of fictitious accounts, commissions
and kickbacks that helped to funnel as much as $2.2 billion out of
Abacha's oil-rich but cash-poor country, Monfrini contends.
</P>
<P>
   While many documents have been destroyed, Nigerian officials
produced enough material to persuade Swiss authorities to help
track down the missing money. Last October, the Swiss froze an
initial $550 million and turned up the additional $104 million
after inquiries. Making their announcement in January that the
accounts were blocked, the Swiss authorities noted that they
expected that more money could be found.

BAY STATE TO SEND MCCAIN, BUSH DELEGATES TO GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HILLARY CHABOT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor A. Paul Cellucci and the McCain 2000 campaign
Tuesday reached an agreement concerning the Massachusetts
delegation to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain won the Massachusetts presidential primary
March 7 and is therefore entitled to all 37 of the state's
delegates. Yet the McCain campaign agreed to send seven Bush
supporters as part of the number.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Lt. Governor Jane Swift will be two of the Bush
advocates attending the convention. They are expected to be picked
by the Republican State Committee in early June.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining five Bush delegates will be elected, along with 25
McCain delegates, at local caucuses April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Inman, head of McCain's Massachusetts branch, will chair
the Massachusetts delegation. The Republican National Convention
takes place in Philidelphia July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cellucci and Inman said the compromise creates a stronger
Republican party within the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal allows us to move on and focus on the important
business of electing a Republican president next fall,'' Cellucci
said in a written statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci was in China last week on a trade mission, he
called McCain to work out a deal with the delegates, Cellucci's top
political advisor Rob Gray said. Gray spent the rest of the week
working with McCain national political director John Weaver in
order to craft the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's convention delegates can influence platform issues
where McCain differs from Bush, such as campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican party will announce similar deals Wednesday that
have been worked out in Vermont, Conneticut and Rhode Island, all
states where McCain carried the primary.

Singapore. A US scientist, Dr. John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, speculated that the embryos that provided
the stem cells were obtained in Singapore, as that type of embryo
research is outlawed in Australia. Then the cells were flown to
Australia to be studied in the lab, Gearhart speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Gearhart downplayed the significance of the Monash research,
saying that US scientists ``have gone far beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is cutting-edge in the field now, Gearhart said in an
interview, ``is putting these cells into animal models and getting
them to function. We have been talking about this stuff for the
past nine months at different meetings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments have already shown, said Gearhart, that nerve cells
derived from embryonic stem cells can be implanted into the brain
or spinal cords of animals ``and they will differentiate into the
appropriate kind of nerve cell for that region.'' These findings
suggest that the cues from the implanted cells' surroundings are of
crucial importance in determining the stem cells' fate, he said.

<P>
   MIAMI _ In Spanish, in English, and in a smattering of both, the
voice of reason came through over cups of thick Cuban coffee
Tuesday: Sad is sad, but the law in a democratic society is the
law.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, why many of the exiles who have remade Miami
in their own image risked everything to come to America, and why
they continue coming.
</P>
<P>
   As Jose de Junco, 78, explained, throwing up his arms in
exclamation as well as exasperation, ``Of course we'll accept what
the court says. We are in a country governed by laws we can
understand. But it is a shame, and I am ashamed of the whole free
world for playing into Castro's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the retired de Junco, none of the men and women nursing
cafe con leches or snacking on sugar-glazed pastries liked the idea
of sending any boy back to Cuba, especially into Fidel Castro's
eager arms. But the late-morning patrons at a popular Little Havana
cafe liked the idea of being viewed by the rest of the country as
immigrant ingrates, as more loyal to anti-Castro ideology than to
their adopted homeland, even less.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before an angry crowd Tuesday pushed through a
metal barricade and surrounded the house where the 6-year-old at
the center of the custody storm has been staying with relatives
since he was pulled from the sea in November, they cafe patrons
said they would watch little Elian Gonzalez return to his father in
Cuba with great sorrow, but without the violence that some in their
community have threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The hardliners, the ones who turn out to protest Cuban bands
performing in Miami and shout down politicians who dare speak
against their no-trade-with-Cuba cause, are in fact a minority of
Cuban-Americans, community observers said. They number no more than
7,000, a tiny and mostly older segment of the 800,000 or so Cubans
in Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates, like those at the cafe Tuesday, tend to skew
younger, although they cut across demographic and economic lines in
a place where the Hispanic community alone is more diverse than
some other entire cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is so large that you can have a small percentage
turn out and still get attention,'' said Lisandro Perez, director
of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International
University. ``It doesn't take much to surround a house in Little
Havana.''
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez's small entourage in
Miami seemingly imminent, negotiations over the logistics of
delivering Elian to his father broke down Tuesday. Led by his
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's Miami relatives are appealing
a federal court ruling. That decision upheld an Immigration and
Naturalization Service order that Elian be sent home to Cuba. In
the interim, the relatives have agreed to give Juan Gonzalez
``temporary care'' of his son if he promises to remain in the
country until the court rules.
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house, where demonstrators briefly and
erroneously feared federal authorities were about to take Elian
away, real estate broker Rene Iturrey tried to sum up his side of
the debate, an argument that emphasizes non-violence until the
possibility of defeat is considered. ``We're not criminals,'' he
said, surveying the hundreds praying aloud for Elian. ``We want the
court to decide. . .If federal marshals show up here, there will be
dead old ladies and children standing in front of them, but they'll
have to get past me first.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a short drive but an ideological chasm away, at the
Versailles cafe on Calle Ocho, Little Havana's main street, a
businesswoman who identified herself only as Maria shook her head
at such inflamed rhetoric. She said she loathed the image of the
Cuban-American community as ultra-conservative extremists, and that
she was as shocked as anyone by the sometimes ugly statements
coming from Elian's most ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be very emotional, but also very American,'' said Maria,
54. ``The thought of that child going back _ and to what, except to
be used as a puppet _ breaks my heart. But absolutely he should go
back if that's what is decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Maria, whose parents sent her to Miami alone as a teenager
and joined her later when they could, many Cuban-American exiles
understand almost innately that any chance at freedom must be
taken. Of course a boy should be with his father, they said, but a
boy should also be free.
</P>
<P>
   Their words, political sounding, were also personal. At one time
or another, most of them have left loved ones behind or been left
behind. They gave up good jobs and grandparents, they said, home
ownership and happy homes, to start anew with nothing but the
certainty that they would fare better under democratic rule than
under a communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gonzalez household, no relation to the family fighting
over custody of Elian, was divided over whether the boy found
clinging to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day should be repatriated
to Cuba if the court orders it. Nelson Gonzalez, 48, said yes.
Maria Gonzalez, 45, said no. But both agreed a good father would
let his son stay in this country. They themselves said they came to
Miami 15 years ago for the sake of their own children, two
daughters now 19 and 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``A father who wants a better life for his son does the right
thing for his son,'' said Maria Gonzalez, a secretary who, like her
husband, was a professor of medicine in Cuba. ``In Cuba we are
something. Here we are nothing. But we are better off here.'' Added
Nelson Gonzalez, now a video game repairman, ``It's the point of
coming here. It's liberty of expression and action. . .The father
deserves his day in court, but I feel sorry for the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans and Cuban-Americans in Miami are particularly
interested in hearing what Juan Miguel Gonzalez has to say for
himself and Elian once he is on US soil. For now, they believe, he
is speaking mostly for Castro, a mouthpiece for a country that gags
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   And their hearts are not with him. Almost everyone interviewed
in turn asked the same questions: Where was the father when Elian
was recovering in the hospital? Why was he not at his son's side
all these months? They insisted it could not have been Castro, who
would have seen a public relations coup in a father's racing to
Miami, then voluntarily returning to Cuba with the son his former
wife had taken without telling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father didn't care in the beginning, how do we know he
cares now?'' said Norma de Junco, retired like her husband, and
living in the United States for 30 years, 10 of them in Miami.
``What he is saying is what Castro says to say. In Cuba, the chief
of the family is Castro. I brought my two children here for
freedom, Elian's mother brought him here for freedom. The father
should know that, even if the court doesn't.''

 &HT;    AirTran, Northwest in feud over service to Minneapolis
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The prospect of lower airfares between Atlanta and
Minneapolis is in limbo amid a feud between AirTran Airways and
Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Discount carrier AirTran announced plans last month to start
service on the route in June at fares below those currently charged
by Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   But those plans are on hold because of what AirTran calls
``anti-competitive'' tactics by Minneapolis-based Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran says Northwest is switching to bigger planes on the
Atlanta-Minneapolis route, boosting its average daily seat count by
about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of increase goes well beyond reasonable
competition,'' AirTran marketing director Tad Hutcheson said.
``It's almost as many seats as we were going to put in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   He said AirTran has been forced to ``reconsider the economic
conditions'' on the route but may still go ahead with the flights
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest denies the move to use bigger Airbus A320s and Boeing
757s for some Atlanta flights was aimed at AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is, quit whining and start flying,'' spokeswoman
Kathy Peach said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Northwest decided to change planes on the route before
AirTran announced its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson said AirTran was openly wooed for months by local
officials in Minneapolis, adding that Northwest knew the smaller
carrier was likely to launch service this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The case reflects the broader issue of fair competition between
giant carriers and small discounters.
</P>
<P>
   Small carriers, including AirTran, have long complained that
mega-carriers add capacity to soak up demand, taking short-term
losses if necessary to protect their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Transportation Department developed guidelines and
penalties governing fair competitive practices, but they have yet
to be enacted. AirTran has lodged fresh complaints to the DOT over
the Minneapolis situation, and this week executives of the carrier
met with the Minnesota attorney general at his request.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest claims it's switching to bigger planes to better
compete with Atlanta-based Delta, the only other nonstop carrier on
the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me,'' said Peach. ``Delta is a far greater competitor in
that market than AirTran ever would be.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested AirTran's complaints might be a case of sour
grapes. Peach said AirTran executives recently approached Northwest
about joining its multicarrier marketing alliance but went home
empty-handed.

 &HT;    ELIAN TALKS BOG DOWN - AGAIN; PROTESTERS VOW TO KEEP HIM IN U.S.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The city swirled with rumors and uncertainty Tuesday as
negotiators failed to reach agreement over the fate of 6-year-old
Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez and once again postponed their talks.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors briefly toppled police barriers outside the home
where the boy has been living with his Miami relatives, and one of
Elian's chief caregivers, his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez,
collapsed in emotional exhaustion and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boy's father was issued a travel visa in Cuba but
continued to say he would not come to the United States without a
guarantee he would be given custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's Washington D.C.
attorney, Gregory Craig, reportedly flew to Havana to try to smooth
out arrangements for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   But a conclusion to the long-running saga remained elusive, as
both sides refused to budge on demands that complicated the
transfer of the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Miami relatives who want to keep Elian in this
country said they do not want to turn the boy over to his father
until he is examined by a panel of psychologists who would
determine what is best for Elian. They also want a promise that the
boy won't be returned to Cuba until their appeal of a court ruling
can be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials refused to grant those conditions, however,
insisting they have the authority to turn the boy over to his
father once he arrives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the government continues to be on how best to
accomplish the reunion of Elian with his father,'' said Robert
Wallis, head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's
Miami office.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis and attorneys for the Miami relatives agreed to take a
one-day break Wednesday and resume their talks Thursday morning.
They have failed to reach agreement despite four full days of
negotiations stretching over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The possible visit by Elian's father seemed to be the spur that
might break the deadlock, although the visit was still up in the
air late Tuesday. The Cuban government has said that Gonzalez would
live in the home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area during
the visit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wanting a guarantee that Gonzalez will be given
custody of his son, Cuban officials want travel visas for 22 other
people, including Elian's classmates and a team of psychologists,
as well as Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials in Havana issued visas Tuesday for
Gonzalez, his second wife, their infant son, Elian's teacher and a
pediatrician, they said applications for the other visas would be
handled on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Cuban officials would allow Gonzalez to
come without assurances that the other visas would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's ordeal began Thanksgiving Day, when he was found
floating in an inner tube off the Fort Lauderdale coast. His mother
and 10 other people drowned when the boat they were using to flee
Cuba sank.
</P>
<P>
   In January, federal officials ruled the boy must go back to his
father in Cuba, but Elian's Miami relatives challenged the decision
in a federal lawsuit. A Miami federal judge ruled against them in
late March, but they immediately appealed to the 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta, which has set oral arguments in the case for
May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the stalemate over the boy's fate are the intense
emotions surrounding the case among Miami's Cuban exiles. Hundreds
of protesters snarled traffic and briefly blocked the entrance to
Miami's bustling seaport in January after the initial federal
decision to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a small but determined group of protesters has kept
a nearly constant vigil outside Elian's Little Havana home, the
crowd swelling at times to hundreds. They have vowed to lay down
their lives to keep Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a group of about 60 demonstrators knocked aside
police barricades after they heard a rumor that federal officials
might be coming for the boy. They locked arms in front of a fence
surrounding the modest home, chanting, singing and praying.
</P>
<P>
   Police stood aside, saying they would allow the protestors to
vent their emotions. Calm returned after about an hour as the
barricades were re-erected and the protestors slowly moved away
from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up marked a day that began with Marisleysis Gonzalez
giving several interviews with the network morning shows, begging
the American public to understand the family's heartbreak over the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they care about is pieces of paper and a signature,'' she
told NBC's ``Today'' show, referring to federal immigration
officials. ``I don't see anybody caring about this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also said she was convinced Elian would be taken away
from his father and brainwashed if he is returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After several more interviews, she collapsed in a dizzy spell,
then was taken to Coral Gables Hospital by paramedics. She was
expected to remain hospitalized overnight. She has been
hospitalized one time previously during the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Lazaro Gonzalez, visited her and then made a brief
statement to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the government expects,'' he said. ``All
we're doing is protecting the child. The government is destroying
this family.''

 RENAISSANCE BOY MEETS NATURE MAN 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; L &LR; 
 &UR; eonardo DiCaprio &LR; : actor, teenage heartthrob, environmental
villain, environmental poster boy and, now, journalist? DiCaprio,
who in the wake of his beach-destroying movie, ``The Beach,''
became the official Earth Day spokes-celebrity, stopped by the
White House on Friday, March 31, to tape a walk-around with
 &UR; President Clinton &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The president was supposed to show the movie star the
environmental improvements he'd made in the presidential habitat in
a segment for an ABC environmental special to be broadcast April
22. But Clinton offered DiCaprio a sit-down interview in which he
discussed global warming and policy on related matters. At least
that was how ABC brass described the encounter in response to
complaints from news-gathering staff members about a movie star
doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The network's news chief,  &UR; David Westin &LR; , e-mailed them all his
assurance that ``all roles of journalist must be played by
journalists.'' (NBC, are you listening? Doesn't this apply to
Fergie, too?) Westin said no one in power would be ``that stupid''
to send the actor to conduct an interview and that ``it's quite
possible we'll use none'' of the taped segment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denied Westin's version, saying that ABC had
sent a formal request for a sit-down interview months ago, and had
the day before the interview forwarded a list of questions DiCaprio
would ask (a fine journalistic practice from the network of heavy
hitters like  &UR; Barbara Walters &LR;  and  &UR; Diane Sawyer &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   P.S. More on Bill Clinton, environmental president:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alice Waters &LR; , who cooked a fund-raising dinner for Clinton in
early March chez  &UR; Susie Buell &LR;  in San Francisco, is determined to
get more from him than a clean plate and a thank you. Waters
believes that planting seeds, tending to gardens and eating the
produce creates a profound connection with the land. She has been
trying to get the president to plant a vegetable garden at the
White House since the beginning of his administration, and she
wrote him again following the Buell dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is an avid fan of Waters' cooking but so far hadn't
taken action on several letters she wrote to him previously.
Although first lady  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  assured a luncheon group in
San Francisco last year that she grows tomatoes on the White House
roof, Waters has more in mind, especially, she notes in the opening
passage of her letter, since he is now in ``the final days of your
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, plant that garden on the White House grounds!
Let the nation know that its highest leader understands the
necessity of a life lived in harmony with the earth. You can do
this quietly, swiftly and without any rhetoric. I can think of no
more powerful way to ground your legacy than to leave behind a
kitchen garden and the compost pile to nourish it . ... Launch this
project and I will happily come and cook you dinner from the
garden.''

ad critic  &UR; Simon Dumenco  &LR; disses ``the cultural tone-deafness on

</P>
<P>
   WebEx is an Internet site that enables businesses to conduct
meetings via the Web. Dumenco can't understand ``a wannabe-hip
dot-com spending millions to embrace a cross-dressing icon five

   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ There was sound. There was fury.
But what stock market investors wanted to know after Tuesday's
bizarre bungee jump in share prices was, what does it signify?
Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in stock market
history, the Nasdaq composite index had plunged 634.31 points,
shearing 13.6 percent off its value. Had it closed there, it would
have been the worst one-day decline in Nasdaq history. But a flood
of buying rescued the index, propelling it up almost 500 points.
Even though the markets recovered by the end of the day, traders
and investors were shellshocked by the extraordinary moves. By

   SCI-HORMONE-REPLACEMENT (Undated) _ Researchers have informed
about 25,000 women taking part in a federal study of hormone
replacement therapy that, far from protecting the heart as many
researchers had assumed, the therapy may have put the women at
slightly higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. The study, known
as the Hormone Replacement Therapy trial of the Women's Health

so that they may try to track down their birth parents and/or
half-siblings. The legal issue pits their ``right to know'' versus
the confidentiality the state at one time promised to women who

<P>
   I was adopted when I was 6 weeks old, and my adoptive mother
died when I was 5. I went to live with my dad, who married three
more times. I never really wanted to talk about adoption. I didn't
find out about it until I was 13. My foster grandmother told me. I
was really mad about it.
</P>
<P>
   I got my first job when I was 12, and I've been on my own since
I was 15. We lived in a trailer, and it was overcrowded, and I just
didn't like the living conditions. There was a YMCA right where I
was working, and so I moved there.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants have been my families. At my first job, in
Knoxville with the Regas Restaurant, the people there were another
family. At my restaurants, we are one big family. That's your
success: when you have happy people having fun. It's pretty
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, we were having a meeting, a kind of
motivational meeting for our managers, and I went public. I said,
if I can do it, you can do it. How many people in this room know
your mother and father? Raise your hand if you've never seen your
biological mother and father. And I raised my hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of my managers came up to me and said, ``I'm adopted.
Why don't you talk about adoption?'' In 1990, President Bush asked
me to come to the White House and talk about the adoption
initiative, which was asking corporate America to give adoption
benefits. Anyone who gives maternity benefits should also have
adoption benefits _ it's kind of a no-brainer. Today, about 62
percent of the Fortune 1000 companies have adoption benefits, like
paid time off and reimbursement for expenses like travel.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, we got the tax credit for people who adopt, and in
1997, the Adoption and Safe Families Act. The federal government
says we don't want these kids in foster care more than 18 months,
and we'll give the states an incentive. About $30 million has been
given back to the states. The adoption stamp is coming out in May.
Adoption is one thing I'm really proud of. I'm proud that we have a
large number of franchisees that have supported us, and it's
growing. The more we talk about adoption, the more things are
happening.
</P>
<P>
   We set up a book tour, and we went to 20 cities to talk to high
school editors about honesty and integrity and about not doing
drugs. We were hoping the high school students would take this
pretty seriously and do something about their lives, like if you
have bad friends, dump them.
</P>
<P>
   But I kept hearing one thing: why did you drop out of high
school? So we were in Seattle, the 20th city, and one young lady
said to me, why don't you go back and get your general equivalency
diploma? I said, maybe I will. I was afraid I was setting a bad
example. I hated the word dropout. I hated the word adoption. I
hated being born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   So I went and got a tutor, and it took me half a year, but I
passed. I wouldn't say I was brilliant. At least I got my GED.

 RENAISSANCE BOY MEETS NATURE MAN

   &QL;

 &UR; L &LR; 
 &UR; eonardo DiCaprio &LR; : actor, teenage heartthrob, environmental
villain, environmental poster boy and, now, journalist? DiCaprio,
who in the wake of his beach-destroying movie, ``The Beach,''
became the official Earth Day spokes-celebrity, stopped by the
White House on Friday, March 31, to tape a walk-around with
 &UR; President Clinton &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The president was supposed to show the movie star the
environmental improvements he'd made in the presidential habitat in
a segment for an ABC environmental special to be broadcast April
22. But Clinton offered DiCaprio a sit-down interview in which he
discussed global warming and policy on related matters. At least
that was how ABC brass described the encounter in response to
complaints from news-gathering staff members about a movie star
doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The network's news chief,  &UR; David Westin &LR; , e-mailed them all his
assurance that ``all roles of journalist must be played by
journalists.'' (NBC, are you listening? Doesn't this apply to
Fergie, too?) Westin said no one in power would be ``that stupid''
to send the actor to conduct an interview and that ``it's quite
possible we'll use none'' of the taped segment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denied Westin's version, saying that ABC had
sent a formal request for a sit-down interview months ago, and had
the day before the interview forwarded a list of questions DiCaprio
would ask (a fine journalistic practice from the network of heavy
hitters like  &UR; Barbara Walters &LR;  and  &UR; Diane Sawyer &LR; ).

   &UR; Alice Waters &LR; , who cooked a fund-raising dinner for Clinton in

   &QL;  TEXAS LAWMAKERS SPLIT OVER CHINA TRADE
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff Russell
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 4 -- With the targeted deadline for Congress'
vote on trade with China closing in, factions on both sides of the
issue are turning up the heat in Washington as Texas lawmakers
scramble to stake out positions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of efforts to normalize trade relations with China
contend that the country's enormous market would be an economic
boon to U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   But some Texas lawmakers voice fear that a bill to grant China
permanent normal trade relations may lose crucial swing votes if it
fails to come up before the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can afford to isolate ourselves,'' said Rep.
Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, who supports the bill. He cited
examples of foreign nations who, according to Ortiz, are taking
advantage of China's opening markets at the expense of American
companies. ``They're eating our lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's challengers counter that granting permanent
normal trade relations, or PNTR, to China will backfire on American
industries in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that American businesses will be subject to a
flood of price-busting Chinese imports,'' said Rep. Ciro Rodriguez,
D-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has supported extending normal trade relations to
China every year it has come up for a vote under Congress' annual
review. But last week he signed on with a group of 19 other
Democratic ``switchers'' who now oppose PNTR.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican support for PNTR remains solid, with
backers such as Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison
pledging their unwavering support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to be perfect,'' said GOP Rep. Henry Bonilla
of San Antonio, ``but I'm confident that the U.S. will come out on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   China is among a small number of nations that must win
congressional approval on a yearly basis to continue enjoying most
favored nation status. Approval of PNTR would eliminate the need
for the annual vote, which Congress has threatened to use in the
past to influence China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The fracture among the Texas delegation mirrors the growing
dispute at the national level. Labor unions, threatened by the
prospect of a job drain, have thrown all their weight towards
defeat of PNTR. ``The vast majority of people in China are not able
to afford the goods we want to sell,'' said Ed Sills, a spokesman
for the Texas AFL-CIO. He indicated that the union plans to
mobilize its membership in the coming weeks by staging protests at
congressional offices and igniting a massive letter-writing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And by all indications the unions' efforts are helping to drum
up opposition from lawmakers like Rodriguez, whose district is
weighted heavily in agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
   But agri-business groups have waged a war of their own to garner
support for open trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need new markets, and China's the biggest market in the
world,'' said Mike Barnett, a spokesman for the Texas Farm Bureau.
He called PNTR a ``win-win'' situation, asserting that China's
immense demand for commodities like rice and citrus fruits could
invigorate the sagging U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Monday in San Jose, Calif., President Clinton --
who has made the bill a top priority of his final year in office --
reaffirmed his arguments in support of PNTR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there's ever been one (trade agreement) this
weighted in our favor,'' he told a group of party supporters. ``The
main consequences of (voting against) this will be to hurt America
economically and to dramatically strain our relations with China.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of mostly Democratic lawmakers are still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-McAllen, is involved in talks with the
White House and other interest groups, his press secretary David
McFarland said. He refused to discuss the issue publicly until he
comes to a decision.

state, and her husband, Laloo Prasad Yadav, with having $99,000
more in assets than can be explained by their legitimate sources of
income. Devi was sworn in three weeks ago after the party her
husband leads won the largest number of seats in the state
assembly.

<P>
   India freed three leaders of the Kashmir Freedom Conference, a
group of about two dozen organizations opposed to Indian rule of
the predominantly Muslim state of Kashmir. The men had been
detained for six months without trial for organizing an election
boycott. Human rights groups had sought their release.

   King Michael of Romania, who was deposed by the Communists in
1948 and has since lived in Switzerland, will get back a
confiscated castle, according to a private news agency quoted by
Reuters. The castle in Arad had become one of many homes of the
communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Many other Romanians are
seeking land seized under communism, and the issue has tied up
courts and Parliament.

   Air France's decision last month to have its pilots speak
English for safety reasons when they approach Charles de Gaulle
airport near Paris isn't getting much help from the French
government, which said that it would continue to support
French-speaking pilots and air controllers. The decision follows a
nudge from the prime minister of the Canadian province of Quebec,
Lucien Bouchard, who last week called Air France's decision
scandalous.

   UKRAINE: DISPUTE OVER REFERENDUM
</P>
<P>
   President Leonid Kuchma is going forward with a planned April 16
referendum that, if passed, would give him power to break an
impasse with Parliament over stalled economic reforms. The assembly
of the Council of Europe, meeting in Strasbourg, urged Kuchma to
delay the vote until a law on referendum procedures could be
considered by Ukraine's lawmakers. If Kuchma goes ahead with the
referendum, the council said it would consider suspending Ukraine
for changing the balance of power in violation of the constitution.

 &HT;    Net site linking shippers, carriers
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You're a shipping manager with 1,000 pounds of dog
food sitting on your Atlanta loading dock. It needs to be in a
grocery store in Mobile, Ala., by noon tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   To find a truck, you have a few choices: use software that
hopefully is new enough to contain accurate shipping rates, break
out the Rolodex or call a broker.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another way. The Internet is squeezing middlemen by
linking businesses and people in such wide-ranging consumer
industries as stock trading and air travel. But it promises to make
shipping transactions smoother and cheaper as well.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta-based firm, CarrierPoint, is developing a Web site
where truckers can bid on shipments. It cuts out transportation
brokers by linking shippers with carriers needed to haul the
freight.
</P>
<P>
   CarrierPoint, started in 1997, expects to close on a $21.8
million second round of funding this month. The Atlanta-based
company was started by John Thomson and Cliff Isaacson. They
launched the first version of the market early last month.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. More than half a billion dollars has flowed
into the market in the last year, said John Fontanella, an analyst
with AMR Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They better hurry,'' Fontanella said. ``There are a lot of
people moving into this space.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as National Transportation Exchange,
Cargosphere.com, OpenShip.com and Shipping-Auction.com also hope to
create Internet-based auctions where shippers can bid on freight.
Other firms _ Logistics.com, Arzoon.com and Celarix.com _ have
similar efforts under way.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers and shippers can register at CarrierPoint's site, www
</P>
<P>
   .carrierpoint.com. Registered users are required to mail a copy
of their signature. CarrierPoint verifies that the carriers have a
satisfactory rating with the U.S. Department of Transportation,
that they are solvent and that the insurance is current.
</P>
<P>
   Registered shippers request bids on loads. Carriers can bid by
the price of their service or by pickup and delivery time. They can
be notified if they win by almost any means: phone, cell phone,
e-mail, hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments can range in size from 500 pounds to a truckload _
anything less probably is better suited for a parcel service,
Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a contract is generated, shippers and carriers each pay a 2
percent fee based on the cost of the shipment. Broker fees can be
12 percent to 15 percent, said Brian Kinsey, CarrierPoint's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, 34, said he saw the opportunity for the Web solution
while working as a consultant, installing distribution management
software programs. He said the traffic managers using the software
would ask him to disconnect the features that chose the least
expensive carrier for the shipment. Thomson said the software was
not updated enough to make the shipping rates relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shipping managers would end up picking up the phone and
calling carriers,'' Thomson said. ``I'd see this and think, 'Why
pick up the phone? The Internet is the perfect solution.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, nine carriers have signed up as have a handful of small
shippers. CarrierPoint also has signed deals with several
business-to-business Internet exchanges to provide shipping for the
goods purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-employee firm is developing version two of the software,
expected to be ready by the end of the year. The new version is
expected to broaden the site's features, offering news, weather and
trip insurance as well as the ability to track shipments.

THE CHINESE STOOL, HUMBLE YET WONDEROUS  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Lipton remembers the first time he saw Chinese stools.
It was the late 1950s, and he was 5. A pair of barrel-shaped
stools, in blue and white porcelain, flanked the sofa in his
grandmother's parlor in Dallas. ``Even on a hot summer day, they
felt icy,'' he said. ``They were plump and smooth and had wonderful
pictures of tall sailing ships in a harbor all around the sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipton has no idea today what became of the stools, family
heirlooms that were trophies of a trip around the world made by a
great-great-grandfather in 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a first visit to China in 1979, when Lipton was a
textile designer working for Jim Thompson Ltd. in Bangkok, stools
loomed large again. In Beijing he saw a towering pile of weathered
wood stools, with elegantly carved aprons and legs, with hoof feet,
scrolled feet and flat feet protruding here and there from a stack
that looked like a bizarre offering to the gods of good taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was not in a temple,'' he said. ``It was in the yard
of a government warehouse compound, standing next to a huge kiln
where the pieces of wood were being recycled into charcoal.
Hardwoods make charcoal that really lasts.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of that scene stayed with him. He became an antiques
dealer in 1989, ultimately specializing in Chinese furniture. Four
years ago he began to assemble as many examples of stools ``with
personality'' as he could find for a show on a form of furniture
that is the most humble and versatile of all in China but is rarely
exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   He selected 92 of them for ``The Wondrous and Amenable Chinese
Stool,'' an exhibition at his shop, William Lipton Ltd., in
Manhattan, through April 22. He invited Sarah Handler, an art
historian, to review the stools he had acquired and to write an
essay on their history in a book that accompanies the show ($60).
</P>
<P>
   Lipton purposely omitted the best-known types of stools: the
most formal ones, like those made for Ming and Ching palaces and
the homes of scholars and merchants, along with the porcelain
garden stools that have been a mainstay of trade with the West for
three centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The stools on view are less perfect. They range from a
15th-century barrel-shaped elm stool to a mid-20th- century
four-legged one, emblazoned with political messages in red
calligraphy on two sides: ``Listen to Chairman Mao'' and ``Walk
with the Communists.'' The prices run from $650 for a tiny vendor's
stool to $42,000 for a set of four stools and a table, all in the
shape of barrels.
</P>
<P>
   There are stools in all possible shapes: an X-framed
17th-century folding stool, made of rosewood-like huanghuali, is
the earliest type of stool known to have been used in China,
probably brought there by nomads in the second century. Its minimal
form contrasts sharply with a pair of rootwood stools inset with
circular seats; they are 18th-century rococo extravaganzas of
joinery, dripping with tubular growths and squiggly things.
</P>
<P>
   There are barrel-shaped stools with four or five legs, and there
are low and tall stools fitted with straight or raked legs. There
is only one log stool, a massive seat carved out of a tree trunk
that was probably used near the gate of a residential compound.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many tradesmen's stools, and those for itinerant
barbers outnumber all others. Barbers brought their own stools to
the streets where they found customers. Some were fitted with a
drawer for razors and a comb; others had a slot to deposit coins.
</P>
<P>
   Masseurs worked the streets too, using two stools with splayed
legs and narrow seats: the client sat on the low one and the
masseur perched on the other, which was twice as tall and also
served as a back rest for the client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tall stools were probably always used by tradesmen because
they were too tall to be used at a table in the house,'' Lipton
said. The most distinctive tall stool in the show is occupied these
days by an articulated lacquered wood figure, a five-foot image of
a deity that was used in festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Informality reigns in the converted town house that serves as
Lipton's shop, which is two steps down from the street. The space,
a bit wider and longer than a railroad car, is always chockablock
with furniture in what might appear to be casual arrangements but
are, in fact, well-ordered groupings of similar pieces placed, side
by side, on the floor, on table tops, on platforms, on counters and
in the window, all to spur comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   There are no wall labels, but explanatory notes are filed in a
loose-leaf binder for visitors to peruse. The show continues out
back in the garden where stone seats are displayed among the pine
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted people to feel free to sit on all these stools and
experience them,'' Lipton said. ``You wouldn't be able to do that
in a formal arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he had learned from organizing the exhibition,
Lipton said that he was reminded of the young Ming incense merchant
who wanted to read a few poems to acquire a little refinement. ``In
my case,'' Lipton said, ``these stools are deceptively simple, like
poems: After studying them I too feel a little more refined.'' (af)

`REVAMPED' TIGER EVEN BETTER THAN ORIGINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Davis Love III received the ominous warning five
years ago, long before Tiger Woods invoked squatter's rights on PGA
Tour leader boards.
</P>
<P>
   It came from Butch Harmon, Woods' swing instructor, who had yet
to watch his star pupil earn the first dollar in a journey that
would lead him to the top of the tour's career money list by age
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept telling me, `Davis, when he learns to control his
irons and control his distances, nobody is going to be able to beat
him. Not because I'm teaching him. Because he's that good,' '' Love
said. ``I repeated that a few times when he first came out. I told
some other players, `You know, this guy is not anywhere near as
good as he can be.' People didn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they believe. Heading into Thursday's opening round of the
Masters Tournament, Woods has won seven of his past 11 starts at
tour events. He has finished below second only once in that
stretch. With 18 victories in 91 tour events, Woods' career winning
percentage (19.8) dwarfs Jack Nicklaus (12.3) and Arnold Palmer
(8.3), the two competitors in the Masters field with the most green
jackets and career victories. Woods also bypassed Love in February
to become the tour's all-time earnings leader ($14,546,859).
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as everything from the Next Nicklaus to the Pied Piper
for minority golfers since his arrival on the tour in 1996, the
multiethnic Woods has matured in the past four years into
``everything we'd hoped he would be'' as a player and role model,
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said. Tour officials also credit
Woods as a primary reason for shifting demographics, higher
television ratings and rising purses.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' presence has become so consuming that Colin Montgomerie,
the No. 3 player in the world rankings, said peers believed ``the
tournament was finished'' when Woods carded an opening 69 in
difficult conditions to emerge a stroke off the lead at the Bay
Hill Invitational March 16-19. Woods went on to win by four shots.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie's stance drew some hot rejoinders from fellow
tourists, most notably Hal Sutton, who defeated Woods by one stroke
at The Players Championship on March 27. Sutton criticized
Montgomerie for adopting a ``defeatist attitude'' toward the game's
top-ranked player, a charge Montgomerie dismissed. Instead,
Montgomerie said he merely uttered the truth, as it pertains to the
majority of PGA Tour participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm third in the world and feel that way, can you imagine
how the others are feeling?'' Montgomerie, 36, said. ``He seems to
have everything. We have never had someone as dominant as Tiger,
not in my career, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who quibble with his take on Woods, Montgomerie said,
``are kidding you ... and kidding themselves.'' He likened Woods,
the golfer, to Michael Jordan, the basketball player, in terms of
separating himself from peers mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his ambition and his will, we have a battle on our hands
every week,'' Montgomerie said. ``This is all very new, this
complete dominance by one player. He has no weakness in his game.''
CHANGES FROM '97
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in 1997, when Woods stormed into the
public consciousness with a record-setting, 12-stroke victory at
the Masters. As a 21-year-old, Woods set the tournament scoring
record (18-under-par 270) and posted the largest margin of victory
in Masters history.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the time, Woods said he realized he had caught lightning
in a bottle. He played the final 63 holes at 22 under and did not
three-putt any of Augusta National Golf Club's sloping greens. He
won his next tournament, the 1997 GTE Byron Nelson Classic, but
failed to crack the top 19 in any of the season's remaining major
championships. In each, Woods posted a round of 74 or higher. The
occasional soaring score became a recurring theme at weekly tour
stops, prompting him to take action.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, Woods retooled his golf swing, with help
from Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to,'' Woods said. ``I didn't like the way I played in
'97, even though I won some tournaments. I wasn't consistent.
Anybody can win when they're hot. That's not hard. But it's hard to
win when you're off. I got tired of shooting 62 one day and 78 the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward distance control on short-iron shots, Harmon
had Woods cut down on his backswing and follow-through. He weakened
Woods' grip and urged him to keep his right heel planted,
minimizing the tendency to swing too quickly and airmail greens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two have worked to keep Woods' club face square
at the top of his swing. They've shallowed the angle of his
downswing to limit spin on approach shots. They've sought to
prevent his arms from lagging behind his right elbow, which causes
a player to push the ball to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Even the putting stroke is different from the one Woods used to
win the 1997 Masters. Rather than a straight-back, straight-through
stroke on the greens, Woods now putts with more of an arcing motion
that is similar to a normal golf swing. It is the type of putting
stroke used by Ben Crenshaw, Phil Mickelson and Justin Leonard,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   The mind-set also is different. Woods hits more 3-woods and
2-irons off tee boxes, rather than drivers, to keep the ball in
play. His average driving distance is down by 11 yards from 1997,
but his driving accuracy is up, from 96th among tour participants
(68.6 percent) to 18th (74.3 percent). The tradeoff, Woods said,
has been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Since making the swing changes, he's hitting more greens in
regulation (73.8 percent), he has improved his putting average
(1.752) and he's winning more tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, he has beaten the odds, said John Rhodes, a Fort
Worth-based golf instructor who has tutored several PGA Tour
participants, including Sutton, Peter Jacobsen and Tom Kite. Rhodes
has seen countless tour players revamp their swings over the past
three decades. Few emerge with the type of turnaround seen in
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare,'' Rhodes said. ``For every one who makes it,
there are five or six you never hear from again.'' SHORT-TERM
STRUGGLES
</P>
<P>
   Provided financial security from a $60 million endorsement deal
signed before hitting his first shot as a professional, Woods said
he never hesitated when Harmon told him he would experience
short-term struggles while tailoring his swing to achieve long-term
success. Woods described the changes as ``not nearly as severe'' as
those undertaken by Nick Faldo in the late 1980s, before Faldo
emerged as a winner of six major championships.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of becoming a more consistent ball-striker, Woods
became an infrequent visitor to the winner's circle. During an
19-month stretch _ from July 1997 to February 1999 _ he recorded
only one victory but several top-10 finishes. David Duval replaced
him as the No. 1 player in the world golf rankings. When questioned
during his winless stretch about a slump, Woods responded by saying
he felt no frustration and that the changes would help in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   The first glimmer of hope emerged at the 1999 Buick
Invitational, where Woods shot 17 under during the weekend rounds
(62-65) to break a 19-month victory drought at tour events.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew the swing changes were coming together,''
Woods said. ``On Saturday of that tournament, I was able to swing
naturally, instead of having to worry about each position on my
backswing and my downswing. I could visualize the shot, hit it and
there it was. I could feel it. Things were jelling.''
</P>
<P>
   By late in the season, they had solidified. Woods won five of
his last six starts at tour events, including the 1999 PGA
Championship, his second major title. He set a season earnings
record ($6,616,585), received his second Player of the Year award
from peers and touched off a fresh wave of ``Tigermania'' among
golf fans.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in today's Tiger and the 1997 Masters champion is
striking, Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, he had one speed, one shot,'' Rhodes said.
``Everything was full-bore, all the time. If he'd never (changed
his swing), he'd still have been remembered as a great player ...
and probably would have won a tournament every year or 18 months.
But he's driven to be the best who ever played. I think he'd have
been very, very frustrated if he hadn't changed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, Rhodes said, is a power player who now has
creativity and shot-making skills comparable to golf legends Ben
Hogan or Byron Nelson. Woods has developed something else over the
past three years: a more mature approach to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Woods said, he feels ``far more comfortable''
dealing with the demands of the limelight than in 1997. He's three
years older and, by his estimation, quantum leaps wiser. He fidgets
less during news conferences, smiles more on the course and
interacts with a wider group of players.
</P>
<P>
   He has expressed regret for incidents where he has thrown clubs
or cursed on the course, especially in front of children. He has
taken to heart suggestions from Arnold Palmer about the need for
better displays of golf etiquette and a more deferential posture in
matters of golf history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Woods is not big on signing autographs (too time
consuming) and he jealously guards his private time. To maintain
sanity in his life, Woods said, ``I have to be ruthless
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the ruthless displays take place away from
television cameras and fans. Instead, fans see a rare talent who is
becoming more his own man away from the course. Since joining the
tour, Woods has fired three members of his support system put in
place by his father _ lawyer John Merchant, agent Hughes Norton and
caddie Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan _ and replaced them with confidants of
his own choosing. His father, Earl, also maintains a much lower
profile, partly by design and partly because of Earl Woods' ongoing
battle with heart disease. THE TIGER EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   The changes within his inner circle, Woods said, have made him
more relaxed in his dealings with fans, media and peers. And there
are plenty of dealings on all fronts.
</P>
<P>
   What impact has Woods had on the PGA Tour and the golf world
since his arrival? Consider:
</P>
<P>
   The season's highest-paying event, The Players Championship,
offered a $3.5 million purse in 1996, the last year Woods played
college golf. Last month, the event paid $6 million. Other tour
purses have exploded in similar proportions under a new television
agreement finalized in 1997, Woods' first full season as a tour
participant.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings for the final round of this season's Buick
Invitational, where Woods' six-event winning streak ended, pulled
an 8.0 rating on CBS. That easily topped the 6.9 mark earned by the
NBA All-Star Game on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys taken at tour events show sharp increases in minority
and younger attendees since Woods joined the circuit. A demographic
survey from 1998 showed African-American fans accounted for 9.8
percent of tour galleries, up from 3.0 percent in 1995. There were
similar increases among other minority fans (3.8 to 3.0) and fans
in the 18-24 age group (10.0 to 7.3).
</P>
<P>
   A National Golf Foundation survey, conducted in 1998, showed the
African-American golfer population has increased by 30 percent
since 1996. In addition, the number of golf newcomers topped 2.9
million in both 1997 and 1998, well above the 2 million per year
average for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The First Tee, a World Golf Foundation initiative to introduce
the game to those of limited financial means, is on target to have
100 facilities completed or on the drawing board by the end of this
year. Launched in 1998, the First Tee has 13 facilities in
operation and 40 to 45 more under construction, said Len Stachitas,
acting executive director. A Fort Worth facility has been on the
drawing board since 1999, with plans to break ground when the
funding is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved said Woods' nonprofit organization, the Tiger
Woods Foundation, has been a driving force in expanding the growth
of The First Tee initiative.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Finchem, the tour commissioner, said he looks at
Woods and sees a star player and role model who has become
``everything we'd hoped he would be,'' from the day he joined the
circuit in August 1996. It's why Love said Woods has learned from
past mistakes and ``is doing everything just right'' today as a
touring professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may throw a bad word out every once in a while because he's
trying so hard, but that's the worst thing you can say about the
guy,'' Davis Love said. ``His attitude is very, very good. His
physical conditioning is great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he's doing everything a little bit better than
everybody else on tour, all the way across the board: putting,
driving distance, control, mental game. Everything is just a little
bit sharper than everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, arguably the world's most visible athlete among active
participants, said he is comfortable with his status in the game
and in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable being a role model,'' Woods said. ``It's
cool to see more minority faces in the crowds at tournaments, and
see those people taking a serious interest in golf. My goal, all
long, was to make golf look more like America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can live my life the way I'm going right now, and stay
true to myself, then hopefully kids will say a lot of positive
things about me ... and want to strive to be like me or better than
me. That's great, because then I know I have impacted their lives
in a positive way. Hopefully, when I'm done with golf or six feet
under, I can look back and say I left the game in better shape than
I found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years into a well-hyped career, golf's Next Nicklaus
appears headed in that direction. nn

INSTEAD OF PROTECTING HEART, ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT MAY INCREASE
RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have informed about 25,000 women taking part in a
federal study of hormone replacement therapy that, far from
protecting the heart as many researchers had assumed, the therapy
may have put the women at a slightly higher risk of heart attacks
and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, known as the Hormone Replacement Therapy trial of the
Women's Health Initiative, is the first large-scale controlled
clinical trial asking whether hormone replacement therapy prevents
heart disease in healthy post-menopausal women. But in letters sent
out Friday, participants were told that those who had been randomly
assigned to take estrogen were having slightly more heart attacks,
strokes and blood clots in the lungs than those who had been
assigned to take dummy pills for comparison. While the effect was
not sufficiently pronounced to stop the study, the researchers
themselves were taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported Tuesday by The Washington Post and
The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 million American women take Premarin, an
estrogen that was approved only to alleviate the symptoms of
menopause, like hot flashes, and to help maintain bone density. The
drug's maker, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of American
Home Products Corp., says the estrogen is the best-selling
prescription drug in America.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and individual women say that one reason for estrogen's
popularity is that there is a widespread belief that it will
prevent heart disease. But that hypothesis came from indirect
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, said in a statement Monday that the new
information does not address the larger issue of long-term benefits
and risks of hormone replacement therapy `and, therefore, it should
not influence current medical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that women who take estrogen after
menopause have fewer heart attacks than women who do not. But since
women who take the hormone tend to be better educated, less likely
to smoke and more likely to eat balanced diets and exercise, it was
hard for researchers to tell whether the therapy or other factors
in their lives contributed to their lower risk. The only way to
know for sure was to do a large study like the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw, who is acting director of the hormone
replacement trial, said in an interview Tuesday that even though it
was too soon to say whether the increased risk of heart attacks and
strokes would hold up as the study continued, he felt morally
obliged to inform the women about the finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't anticipated when they enrolled,'' Rossouw said.
``We told them all about the risks and benefits but we didn't tell
them there might be an increased risk of heart disease.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added that he fervently hoped that the women would stay in
the study and that other women would not panic because the number
of women who had had heart attacks and strokes was minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my women friends ask me, `How does this affect me?', my
advice is it doesn't change a thing,'' Rossouw said. ``I would say
there never was proof that hormones help heart disease and there
still isn't. The only qualifier is, if you're expecting an early
benefit from heart disease it looks less likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators emphasize that only a small number of women in the
study actually had heart attacks, strokes or blood clots in the
lungs or the legs. The exact numbers were in the hands of an
independent committee that oversees the study, and its members
would not reveal them even to the study investigators. But overall,
only about 1 percent of all the women, who were 50 to 79, had these
medical problems in the first two years of the study. The effect
seems to be diminishing as the study continues, the researchers
say. Yet, apparently, these grave medical problems were
disproportionately concentrated in the women taking hormones that
were supposed to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most widely prescribed drug in America,'' said
Cindy Pearson, the executive director of the National Women's
Health Network, an advocacy group in Washington. ``A lot of the
women are taking it because they've been told by their doctors that
it will prevent a heart attack. Those are the women who should be
sitting up and taking notice and going to their doctors and saying,
`Why am I taking this? What's the point of this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said that, in her opinion, no woman should be taking
estrogen to prevent heart disease outside of a clinical trial
asking if it has that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some heart disease researchers said that they already were wary
about estrogen because it can elicit blood clots, which can cause
heart attacks and strokes. Birth control pills, which contain
estrogen, may cause clots, and a recent study found that women who
already had heart attacks might not be protected from new ones if
they take estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The study, directed by Dr. Stephen Hulley of the University of
California at San Francisco, found that in the first year, women
taking estrogen actually had more heart attacks and other
manifestations of heart disease than those taking a placebo. The
effect diminished in subsequent years, and by the fifth year the
women taking estrogen did better than those taking the placebo. But
the study failed to show that overall, women who had had heart
attacks were helped by estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, decades ago, in which men took estrogen in the
hope of preventing heart attacks, had to be discontinued because
the hormone was causing heart attacks instead.
</P>
<P>
   Those who hoped estrogen might benefit healthy women pointed to
the studies showing that women who happened to take estrogen had
fewer heart attacks than those who happened not to take it. They
also noted that estrogen increased the amount of beneficial
cholesterol in the blood, the HDL fraction, in the blood, while
decreasing the fraction of the harmful LDL cholesterol. But, Hulley
noted, his study of women who had had heart attacks indicated that
those changes in cholesterol levels could be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a nice 10-percent rise in HDL cholesterol and a
10-percent drop in LDL cholesterol, on average,'' Hulley said.
``This suggested to us that we were going to see a beneficial
effect on coronary heart disease rates.'' When that did not happen,
he said, ``we were very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, investigators said, the Women's Health Initiative remains
scientists' best hope of learning whether estrogen replacement
therapy is helpful or harmful to healthy women.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else is going to do a study this big on hormone
replacement therapy,'' said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a Stanford
University professor who is chairwoman of the study's steering
committee. ``If we don't answer the questions on hormones, they're
never going to be answered,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In the letters they received, participants in the Women's Health
Initiative were urged to stay in the study. The study, they were
told, ``is more important than ever.'' So far, said Rossouw, the
women are reacting calmly. ``It seems that we're not going to lose
any participants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, said Dr. Michael Criqui, an investigator in the
study who is a professor of family and preventive medicine at the
University of California at San Diego, ``one cannot recommend to a
woman to take estrogen to prevent heart disease at this time.'' So
far, he said, ``there's no evidence that it will.''

 &HT;    Metro firm energy source for new electronic products
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New electronic products are popping into the
marketplace like clockwork these days, but new radios, laptops and
wireless phones demand new battery products _ and that's what
Motorola Energy Systems Group provides.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to their new facilities unveils a dazzling display of
storage batteries, tiny and large, that range from self-charging
units you can use marooned in the jungle or powerful units that can
run a notebook computer for 11 hours straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrenceville research labs and battery production lines,
part of a quiet Motorola campus near Interstate 85, are flagship
operations in Motorola's worldwide battery production subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the unique things about our operation is that we are in
at the beginning,'' said Ed Myszka, director of strategy and
business development for ESG. ``We and other companies are brought
in when any manufacturer has a new proposed product, to help them
arrive at the right energy source.''
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence Myszka and his staff always know months ahead
of the public what new things are coming down the electronics
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 900 employees in Lawrenceville, a squadron of
engineers specializing in electronics, chemistry and polymers work
on the latest battery units, striving for products that are
powerful but also lightweight and responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holy grail for people in our business is to create
batteries that are `out of sight and out of mind,' like the
batteries in your remote control,'' Myszka said.
</P>
<P>
   That's easier said than done, given the huge and growing variety
of devices now on the market that range from simple cell phones and
pagers to interactive pagers and the latest devices that act as
all-around communicators like the Motorola IDEN phone with Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   These phones are being attached to a variety of networks by
Nextel, Microsoft and others. But because of their many uses, there
is a need for ever stronger, higher-capacity batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the units produced by Motorola carry the brand
names of the manufacturers, many consumers may be unaware of the
source of the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, nearly all lithium-ion batteries for Compaq
notebook computers are products from ESG. Micron has ordered for
some of its laptop computers a special battery system that can
function for 11 hours of steady operation.
</P>
<P>
   The lithium-ion batteries and the newer polymer batteries, the
latest ideas from the battery makers, are highly prized both for
their efficiency and for being ``smart.'' Unlike older battery
technology, they can be charged at anytime and, when used with the
proper charging units, they will not overcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Product safety is another assignment carried out in the
Lawrenceville facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is plenty of talk and concern about product
quality, safety is one of our leading priorities,'' said Doug
Morris, technology director and who runs a laboratory that tests
products to the point of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   They test the products for various forms of stress, including
temperature, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest batteries is the zinc air self-charging
battery, a light unit the size of a business card that does not
charge until opened and exposed to the air _ the kind of product
that would be useful for a person stranded for a long time in an
isolated area.
</P>
<P>
   Other cutting-edge technologies are poised to produce
lighter-weight batteries for wearable computers, and others for
Blue Tooth technologies that will provide for wireless
communication among devices within a home or office.
</P>
<P>
   What are some of the biggest challenges for battery makers?
</P>
<P>
   To come up with longer-lasting units, perhaps powered by fuel
cells, said Myszka, and also for tinier devices.
</P>
<P>
   Among those around the corner are, yes, the Dick Tracy
wristwatch communicators. And wireless phones that consist mostly
of an earpiece and a mouthpiece attached to the lapel, perhaps the
ultimate hands-free communication.

exempt from public policy that forbids discrimination against
minorities. Fear should not be allowed to triumph over tolerance
and civil rights. By MARIANNE MEANS.

GLENN SEEKS NEW DEAL FROM PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Is a Keyshawn Johnson-like storm brewing in
New England?
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn and his agent, James Gould, will know in the next 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   Gould confirmed Tuesday that he has asked the Patriots for a new
multiyear deal for Glenn, who, like the Jets' Johnson, has two
years remaining on his current pact. Gould expects to talk with the
Patriots this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' plans for the April 15 draft could be altered
depending on how Glenn and Gould react if they receive ``no'' for
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll definitely know more by the end of the week,'' said
Gould. ``To this point there's been a spirit of cooperation between
Terry and the team. My sense was the Patriots were genuinely taking
the request seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who caught 69 passes for 1,147 yards, last season, is
part of the great 1996 wide receiver class that produced Johnson
(No. 1 to the Jets), Glenn (No. 7 to the Patriots), Marvin Harrison
(No. 19 to the Colts), and Eric Moulds (No. 24 to the Bills).
</P>
<P>
   Harrison reportedly is close to a four-year deal that would
include an $11 million signing bonus and average $6 million a year.
That certainly would be a measuring stick for Johnson and Glenn,
though Harrison had biggers numbers last year: 115 passes for 1,663
yards and 12 touchdowns. He was scheduled to earn $1.02 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who caught 89 passes for 1,170 yards, requested that
his contract be redone, but new Jets owner Woody Johnson has
emphatically stated that he should honor the deal he has. Johnson
is scheduled to earn $2.24 million this year and $2.46 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, Buccaneers, and Redskins had some interest in
talking trade with the Jets for Johnson, but now that appears
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Moulds, who caught 65 passes for 994 yards, is entering the
final year of his contract and will earn just under $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has been a willing participant in the Patriots' strength
and conditioning program after coach Bill Belichick strongly urged
that he be on hand. With Ben Coates and Shawn Jefferson out of the
receiving picture, Glenn will be relied on even more in the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is scheduled to earn $2.3 million this season, which
includes a $200,000 reporting bonus and a $56,000 workout bonus.
His pay next season is around $2.4 million, with a base of $1.2
million and a reporting bonus of $1.13 million, as well as a
workout bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not the Patriots' highest-paid receiver. The team
signed Troy Brown to a five-year, $12.5 million deal this year.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to have been a sense of goodwill between Glenn and
the Patriots since Belichick came aboard, with Belichick even
dropping the suspension Glenn was handed by Pete Carroll at the end
of last season for allegedly violating team procedures in how he
handled an illness.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has said he wants to bear the burden of being the big-play
receiver, the ``go-to'' guy. For that, he would like to be
compensated the way the best receivers in the game are.

HOUSE VOTES TO KEEP CURRENT SYSTEM OF ALLOCATING DONATED ORGANS
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved legislation Tuesday that would
block the Clinton administration's plans to revamp the nation's
system for allocating donated organs based on medical need,
regardless of where the recipients live.
</P>
<P>
   The action fuels a long-running fight between Congress and the
administration over which patients should have priority in
receiving human organs, the nation's scarcest medical resource, and
what role the federal government should have in that process.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, by a vote of 275-147, reaffirmed that the authority
for organ distribution lies not with the federal government, but
with the private sector and specifically with the United Network
for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit agency that is under contract with
the government to coordinate distribution of donated human organs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, if enacted, would overturn a long-delayed federal
regulation that took effect on March 16. The rule gives the
secretary of health and human services, Donna Shalala, authority to
direct the agency to change its policies so organs are shared
broadly across regional lines, with sickest patients generally
given first priority.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, which has been waged along parochial lines rather
than party lines, affects thousands of patients nationwide, many of
whom are critically ill and have been waiting for months or years
for new organs.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill, sponsored by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who is a
physician, is to be introduced in the Senate on Wednesday. But the
Senate bill differs from the House version in at least one
important way: The ultimate policy would be made by a commission
made up of federal authorities, the transplant agency and an
independent medical institute.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's advisers say they would recommend he veto
the House bill, arguing in a policy statement put out by the White
House that the measure ``would preserve existing inequities in the
organ transplantation system, and could result in potential harm to
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, in a statement after the vote, observed that supporters
failed to muster a veto-proof majority, and said the House measure
would be remembered as ``an unfortunate footnote to the larger
good-faith efforts that are underway to achieve the best organ
transplant system possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing system, the country is divided into 11
regions, which are in turn split into 62 local areas; these areas
range in size from a few counties to several states, and in
population from 1 million to 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   When an organ becomes available, it is offered locally first. If
a matching patient is not found, the organ is then offered
regionally, and, in rare cases, nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala has criticized the system as unfair to patients because
waiting times vary greatly from region to region. Under the new
federal regulation, the organ-sharing network must propose a plan
that meets new federal requirements for broader, regional sharing.
If not, Shalala could propose one herself.
</P>
<P>
   But in a key amendment, the House rejected a proposal to codify
that approach. The vote was 260-160. Later, by voice vote,
lawmakers agreed to nullify the regulation altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In spirited debate on the House floor, critics of Shalala's
approach defended the current system. ``It keeps organ allocation
out of the hands of federal bureaucrats and in the hands of local
communities,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Martha M. Kendrick, a lobbyist for the Patient Access to
Transplant Coalition, a group of 29 transplant centers of varying
sizes, said, ``The system today tries to do the greatest good for
the greatest number of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the existing system say it places too much
authority in a private company, and denies organs to the neediest
patients. The Health and Human Services Department ``worked hard to
come up with a final rule that reflects the views of patients,
donors and the medical community,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown,
D-Ohio. ``The right way to serve the public interest is not to
protect a private government contractor.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 66,000 Americans are now waiting for a heart, lung,
liver, kidney or pancreas and, according to the health and human
services agency, nearly 5,000 patients die every year while
awaiting a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Organ donation has grown much more slowly than demand. The
federal health agency said that the number of transplants performed
increased to 20,961 in 1998 from 12,618 in 1988. But the number of
donations only increased to 9,913 in 1998 from 5,906 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   To help resolve that shortfall, the House on Tuesday adopted an
amendment authorizing $15 million in grants to states that promote
organ donation.

DOT-COM COMPANIES AWAITING IPOS SUFFER THROUGH NASDAQ DIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could smell the fear.
</P>
<P>
   At their worst point in the day, Nasdaq stocks had nearly
doubled their Monday losses, for a 20 percent dive in less than 48
hours. For entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, it was a stark
sign that the easy money may be over for initial public stock
offerings of dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a reminder of how quickly these markets come and
go for companies that don't have earnings,'' said Andy McLane,
managing director at TA Associates, a Boston private-equity firm.
</P>
<P>
   Most start-up companies with venture backing don't have profits.
But that hasn't bothered the investors who have been snapping up
young technology companies as soon as they hit the IPO market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company could achieve a billion-dollar market capitalization
overnight _ until today,'' McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   The hot IPO market lately has enabled venture capitalists to
take fledgling high-tech companies to the public markets after only
a year or two, about the half the time it typically takes.
</P>
<P>
   That means stock investors, eager to fetch big returns on
high-flying technology companies, are taking on more risk than they
would with more established companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the late 1970s, and briefly during the biotech craze
of the 1980s, have ordinary investors taken on so much risk in
unproven companies, McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders are being venture capitalists,'' he observed.
``The public markets have been providing the second and third
rounds of venture financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, venture capital firms have been getting cool receptions
from mutual fund managers and other big investors for their
consumer Web site companies. Most firms are avoiding investing in
business-to-consumer companies, as a result, and are also being
more cautious about their business-to-business financings.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Cowan, a general partner with Bowman Capital in San
Mateo, Calif., said the volatile Nasdaq market will have a chilling
effect _ and perhaps tilt things back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are b-to-c companies in registration right now that will
never get out,'' or go public, Cowan said. ``The world does not
need the tenth entrant into an already competitive sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Many venture capital firms from Boston to Silicon Valley have
portfolios with as many as six companies waiting to go public in
the next few months. A weaker stock market makes it harder to
launch IPOs, as investors sign up for fewer shares of firms deemed
to be risky.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com Inc., the Framingham-based online furniture site
that's backed by CMGI Inc., is slated to go public this month. So
is Zefer Corp., a Boston Web-strategy consulting company. I3 Mobile
Inc., a Stamford, Conn.-based provider of wireless Web equipment,
is supposed to be priced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies was willing to say whether it would delay
its IPO as a result of the bloodletting on the Nasdaq. Some
companies delayed their IPOs. MetLife, the big New York insurer,
went ahead and priced its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, at
$14.25, having previously scaled back its hopes for raising money
by half, to $2.88 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, entrepreneurs poised to file for public offerings
this year had to brace for disappointment Tuesday. Some observers
said the reality check would be good for the market and for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the market saying, `We've had enough of this
particular type of company, so stop the flow,' '' said Jonathan
Guerster, a principal with Charles River Ventures in Waltham. ``It
shakes out the companies that are less strong (whether they are)
public or poised to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Guerster suggested, the stock prices of the better
companies will rise. In the meantime, he admitted, for companies
that are getting mid- to late-stage venture capital, ``this is
putting hiccups in their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists are shrugging off the market jitters, saying
they'll go back to their old practices if the IPO market shuts down
for a while. When they can't take companies public, venture firms
tend to hold on to companies for longer and pour more money into
them. They eventually try to sell them to larger companies, or wait
for a new IPO window.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bowman's Cowan: ``We may be back to some sense of normalcy,
where companies have to show a clear path to profitability before
going public.''

NASDAQ FREEFALL EASED BY LATE TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market went for a wild ride Tuesday as panicked
investors drove the Nasdaq down 575 points and the Dow more than
500 points before both indexes snapped back in a dramatic afternoon
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, losses in the technology-dominated Nasdaq were
contained at a modest 74.79 points, down 1.77 percent to 4148.89.
It was a remarkable comeback for the index which had, at its low
point, shed almost 14 percent in a temporary rout that evoked
memories of the 1987 market crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which also recovered, lost 57.09 points _ just one-half
a percent. The Dow closed at 11,164.84.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rebound, the rollercoaster market unnerved
investors. One expert called it ``one of the whackiest days'' ever
on Wall Street, and it came on the heels of Nasdaq's enormous
decline Monday in reaction to the collapse of settlement talks in
the Microsoft antitrust case. Over the past week, Nasdaq's
double-digit gains in year 2000 have been trimmed to a modest 1.96
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet technology shares remain highly valued and, many believe,
vulnerable to further declines: Nasdaq is more than twice its level
of a year ago when it was just over 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   If Nasdaq stocks slip again, economists said the US economy _
and particularly high-tech cities such as Boston and San Francisco
_ will suffer. Initial offerings by small companies are already
being canceled due to uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston area is doubly vulnerable because it has such a
high concentration in the financial services industry, as well as
the technology sector,'' said Rachael Chioino, economist for
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Investors early on engaged in panic selling amid doubt about
their tech shares' prospects in the aftermath of a federal court
ruling charging Microsoft with illegally hurting competition in the
software industry. As the market sank, some investors who had
bought shares with borrowed money were forced to sell to meet
brokers' demands for more cash.
</P>
<P>
   Then, steely investors, taking advantage of the technology
industry's plunge, rushed back in and bought shares, said Bruce
Addison, Boston branch manger for First Union Securities, a
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The ``meltdown,'' he said, started with Microsoft and spread to
other companies. At first, ``nobody was buying.'' As the day
progressed, investors started calling up and placing orders to buy.
``At mid-afternoon, the volume picked up, buyers stepped in, and we
showed strength in buying right into the close,'' Addison said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's performance this year is still better than the Dow's,
which is down 2.89 percent since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But such volatility in technology stocks bodes huge
uncertainties for investors. After Nasdaq retreated last week, a
growing number of investment analysts speculated the bubble was
bursting. The performance added to the confusion but did nothing to
deter pessimists.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors seeking a safe place for their money purchased US
Treasury bonds, which experienced their biggest rally in almost two
months. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds dropped 3 basis points
to 5.78 percent, its lowest level since May 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a month now where the Dow has outperformed the
Nasdaq,'' said Boston money manager Kenneth Heebner. ``If money
starts coming out of Nasdaq, that could pop the tech bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cliggott, managing director for J.P. Morgan in New York,
said stock traders had a glimpse of a dark day. Traders, he said,
were ``starting to come to grips with what things might look like
when liquidity dries up. That's where their sharpest declines were
_ in a lot of the Nasdaq names.''
</P>
<P>
   At the market's depths, institutional investors were seeking
buyers for 10,000-share blocks of giant technology companies, such
as Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and EMC Corp., one broker said. A
shortage of buyers for technology shares pushed Nasdaq down
sharply. Microsoft lost another $2.3125 a share, closing at
$88.5625. Oracle Corp.'s stock price was shaved 94 cents, closing
at $75.94, but EMC rose $1 a share, to $128.
</P>
<P>
   But, drugmakers' shares, led by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and
Pharmacia Corp., rose as investors left biotechnology and bought
stakes in pharmaceutical stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   For now, doomsday predictions were put on hold due to one of the
most dramatic rebounds in the stock market's history.
</P>
<P>
   There was sharp disagreement among experts about where the
technology sector and financial markets are going. Wayne Ayers,
chief economist for FleetBoston Financial, argued that a strong
economy provides a floor under stocks _ even Nasdaq stocks. The
federal government reported recently that the US grew 7 percent in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a Nasdaq correction but whether we plummet further
from here _ I don't think that's likely,'' said Ayers. ``This
economy, while it's going to slow, isn't in any danger of falling
off a cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said
his belief that a new technology-based economy is emerging does not
mean Nasdaq's near future is assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a believer in the new economy doesn't mean I haven't
perceived the bubble characteristics in the Nasdaq,'' Yardeni said.
``There's the economy, and there's the stock market, and they don't
always tell the same story.''

WHY GIVING STAFF FREE PCs IS SMART 
 
By JIM BARLOW 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp., the huge California maker of computer chips, is
giving its 70,000 full- and part-time employees a Pentium III
computer, Internet access and frequent computer updates _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. says it will buy high-speed computers for all its
350,000 employees and throw in unlimited Internet access _ for $5 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines will give free computers to its 72,000 employees.
General Motors and United Airlines are exploring doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Just another example of perks gone mad? Not so, says Adam
Corson-Finnerty, director of external affairs for the University of
Pennsylvania library, in a piece he wrote for the Wharton School of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are actually saving money by giving _ or nearly
giving _ computers to their employees to use at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BETTER COMPUTER SKILLS NEEDED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's why that's true.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the computer age. They are used in business for
everything from controlling tools on the factory floor to getting
out an order to a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Companies need employees with computer literacy. Which is a
fancy way of saying that employees need to be able to use a
computer, not be afraid of it. For the computer is a tool, no more
or less than a screwdriver. You don't need to know how to build a
screwdriver to use it. You don't need to know how to program a
computer to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who are wired can also push ideas up the chain of
command with little or no effort. And companies can push down
memos, the company newsletter, benefits manuals and a wide range of
communications to employees at little or no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual teams can be formed and meet over the Internet, saving
millions in travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   People with computer skills are a hot ticket item these days.
Instead of going out and paying top bucks for those folks, the
companies giving their employees take-home computers are, in
effect, growing their own.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LEARN AT HOME, CUT TRAINING COSTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now they could develop those same computer literacy skills by
setting up massive training programs. But consider the costs. A
company would have to hire consultants, buy computers, build
classrooms and pull people off their jobs during regulator working
hours or pay overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Giving employees computers seems downright cheap. Let them play
at home on their own time. The results will be about the same. And
when it comes time for formal training on software they might not
encounter at home, the employees don't have to start at ground
zero.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, the companies might even make money on the deal. Ford
will have 350,000 people hooked to its network. That's a lot of
buying power. Perhaps the company can make deals with Internet
companies so their employees can get lower prices, and the company
can get a tiny piece of the price in return for access to the
network and deducting purchases from the paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who didn't want to buy from the company Internet store
could easily bypass it. Which means that the company would have to
offer real values in price and services. If it did, everybody would
win. Employees would get better goods at lower prices, the company
would get a few cents profit and the Internet suppliers of products
and services would get a huge customer base to appeal to.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the downside to a company wiring its employees?
Simple. While the company can more easily communicate with them, so
can anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   You might have read recently how unions are using computers to
help them organize new members and keep in touch with old ones.
</P>
<P>
   All the major unions, and many locals, now have Web sites. That
makes it easy for a disgruntled employee to contact them.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that Ford, which prides itself on its good employee
relations, might find it harder to relate. Delta, its
once-excellent employee relations hurt by a cost-cutting initiative
a few years ago, will have to redouble its communications efforts
with employees.
</P>
<P>
   Will non-union companies, which supply employees with computers,
put themselves in union jeopardy? If so, their employee relations
are so poor they deserve it.
</P>

   LIMA, Peru _ Alejandro Toledo grew up shining shoes in the grimy
port city of Chimbote, one of 16 brothers and sisters whose father
was a bricklayer and whose mother sold fish in a street market.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unlikely background for a would-be president in
class-conscious Peru. But today Toledo is doing something that
Mario Vargas Llosa, this century's most prominent Peruvian author,
could not do in 1990 and that Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former
U.N. secretary- general, could not do in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is giving President Alberto K. Fujimori, the ``giant
killer'' in those two previous runs for the presidency, the
toughest political battle of his life. Toledo is attracting votes
from disaffected urban lower-class voters who are rejecting the
traditional ruling elites.
</P>
<P>
   Only five weeks ago, Toledo was a little-known business school
professor, one with a remarkable rags-to-middle-class story but no
credible chance of defeating Fujimori. His extraordinary political
climb _ leapfrogging over several formidable opposition candidates,
including the mayor of Lima and a former director of the social
security system _ has been called the ``Toledo phenomenon'' by the
press here.
</P>
<P>
   The polls indicate that Toledo will probably stop Fujimori from
winning a first-round victory in the presidential election on
Sunday unless there is fraud, and that he could even beat Fujimori
in a runoff, which would be in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Toledo phenomenon'' represents the coming of age of a huge
class of Peruvians: the more than 8 million people who have
migrated from mostly Indian villages in the Andean highlands to
cities across the country in the last 30 years. These Peruvians
have given up their little plots of land to work in factories or on
fishing boats or simply to beg in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has strong Indian physical traits, making him popular
with Indians and those of mixed race, who are known as mestizos or,
in Peruvian slang, ``cholos.'' And at 54 he has accomplished the
cholo dream of achieving an education, rising from poverty and
marrying a woman of higher social status.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo earned a doctorate at Stanford University, where he met
his wife, Eliane Karp, a Belgian-born naturalized American citizen
who is an anthropologist and consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these people see that I can become president, they
realize they can become president too,'' said Toledo, seated with
his legs intertwined comfortably with his wife's as they traveled
in their rented campaign plane. ``It is a matter of hopes and
dreams. I'm an example of what people can do who have good health
care and an education.''
</P>
<P>
   As Toledo travels across the country, the enthusiasm surrounding
his candidacy has grown from week to week even though he has never
held high office. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people block
his campaign caravans along roads and jump on top of his
``cholomobile'' van in what sometimes appears to be mad,
uncontrolled excitement.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Toledo mixes moving accounts of his youth with a
centrist message that promises more government loans for small
businesses and farmers and a gradual phasing out of government
handouts of milk and cereal. He takes the time to explain the
importance of balancing the government budget and attracting
foreign investment _ and in a break from customary Peruvian
politics, makes a point of saying that he cannot promise easy,
instant solutions to this country's vast social problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't bring you rice or cooking oil because votes cannot be
bought,'' he said, in a pointed criticism of Fujimori's campaign
tactics, before a screaming crowd of 25,000 in the agricultural
center of Ica last Friday night. ``I've come to bring my talents to
bear to offer you jobs, jobs, jobs. I know my people and my people
don't want charity. They want jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd responded by chanting what has become the unofficial
slogan of Toledo's campaign, ``Cholo si, Chino no!'' a reference to
Fujimori, who is popularly known as ``El Chino'' even though he is
of Japanese descent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Toledo went on to invite everyone to his inaugural party, where
he promised to serve local favorites like fermented corn juice,
sweet potatoes and ceviche, marinated raw fish. The crowded
responded robustly, chanting, ``Toledo is justice!'' and ``The
dictatorship will fall!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many of these same people had turned in the past to Fujimori _
who comes from an immigrant family of fairly modest means _ as an
alternative to Vargas Llosa and Perez de Cuellar, representatives
of the traditional light-skinned Lima elite who are the descendants
of the Spanish colonial power structure. But now an increasing
number of Peruvians are choosing someone whose features and
background more closely resembles theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the submissive cholo, Toledo has risen to the sure-footed
cholo, and that automatically makes him a leader _ and with a
blond, gringa wife to boot,'' said Raul Vargas Vega, director of
Radioprogramas, Peru's leading radio network. ``He has a story that
is similar to hundreds of thousands of Peruvians but with a
successful ending.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fujimori remains ahead in Lima, where he controls most
of the news media and has delivered an array of social programs to
the shantytowns, as well as in the rural Indian areas, where his
free milk and cereal programs still benefit hundreds of thousands
of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   But about half of the population of Peru now live in
middle-sized cities, where people have given up their Indian ways
but now appear to have a renewed respect for their ethnic identity.
It is in those places, cities like Ica, Iquitos and Arequipa, where
Toledo's campaign has taken off.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crowds seem not to care that Toledo is entirely untested as
a leader and that he is viewed, perhaps unfairly, as an
untrustworthy opportunist by other opposition leaders. Those
leaders have openly attacked Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's
intelligence chief, for engaging in dirty campaign tricks. Toledo
has not been spared, but he has responded differently.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers that are said to take directions from Montesinos have
been bombarding Toledo with charges that he was an adviser to a
shady financier whose pyramid scheme collapsed a few years ago and
that he has an illegitimate daughter he does not support.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo, who denies the charges, has quietly sent emissaries
to aides of Montesinos to open talks with him. And with Toledo's
poll numbers continuing to move skyward, he attributes his ability
to overcome the attacks to his innate toughness, his wife's support
and his ethnic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Toledo got his big break in life at 16 when Peace Corps
volunteers helped him obtain a one-year scholarship to the
University of San Francisco. He managed to continue his studies by
pumping gas and getting a soccer scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to earn two master's degrees and a doctorate in the
economics of human resources. He eventually became chief economic
adviser to the president of the Central Bank and the minister of
labor during the Fernando Belaunde government of the early 1980s.
He has since worked for the World Bank and directed research at a
prestigious Lima business school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a dreamer,'' Toledo said, ``and I don't apologize for
it.''

 Tessa DeCarlo's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the artist Thomas Kinkade.  
 By TESSA DeCARLO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At a time when ``based on real-life events!''
and ``a true story!'' are the most popular come-ons for everything
from memoirs to movies, an entertaining show at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art investigates contemporary artists' fascination
with the opposite tactics of fakery, disguise and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, titled ``Fact/Fiction: Contemporary Art That
Walks the Line,'' presents 82 works that embrace the appearance and
techniques of realism, yet delight in exposing realism as just
another deception. True, there's nothing new about artists using
deception _ the illusion of perspective, for example, or tricks of
light _ to reveal a higher truth. But in this show, as in a great
deal of art nowadays, the higher truth seems to be that truth
itself is a perilously slippery concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fact/Fiction'' runs through next Sunday and draws on the
museum's permanent holdings and the vast collection of Vicki and
Kent Logan, a local couple who have given or promised more than 300
works to the museum. Thanks to them and other donors, the museum
has been aggressively expanding its contemporary holdings in recent
years, adding works by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and other
big names as well as a host of younger artists.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the wave of new acquisitions helped inspire the show's
theme, says Janet Bishop, the museum's associate curator of
painting and sculpture. ``I noticed that in the justifications we
were writing for acquiring new works, the play between fact and
fiction kept coming up again and again,'' she says. ``It seemed
like a great way to look at our contemporary collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The show starts in the 1960s, with a pile of 11 of Andy Warhol's
Brillo, Campbell's tomato juice and Kellogg's cornflakes boxes _
blocks of wood painted and stenciled to look exactly like the large
cardboard cartons in which these popular consumables travel to
market. On two adjacent walls are a set of Cindy Sherman's
``Untitled Film Stills'' from the late 1970s, with the artist
posing as battered woman, film noir femme and sex kitten. The
juxtaposition reveals that Sherman's photographs are as teasingly
deceptive as Warhol's boxes, and that the cinematic conventions she
exploits are every bit as prefabricated as cereal packages.
</P>
<P>
   On a third wall is a set of more recent fake film stills, a
series of 1996 ``self-portraits'' by Yasumasa Morimura, who
photographs himself elaborately cross-dressed as Liza Minnelli,
Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monroe and other screen divas. Around the
corner are Morimura's three gigantic, digitally created renditions
of himself as da Vinci's Mona Lisa, first clothed, then nude and
pregnant, then in cross-section, revealing the heart, lungs and
fetus within.
</P>
<P>
   The Warhol boxes and Sherman's pictures look austerely classical
by comparison, yet Morimura's exhibitionism also seems like an
inevitable outgrowth of the earlier works' more discreet campiness,
fired by the same desire to reinvent the world rather than merely
comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they're referring to art history or movies or objects
from the everyday world, artists are taking as their starting point
things that people know,'' Bishop says. ``And they're showing that
artists as well as writers are in the wonderful position of being
able to present a new reality.''
</P>
<P>
   If works of art can be said to converse with each other, the
dialogue among the reimagined realities in ``Fact/Fiction'' is the
visual equivalent of a high-energy cocktail party, with allusions,
influences, jokes and arguments caroming off the gallery walls.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in one room a small card concocted by the local
artist Tom Marioni announces that he has just been named the San
Francisco museum's new director _ a hoax that fooled many
colleagues when the artist mailed it in 1971. Across the room, a
small painting by Sandow Birk imagines what the museum and its
environs might look like after several days of aerial bombing. It's
hard to think of a better summing up of artists' love-hate
relationship with the museum as institution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stephanie Syjuco's carefully drawn ``False Botanical
Studies'' of a plastic daisy debate the nature of reality, and the
reality of nature, with Nic Nicosia's obviously staged ``Real
Picture'' of three children burning down a tree.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gober seems to be replying to Warhol's boxes with a
hand-crafted sack of Kitty Litter that slouches in a corner, while
Cindy Sherman's photos turn a cool eye on Jeff Koons' series of
advertisements for himself in which the tanned, blow-dried and
meticulously made-up artist is shown variously embracing pigs and
teaching enthusiastic schoolchildren a lesson on ``Banality as
Savior.''
</P>
<P>
   The show as a whole can even be seen as a high-spirited
rejoinder to the Sol LeWitt retrospective also on view at the
museum. After two floors of LeWitt's insistence that a line is a
line and nothing more, ``Fact/Fiction's'' revelations of the
personal and embrace of the everyday are a welcome change _ even if
they're far from sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the show's most extreme challenge to notions about
what's really real comes from Sherrie Levine's 1981 copies of two
photographs by Walker Evans. Virtually indistinguishable from the
revered photographer's original prints, the two photographs elevate
theft to an art form, and call it ``appropriation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stealing is something everyone understands,'' says Levine, who
confesses she was a shoplifter in her youth. ``They might not like
it, but they get it. And the art history side of it is the fact
that stealing is what all artists do.''
</P>
<P>
   While many works in the show comment on the realities and
unrealities of the art world, others examine the world everybody
else inhabits. Thomas Demand's six-and-a-half-foot-wide photograph
titled ``Corner'' appears at first to depict the most mundane
scene: an office cubicle messily strewn with papers and manuals.
</P>
<P>
   But then the eerie blankness of the desktop, the lack of
identifying names or logos on the manuals and the computer, reveals
that this is in fact a picture _ a strangely beautiful picture _ of
a paper model, which duplicates with fanatical fidelity something
that would probably never engage our attention if it were real.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's most dazzling feats of trompe l'oeil is Steve
Wolfe's three-dimensional rendering of a stack of cardboard cartons
filled with books. The bright colors of the cartons and the
interplay of the book covers _ ``Conversations With Duchamp''
alongside Raymond Carver's ``What We Talk About When We Talk About
Love'' alongside a book about that modernist icon of lovesickness,
Krazy Kat _ offer a feast of visual, historical and philosophical
ideas. But the viewer must see past Wolfe's virtuosity to glimpse
the art beneath the artfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a Tina Barney photograph demonstrates in a different way
how issues of fact and fabrication can become so intertwined they
can hardly be unraveled. The 1989 photo shows Barney, looking tense
and rather aggrieved, talking to her two 20-something sons around a
barbecue grill on a summer evening. It could almost be a snapshot,
yet its size, its technical perfection and the beauty of the colors
and the composition tell us it is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was in fact carefully posed, as Barney hints by
showing the camera's shutter release in her hand. Yet the feelings
revealed in her face were not entirely an act, she says, because
she was genuinely anxious about capturing the shot before the light
faded, and sad that divorce and her sons' growing up seemed to be
dissolving her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing people always want to know more than anything is _
is it real?'' Barney says. Like most of the works in
``Fact/Fiction,'' her photograph answers ``yes'' and ``no'' with
equal truth. (af)

GORE PROPOSES NEW BENEFITS FOR PARENTS AND WIDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Vice President Al Gore proposed on Tuesday
expanding Social Security benefits for widows and parents who take
time off from work to care for families, asserting that the current
rules have unfairly penalized women.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Social Security Act was 65 years old, Gore also
accused Gov. George W. Bush, his likely Republican opponent, of
proposing a ``risky tax-cut scheme'' and other policies that would
drain dollars from the retirement system and threaten its long-term
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush seems to think that 65 years of the current
Social Security system is more than enough,'' Gore said at an event
before retirees, echoing what is becoming a familiar attack line.
``If he got his hands on America's retirement system, it would
quickly become a system of social insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals would partly end what he called ``the
motherhood penalty'' under which parents who stop working to raise
their children see their retirement benefits slip. They would also
raise the benefits paid to widows by up to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two plans, which would raise annual benefits for 11 million
individuals by $600 to $1,000 each, were considered modest. But
they gave Gore an opportunity to praise what he called the
``magnificent'' Social Security system, as well as ``honor'' women
who raise children rather than work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's done it knows what hard work it is,'' Gore said
of child raising. ``Should we honor that work? Of course we
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said his proposals would be financed by the Social
Security surplus, now projected at $2.2 trillion in the coming
decade. But they would not estimate a cost beyond saying the plans
would use less than 5 percent of the surplus, or less than $100
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore courted women voters on Tuesday, his focus on Social
Security also let him underscore what he considers the sharp
differences between himself and Bush on a core Democratic program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for using the Social Security surplus to shore
up the system, now projected to become insolvent by 2037. He
contends that Bush's plan to cut taxes by $483 billion in five
years would force the government to use the surplus to pay for
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denies that. The Texas governor also proposes using the
Social Security surplus to bolster the system. Unlike Gore, he
would let payees invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks to
raise returns.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Bush, also campaigning in Pennsylvania, said Gore had
played down the system's problems. ``There needs to be Social
Security reform to make sure there's a Social Security system at
all,'' he said. ``This is a system that I believe needs to be
fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security benefits are based on the number of years a
person is employed; thus, women who stay home for part of their
work life to raise children tend to receive lower benefits than men
upon retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would credit stay-at-home parents _ men and women _ with
$16,500 in income for up to five years, lifting benefits by an
average of $600 a year for as many as eight million people, his
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   For widows, Social Security benefits are now cut by a third to a
half of a couple's combined benefits. Gore would lift a survivor's
benefits to 75 percent of the couple's _ raising them an average of
$1,000 a year for as many as 3 million people, according to his
aides.

WHAT'S BEHIND THE SMILE? MAYBE AN OFFER TO RUN FOR VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Like impatient relatives expecting a wedding
announcement, reporters analyzed every nuance of the political
flirtation between Govs. George W. Bush of Texas and Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, looking for signs of a ring.
</P>
<P>
   There was the frequency of their exchanged smiles and the
gallantry in the way they introduced each other to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was where Bush chose to stay between campaign
appearances in Pennsylvania on Monday and Tuesday: at Ridge's pad.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels had been good enough last week when Bush dropped in on
Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Why the change?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiscally conservative; huge TV screen for the Final Four; like
him,'' said Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
aboard his campaign plane on Monday afternoon, suggesting that
thrift and college basketball were secondary in the equation.
</P>
<P>
   His coy, teasing manner indicated an understanding of what
reporters, Washington pundits and aficionados of politics
everywhere really wanted to know. Was Ridge a serious vice
presidential possibility? And if not him, who?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no lists, and I won't for awhile,'' Bush insisted at a
news conference on Tuesday in Abington, Pa., near Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Less than a month after he and Vice President Al Gore
effectively secured their parties' presidential nominations, the
guessing game is in full swing, with a dizzying array of names
being tossed around, and the two candidates' actions being
scrutinized for even the murkiest signals.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline, an Internet journal that political junkies read
with an almost fanatical devotion, recently published the names of
22 Republicans and 20 Democrats who might make the vice
presidential cut. The lengths of those lists have raised hedging to
a new level and have guaranteed contented hours of cocktail
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Gumbel last week apportioned a lengthy segment of his CBS
morning program, ``The Early Show,'' to the soothsayings of Jack
Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996, and former
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Both men readily conceded that it was too soon to credibly
handicap the vice presidential sweepstakes, then went ahead and did
precisely that, proving that when it comes to the political world's
closest approximation of the Oscars, nobody can resist.
</P>
<P>
   Political operatives in and around Washington say that the
casual conversation about the subject has become nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Greg Mueller, a Republican
strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Steve Forbes.
``A lot of us consultants work for corporations not necessarily
involved in politics, but the first topic when you sit down at a
table is always, `Who is Bush going to pick?' or `Who is Gore going
to pick?' The list grows with every meeting inside the Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the roll call often begins with Ridge,
in part because Gen. Colin Powell has repeatedly disavowed any
interest. Other names include Thompson, Gov. Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Rep.
John R. Kasich of Ohio, former Defense Secretary Richard Cheney,
Sen. Connie Mack of Florida and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the chatter encompasses Sen. Bob Graham
of Florida, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, Sen. Richard Durbin of
Illinois, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, Sen. Dianne Feinstein
of California and Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The mention of almost any of these names is accompanied by an
elaborate rationale. The argument for Ridge reflects several
factors that are typically cited and often guide the selection of a
vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Geography, for starters. Ridge, in his second term as governor,
leads a state that has the fifth highest number of electoral votes,
23, and does not lean too strongly in either party's direction. His
presence on the ticket could tip Pennsylvania toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Biography. Presidential candidates often choose running mates
who offset their potential weaknesses. Bush, 53, was a child of
privilege who did not fight in Vietnam, while Ridge, 54, grew up in
humbler circumstances and earned a bronze star for his tour of duty
there.
</P>
<P>
   Religion. Ridge, who is Roman Catholic, could strengthen Bush's
appeal to voters of that faith and help undo any lingering damage
from Bush's visit to Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school
with a history of anti-Catholic bias.
</P>
<P>
   Political record. This is where Ridge represents either a bold
opportunity or a potential disaster, and it all boils down to his
support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing Ridge, Bush might be able to diminish fears among
some swing voters that he is too far to the right on social issues.
But he might also inflame social and religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and Ridge traveled around Pennsylvania this week,
reporters repeatedly asked the Texas governor whether Ridge's
position on abortion would remove him from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush answered somewhat evasively, saying the principal criteria
he would use to pick a vice president were whether the person was
ready to become president and whether the person liked him.
</P>
<P>
   Although the question was serious, it did not seem to prevent
the two governors from toying with all the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure, over the next couple of months, people are going to
say, `Did the governor call you?,''' Ridge said on Monday afternoon
in Aliquippa, Pa., just outside Pittsburgh. ``And I'm just not
going to tell you if he calls or when he calls. And I think it's
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the governor's call, pure and simple,'' Ridge continued,
dwelling on the topic for an awfully long time. ``And the last
thing in that very important process he needs is a bunch of other
elected officials running around saying, `Hey, I got a call! I got
a call! I'm on the list! I'm on the list!'''
</P>
<P>
   As he chanted those last lines, he pumped his hands up and down,
mimicking an excited little boy. Bush raised his eyebrows at the
spectacle.
</P>

   ``You want to try that again?'' Bush said, and the two men's
reactions demonstrated yet another reason they might want to join
forces. They laugh at the same jokes.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most radio shows are as predictable as sunrise. Dean
Olsher has decided to surprise listeners by following his own
fancy. Olsher, a former cultural correspondent for National Public
Radio, will be the host of ``The Next Big Thing,'' a one-hour
weekend program that will go on the air this summer on WNYC.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner in Manhattan, months before its debut, he said
excitedly, ``It will be about anything.'' Not about the next big
thing? ``No,'' he said, laughing, ``the title is ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   To give listeners an idea of what he is up to, Olsher, who at 36
looks like a young college professor, has been presenting a series
of specials to commemorate WNYC's 75th anniversary. The first,
``This Is What I Live For,'' broadcast earlier in the year, will be
rebroadcast this Sunday at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As the show begins, Charles Mingus's mellow ``II B.S'' fades in
the background. ``Pop psychologists have started to tell us that
it's a bad idea to equate who we are with what we do for a
living,'' Olsher says. ```Don't define yourself by your job,' they
say.'' The Mingus returns before he continues. ``It's such a downer
when somebody says, `That's why they call it work; otherwise they'd
call it play.' Wouldn't it be great if that idea would be replaced
with what Buddhists call `right livelihood' _ the idea that what
you do for a living should be a natural extension of your
personality?''
</P>
<P>
   The talk then turns to dream jobs, with Olsher confessing his
own secret wish to play cello with the Guarneri Quartet. But is
David Soyer, the cellist with the Guarneri Quartet, content? No, it
turns out. When Soyer comes on the air, he fantasizes about being a
tugboat captain, although not in choppy seas. What about the
tugboat captain Buddy Cantrelle? The job is lonely, he reports.
Running a Cajun restaurant might be cozier. And so it goes, until
Olsher discovers, in his idiosyncratic survey, that nothing beats
being paid for animal care.
</P>
<P>
   How quirky can jobs get? Olsher visits the actress Sally Parrish
backstage at the acclaimed play ``Wit''; though pivotal to the
drama, she has few moments onstage. Dolly Gallo. 85, explains why
she does not want to be paid for selling gifts at a South Street
Seaport shop, interspersing gossip about her customers with salty
memories of her childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Other unusual New Yorkers appear before the program closes with
a dramatic reading by the actor Barnard Hughes of Herman Melville's
melancholy short story, ``Bartleby the Scrivener,'' whose
protagonist stubbornly refuses to work. Artfully, Olsher comes full
circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about ideas for
upcoming programs,'' Olsher said. One brainstorm led to a segment
in February called ``Every Day Is a New Thing to See'' in which he
accompanied the architectural historian Tony Hiss on a tour of
Grand Central Terminal, chancing upon little-known glories.
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, the writer Paul Auster read from his
stories about the physical space of New York. A March special on
consumption, ``How Can Anybody Explain the Success of a Product
Like Jell-O,'' sparkled with segments by David Rakoff and Janeane
Garofalo doing improv comedy in the style of Nichols and May.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Olsher was destined to create a radio program. How many
kids spend their youth, as he did in rural Hunterdon County, N.J.,
ignoring television and hooked on ``The Bob and Ray Show'' on WOR
and Jonathan Schwartz on WNEW? ``I always got attached to the
people on the radio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After college at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Mass., and
graduate studies in musicology at the University of North Carolina,
he signed on as the afternoon announcer at WUNC in Chapel Hill in
1985 and freelanced cultural reports for NPR before being hired as
a correspondent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cappello, director of programming at WNYC, was crucial in
getting ``The Next Big Thing'' on the air. ``Dean had been a
standout on NPR,'' Cappello said. ``I wanted to set him free.''
They had both been thinking about a New York-focused show with a
magazine format that would do things differently.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Laura Walker, president of WNYC, was already
planning to expand the station's cultural programming. ``I'd like
to see the arts talked about with the same passion as sports and
politics,'' she said. Later this year, the station will broadcast
another cultural program, ``Studio 360,'' with the journalist Kurt
Andersen as host.
</P>
<P>
   But even with WNYC's enthusiastic support, Olsher has a tough
road ahead. While special series and shows devoted to music are
mainstays of public radio, daily and weekly cultural programs have
not had much luck. The few noteworthy exceptions include Garrison
Keillor's ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' from Minnesota Public
Radio; Terry Gross's ``Fresh Air,'' from WHYY in Philadelphia;
Leonard Lopate's ``New York &AMP; Company,'' from WNYC; and a relative
newcomer, Ira Glass's ``This American Life,'' from WBEZ in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One reason for their scarcity is that ever since NPR became a
major news source during the Persian Gulf war in 1990, news has
increasingly dominated air time on public radio. ``We spend five
times more money on news than culture,'' said Kevin Klose, NPR's
president, vowing a change. In fact, the network just hired Bill
Davis, former general manager of WUNC in Chapel Hill, specifically
to oversee that change.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the field think it will take a minor revolution for
public radio to regain its creativity. Partly out of frustration,
Jay Kernis, who had produced popular news-oriented programs for
NPR, left the network in 1987 to become a producer of ``60
Minutes'' on CBS-TV. For Kernis, the question is whether NPR and
Public Radio International (PRI) are supplying the 600 public radio
stations with the programming they should have.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, he said, echoing the CBS producer Don Hewitt, has a
journalism part and a show business part, an Edward R. Murrow side
and an Ed Sullivan side. ``Right now,'' he said, ``the Murrow side
is more appreciated. We need storytellers. People are hungry for
shows like `A Prairie Home Companion,' `Fresh Air' and `This
American Life.'''
</P>
<P>
   These programs were not overnight hits. ``A Prairie Home
Companion'' went on the air in 1974 and was only picked up by NPR
in 1979. Gross, considered by her peers to be one of the best
interviewers in the business, became the host of ``Fresh Air'' in
1975 and slowly built enough of a following to be distributed
nationally by NPR in 1989. Glass's ``This American Life,'' with its
first-person stories, fiction and poetry, has been on the air since
1995 and is now one of the fastest growing programs in public
radio, nationally distributed by PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how to market myself,'' Glass said. ``I hired a
part-time publicist, sent out funny postcards, and offered every
station entertaining spots for their pledge drives.'' Just as
important, Glass connected with his listeners.
</P>
<P>
   But charismatic hosts and lively subjects do not necessarily
keep shows on the air. In 1989, NPR launched ``Heat,'' with John
Hockenberry as the host. An innovative mix of public affairs
segments and performances, it lasted barely a year. ``The recession
came along, and the network wasn't finding the underwriting dollars
they had committed to,'' said Steve Rathe, president of Murray
Street Enterprise, which created the program with WGBH in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't NPR's own baby. I understand.'' Sometimes, he said,
even the brightest executives cannot identify the next good thing.
``The greatest successes have been built by passionate _ maybe a
little crazy _ individuals scattered around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adventurous program, ``Anthem,'' produced by NPR in
1998, did not last quite two years. One of its hosts, Rick Karr,
now an NPR cultural correspondent, thinks its concept was too
complex to sell to stations. ``It was more than offbeat music,'' he
said. ``We couldn't sum it up in 10 words. It was also expensive.
The best way to launch one of these programs is fast and cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   But someone also has to be willing to stay with them while they
build an audience, as Melinda Ward, a senior vice president at PRI,
has done with ``Sound and Spirit.'' That show, introduced at WGBH
in Boston in 1996, draws on a wide variety of spiritual music and
ideas. ``It took quite a while for people to know what to expect
from it,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Olsher fully appreciates the risks of his venture; still, he is
intrepid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel,'' he said, ``as if I've found the keys to the
sandbox.'' That must be something like discovering your ``right
livelihood.'' (af)

INVESTORS AND EXECUTIVES TAKING TECH STOCK TURMOIL IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: See also STOCKS-MARKETPLACE)  
 By MATT RICHTEL and KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On their roller-coaster ride Tuesday, investors and
executives in technology companies traded on the Nasdaq market
could be expected to feel a little queasy.
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker approached Dr. Pehong Chen, chief executive of a
software company called Broadvision, based in Redwood City, Calif.,
and asked him how he was early in the morning. ``He saw me standing
at the trash can and thought I was throwing up,'' Chen said. In
fact, ``I was peeling an orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he had lost about $2.5 billion on paper in the
last two weeks, Chen seemed calm Tuesday Then again, his stake is
still worth at least a couple of billion dollars, since the stock
was one of the best performers on Nasdaq last year.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives punished by the stock market also sounded
philosophical, suggesting that they had hit a speed bump _ and
nothing more. Their comments were echoed by many smaller investors,
who continue to sit on profits after a year of tremendous gains.
Some even find the rapid decline an encouraging sign because
excesses are being quickly wrung out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valuations were such that this was a balloon looking for a
pin,'' said Kent Simons, manager of the $2 billion Neuberger Berman
Focus fund. ``Things that used to take six or seven weeks are now
over in six or seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a few days it has been. A rout that began in the Nasdaq
market early last week picked up steam Monday as investors braced
for the ruling that Microsoft had violated antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices plunged Tuesday morning and early afternoon in what
some traders described as panic selling by individuals and hedge
funds forced to unload shares to meet margin calls. At one point,
the Nasdaq composite index was down nearly 575 points, or 13.6
percent. That spilled over to the Dow Jones industrial average,
which fell as much as 504 points, or 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The panic lifted soon afterward as one market participant said
mutual funds began buying. The major averages then retraced much of
the lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones
industrial average had recorded their largest point swings ever.
Though the major averages closed only moderately lower than they
had on Monday, the final numbers do not convey the volatility, nor
the pain and psychological damage inflicted on investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only positive thing you can take away from this is that
you did see almost capitulation selling,'' said Rob Cohen co-head
of block trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Nasdaq composite was down 74.79, or 1.8
percent, to 4,148.89. The 634-point swing in Nasdaq from its peak
to its trough Tuesday was its biggest ever in a single day and was,
in fact, twice the previous record of 328 points on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   At its low point, the Nasdaq was down nearly 28 percent from its
peak March 10. By the end of the day, it was about 18 percent off
its peak. For the year, it remains ahead 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the day, the Dow slipped 57.09, or 0.5 percent, to
11,164.84. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index shed 11.24, or 0.8
percent, to 1,494.73.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is just wishful thinking, but stock analysts said
some of the speculative excess that has been building in technology
stocks has now been purged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who thought the market owed them a living now
realize that the market won't go up forever,'' said Laszlo Birinyi,
who runs his own stock market research firm in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said
``a lot of speculators have either seen the light or run out of
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of highly speculative companies in the technology and
Internet world suffered the most, and by some counts, they have
further to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, a St.
Louis-based brokerage firm, said stock values have been totally out
of whack. ``We have a new economy, but the same old rules of
investing still apply,'' he said. If you buy companies with no
earnings, ``you're going to get burned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the beginning of the end of the wild wild
west style of investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrainka pointed to a joint study by Edward Jones and Ned Davis
Research, a securities research firm in Venice, Fla., on the stock
performance of companies whose shares reached levels equivalent to
100 times their annual earnings. Among the resulting 1,780 Nasdaq
stocks since 1972 (ending in 1995), the 5-year median return was
just over 10 percent, or 2 percent a year. And the risk was 17
times more for these stocks than for the S&AMP;P 500 and 100 times more
than for Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kerschner, chief market strategist at Paine Webber,
issued a warning last week about the values of what he called the
``New, New Industrial'' stocks trading at high multiples of
earnings, if they have earnings that is. As of Tuesday morning, the
stocks on his list, including Ciena, Akamai and Juniper Networks,
were still about 40 percent overvalued, Kerschner said. By midday,
those stocks ``were down another 15 percent to 20 percent,'' he
said. ``That means they need to fall another 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even as he called for a sharp correction in these stocks last
week, Kerschner reiterated his generally positive outlook for
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you will see a widespread correction, but a
cleansing action in the frothier parts of the Nasdaq,'' he said.
``Overall, the market is still trading at attractive levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is still strong, said Simons of Neuberger. ``The
fundamental outlook is actually a lot better than the price action
in Nasdaq would have you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors who have ridden the technology wave in recent years
cannot be easily shaken from their seats. Howard Appel, 43, of
Merrick, N.Y., said Tuesday that he had a big loss in his 401(k)
retirement account because it was invested in technology stocks.
``If I was retiring in the next few years, I'd be in a panic,'' he
said. ``It's not fun losing $50,000 in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I`m going to be able to buy a lot more shares at a lower
price,'' he added. ``I expect in the near future, technology and
the Nasdaq are going to come roaring back.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hopkins, a 68-year-old retired publisher of trade
magazines who lives in Keswick, Va., said he remained on the
sidelines Tuesday. ``I was tracking it all day long,'' he said. ``I
don't think anybody could watch it and not be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he did not sell anything in his portfolio, which has
fat profits from recent years. ``I'm still playing on house
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Silicon Valley, where so much wealth has been
minted in the last few years, there is plenty of ticker checking
going on in the hallways at work. And the tension is heightened at
companies whose insiders will soon get their first chance to sell
after the lock-up period _ imposed after a public offering. More
than half the initial public offerings of stock this year are now
trading under their offering price, challenging the market wisdom
that getting into a hot IPO is easy money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beindorff, president and chief operating officer of
PlanetrX.com, an online pharmacy based in South San Francisco, said
that the volatility is `not terribly surprising.'' Still, ``It's
scary for everybody,'' said the executive, whose stock went public
in October, peaked around $36, hung around $20, but then slid
steadily. It finished yesterday at a new low of $5.6875, down from
its $16 offering price.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has been under pressure because its lock-up period
ended on Monday, Beindorff said. In recent days retail investors
sold the stock in anticipation that company insiders would do so
when they could, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the demoralizing dips, executives at some of these
technology companies said it was premature to consider buying back
company stock or repricing options granted to employees. The
message they are trying to send to employees is that if they keep
the company on track, valuations will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Slatt, 41, chairman and chief executive of WatchGuard
Technologies, an Internet security firm in Seattle whose stock has
fallen 30 points in the last several weeks to $75.50, but which
remains far above its opening price of $13 last July, sent an
e-mail designed to bolster employee morale 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these fluctuations, you'll literally drive yourself mad
looking everyday'' at your personal worth, said Slatt, whose said
his own net worth has fallen some $500 million in the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he and other executives of public companies say they are
keenly aware of one benchmark: how their own company's stock is
doing relative to that of direct competitors. In short, executives
say they have learned to live with wild drops they say are largely
beyond their control, but are far less comfortable when their
stocks fall in percentage terms more than that of business rivals.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Our Song,'' which will be shown Wednesday night and
Thursday night as part of the New Directors/New Films festival at
the Museum of Modern Art, follows three young friends through the
languid, anxious days of a summer in Brooklyn. In the course of the
film, which moves with the ease and warmth of its season and place,
Lanisha, Jocelyn and Maria face the usual dilemmas and frustrations
of teen-age life in America _ and in the movies _ today. They shop
(and shoplift), daydream about their futures, boys and exotic ice
cream flavors, anticipate the coming of the school year and
navigate the treacherous tides of sexuality, social ambition and
loyalty to one another.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Our Song,'' written and directed by Jim McKay, is so
unlike most Hollywood coming-of-age stories as to seem downright
revolutionary. The three young women live in a housing project in
Crown Heights, and their school has been shut down for asbestos
removal. Maria, whose father is in jail, lives with her overwhelmed
mother and her budding male-chauvinist younger brother. Lanisha's
loving, not entirely reliable father is a doorman in a fancy
apartment building. Jocelyn works in a boutique and fantasizes
about opening a store of her own, as a fallback in case her singing
career fails to take off.
</P>
<P>
   McKay refuses to make a big deal of his characters'
circumstances, or to hang message boards around their necks. He
respects them too much for that. ``Our Song'' steers clear of the
condescension and sentimentality that color most contemporary
cinematic portrayals of female adolescence. Even more remarkable,
it avoids the sensationalism and ideological point-scoring that
dominate most discussions of race, urban poverty and teen-age
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   McKay directs in such an understated, self-effacing manner _ the
opening credits proclaim it a film by everyone involved in its
making, their names projected simultaneously and unhierarchically _
that what he has accomplished may not be immediately apparent.
Unlike many other young independent filmmakers, he does not
flourish his stylistic chops or flaunt his mastery of film history.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a movie less self-indulgent than ``Our
Song,'' or one more completely absorbed in the complex humanity of
its subjects. It has the intimacy of real life, and you feel by the
end that Lanisha, Jocelyn and Maria are people you know, whose
inner lives and defining relationships have become part of your own
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Song'' was shot entirely on location, with a cast that
includes residents of the neighborhood, most notably the Jackie
Robinson Steppers, a real-life marching band to which the three
fictional heroines belong and whose music and choreography provide
some extra aural and visual excitement. But if the film has the
look of a documentary, it has the psychological density and
narrative coherence of a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three principal characters undergoes a subtle but
decisive change and faces a life-defining choice at a scarily young
age. Jocelyn (Anna Simpson) begins to gravitate toward a more
popular, worldly group of friends and seems impatient with the
passive, slow-moving Maria (Melissa Martinez), whose unexpected
pregnancy is the dramatic linchpin of the film. Lanisha (Kerry
Washington), who has been pregnant herself, tries to remain true to
her friends while steering her own course toward maturity and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is presented with passionate sympathy, with quiet
good humor and almost entirely without melodrama. Watching Simpson,
Martinez and Washington, none of whom has appeared in a movie
before, you forget that they are acting, which means they are
acting very well. Martinez shows us a young woman who is indecisive
and somewhat lost, but also sensual, sensitive and smarter than she
seems at first. Simpson lets us see Jocelyn's pluck as well as her
vanity. Washington is, simply, a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   McKay's first feature, ``Girls Town,'' won a filmmaker's trophy
and a special jury award at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival. That
film, which celebrated the Thelma-and-Louise-like rebellion of a
group of high school seniors fed up with the callousness and
brutality of men, anticipated some of the themes of ``Our Song,''
even as it nearly drowned them in earnest political sentiment. In
spite of its rough edges, ``Girls Town'' showed McKay to be a
thoughtful, promising director. With ``Our Song'' he has proved
himself to be something more: an indispensable filmmaker.

   Given her theatrical pedigree, Hayley Mills must be aware of
more than a few show business maxims. For example: try to avoid
following a tough act, and, there is no tougher act than a cute
kid.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when you're your own toughest act to follow?
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Mills has already found out, having worked on the
London stage for the last 30 years. But in this country she is
still best known as that saucer-eyed little girl in such popular
Disney films as ``Pollyanna'' (for which she won a special 1960
Academy Award), ``The Parent Trap'' (1961) and ``That Darn Cat''
(1965).
</P>
<P>
   If Mills has her way, her New York stage debut will begin the
third act of what has already been a long career. The London-born
actress, who turns an impossibly young-looking 54 next week, opens
Monday at the Lucille Lortel Theater in ``Noel Coward's Suite in
Two Keys,'' an evening of two one-act plays directed by John
Tillinger. The cast also includes Judith Ivey and Paxton Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my green card and I'm not leaving,'' she warned over
tea after a rehearsal. ``I always knew I'd end up here. Not that
I'm not terrified. But as someone said, if it doesn't terrify you,
it's not worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills still exudes the charm of a precocious child. Blonde and
spritelike, she playfully drums her heels when she forgets a line,
or tilts her head and smiles coyly when she wants an interview to
end. She wears a heavy silver bracelet with which she fidgets.
Lacking a spoon, she stirs her tea with the stem of her sunglasses
and giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Mills is the daughter of the celebrated English actor John Mills
and the novelist and playwright Mary Hayley Bell. She made her
acting debut in the 1958 British film ``Tiger Bay'' at the ripe old
age of 12. In his autobiography, Mills' father, who was also in the
cast, wrote of that experience, ``She looked as if she'd been born
in front of a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   To those old enough to remember, it never seemed otherwise.
After seeing her in ``Tiger Bay,'' Walt Disney called her ``the
greatest movie find in 25 years'' and his company signed her to a
five-year contract. In 1961 she starred with Alan Bates in
``Whistle Down the Wind,'' based on the novel by her mother. A song
she performed in ``The Parent Trap,'' titled ``Let's Get
Together,'' made her a minor recording star at the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   But while the young Hayley enjoyed being a well-known juvenile
performer, she found the plucky persona limiting. She continued to
make movies on both sides of the Atlantic, receiving a spotty
education (arithmetic between takes, according to Mills), but
``always feeling a hunger to read and learn what an educated person
should know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was desperate for roles that American audiences were
unprepared to see me play,'' she added. At the age of 14, she was
offered the title part in Stanley Kubrick's film ``Lolita.'' ``But
it was made quite clear to me by Disney, my parents, everyone, that
that wasn't going to happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, she looked to the British stage for professional
fulfillment. Cutting back on film work, Mills said she taught
herself how to act for the theater: ``My debut, `Peter Pan,' was
not that far off from what I had done in film. But then I was cast
in `The Three Sisters'!''
</P>
<P>
   This baptism-by-Chekhov was daunting for Mills, then 23, but she
remembers it as the beginning of a second chance at gaining an
education as well as the inaugural moment of a successful second
career. ``I had been in film since I was 12, and had hit a wall,''
she said. ``I learned about literature and about life through the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   This self-education has paid off, Tillinger said: ``There is
none of the usual overly broad style one often sees when a
Hollywood star gets onstage. It's partly intuitive and partly
because she comes from a theatrical family _ not only her father
but her sister as well.'' Juliet Mills, an actress best known as
the Nanny in the television sitcom ``Nanny and the Professor'' and
now starring in the NBC soap opera ``Passions,'' is five years
older.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About his current production, Tillinger said: ``Hayley brings
proper restraint to two very different roles in these Coward plays.
In the first, she is a sort of faded English rose. In the second,
she is this rigid German figure.''
</P>
<P>
   The two plays that make up ``Suite in Two Keys'' are ``Shadows
of the Evening,'' a drama about a publisher, his wife and mistress,
and ``A Song at Twilight,'' a breezy play about a novelist (based
loosely on W. Somerset Maugham), his German wife and a former
mistress who possesses passionate letters the novelist once wrote
to a male lover.
</P>
<P>
   While both bristle with Coward's heightened language, they are,
Tillinger said, widely different in tone: `` `Shadows of the
Evening' ends up a very quiet play, really Coward's farewell to the
world. `A Song at Twilight' is very, very funny, more to do with
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The plays were originally performed in London in 1966 as ``Suite
in Three Keys'' (with a third short play, ``Come Into the Garden,
Maud'') and a cast that included Coward, Lilli Palmer and Irene
Worth. A longer version of ``A Song at Twilight'' recently ran in
London's West End in an acclaimed production starring Vanessa
Redgrave and her brother, Corin.
</P>
<P>
   While touring the United States in 1997 as Anna in ``The King
and I,'' Mills learned, with a mix of delight and bemusement, that
Americans still see her as a spunky little girl. ``And it's all
generations,'' she said. ``Grannies remember me from my Disney days
and now a whole new generation of 6-year-olds from videotapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills has two grown sons: Crispian, 27, from her marriage to the
film director Roy Boulting, and Jason, 23, whom she had with the
actor Leigh Lawson. It is partly the empty-nest syndrome that has
made her take the plunge in New York, she said, as well as a new
romance with a Persian-American actor, Firdous Bamji, who lives in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said that her nervousness about her New York debut has
been reduced by the fact that she feels at home in the world of
Coward. No wonder: he was the godfather of Juliet Mills, and the
two sisters toured Britain and Australia in his ``Fallen Angels''
in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more,'' Mills said, ``Coward really gave my father his
first big break in the theater. After seeing him make an entrance
on roller skates and fall, in a small touring production of
`Hamlet' in Singapore, Coward went backstage. My father sat in the
dressing room, hand bandaged up, and Coward said, `Good
entrance.''' When John Mills returned to London, Coward cast him in
some roles, and his career took off.
</P>
<P>
   At 92, John Mills still performs a one-man comic memoir that his
daughter describes as hilarious. ``He's quite good, although he
can't see,'' she said. ``So there are big lines painted on the
stage to keep him from disappearing into the orchestra pit.''
</P>
<P>
   If this theatrical longevity is inherited, then Mills is only
about halfway through her career. ``Who knows?'' she asked. ``Maybe
you (italics)can(end italics) be young again.''

TENSIONS GROW AS INS URGES U.S. RELATIVES TO RELINQUISH CUSTODY OF
CUBAN BOY  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immigration officials pressed the Miami relatives
of Elian Gonzalez to relinquish custody of the boy as tensions grew
Tuesday in the Cuban exile community in anticipation of the arrival
of Juan Miguel Gonzalez to reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   Visas were issued Tuesday morning in Havana by the U.S. State
Department interest section to Gonzalez, Elian's stepmother and
stepbrother, his former kindergarten teacher, a pediatrician and a
cousin. The move cleared the way for Gonzalez to travel to the
United States at any time. But he has said he will not make the
trip until he receives assurances that his son will be returned.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives were still balking Tuesday night at
the idea of handing over the 6-year-old to his father, who has not
seen his son since November when he was taken from Cuba by his
mother in an attempt to reach the United States by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Justice Department officials said negotiations
would resume Thursday, but they insisted they are prepared to
revoke the temporary custody status the Miami relatives now have in
order to comply with U.S. immigration laws and a federal court
decision mandating that the boy be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez has been living with relatives in Miami since he
was rescued at sea more than four months ago after the boat he was
on sank trying to cross from Cuba to Miami. His mother and 10 other
Cubans drowned, but Elian and two others managed to survive by
clinging to an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday when Juan Miguel Gonzalez might make
the trip to reclaim his son, or whether he would fly to Washington
or Miami to await the custody transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said they hope the reunion will take
place in Miami. But the situation there, especially in the Little
Havana neighborhood where the boy has been living since his
relatives were given temporary custody, is volatile. Local
officials fear there could be violent protests from the Cuban exile
community if the INS attempts to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, Miami police stood by and watched as
dozens of protesters broke through barriers keeping them away from
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle whom Elian has been
staying with. The protesters linked arms to form a chain around the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian is not leaving,'' they shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez said the boy's father would be welcomed in his
home if he comes to Miami. ``Don't ever doubt the Gonzalez family
has their door open for their family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wallis, director of immigration services for the Miami
area, reiterated that the transfer of custody will take place, but
suggested that it might not happen immediately, as Juan Miguel
Gonzalez wants.
</P>
<P>
   Washington attorney Gregory Craig, who represented President
Clinton during his impeachment trial last year, was in discussions
with the INS Tuesday on how the transfer of custody will take
place. Craig is representing Juan Miguel Gonzalez as he seeks to
reunite with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department rejected a plea by the boy's Miami
relatives that a panel of psychologists be appointed to examine
Elian and help determine whether he should remain in the United
States or be returned to Cuba with his father. One Justice
Department official said the boy might be examined by a doctor but
only in the context of helping to ease the transition from his
Miami relatives back to his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in consultation with the
Justice Department, is still considering whether to grant visas to
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, and 21
other Cubans, including 12 kindergarten classmates of Elian, to
help ease his transition back into Cuban life.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 6-year-old has apparently not been told that his
father and other family members may be coming to the United States.
Marisleysis Gonzalez, Lazaro's daughter who has been caring for the
boy, said Elian has not been told because the last time she
mentioned it to him he became upset. She continued to insist that
he does not want to go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's case, meanwhile, continued to play center stage in the
presidential campaign with Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush issuing statements about it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program, said the boy
should be allowed to return with his father to Cuba ``if the father
says on free soil that he believes that the son should go back to
Cuba with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But he called on government authorities to allow a family court
to decide custody, a position that the boy's Miami relatives have
taken in their appeal of the recent federal court ruling upholding
INS efforts to reunite the boy and his father.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, echoed that
view. He called on Attorney General Janet Reno to make sure that
the final outcome in the case is decided by a Florida family court.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Gore ``agree that the family court in Florida
ought to determine the fate of this young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that's where the decision will be made,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That view is also held by many lawmakers in Congress, where
legislation is pending that would grant permanent residency to
Elian, his father and immediate family in order to prevent the boy
from being taken back to Cuba. Gore said last week that he supports
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   However, short of votes, sponsors of the legislation indicated
Tuesday that they may push instead for a nonbinding resolution
urging that the boy's custody be decided by an impartial panel, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he may introduce such a measure
this week as an amendment to the fiscal 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that nearly two-thirds of Americans disagree
with the political leaders on the issue and believe that U.S.
authorities are right in pushing to reunite the father with his son
and facilitate his return to Cuba.

   KALININGRAD, Russia _ If President-elect Vladimir Putin is going
to fight corruption and lawlessness in Russia, as he has vowed to
do in the wake of last month's election, he might start here on the
southern shore of the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   This territory of rolling farmland where Putin's wife, Lyudmila,
grew up and where the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant
devoted much of his life to the study of morality is about as
corrupt as any in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A region the size of Connecticut that was seized from Germany
during World War II, Kaliningrad was a closed city until 1990,
serving as the headquarters of the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Now
separated from the rest of Russia by 400 miles of Lithuanian and
Belarussian territory, the region and its capital, formerly known
as Koenigsberg, are today ruled by Gov. Leonid P. Gorbenko, a
political boss who is built like a refrigerator and is a law unto
himself.
</P>
<P>
   To many here, he is simply known by the Russian diminutive term
that translates roughly as ``Pappy,'' or maybe ``Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after the Soviet collapse, the rough-hewn and
hot-tempered Gorbenko rose from the waterfront, where he ran the
docks as port manager. Despite press coverage that he was under
investigation for embezzlement, he won election in 1996. Since
then, he has issued a decree as governor to take personal control
of the cigarette, auto and liquor import trade, positioning himself
as the essential middleman in the region's business. Here,
importers of duty-free goods must be licensed in an auction process
controlled by his office, which invariably rewards the governor's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   When the local parliament accused the governor of frequently
breaking the laws of fiscal accountability and of illegally seizing
budget money, the members of parliament said he simply turned off
the electricity of the parliament building for eight months last
year and stopped the salaries paid to members.
</P>
<P>
   The members of parliament who audit the budget said that tens of
millions of dollars of government funds had disappeared during the
governor's tenure, and that each year's audit of his budget had
been sent to the state prosecutor with a request to investigate
irregularities and missing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unfortunate fact that in Russia today the governors
have turned into untouchable barons reminiscent of feudal times
where they swear an oath to the sovereign but then do whatever they
want,'' said Nikolai P. Tulayev, a former naval officer who serves
as the deputy chairman of the Law and Order Committee of the
Kaliningrad Duma, or regional parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Added Aleksandr G. Khmurchik, editor in chief of Kaliningrad's
largest newspaper, Kaliningrad Pravda, ``What we have here is an
authority that is tied to criminality and does not function as an
authority elected by the people, but as a power that works for
itself and protects its own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the challenge for the newly elected Russian
president. Putin cannot lay the foundations for the rule of law nor
make the country safe for foreign investment nor usher in a new era
of economic development without doing something about the corrupt
regional overlords like Gorbenko.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Putin chooses to act, the task will not be easy, because
the governor, and many other regional officials like him, are not
exactly outsiders. Gorbenko, for instance, is one of the founding
members of the Unity Party, a coalition of governors, mayors and
other regional leaders who last fall formed a new power bloc to
support Putin's candidacy for president and to create a
pro-government majority in the national Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``What frightens us is that so far, Putin has not taken any
strict measures against Gorbenko,'' said Igor Rostov, a television
executive whose news programs have exposed corruption and
criticized the governor during the last three years. ``And because
Gorbenko is a member of Unity, it gives him the right to say that
any attack on him is an attack on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Rostov is also frightened because he believes that the governor
and his men have been behind attempts to silence criticism in the
news media through threats and intimidation, an accusation the
governor has denied.
</P>
<P>
   One evening in November, Rostov said he was walking from his car
to his apartment when a man wearing a hat pulled low over his brow
approached with a dog on a leash, and then wheeled suddenly to bash
Rostov on the back of the head with an iron pipe.
</P>
<P>
   A second man appeared and slammed another pipe against Rostov's
head, and the two assailants pummeled him as he screamed for help.
Had his wife, Olga, not heard his cries and come running to put the
attackers to flight, Rostov said he is sure that he would have been
killed. As it was, he spent three months recovering from his
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third such assault on journalists who have documented
allegations of corruption against Gorbenko and his deputies. The
offices of New Wheels, a newspaper, have twice been damaged, once
by a pipe-bomb planted just outside, and once by firebombs that
failed to explode when they were thrown through office windows.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, who report to the governor, have dismissed
those acts as ``hooliganism'' and ``street violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbenko declined requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He just returned last week from Moscow, where he delivered a
tough speech to the upper house of parliament calling for
amendments to Russia's press law that would make it easier for
public officials to use the courts to silence their critics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the governor's declared enemies is the Moscow-based NTV
television network, whose reports about corruption in Kaliningrad
and attacks on journalists have been distributed to a national
audience.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Gorbenko agreed to an interview with the network's
reporter, Eduard Petrov, but minutes into the taping session, he
became outraged at the tone of Petrov's questioning, which focused
on the governor's political migration to the Putin camp and away
from the Fatherland-All Russia Party formed by former Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov and Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not interrupt me! That's it. End of discussion,'' Gorbenko
said angrily as he threw down his pen, removed the microphone and
walked out of the interview.

 &HT;    Bush win may be good for GatesBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Probable GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush
_ who has high-level backing from within Microsoft _ is trying to
steer clear of the software giant's legal woes.
</P>
<P>
   In a bland statement issued when a federal judge declared
Microsoft an illegal monopoly, Bush said little more than that he
would ``fully enforce antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush had a lot more to say in late February during a
campaign swing through Washington state when the Microsoft homeland
loomed as a crucial primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the great fear is that Microsoft will be broken up,''
he said on the eve of the Feb. 29 Washington primary that put him
on the road to securing the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a longtime fan of free-market forces, also said he
``worried'' about the consequences, ``if this company were to be
broken apart, this engine of change, engine of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Microsoft case moves toward the remedy phase,
Washington think-tank experts with opposing views on what's best
for the country agreed that a Bush win in November is what's best
for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cato Institute, Senior Fellow Robert Levy, whose
expertise is in constitutional studies, believes Bill Gates ``may
be praying'' for another Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who opposes a Microsoft breakup, said Tuesday that his
comment is based more on what he is sure Al Gore would do than what
Bush might do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every indication (Gore) will be as activist in
antitrust as President Clinton, who is the most activist in
memory,'' Levy said. ``Bush has made some noises about being a
little more conciliatory toward market power, but he has backed off
when pressed. I'm not suggesting he necessarily will do what
Microsoft wants him to do. But it's quite clear Gore would do
nothing Microsoft would like him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Brookings Institution, Vice President Robert Litan, who
believes a Microsoft breakup would be good for the country, said a
Bush win would be a victory for Microsoft though not the end of the
company's legal woes. ``I expect that Microsoft wants Bush to be
elected, but Bush by himself is not going to solve all their
problems,'' said Litan, who believes Microsoft is counting more
heavily on evolving technology that will create a far different
competitive landscape by the time the case is finally decided on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his feelings on the lawsuit clear in November during a
visit to Microsoft headquarters. He talked about ``unfair use of
market dominance in one sector to stifle innovation in another
sector,'' and said, ``If competition is valuable, which I think it
is, then antitrust laws have a place in embodying the values of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's White House campaign has gotten a solid boost from Robert
Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating official and a Bush campaign
``pioneer'' who has raised more than $100,000 for the presidential
race. Herbold was a co-host at a July 1999 Bush fund-raising event
targeted at Silicon Valley executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palo Alto luncheon, Herbold labeled himself ``a champion
in the Northwest part of the country as regards to fund raising''
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, while Bush was doing his best to stay out of it,
former foe John McCain pushed his way into the case. McCain,
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called for congressional
hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the role of Congress to assess two things: one,
the impact on the consumer of such action that might have to be
taken on the part of Microsoft; and two, what is the impact on this
incredible engine that's driving America's economy,'' said McCain,
who Bush defeated in the GOP presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was willing to comment more freely about the case,
Bush said he lines up ``on the side of innovation, not
litigation.'' During the Washington state campaign swing, he told
reporters: ``I am not sympathetic to lawsuits. Write that down. I
worry about the effect of lawsuits on job creation. If you are
looking for the kind of president I will be, I will be slow to
litigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gordon (R-Wash.), who also is Bush's state chairman,
predicted Bush would ``seek to resolve (the case) in a way that
does not break up the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a Bush administration would have brought the
case to begin with,'' Gordon said _ a comment later disavowed by
the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, like much of the high-tech sector, has pumped up its
political giving in recent years. Since 1997, the company and its
officers have poured almost $1.5 million in soft money into
political coffers. About 68 percent has gone to Republicans, though
the amount for the current election cycle is more evenly split.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 1 of this year, Microsoft has been the nation's
sixth largest provider of political soft money.

 &HT;    Bush win may be good for GatesBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Probable GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush
_ who has high-level backing from within Microsoft _ is trying to
steer clear of the software giant's legal woes.
</P>
<P>
   In a bland statement issued when a federal judge declared
Microsoft an illegal monopoly, Bush said little more than that he
would ``fully enforce antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush had a lot more to say in late February during a
campaign swing through Washington state when the Microsoft homeland
loomed as a crucial primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the great fear is that Microsoft will be broken up,''
he said on the eve of the Feb. 29 Washington primary that put him
on the road to securing the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a longtime fan of free-market forces, also said he
``worried'' about the consequences, ``if this company were to be
broken apart, this engine of change, engine of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Microsoft case moves toward the remedy phase,
Washington think-tank experts with opposing views on what's best
for the country agreed that a Bush win in November is what's best
for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cato Institute, Senior Fellow Robert Levy, whose
expertise is in constitutional studies, believes Bill Gates ``may
be praying'' for another Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who opposes a Microsoft breakup, said Tuesday that his
comment is based more on what he is sure Al Gore would do than what
Bush might do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every indication (Gore) will be as activist in
antitrust as President Clinton, who is the most activist in
memory,'' Levy said. ``Bush has made some noises about being a
little more conciliatory toward market power, but he has backed off
when pressed. I'm not suggesting he necessarily will do what
Microsoft wants him to do. But it's quite clear Gore would do
nothing Microsoft would like him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Brookings Institution, Vice President Robert Litan, who
believes a Microsoft breakup would be good for the country, said a
Bush win would be a victory for Microsoft though not the end of the
company's legal woes. ``I expect that Microsoft wants Bush to be
elected, but Bush by himself is not going to solve all their
problems,'' said Litan, who believes Microsoft is counting more
heavily on evolving technology that will create a far different
competitive landscape by the time the case is finally decided on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his feelings on the lawsuit clear in November during a
visit to Microsoft headquarters. He talked about ``unfair use of
market dominance in one sector to stifle innovation in another
sector,'' and said, ``If competition is valuable, which I think it
is, then antitrust laws have a place in embodying the values of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's White House campaign has gotten a solid boost from Robert
Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating official and a Bush campaign
``pioneer'' who has raised more than $100,000 for the presidential
race. Herbold was a co-host at a July 1999 Bush fund-raising event
targeted at Silicon Valley executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palo Alto luncheon, Herbold labeled himself ``a champion
in the Northwest part of the country as regards to fund raising''
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, while Bush was doing his best to stay out of it,
former foe John McCain pushed his way into the case. McCain,
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called for congressional
hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the role of Congress to assess two things: one,
the impact on the consumer of such action that might have to be
taken on the part of Microsoft; and two, what is the impact on this
incredible engine that's driving America's economy,'' said McCain,
who Bush defeated in the GOP presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was willing to comment more freely about the case,
Bush said he lines up ``on the side of innovation, not
litigation.'' During the Washington state campaign swing, he told
reporters: ``I am not sympathetic to lawsuits. Write that down. I
worry about the effect of lawsuits on job creation. If you are
looking for the kind of president I will be, I will be slow to
litigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gordon (R-Wash.), who also is Bush's state chairman,
predicted Bush would ``seek to resolve (the case) in a way that
does not break up the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a Bush administration would have brought the
case to begin with,'' Gordon said _ a comment later disavowed by
the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, like much of the high-tech sector, has pumped up its
political giving in recent years. Since 1997, the company and its
officers have poured almost $1.5 million in soft money into
political coffers. About 68 percent has gone to Republicans, though
the amount for the current election cycle is more evenly split.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 1 of this year, Microsoft has been the nation's
sixth largest provider of political soft money.

 KALININGRAD, Russia: the interview. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even more surprising, one of the governor's deputies, Vasily
Kotov, then reportedly offered to pay $300,000 for the videotape
showing the governor's eruption. Kotov has denied making such an
offer, but in February, the NTV crew returned to Kaliningrad and
upon encountering Kotov on the street, recorded him on videotape
saying: ``I thought you would be afraid to come over here. I
offered you $300,000, but you showed such horse manure.''
</P>
<P>
   In tackling corruption, Putin will have to walk the fine line
between respecting the autonomy of duly elected regional officials,
some of whom have strong popular support, while insuring that such
officials do not flaunt the law. Some Russian political leaders
have advocated a consolidation of power under a strong president
like Putin, one empowered to appoint and remove governors. For the
moment, this idea has been beaten back by those who prefer
preserving a federal system where regional leaders remain
accountable to local voters.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Putin is woefully lacking in tools to enforce
anti-corruption standards across Russia's 11 time zones.
</P>
<P>
   The local police, prosecutors and judges _ in the absence of
federal financing _ are slavishly dependent upon governors to pay
their salaries and even to provide housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold governors accountable is difficult for both Moscow and
for localities,'' said Khmurchik, the newspaper editor. ``Moscow is
afraid to lose support of the regions, and here in the region,
everyone walks in the shadow of the governor, and it is difficult
to overcome their dependency on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even where there is proof of corruption, added Tulayev of the
Law and Order Committee, ``we are still lacking in an honest and
independent judicial system.'' And unfortunately, he continued, ``I
have to say that in the current situation, the price of justice is
equivalent to the price of an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaliningrad parliament is now considering legislation that
would set out clearly defined procedures for removing a corrupt
governor, but some opposition leaders here are privately hoping
that Putin and the central government will step in to conduct an
investigation that, in their view, would provide grounds to remove
Gorbenko.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes were raised last week when an inspection team of 50
officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal
Security Service arrived here for an unspecified but large-scale
investigation. The mandate of this investigative swat team remains
a mystery, but it is headed by Gen. Gennadi Y. Marshkov, who
publicly denounced Gorbenko's administration as corrupt before
leaving the territory last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the only time in history that the local head
of the FSB criticized the governor in the open pages of the
newspapers,'' Rostov said, referring to the general and the Federal
Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Kaliningrad holds the potential to become a rich
entrepot like Hong Kong on the northern rim of Europe. The region
is generously endowed with a deep-water harbor, a well-educated
labor force, one of the world's largest deposits of natural amber,
rich farmland and endless beaches. There are also modest crude oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But since Gorbenko's election in 1996, foreign investors have
fled the territory while organized crime figures who run the
smuggling, drugs and prostitution businesses have increased their
influence. A drug epidemic now rages here, fueled by high
unemployment and the ready availability of cheap heroin passing
through on the way to big markets in Europe. And Kaliningrad leads
the nation in HIV infections, a by-product of drug addiction and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in office, Gorbenko has delivered on few of the
promises he made to voters to work on their behalf, and it appears
that he has lost a great deal of trust.
</P>
<P>
   In an encounter with school teachers on hunger strikes last
year, one irate teacher complained to the governor that ``children
are not being fed at schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no money to feed them,'' Gorbenko snapped back.
``Nobody is paying taxes. They have destroyed everything, eaten
everything and sliced everything up. How can I get their money?''
Then, to the horrified teacher, he added: ``I want to ask why you
allowed them to destroy everything. I will now stand up and
leave.'' This exchange was also broadcast on national television.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent albatross still clinging to Gorbenko's neck is a
fiasco surrounding his chicken ranch. Last year, in violation of
all fiscal controls, he personally arranged for a $10 million loan
from a German bank to finance a poultry processing enterprise. But
no sooner had the loan been issued than the enterprise declared
bankruptcy and the money disappeared. Now the regional government
is saddled with paying on the debt. That case, too, has been sent
to the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the chicken ranch controversy calmed down than
someone in the governor's administration leaked the text of an
exclusive agreement he had signed with an Israeli company, Eurotech
Industrial Ltd., granting the company exclusive rights to develop
the amber industry, oil business and tourism in the territory.
Instead of applause, the agreement was greeted here by a howl of
protest because it had been negotiated in secret without bidding
and had granted the Israeli company such sweeping guarantees and
tax exemptions that the local taxpayers would end up covering any
losses.
</P>
<P>
   And just before last month's presidential election, Gorbenko
flew to Moscow hoping to win Putin's endorsement for an
extraordinary scheme to renationalize Kaliningrad's major
industries _ oil, amber, shipping, fishing, rail and air transport
_ under one super corporation to be headed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   This scheme prompted Khmurchik to ask whether one morning, the
citizens of Kaliningrad might wake up to find the name of their
region changed to Gorbenkograd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing President Putin can do in the face of a
governor such as ours is conduct an investigation so that he will
be held responsible for what he has done before the coming
elections,'' Khmurchik said, referring to the gubernatorial
elections in the fall in which Gorbenko is seeking a second
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Slisarenko, an opposition politician from the Yabloko
Party, warned that ``Any further criminalization of the government
authority must be stopped'' before criminals gain complete control
of Kaliningrad's economy.
</P>
<P>
   And so, like many Russians, they say they are waiting for Putin.

 Mindy Aloff is the dance critic for The New Republic.  
 By MINDY ALOFF c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dances of the Israeli-born choreographer Ze'eva
Cohen focus on women, contemporary, ancient and mythical. Some of
the women are feisty, some are noble. All, ultimately, are tragic:
they dance as an act of resistance against straitened circumstance
or passing time, as if they were singing private songs in a desert.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 40 works Cohen has choreographed since 1968,
collected under the title ``Female Mythologies,'' will be performed
at Danspace Project in St. Mark's Church in Manhattan from Thursday
through Sunday in a program dedicated to Cohen's mentor, Anna
Sokolow, who died on March 29. None of the dancers are old enough
to have seen Cohen's own impassioned performances, the true models
for their roles, with Sokolow's company during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing for Anna was a total emotional and intellectual
commitment,'' Cohen said. ``She helped liberate me from being an
academic dancer to being a full-blooded, expressive dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, however, Cohen is soft-spoken and precise. Sometimes
her corrections to the dancers are framed by metaphors: a maneuver
for both hands should have the character of falling sand; arms
should ``be like seaweed.'' More often, though, the frame of
reference is direct and practical.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious work of the Danspace evening is ``Women and
Veils II,'' a new and intricate ensemble piece for 10 women to an
insinuating score commissioned from Michael Keck. Its images of
female life in a tribal society _ where individual expression, much
less individual freedom of action, is suppressed _ bloom from
austere patterns and binding rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview at the Lower East Side studio where it
was being rehearsed, Cohen said that the dance had been inspired by
the life of women in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's memories of her native country still evoke mixed
feelings. She explained that although she felt privileged and
encouraged in some contexts, as an Israeli of Yemenite descent she
also grew up considering herself an outsider within the larger
population of European emigres, who, despite their common Jewish
heritage, looked down on the Yemenite Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only Yemenite Jew in a European neighborhood,'' she
said. ``At home, I was treated with kid gloves, given music and
dance lessons. In the street, a stranger once actually stopped me
to ask if I would clean her house. At one time, I would never touch
klezmer music, for example. I'm not European, and klezmer music was
part of Yiddish culture, the culture of victims,'' she said,
referring to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Cohen finally brought herself to reconsider this
self-imposed censorship when she incorporated instrumental klezmer
music and traditional Yiddish songs into a lighthearted duet for
herself and the dancer-choreographer Jill Sigman, ``If Eve Had a
Daughter (Mother's Tongue/ I Love You),'' which will be on the
Danspace program.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Tel Aviv in the 1950s, Cohen studied with the
Austrian-born modern dancer Gertrude Kraus, who emphasized
improvisation and musical response, and with Rena Gluck, who taught
the Martha Graham technique. As a teen-ager she also made
occasional visits to classes in jazz and ballet, which, at that
time, were not considered kosher for a confirmed modern dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Two obligatory years in the Israeli Army were followed by
performing experience in Gluck's dance group and then with Sokolow,
who had first traveled to Israel in 1953 to work with Inbal Dance
Theater, a Yemenite company. After nearly a decade, Sokolow founded
her own Lyric Theater, whose 10 original actor-dancers included
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow soon arranged for, and subsidized, Cohen's travel to New
York, where she completed the dance program at Juilliard in three
years and danced with Sokolow's New York-based company over a
period of eight years. (Her astonishing performance in ``Rooms'' is
preserved in Jac Venza's 1966 film, ``Anna Sokolow's `Rooms.''')
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Princeton University _ newly coeducational _ hired
Cohen to teach dance; she immediately founded an entire dance
program, running it while she also performed as a soloist and, for
a time, directed her own group. She maintained a family life, too,
marrying and having a daughter, Keren.
</P>
<P>
   At Danspace, Cohen will be working with experienced dancers who
are sympathetic to her aesthetic aims and style of direction. The
ensemble of ``Women and Veils II'' consists of dancers whom she
discovered by asking colleagues and friends for recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the soloists in the other pieces originated their roles:
Sigman, the dancer-choreographer Aleta Hayes (who performs with
Cohen in the 1996 duet ``Negotiations,'' which interprets the
relationship between the biblical Sarah and Hagar) and Regina
Nejman, who will dance in the 1998 tragic duet, ``Jeptha's
Daughter,'' while Cohen recites the poem of the same name, by
Alicia Ostricker, that inspired it.
</P>
<P>
   Caryn Heilman will perform the sobering and statuesque solo
``Ariadne,'' which Cohen developed for her in 1985, several years
before Heilman joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company, from which she
recently retired after a 10-year association to pursue her own
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made `Ariadne' together, in the sense that I was the person
Ze'eva made it on,'' Heilman said in the studio, just before a
run-through of the dance. After she had rehearsed it, Cohen picked
up the story of its making. This dance, to me, is Ariadne's peace
offering to Theseus, who abandoned her at Naxos and never came back
for her, and to herself,'' Cohen said. ``Caryn and I took time _
two weeks _ to find just the right movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one time I started all the choreography of a dance
from positions,'' Cohen continued. ``I strung together gestures
from Hellenic vases and from books: this is mourning. This gesture
is going to the bath. This is an archer. I put them together like
notes in a musical scale. The idea is that a woman has been found
on an island as a sculpture, and, in the course of the dance, she
comes back to life, trying to make sense of what happened to her,
why she was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``An audience may not see the particular meaning I had for every
gesture, but they will see in the first that she's abandoned and in
the last that she has something to give. If they understand those,
they'll have something. I'm still of the school that likes to leave
room for an audience to interpret. If you can get to a fertile
symbol from which people can take their own stories, that's the
best.'' (af)

COMMENTARY: ROLLER-COASTER MARKETS
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are one of those people who, despite all the evidence,
retain some lingering illusions about the rationality of financial
markets, Tuesday should have cured you. And the day's events also
proved that worries about the growing practice of buying stock on
margin _ in effect, borrowing in order to speculate _ are
completely justified.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken economists a long time to accept the idea that
financial markets are systematically too volatile. It was almost 20
years ago that Robert Shiller, whose important new book,
``Irrational Exuberance,'' has made a couple of previous
appearances in this column, produced what he thought was an
ironclad argument against the then-dominant ``efficient market''
theory of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   According to that theory, movements in the stock market should
always reflect genuine news about future earnings. But Shiller
showed that actual stock prices fluctuated much more than any
possible rational forecast of prospective profits; he thought that
this ``excess volatility'' result would settle the point.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't. Efficient-market theorists (including some
of the future principals of Long Term Capital Management _ the
hedge fund that collapsed in 1998, when markets did what they
weren't supposed to) defended their ground, producing elaborate
statistical critiques of Shiller's calculations. Yet over the years
events gradually eroded economists' faith in market rationality.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case was, of course, the 1987 stock crash,
during which Shiller had the presence of mind to carry out an
instant survey of investors. That survey discredited in advance all
the supposedly rational explanations for the crash concocted in the
weeks following, because it showed that the only reason any
significant number of investors gave for selling stocks was _
surprise! _ that prices were falling.
</P>
<P>
   But if that wasn't enough to convince you, Tuesday surely must
have done the trick. If you were lucky enough to have missed the
action you were spared a nauseating ride. At one point the Nasdaq
was down 575 points _ that is, around 13 percent. But by the
closing it had recovered 500 of those points.
</P>
<P>
   Was there any real news to explain all this turmoil? True, there
were developments in the Microsoft case. But it is hard to see how
that news could have justified even the fall in the price of
Microsoft itself, let alone the pounding taken by the stocks of
companies that one might have expected to be celebrating the new
weakness of the Evil Empire. Anyway, the timing was all wrong. The
lack of a settlement was old news by Monday morning; the formal
verdict by the judge delivered Monday afternoon contained few
surprises, and anyway had been fully digested by Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   So the wild swings in the market were, as Shiller could have
told you, mainly self-generated: The same people who frantically
bought tech stocks over the last couple of months, because the
prices were rising, sold them frantically over the last two days
because the prices were falling. Some of those people were naive
individual investors who panicked (you mean these things can go
 &UR; down? &LR; ) or, worse, were forced into sales because they had bought
on margin. Indeed, margin calls probably played the same role in
Tuesday's market that automatic sell programs played back in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But does this craziness do any harm? Or is it all audio and
video, signifying nothing? Well, many individuals, especially those
who had speculated on margin, have suffered losses they can never
recover. And this level of volatility has got to be bad for
business planning, perhaps even a threat to the stability of the
real economy.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now Shiller and others have been pleading for
action to limit market volatility. At the very least, surely, we
should impose limits on margin buying; I admit to being completely
baffled that nothing has been done over the past year, as margin
debt has soared. And it's now past time to take a serious look at
other proposals, like that of subsidizing the creation of futures
markets in dividends (which could help ground stock prices in
reality).
</P>
<P>
   When things are going well there is a strong tendency to suppose
that financial markets can take care of themselves. Well, they
can't.

MICROSOFT COULD FACE WAVE OF LAWSUITS AFTER ANTITRUST RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of a federal judge's harsh antitrust ruling,
Microsoft Corp. now faces the threat of a rising wave of consumer
class-action cases and other private lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   With Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson having ruled Monday that
Microsoft is a ``predatory'' monopolist that repeatedly violated
antitrust laws, private plaintiffs have a far less daunting
challenge in suits already filed _ and in actions being considered
by companies that believe they have suffered from abuse of
Microsoft's market power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now an awfully big invitation to plaintiffs'
lawyers,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia
University law school. ``We may have reached a point for Microsoft,
as there was in the tobacco cases, that basic attitudes have
shifted, and a powerful defendant is no longer seen as
invulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's judgment was not surprising, after his findings of
fact in November sided with the version of the case presented in
court by the Justice Department and 19 states. But this week's
ruling was a crucial step because it means that many of his
findings _ that Microsoft is a monopoly, for example _ may be
accepted as proof by other courts in private suits.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies that could now step forward as plaintiffs sent
witnesses to Jackson's courthouse to testify on behalf of the
government, including Netscape, America Online, Sun Microsystems,
Apple and IBM. In his ruling, Jackson cited all those companies as
having suffered from Microsoft's ``oppressive thumb on the scale of
competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled, for example, that the company used its market
power to defend its monopoly in operating systems, but that it also
illegally tried to monopolize the market for Internet browsing
software. The principal victim of that tactic was Netscape
Communications Corp., the pioneer in the browser market, which was
acquired by America Online in late 1998. That judgment makes it far
easier for America Online to sue for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Because the judge ruled that Microsoft's monopoly power allows
it to overcharge for Windows, the big personal computer makers
including Dell, Compaq, Gateway and IBM could have cause to file
suit. If they won, such judgments could yield hundreds of millions
of dollars each for big PC makers using Windows. The treble damages
in private antitrust cases would cover every PC a company sold over
four years, the statute of limitations in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft could find itself in a very tight pincer here, since
these companies could regard it as being in their fiduciary
interest to file private suits,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a
professor at the University of Iowa law school.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, lawyers say, is probably the most likely to
file a private suit against Microsoft. It is a bitter head-to-head
competitor of Microsoft and has little to lose. For all the others,
the calculation would be more complicated because they rely in one
way or another on Microsoft's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies named in Jackson's ruling declined to
comment Tuesday on the possibility of private antitrust suits
against Microsoft. Still, an executive at one of the companies
said, ``It is clearly something we will consider, but there has
been no substantive internal discussion of that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But companies are not the only potential litigants. More than
100 class-action suits have already been filed against Microsoft in
two dozen states, nearly all of them in the aftermath of Jackson's
powerfully worded findings of fact last November. Those suits,
legal experts say, were the early starters as plaintiffs' lawyers
jockeyed for leadership positions in what will likely become a
broader class-action assault on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   More consumer class-action suits are expected, and lawyers
involved in the early cases said that Jackson's rule was a
significant victory in their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the way the government case came
out,'' said Leonard B. Simon, a partner at Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &AMP; Lerach in San Diego, whose firm has brought many prominent
class-action cases. ``This is very good news for the consumer
class-action cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the ruling in the government case makes things easier
for private antitrust plaintiffs, it by no means insures that they
will win in court. The consumer class-action suits mainly contend
that Microsoft, as a monopoly, was able to overcharge for its
industry-standard Windows operating system, which run the basic
operations of nearly 90 percent of all personal computers sold
today.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled that Microsoft had the ability to ``price
substantially above the competitive level.'' And in his November
findings, he noted an internal Microsoft pricing study that said
the company could have charged $49 for a retail upgrade from
Windows 95 to Windows 98 but that the company chose to charge $89
instead because it was the ``revenue-maximizing price.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the numbers cited in the study were
arbitrary numbers, and that it could have also charged far more for
the Windows upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In the class-action confrontation, Microsoft says it has the
money and the patience to withstand what it regards as an
opportunistic assault on a deep-pocketed corporate target. In
addition, the company's executives express confidence in their
legal position.
</P>
<P>
   ``These class-action cases are just piling on,'' Bill Gates, the
Microsoft chairman, said in an interview over the weekend. ``There
is no economic theory to show that ours was not the aggressive
price for Windows.''

SULLIVAN WITHOUT GILBERT? DON'T ASK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a brief but crucial scene in ``Topsy-Turvy'' _ Mike
Leigh's exhilarating film about the creation of ``The Mikado,''
which recently won Oscars for costume design and makeup _ that
makes abundantly clear just what kind of composer Arthur Sullivan
might have remained had he not teamed up with W.S. Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   The scene depicts a musical soiree at the London home of Mary
Frances Ronalds, the American socialite with whom the unmarried
Sullivan enjoyed a close romantic friendship for the last 20 years
of his life. (Ronalds was separated from her husband.)
</P>
<P>
   The character Sir Arthur (engagingly played by Allan Corduner),
arriving late, quietly enters the salon while a pianist is playing
a ruminative piano piece by Faure for the attentive guests. The
composer is struck by this intriguing new music from France, with
its murky chromatic harmony and languid sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my milieu,'' you can sense him thinking. ``This is
where I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   As we have learned by this point in the film, Sir Arthur is
tired of churning out ephemeral comic operas with Gilbert. He
craves lasting respect for his serious compositions, although he
has not written many of them.
</P>
<P>
   After the Faure performance, Ronalds, an amateur singer, coyly
announces that as a surprise, a work by another promising composer
will be performed. The smiling Sir Arthur comes forward, greeted by
friendly applause. Ronalds begins to sing ``The Lost Chord,''
accompanied by harmonium (played by the pianist who had performed
the Faure) and piano (played by Sir Arthur).
</P>
<P>
   The time is late 1884, so ``The Lost Chord,'' Sullivan's most
popular serious piece, would have been in circulation for almost
eight years. Today the ballad seems thoroughly dated and
saccharine. Written after the death of Sullivan's brother, it is a
setting of a pious Victorian text by the English poet Adelaide A.
Proctor. It begins: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Seated one day at the organ,
</P>
<P>
   I was weary and ill at ease.
</P>
<P>
   And my fingers wander'd idly,
</P>
<P>
   Over the noisy keys.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As such absent-minded playing continued, the song recounts, the
organist's fingers stumbled onto a haunting chord, ``like the sound
of a great Amen.'' The chord flooded the ``crimson twilight'' like
the ``close of an Angel's hand,'' ``quieted pain and sorrow'' and
``link'd all perplexed meanings/ Into one perfect peace,'' quite a
lot for a single chord to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, it ``trembled away into silence.'' Forever after, the
organist searched in vain to find that chord again. ``It may be
that only in Heav'n,/ I shall hear that grand Amen,'' the organist
speculates, as the treacly song with its cliched hymnbook harmonies
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the text attracted Sullivan because he spent his
creative life searching for his own lost chord. As conveyed in
``Topsy-Turvy,'' the reactions of the guests at the soiree are
wonderfully ambiguous. After all, they had just heard a fascinating
new work by Faure. Perhaps the pieties of ``The Lost Chord''
appealed to them. But on their faces you detect impatience, even
glints of bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that old thing,'' they might be thinking. ``Why doesn't
Sir Arthur just give us another `Pinafore'?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sullivan probably went to his grave denying it, the day
in 1869 when he was introduced to Gilbert was the luckiest of his
life. Today ``The Lost Chord'' and Sullivan's other serious works
(choral anthems, chamber pieces, the ``Irish'' Symphony) are at
best curiosities. The Gilbert and Sullivan operas are timeless
glories.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was an excellent musician. A prize-winning scholarship
student at the Royal Academy of Music in London, he received
advanced training at the Leipzig Conservatory, where he studied
counterpoint with Moritz Hauptmann, who had been a student of
Ludwig Spohr; composition with Julius Rietz, who had been an
assistant to Mendelssohn; and piano with Ignaz Moscheles, who had
been a younger colleague of Beethoven. He was a fine pianist, an
excellent conductor and an imaginative orchestrator.
</P>
<P>
   But his serious compositions were hopelessly derivative.
Sullivan could produce persuasive, crafty evocations of music from
all styles and periods: Purcell odes, Handel choruses, Italian
opera recitative, Rossini patter arias; and he could turn out
anthems and parlor songs in the Victorian style of the day. What he
lacked was originality.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is the essence of comedy, however, and Sullivan had
keen instincts about the kinds of music to put with Gilbert's dry,
witty words. When a verse suggested a jaunty dance tune, an
Italianate aria, a pastoral ditty or an agitated recitative, he
provided it, exaggerated slightly for comic effect with an odd turn
of phrase, a mawkish harmonic progression or some inflated dramatic
intensity: whatever it took. The results were hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is ``A Wandering Minstrel I,'' the recitative and
song with chorus sung by Nanki-Poo, the son-in-hiding of the
Mikado, which is performed winningly in the film by Martin Savage,
as the morphine-addicted actor George Grossmith. Gilbert's lyrics
are a clever sendup of an English ballad: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)A wandering minstrel I _
</P>
<P>
   A thing of shreds and patches,
</P>
<P>
   Of ballads, songs and snatches,
</P>
<P>
   And dreamy lullaby!(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's musical setting has an ambling rhythmic gait and a
sweetly tuneful melody; yet the music is somewhat out of kilter.
The melodic phrases go a bit against the rhythm of the words,
turning the inner couplet (the second and third lines) into one
elongated, ornamented phrase. And the final phrase spins off
lyrically, depriving the melodic statement of a clear conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a balladeer Nanki-Poo seems to be a makeshift craftsman. But
Sullivan wisely doesn't overplay the musical joke. The song is
wistful, curious, beguiling and delightfully funny.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Sullivan's musical evocations are so close to the
source that they seem almost serious. In ``The Mikado,'' the
elegantly composed madrigal in Act II, ``Brightly Dawns Our Wedding
Day,'' is a genuine homage to the British madrigal tradition, which
should be performed with tenderness and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   As Sullivan well knew, sometimes the madcap pace of a comic
opera has to slow down. This madrigal serves that purpose. It also
prevents the characters who sing it (Yum-Yum, Pitti-Sing, Nanki-Poo
and Pish-Tush) from falling into caricature. Just as we gear up for
the frantic, improbable conclusion of the opera, the madrigal
reminds us of our fondness for these vexed residents of Titipu.
</P>
<P>
   The chilliness of the relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan
is sometimes overstated. Though not particularly close, they worked
together professionally. And in focusing on a period when they were
at creative loggerheads, Leigh's film makes clear just how much
they needed each other.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in the summer of 1884, during a hot spell.
Attendance at the current Gilbert and Sullivan show, ``Princess
Ida,'' has been falling off badly. The team is under pressure, and
under contract, to provide a new work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The sour, cynical, asexual Gilbert, unforgettably portrayed by
Jim Broadbent (who was robbed of an Oscar nomination), has written
a new libretto. Sullivan finds it thoroughly contrived: yet another
tale of magic potions and topsy-turvy plot twists. He refuses to
set it, and this time the standoff between these reluctant
collaborators is serious. Sullivan wants out for good.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gilbert's meek, devoted and long-suffering wife, Lucy (in a
poignant performance by Lesley Manville), drags him to a Japanese
exhibition in London. The crusty writer is captivated by the
strangeness of what he sees. The notion of using stiff Japanese
protocol and exotic Oriental imagery to parody British rectitude,
law and society takes hold of him.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally reads his completed script to Sullivan in one of
their few scenes together (an appropriate touch, for they survived
as a team by doing their jobs separately), the composer is hooked.
Even the opening scene description amuses him: ``Courtyard of
Ko-Ko's palace in Titipu.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the film is devoted to the story of putting
together, step by step, the work's premiere production. And as many
critics have noted, no film does a better job of taking viewers
inside the often chaotic creative process, an unlikely mixture of
inspiration and happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is obsessed with the idea that the show must have an
authentic, straight-faced Japanese style. He brings some geisha
girls from the Japanese exposition to a rehearsal, so they can show
the British actresses who sing ``Three Little Maids From School Are
We'' how to move, bow, smile and wield fans.
</P>
<P>
   The geishas, who speak no English, are quite terrified. The
intimidated English actresses think Gilbert is crazy. He is. But he
is also right. For ``The Mikado'' to be funny, the actors have to
be serious. They cannot be in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Leigh's excellent conductor and musical adviser, Carl
Davis, the musical elements of the film are accurately realized.
Davis has arranged excerpts from various Gilbert and Sullivan
operas into an effective film score.
</P>
<P>
   The many selections from ``The Mikado'' and other works that are
actually performed in the film are done with wit and style by
gifted singing actors. The orchestra plays on period instruments.
The somewhat leisurely tempos may startle those who know these
works only from modern productions.
</P>
<P>
   Most directors and conductors today, fearing that the operettas
will seem dated, rush through the music, hoping to fill the stage
with fleet comic energy. But words must be paramount in Gilbert and
Sullivan performances; hence Davis' slower tempos, which allow the
singers to make the texts clear.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that Davis' tempo choices are close to what the
creators would have wanted, though we cannot be sure. Scholars who
want to investigate the matter can examine the manuscripts at the
Morgan Library in New York, which has the largest collection of
original Gilbert and Sullivan materials in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mikado,'' of course, was a smash hit. Sullivan was
compelled to continue working with Gilbert. The next three works
were top-drawer: ``Ruddigore,'' ``The Yeoman of the Guard'' and
``The Gondoliers.'' The final two, ``Utopia Limited'' (1893) and
``The Grand Duke'' (1896), fizzled at the box office, though ``The
Grand Duke'' has some winning songs, a few of which Davis has woven
into his film score. The Gilbert and Sullivan partnership was over.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the bon vivant, died in 1900. He spent his final years
trying to compose stage works with other authors, grappling with a
kidney ailment and fretting that he would never win respect as a
composer of serious music. But what composer today would not gladly
trade a whole roster of formidable works to have written ``The
Mikado''? (af)

MEN ON TV: DUMB AS POSTS AND PROUD OF IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Dashes in the word (M-A-S-H) in the story should be replaced
with asterisks) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Homer Simpson doesn't bother me. When he sits on his sofa,
directly across from the television set, beer in hand, slack-jawed,
with a blank stare to represent a brain set on stall, I don't
really believe that our nation's nuclear power plants are operated
by his kind. At least I know that Matt Groening, who created Homer
and his sallow-faced, bug-eyed family, did not intend him as a role
model.
</P>
<P>
   Homer is, after all, just a really famous cartoon. If he were
the only heterosexual adult male on television who seemed
inordinately pleased with himself and blissfully unaware of his low
IQ, prime time would be in good shape. But in recent months I've
been noticing his live-action counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they can be caught in precisely the same pose. There's
the title character of ``The King of Queens'' (Kevin James), whose
lifelong dream is still to turn his basement into a private
hideaway for watching sports on big-screen television.
</P>
<P>
   An episode of ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' begins with the title
character's father and brother (Peter Boyle and Brad Garrett)
seemingly hypnotized in front of a televised football game. When
Raymond (Ray Romano) greets them, they respond with a single
simultaneous grunt. And on reruns of ``Friends,'' Chandler (Matthew
Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) _ witty, upwardly mobile Manhattan
bachelors _ veg out for sports telecasts in their matching recliner
chairs. (Chandler has since been resocialized by moving in with
Monica.)
</P>
<P>
   But television sports mania is not these characters' only fault.
Men in a growing number of comedies are depicted as rude, crude,
sex-crazed, sexist, childish and blindly egotistical.
</P>
<P>
   The curmudgeonly title character of ``Becker'' (Ted Danson), a
middle-aged doctor, says things like: ``If you want to know about
women, you don't ask a woman. If you want to know about meat, do
you ask a cow?'' When a patient tells him that an injection hurt,
Becker replies, ``Grow up, will you?'' On ``Friends,'' Joey eats
steak with his fingers at Ross' wedding reception. On ``Dharma and
Greg,'' Greg (Thomas Gibson), a respectable married lawyer, can't
have his wife (Jenna Elfman) work at his office because every time
he looks at her, his legal training and his self-discipline vanish
and he has to have sex with her, right there on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time gives us grown men who can't stop giggling in church,
bawdy male magazine publishers married to women half their age and
men who stick Montblanc pens up their noses in order to meet women
in the emergency room. Anyone who watches television regularly
could get the impression that one of the two sexes on this planet
is not only dimwitted and uncouth but darned proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   In their desperate attempt to lure male viewers (and all the
dollars advertisers believe they are ready to spend), the powers
that be in television seem to have decided to appeal to the lowest
common denominator. And it's remarkably low.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this glorification of the dumb started with the research.
Men, as any pollster can tell you, do watch football _ a contest in
which, its fans point out, the best men really do win and it's all
about sheer ability, not politics or personality, at least during
the game itself. Men also watch wrestling, in which hypermasculine,
hyperstrong men take on outrageous personas and act out the battle
between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the programming experts decide? Rather than
developing or buying series that might appeal to those fascinations
with ability, victory versus defeat or good versus evil, they give
us shows about men watching football and wrestling. And doing
little else. Now little boys across America want to grow up to be
just like them.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously. The last time Children Now, a California media
advocacy group, surveyed 10- to 17-year-old boys, the top
television role models they named were all sitcom characters, most
of them a little off-kilter. One was Tim the tool guy (Tim Allen),
the inept handyman who liked to growl to demonstrate his manliness
on ``Home Improvement.'' But he was a responsible husband and
father _ and at least partly facetious.
</P>
<P>
   Two were smart-mouthed New York single guys from ``Seinfeld'':
Jerry Seinfeld's namesake character, a likable enough stand-up
comedian, and Kramer (Michael Richards), a complete lunatic who
spent most of the show's eight-year run unemployed and couldn't
manage to walk into a room without falling down. The two other
people boys wanted to be like were, God help us, Homer Simpson and
his chip-off-the-old-block son, Bart, whose contribution to the
English language so far has been the admonition, ``Eat my shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on. Prime time is strewn with noble, brave, dedicated,
attractive male characters that any little boy might be proud to
emulate. Why does no one want to be Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) or
Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle) from ``E.R.''? Or Bobby Donnell
(Dylan McDermott) on ``The Practice''? Or any of the police
officers on ``N.Y.P.D. Blue''?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these characters are single, good-looking, making good
money and doing quite well with women. Presumably the younger boys
are in bed by 10 p.m., when many of the serious dramas are on the
air. But there could be two other answers.
</P>
<P>
   First, these characters are all working themselves to death. As
television dramas have become more realistic, they have
increasingly depicted adults as stressed out, physically exhausted
and in almost constant moral agony, often fighting uphill battles
against the idiots at their hospitals, law offices, precincts and
other workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) on ``The X-Files,'' for instance,
may be a big, tough, handsome FBI agent who carries a gun and is
smarter than everybody else (except his partner, Scully, played by
Gillian Anderson), but he's also a little deranged, what with his
fixation on flying saucers and government plots, and his immediate
superiors constantly try to thwart him. Moreover, the man hasn't
had a date in ages. If this unspoken, slowly building
sexual-tension thing with Scully doesn't work out when the series
ends, Mulder could end up alone for life.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it's just that 12-year-olds don't want to grow up to be
burned-out, sleep-deprived misfits. The Peter Pan syndrome isn't
all about fear of commitment, you know. Or _ more horrible thought
_ maybe Dr. Carter, Dr. Benton, Bobby Donnell and the rest actually
turn into slack-jawed, beer-drinking, sports-watching zombies after
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, medicine, law and law enforcement are demanding fields,
but Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) always looked fresh, well rested and
sure of himself. Marcus Welby (Robert Young) was cool, calm and
collected for seven seasons. Of course, in their day, series heroes
were almost infallible; neither of them had to deal with actually
losing cases or patients.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Second, it may be simply that young men aren't watching these
particular would-be role models. The dramas that feature sensitive,
intelligent male adults are often shows with predominantly female
audiences. You think George Clooney became the most bankable star
on ``E.R.'' because of heterosexual male viewers? And the more
emotionally mature and aware the male character, the more likely it
is that he's being written for a series aimed largely at women to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Take Rick (Billy Campbell), the boyish, fortyish divorced
architect in ``Once and Again,'' ABC's freshman drama about
divorced parents in love. Rick is so sensitive that the first time
he and Lily (Sela Ward), a fortyish divorced bookstore owner, meet,
he gently, reassuringly tells her daughter how to take care of her
soccer injury.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Providence,'' NBC's treacly drama about Dr. Sydney Hansen
(Melina Kanakaredes), a plastic surgeon who leaves her superficial
Los Angeles life behind to move back to her hometown in Rhode
Island, Sydney's father (Mike Farrell) is a sensitive type. You can
tell because he's a veterinarian who's really gentle with pets and
often sits around looking sad because his wife died.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney even actually finds love interests who open up. One,
dealing with a health crisis not long ago, confessed to Sydney:
``Some things are hard to admit. Some are even harder to say. I
don't want to go through this alone.'' Good role model in terms of
emotional communication, but it's doubtful that a lot of growing
boys were watching; ``Providence'' is the prime-time equivalent of
a chick flick.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that guy was actually acknowledging that he needed help,
that he was willing to be less than completely in control. The
author Susan Faludi suggests that in our culture men have come to
believe they aren't real men if they aren't in control. And in our
culture it's hard to be in control of anything, which is what those
workplace-based dramas often reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Even today's doctors, lawyers and cops are shown losing to
forces beyond their _ oops, there's that word again _ control. In
``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,'' Faludi also says
that at the turn of the 21st century, men are searching for a way
to recapture the masculine camaraderie and purpose of World War II,
their fathers' proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   From the look of things, they are settling for camaraderie
alone. But there's no reason that characters who watch football
games and get a little drunk together can't be good human beings as
well. Television's quintessential sensitive guy, Hawkeye Pierce of
``M-A-S-H,'' as played by Alan Alda, was the class clown of his
Korean War medical unit, an usually successful seducer of women and
a dedicated martini drinker.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least that was true at the beginning of the series;
maybe the writers decided that viewers couldn't handle a character
so complicated that he had those ``faults'' and yet was both wise
enough to see war for the horrible waste that it is and sentimental
enough to have sympathy for the other side. So they cleaned Hawkeye
up as the seasons passed. Our loss.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the male television oaf is anything new. Chester
A. Riley of ``The Life of Riley,'' as played by both Jackie Gleason
and William Bendix, was a classic big, dumb lug. But at least he
was a little embarrassed about it.
</P>
<P>
   And Riley was funny. Yes, it's important to remember that all of
the current shows with idiotic male characters are comedies, and
comedy thrives on exaggeration. Lucy Ricardo, the beloved heroine
of ``I Love Lucy,'' reinforced every 20th-century stereotype of
women: she couldn't handle money, loved to gossip, took good care
of her man and was singularly ditsy, but she didn't know how good
she had it just being a housewife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   The female sitcom heroines that followed avoided that kind of
automatic sexism. On ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' Mary Richards'
problem was being too nice. On ``Murphy Brown,'' the title
character's problem was just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any attempt in the year 2000 to base a female
character on the old stereotypes would cause an outcry among
viewers. Just look at the objections to ``Ally McBeal,'' whose
title character wears short skirts and worries as much about her
love life as her law career. David E. Kelley, the show's creator,
is actually an equal-opportunity stereotypist. The men on ``Ally
McBeal'' are just as superficial and insecure as the women.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of political correctness could be part of the
problem as well. All that stored-up tension from being careful not
to offend women, black people, gay people, animal rights activists
or any nationality on earth comes out in the creation of grotesque
male characters. As long as men are in power, they are the one
group that television can ridicule without fear of reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   Take a classic episode of ``The Simpsons,'' in which Homer and
Marge's intelligent, cheerful daughter Lisa goes into a funk when
she realizes she has Homer's genes and so is destined to grow up to
be just as big an idiot as he is. (This is a man who once threw his
own wallet into the fireplace, so pickpockets would not be able to
get it during his coming trip to New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Lisa's parents try to reassure her by gathering lots of Simpson
relatives together, but they turn out to be jerks and failures of
various kinds. Until Lisa starts meeting the female Simpsons, who
are brain surgeons and professors and rocket scientists. ``The

 &HT;    Boycott by SCLC threatened if Georgia flag not changed
 &HT;    By David Pendered
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Southern Christian Leadership Conference will call
for a tourism boycott of Georgia unless the state flag is changed
next year, SCLC President Martin Luther King III said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are poised (to call a boycott) if righteousness and justice
does not happen and the flag is not changed,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge capped more than two hours of speeches
commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the assassination in Memphis
of King's father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Other activities followed a familiar path. The King family laid
a wreath at King's crypt. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, urged
support for a King memorial in Washington and said a conspiracy was
behind her husband's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   King III did not detail how a boycott would unfold. It could
involve a statewide boycott, like the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People program against South Carolina. Or it
could be targeted to specific events where impact would be easier
to measure.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the South Carolina boycott, started last summer, are
hard to determine. King said the state lost $50 million in tourism.
Published reports put the figure closer to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, industry invested $6.3 billion last year and created
30,000 jobs, according to the South Carolina Department of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, supporters said King's comments will resonate
across Georgia and strengthen support for changing the flag by
removing the Confederate emblem within it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It carries a great deal of moral authority amongst the
mainstream of Georgia for Martin Luther King III to say, on the
32nd anniversary of his father's death, that the flag should be
changed,'' said Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta), a history professor
at Morris Brown College in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   King also may find support from unexpected corporate allies,
said Daniel Levitas, executive director of the Georgia Rural Urban
Summit, which promotes social justice. He noted that both Coca-Cola
and Lockheed Martin have been accused of racial discrimination
against black employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to improve their image in the African-American
community, and that means the possibility of some corporate allies
on the flag issue,'' Levitas said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a significant difference between King III's call to
remove the Confederate emblem from the Georgia flag and past
efforts to change the flag. This campaign will be waged by students
in high schools and colleges, a group that has little political
clout to lose in the battle. The last effort was led by then-Gov.
Zell Miller, who was defeated by the 1993 state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's regional coordinator of college students, Mark Bell,
said students will arrange educational sessions across Georgia this
summer to drum up interest among youth to change the flag. Other
organizers said students will call for the flag to come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Centennial High School, in Roswell, the young people
declared that this flag will be removed,'' said Brenda Davenport,
head of student affairs for the SCLC. ``The governor will have it
on his agenda because students will say it will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes told a national television audience in
February that changing the flag was not a priority for him or
African-American lawmakers in the legislative session that ended
last month. Barnes' administration officials could not be reached
for comment Tuesday.

 &HT;    Soul-searching on University of Georgia's fraternity row
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The death of a University of Georgia fraternity
member last week comes at a time in which members of the Greek
system at UGA say they already feel they are under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely doesn't help,'' said Matt Sawhill, 21, a senior
from Rome, Ga., and president of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. ``We
all understand that we have to hold ourselves up to a higher
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Sawhill's Kappa Sigma brothers were on the roof of
their house, draping black cloth over the fraternity's letters to
pay respect to Ben Folsom Grantham III, a member of the Alpha Tau
Omega fraternity a few doors down.
</P>
<P>
   Grantham may have been handcuffed and blindfolded when he died
last week in a car crash. Wynn Smiley, executive director of the
Indianapolis-based national ATO organization described the incident
as a ``road trip that got out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, UGA officials said 10 fraternities and
sororities have been disciplined for hazing, alcohol or curfew
abuses. Officials say there are about 40 fraternities and
sororities on campus, and 17 percent of UGA's students are members.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law punishes hazing _ defined as putting a person
through physical punishments and humiliation _ by as much as a year
in jail and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken a zero tolerance on hazing,'' said Brad
Bohannon, 20, a junior from Augusta and member of the Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity. ``It doesn't occur here.''
</P>
<P>
   Derick Corbett, 23, a senior from Canton and member of the
fraternity, added, ``In this house, the attitude has changed
dramatically. We realize hazing is less educational and more about
paying your dues. You're never going to end it completely. You have
the old boys with the old rules.''
</P>
<P>
   While he still hears about hazing on campus, Corbett said those
stories rarely involve ``physical brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   The most highly publicized hazing case in recent years at UGA
likely was in 1996, when three Phi Beta Sigma fraternity members
pled guilty to battery and hazing charges after the paddling of
then-20-year-old Rod Perrymond, a University of Georgia Bulldogs
football player in an off-campus apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bracewell, former director of student judicial programs at
UGA, said, ``There has been a definite trend, and it's been away
from life-threatening, dangerous activity'' at fraternities and
sororities.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said pledges remain a sort of second-class citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem remains, as long as you're thinking that way, and
it's OK to make them drive you to class, then it becomes OK to make
them clean your apartment, then it becomes OK to ... you're on a
slippery slope,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bracewell said for years, what was going on in local
fraternities wasn't of great concern to national organizations and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a part of American society for a long time. What
happened is people started getting maimed and killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Campuses started cracking down, broadening the definition of
hazing to the point, he said, that they ``outlawed silliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Williamson, assistant chief of UGA's police, said he
doesn't see as many big parties at fraternities these days. ``It's
easier downtown to rent out a facility and have it all provided,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may be policies that force fraternities to
have security, police underage drinking and keep their events
contained on their premises.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mullendore, UGA's vice president for student affairs,
said the school has year-round education programs for fraternity
members and pledges on hazing and other issues. The school also has
a hazing hotline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe my staff is doing everything that is humanly
possible (to educate students),'' he said. ``Sometimes, out of
tragedy, education occurs. There is not a student who pledges at a
fraternity or sorority that does not know what the policy on hazing
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other schools in Georgia and across the country are tackling
similar issues.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University decided a few years ago to mandate fraternity
houses have full-time house directors to keep a closer eye on
what's going on. Members of fraternities and sororities also must
undergo anti-hazing orientations and sign a pledge not to haze. The
house directors are employees of the school, not the fraternities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worked out wonderfully,'' said Bridget Guernsey Riordan
of Emory's Campus Life office, who added that few schools mandate
house directors. She said there hasn't been a reported hazing
incident on the campus in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, meanwhile, has been aggressive in attacking
underage and binge drinking on campus. The school is considering
changing its policies on when to notify parents that their underage
children have been caught drinking or using illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bracewell said Greek chapters may have more to worry about than
college clamp-downs when accidents occur, like the one involving
Grantham. ``The resulting lawsuit is probably more important to
whether the organization continues to exist,'' he said. ``Somebody
might get sued over this. ``

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was sound. There was fury. But what stock
market investors wanted to know after Tuesday's frightening bungee
jump in share prices was, what does it signify?
</P>
<P>
   Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in stock
market history, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index had
plunged 574.57 points from its close the day before, shearing 13.6
percent off its value. Had it ended there, it would have been the
worst one-day decline in Nasdaq history. But a flood of buying
rescued the index, propelling it up almost 500 points, to close
with a loss of only 1.77 percent on the day. In a single trading
session, the index moved an extraordinary 1,074 points.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nasdaq plummeted, the more established gauges fell
alongside it. About 1:15 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average had
fallen 4.5 percent and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost
5.9 percent. But these gauges bounced back as well, with the Dow
closing the day down 0.51 percent and the S &AMP; P 500 ending with a
loss of 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the markets recovered by the end of the day, traders
and investors were shellshocked by the extraordinary moves. Ten-
and 15-point trading ranges were commonplace among even established
companies like American Express, Intel, General Electric and Cisco
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The selling seemed to represent the first serious threat to the
all-technology, all-the-time stock market investors have come to
love. Technology stocks have dominated investors' psyches in recent
years and have been responsible for titanic gains among those
buyers willing to suspend their disbelief about what the future may
hold for these companies. As a result, investors bid up the prices
of both untested companies with no sign of profits and established
companies with enviable earnings growth to levels that were never
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks are trading on psychology, and ultimately markets
are efficient,'' said Edward Kerschner, chief market strategist at
PaineWebber. ``Our view is that part of the excesses have been
corrected, but not all of them.'' Kerschner thinks that the 20 most
popular technology stocks with no earnings, like Amazon.com and
Juniper Networks, have to go down another 40 percent before they
can begin to be considered for purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Many strategists think Tuesday's mood shift among investors has
staying power. ``Panic is setting in among people who have big
gains,'' said David Eidelman, money manager with Eidelman, Finger &AMP;
Harris is St. Louis. ``At first, when stocks go down, you have
complacency among investors. Then people start to wonder, `Can I
lose everything I've made?' In a lot of these stocks'' with high
price-to-earnings ratios, ``you don't really have a comfortable
feeling for where the bottom is.''
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval in the market on Tuesday acted to level out some of
the peaks and valleys seen in the main market gauges this year. The
Nasdaq, which had been up 28 percent at its March 10 peak, is now
up 1.96 percent on the year. The Dow , which had lost 14.8 percent
in early March, is now down only 2.89 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said that Tuesday's selloff accelerated when calls for
additional money went out from brokerage firms to their customers
who had borrowed to buy shares. For the investors whose shares
declined precipitously Monday, those margin calls went out on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One employee at a large online brokerage firm who declined to be
identified said the firm made a record number of margin calls on
Tuesday, four times what is typical. Almost none of the customers
put up the additional money, this person said, and were therefore
forced to sell some or all of their holdings. This accelerated the
declines in already weak stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking cover from the carnage in stocks, investors fled to the
traditional safe haven of U.S. Treasury bonds. Yields on the
30-year Treasury bond dropped to 5.65 percent from Monday's close
of 5.81 percent. The Treasury bond ended the day at a yield of 5.78
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers were scarce until the turnaround, which came before 2
p.m. Even so, the feeling among traders was more that the selling
had subsided than that huge buyers had stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two trading days, the Nasdaq composite has lost 9.3
percent. It remains up 1.96 percent on the year, but is down 17.8
percent from its March 10 peak. Volume was heavy. More than 1.5
billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the
biggest day ever. It was also the busiest day on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   While the rout in the Nasdaq got started early in the day, the
Dow and S &AMP; P held up until late morning. Then, traders said, large
investors began to experience trouble getting out of their Nasdaq
shares and started selling the stocks they could. This meant many
of the big NYSE stocks that make up the Dow and the S &AMP; P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions we deal with are extremely calm, but they're
frustrated because there is a ton of volume, but no natural
liquidity,'' said Bill Schneider, head position trader at Warburg
Dillon Read. ``To some extent we have seen some buyers. But buyers
who have bought the dip are a little more cautious this time
particularly in Nasdaq.'' One of the reasons for the lack of
liquidity in Nasdaq stocks is that the traders acting as market
makers in these shares are only required to buy or sell 100 shares
at their specified price. In the 1980s, market makers had to buy or
sell 1,000 shares at their quoted prices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, traders said that many dealers on Tuesday bought
100 shares from a customer, as they were obligated to do, and then
posted their next price so far below the prevailing market that few
investors would be interested in taking the other side of a trade.
This essentially guaranteed that they would not be stuck buying
shares in a falling stock. Traders also said that the differences
between what dealers were willing to pay for a stock and what they
were willing to sell it for _ called the spread _ widened
significantly as the Nasdaq plummeted, driving away all but the
most desperate investors.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday's gyrations in the Nasdaq were recordbreaking,
they are a continuation of extreme swings seen in that market for
months. ``In January and February, 70 percent of the trading days
qualified as high volatility moves of 1 percent or more, day to
day,'' said Steven Leuthold of Leuthold Weeden Research in
Minneapolis. ``In March we probably kicked this up to 75 percent of
trading days, the highest we've seen in the history of the Nasdaq
index.'' As for the broader market averages that have been around
longer, volatility is higher than it has been since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Leuthold said that in addition to being unprecedented, the
swings are scary. ``High volatility normally indicates a market in
transition,'' he said. ``I wouldn't be surprised if that is the
message we're getting right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the increasingly volatile Nasdaq is where many
investors have placed their bets. According to AMG Data Services,
over half of the $113 billion investors have put into mutual funds
this year has gone into those that specialize in technology stocks
and speculative growth shares. ``This is the most focused the flows
have ever been,'' said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data
Services. ``The point is technology and all bets are pressed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, technology stocks have become much more popular
among hedge funds, investment vehicles for wealthy individuals.
According to the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group, new capital
earmarked for technology funds this year is four times the capital
going into the average hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schwab, director of shareholder communications at Strong
Funds in Milwaukee, reported that investors who called into the
fund's headquarters were concerned but not panicked. Those who did
sell shares, exited technology funds and went into money market
funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One trader said that when Nasdaq had given up all of its gain
for the year on Tuesday, the selling seemed to increase, reflecting
the desire of investors to keep the market's rout from cutting into
1999 gains. Further selling pressure in Nasdaq stocks likely came
from executives of newly-public companies eager to nail down some
of their gains before they evaporate altogether. Because these
executives typically agree to hold off from selling their shares
for months after an initial public offering, selling pressure does
not emerge for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many of these so-called lockup periods are
expiring and stock is coming onto the market. Indeed, according to
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., a research firm in New York, in the
past two weeks, stocks with upcoming lockup expirations are down
over 24 percent, almost three times the overall Nasdaq's decline.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Tuesday's decline, some strategists said, is
that it could ease some of the Federal Reserve Board's worries
about increasing demand for goods driven by an overheated stock
market. ``We think this decline in the stock market, if it
persists, could change the Fed's thought process radically,'' said
Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. ``The
plunge today is serious enough that any thought of wealth driving
the economy is going to be tempered at a minimum, and unless
there's a reversal right away, the Fed is more inclined to be more
mild with their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at The Wharton School and
author of Stocks for the Long Run, argued that Tuesday's move was
healthy because it took some of the speculative fever out of Nasdaq
stocks. ``This should surprise no one,'' he said. ``There's no way
you can make these valuations reasonable. When you have that sort
of market, when it finally falls you get tremendous gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors who have watched the technology craze from the
sidelines see a return to sanity among investors. ``We sense some
sort of balance may be coming back into the market,'' said Anthony
M. Maramarco, portfolio manager for the Babson Value Fund in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Gradually people will come to their senses and
realize that there's more out there than just technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is fundamentally strong,'' Siegel said. ``But I
think there's going to be a lot of unfulfilled hopes and
expectations among people who thought they were entering the new
world and are now finding it's a pretty harsh reality.''

AROUND THE WORLD OF MUSIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethnomusicologists are rarely accused of getting popular music
right. More often, they're engaged in pursuits that seem
excessively narrow and clinical _ pitch variance among Central
African xylophones or Connecticut River Valley fife-and-drum
history.
</P>
<P>
   Individual projects of ethnomusicology are often hard to read
and feel abstracted from what most of us consider the important
stuff: the music that we have emotional attachments to, the music
that our commercial society points us toward.
</P>
<P>
   But collect the best work of a few hundred musicologists, make
their language palatable to a general readership and, lo, the
notion that Wagner and Charlie Parker and the Beatles really
changed life as we know it holds less water. You may move beyond a
record-based understanding of music; you will see how music-making
has its basis in society and religion and commerce and the
traveling of different peoples from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   The Garland World Music Encyclopedia, a projected 10-volume
series of telephone-book-size reference works from Routledge that
started appearing in 1998, brings together this confluence of
research. Six volumes have been published; the two volumes just
released, on Europe and South Asia, are up to the level set by
their predecessors, on Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and the
Pacific Islands and South America, Mexico, Central America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Don't spend too much time fussing here about the loaded term
``world music.'' In this case it is not a naive stand-in for
``music that North Americans consider foreign''; it literally means
music made all over the world, including here.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching such a large canvas _ as well as music's importance
in dance, literature and religion _ messes profoundly with our
built-in cultural orientation. European art music, in the Garland
books, is represented by two intelligently written chapters in the
Europe volume: one a brief history running from Gregorian chant to
Alfred Schnittke, the other a historiographical chapter on how
classical music is understood in the West and an analysis of
Western concert music as ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The Garland books are not consumer guides, and they militate
against the notion that the music of a nation can be easily reduced
to a few great men making a single national music.
</P>
<P>
   For example, American music. In the forthcoming volume on the
United States and Canada, of which I have seen only a table of
contents (the book will be published in November), American music
seems to mean simply whatever has been played by people who live
here, and the circumstances of business and culture under which it
has been made.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this volume might settle heavily on blues, jazz,
country, gospel and Cajun _ our best-known heritage music _ think
again. Among the 120 chapters are ``Railways as Music Patrons,''
``Japanese Music'' (including karaoke in the United States),
``Campaign Music in the United States,'' ``Heavy Metal and Male
Desire,''and ``Prairies: A Musical Overview,'' as well as, of
course, ``Blues'' (by Neil Rosenberg, who has written a good book
on bluegrass), ``Jazz'' (by the scholar Ingrid Monson) and
``Country and Western'' (by Charles K. Wolfe, a pre-eminent
historian of early country music).
</P>
<P>
   The Garland series was first planned in 1988, when there was
almost nothing available that tried to be comprehensive. Its
editors decided to put the emphasis on place above all, so that
these encyclopedias aren't alphabetical; they're done region by
region. You can't just look up King Sunny Ade under A and be done
with it; you have to find him in the greater weave of West African
culture. Music is a consequence of all history, not just of music
critics' 10-best lists.
</P>
<P>
   Really, you may not know how important music is until you see
how these books can be used almost as general sources of knowledge
about a country. You can consult them when you're about to travel
to any place that has its own regional culture; when you see the
``Buena Vista Social Club'' and want to know the history of son;
when you want to know what the polka came from or why Yoruban
culture is so important or how Western scholars struggled to reckon
with African music's idiosyncrasies of time, harmony and timbre.
</P>
<P>
   All the essays were commissioned especially for these books; in
some cases, as in Peter Manuel's ``Pop Music and Audio-Cassette
Technology in South Asia,'' the information seems a useful
compression of books already written and published. Each volume
comes with a CD of music drawn mostly from the writers' own field
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   My one frustration with these books is that they have an uneven
standard for treating music of the last 50 years; even where you
wish they would reflect Western critical thought a little more,
they tend not to. If you look for information on Jamaican dub music
or the new Cuban timba style, you get dissertations on instrumental
ensembles instead, with a generalized history that weakly trails
off in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Afro-Brazilian chapter is better than you
would expect, taking seriously the newer pop styles that music
critics tend to wave off: samba-reggae, axe and rap.
</P>
<P>
   At $195 each, these books aren't objects one buys lightly.
(Abridged paperback versions are already under way.) But as
regional culture seems to become both more precious and more
visible _ because of the homogenizing global effect of MTV and an
increasingly sophisticated market for ``world music'' _ these books
could become as important to serious music enthusiasts as the
Oxford English Dictionary is to serious readers. (af)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are mailing in their census forms at a
rate well below what federal officials had hoped for, raising
concerns that getting an accurate population count will take longer
and cost more than it should, the chief of the Census Bureau said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide response rate, 55 percent as of Monday versus the
61 percent that the bureau had anticipated by now, is ``not a good
indicator of civic responsibility in this country,'' Dr. Kenneth
Prewitt, the census director, said at a news briefing in which he
alternated between optimism and worry, exhortation and mild
scolding.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he still hopes for a torrent of mail in the next
few days, so that the mail-in response target of 70 percent _ 5
percentage points higher than the mail-in rate from the 1990 census
_ can be reached by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   After that, counters will go to households that did not respond,
at a cost estimated at $35 per visit. For each percentage point
that the response rate rises, 1.2 million fewer household visits
will be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the census is in the hands of the American
people,'' Prewitt said, calling on his countrymen to ``reverse a
long tide of civic disengagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The census of 1990, which had a mail-response rate of 65
percent, is acknowledged to have undercounted the population by
several million, and census officials dearly want to avoid a
similar failure this time.
</P>
<P>
   Federal aid to schools, money to cities for anti-poverty
programs, the locations of new roads, sewers, banks and shopping
centers _ all those and many more features of American life are
linked one way or the other with census data, Prewitt reminded a
news conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So is representation in Congress. Though Prewitt did not mention
it on Monday, many population experts believe that some states
missed out in the 1990 census because of an overall undercount of
several million people. California, which has 52 seats in the House
of Representatives, might well have 53 if the last census had been
more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1990 and before, states in the South and Southwest lagged
behind the rest of the country in response rates, Prewitt said.
South Carolina had a response rate of 47 percent, for instance, and
Mississippi 46 percent. The District of Columbia had a response
rate of 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent of the people in Arizona responded, as did
51 percent in Texas and Oklahoma, and 50 percent in New Mexico.
Alaska had the lowest response rate among the states, 43 percent,
but the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had by far the worst record: 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio and Nebraska had the highest response rate, 62 percent,
followed by Michigan and Iowa at 61, then Pennsylvania at 60
percent. California had a 58 percent response rate.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said low response rates can be explained, at least in
part, by demographics and attitudes. States that have a high
proportion of hard-to-reach rural dwellers, or in which many people
distrust the government, tend to have low response rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said much of the mistrust, ``ill-founded but
understandable,'' is in the hearts of recent immigrants, who do not
understand or simply will not believe what is true under the law:
that information gleaned by the census is not passed on to law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt acknowledged some dismay at recent remarks by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,
expressing concern about possible invasions of privacy in questions
on the census long form, sent to one in six households.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the long form's more personal questions, about indoor
plumbing or disabled people in a household, are vital if deserving
Americans are to get the assistance they need, the director said.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau plans a barrage of ads in the days just ahead
in regions where response has been low. Anyone who lost a form can
still get one by calling 800-471-9424, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   There was another small but telling example of how the face of
the nation and its technology have changed. Organizers of a Web
site for South Asians, Chaitime.com, said Tuesday that they would
encourage U.S. residents from India, Pakistan, Sri Landa,
Bangladesh, Nepal, the Maldives and Bhutan to cooperate in the
census. The group said the American population of South Asians had
increased to more than 2.7 million today, from 815,000 in 1990 and
387,000 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt found some reasons for optimism in the results to date.
The bureau's electronic scanners have worked almost flawlessly in
processing more than 25 million forms, he said, and 58,000 forms
have been done on the Internet _ something almost inconceivable a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he urged people who are visited by census takers not to
hide or be uncooperative. ``These are not federal bureaucrats,
these are Americans,'' he said. ``Neighbors.''

COKE KEEPS GROWTH TARGET THE SAME AS IN PAST YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a bold display of the optimism that has
characterized its growth predictions in the past, Coca-Cola Co.
told investors Tuesday that it expected its sales volume to
increase 7 percent to 8 percent a year over the long term and that
it planned to increase earnings by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company disclosed preliminary results for
the first quarter, which show lower-than-expected growth of 1.5
percent worldwide, with many regions flat or down, and said it
would take a $400 million charge against earnings for poorly
performing plants and other assets in India.
</P>
<P>
   Coke made the announcements at a long-awaited meeting in New
York with analysts and money managers. It was the first such
gathering since late January, when Coke's management called
analysts together to discuss the sweeping changes set for the
company that included layoffs of 6,000 employees, decentralizing of
the business from Atlanta to the local offices around the world,
and write-downs of $1.6 billion for bad investments and the costs
of the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts listened politely Tuesday while Coke's chairman and
chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, and other senior executives
described the marketing, new-product development and other plans
the company has to generate volume growth, which is expected to be
5 percent to 6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In questions to Coke management and in interviews afterward,
however, most analysts seemed less than convinced that the company
would be able to hit its targets. Missing the target has plagued
Coke for the last eight quarters and has been a principal reason
for the 41 percent drop in the company's share price over the last
20 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 7 to 8 percent volume growth, compounded annually for 5
to 10 years, is a little aggressive,'' said Andrew Conway, a
beverage stocks analyst for Morgan Stanley, who downgraded Coke in
December, when its former chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas
Ivester, said he would step down. ``That rate is doable in any one
year, but can they do it for 10 years straight?''
</P>
<P>
   Daft said several times that the rate was realistic. ``We
believe in it, it's achievable, and we've got the programs to do
it,'' he said in response to a question from Jennifer Solomon, an
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, who asked why he was sticking
with the same growth target that Coke has had for years. ``We had
to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience described the meeting as unexpectedly flat,
apart from the growth predictions. With Coke's share price closing
at $52.375 Tuesday, up $3.0625, after falling into the low $40s in
recent weeks, the meeting had been seen by some analysts as Coke's
big chance to persuade Wall Street that the worst was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some presentations dwelled for close to an hour on topics
already well known to analysts and investors, like pricing patterns
in supermarkets and marketing efforts overseas. One long video
discussed Coke's investment over several years in building schools
in rural China and was followed by a satellite feed from Hong Kong,
where it was 4 a.m. Another showed clips from Coke-sponsored beach
parties in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The charge to earnings related to investments in India, where
Coke has spent heavily to reorganize the bottling business, will
result in a decrease of about 11 cents a share in first-quarter
earnings, said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.
Coke's chief financial officer, Gary P. Fayard, said the layoffs
would total about 5,200 people, rather than the 6,000 originally
predicted, at a cost of $725 million, less than the $800 million
forecast in January.
</P>
<P>
   Annual savings from the job reductions would be about $200
million this year, Fayard added. About 10 cents will be shaved from
first-quarter earnings to cover most of the costs of the job cuts,
he said.

 Terrence Rafferty is the critic at large for GQ magazine.  
 By TERRENCE RAFFERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although Om Puri has appeared, by his own estimate,
in something like 140 films in his 24-year screen career and has
been characterized by one expert on Indian cinema as ``the finest
actor of the post-independence generation,'' he does not expect to
be recognized on the streets of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But when he and I step out for a cigarette in front of the SoHo
Grand Hotel, a middle-aged man and woman strolling up West Broadway
look startled, walk a few steps farther up the street, and then,
after a fast conference, return to tell Puri how impressed they had
been by his performance in ``East Is East,'' which they had seen in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He accepts their praise graciously and modestly, and after they
have moved on he puffs contentedly and beams. ``That's absolutely
made my day.''
</P>
<P>
   His delight is so contagious that I instantly banish my
suspicion that this improbable encounter has been staged by the
wily publicists of Miramax, which is releasing ``East Is East''
here on Friday. To be recognized, on a nearly deserted street, for
a performance in a British art-house picture that has not even
opened in the States? Not bloody likely.
</P>
<P>
   And yet: Puri's portrayal of George Khan _ a Pakistani Muslim
married to an Englishwoman (Linda Bassett) and trying to raise
seven children in a racially mixed neighborhood near Manchester in
the 1970s _ is unforgettable, the sort of performance that should
stop traffic. (Light pedestrian traffic, at least.) So I want this
scene to be real: It couldn't happen to a nicer guy, or a better
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the hotel's smoke-free lounge, Puri, clearly stimulated
by the heady combination of recognition and nicotine, expands on
his approach to the domestic tyrant George Khan, who could easily
have been played as a monster. ``I look for subtext,'' he says,
``the hidden script within the script. Here's a working-class man
who comes to England and finds himself in circumstances that are
too huge for him to handle. It's 1971. In parliament there are
people shouting about repatriation. This man who is so rigid on the
surface has agreed to stay with his wife in a non-Muslim area and
send his children to modern schools. Even his daughter, and for a
Muslim it's very tough to send a girl child to a modern school. I
knew I had to find a space for this in my portrayal, without
departing from the script or changing the scenes. So when he hits a
child it should be with pain. The anguish on his face should give a
little balance to his monstrousness.''
</P>
<P>
   That it does. The film, directed by Damien O'Donnell from a
script by Ayub Khan-Din (based on his own play), opened smashingly
in Britain; the distributor had to quadruple the number of prints
within two weeks of its release. ``In the play,'' says O'Donnell,
``George Khan is less three-dimensional. Om brought in that
vulnerability, which makes the whole situation of the family more
ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Udayan Prasad, who directed Puri in ``Brothers in Trouble''
(1996) and ``My Son the Fanatic'' (1999), says: ``He's always
surprising you. That's the sign of a great actor. You think you
know exactly how he's going to play a scene, and then he does
something different, and better.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Son the Fanatic,'' written by Hanif Kureishi (``My
Beautiful Laundrette''), Puri plays another working-class immigrant
father, who is also a Muslim by birth and who also lives in the
industrial north, but whose parenting difficulties are precisely
the opposite of Khan's: Parvez, an easygoing cabdriver who loves
jazz, drinks a little too much and has for a best friend and
confidante a young prostitute, is alarmed that his son has become a
militant Islamic fundamentalist.
</P>
<P>
   The actor considers Parvez the richest role that he has had in
the English-speaking cinema. And besides, he says, ``I can more
easily identify with that character. I consider him to be a citizen
of the world. You could send him to Italy, you could send him to
Spain, you could send him to Japan and the man would adjust. There
is no place where there is not a collage of people, so there are
frictions everywhere. Unless people have a sense of tolerance
towards each other's beliefs, life is not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Puri describes himself as ``very, very liberal,'' which is
perhaps why most of his work in his native land has been in ``what
we call the art cinema, where the assumption is that cinema or
theater is a medium of social commitment,'' he says. As he sees it,
``My whole training has set me up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in a rural area of northern India in 1950, Puri worked his
way through a Punjabi university where he joined a theater group
and ``drifted'' from his youthful ambition to be a military man
like his father. The family did not object.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father could see that I was economically responsible and
really hard-working, so he never questioned my activities. And I
never embarrassed him.'' He then spent three years at the National
School of Drama in New Delhi, where he received what he describes,
with some understatement, as a ``very well-rounded'' education in
the theater: he played Hamlet in Hindi at age 23 and also performed
(in that language) Brecht, Shaw, Ibsen, Indian folk plays and even
a Kabuki drama.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years at the Indian Film Institute in Poona,
Puri lit out for the film-industry capital, Bombay. He anticipated
having a hard time breaking into the movies, because he did not
have ``an obvious personality'' _ which means, in part, that he was
not handsome enough to attract immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   But his theater work got him noticed and once he had begun
making movies his versatility kept him in demand. By 1981, he was
well known enough to get a call from India's greatest director,
Satyajit Ray, who was casting ``Sadgati'' (``Deliverance''), which
was to be the Bengali filmmaker's first production in Hindi; Puri
was his choice to play the lead, an untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the actor says, his career in the West is repeating
the pattern of his career in India. He has had small parts in the
major studio films ``Gandhi (1982), ``Wolf'' (1994) and ``The Ghost
and the Darkness'' (1996), as well as a substantial supporting role
in ``City of Joy'' (1992).
</P>
<P>
   But his meatiest parts have been in serious, low-budget
pictures. That's fine with him, because he has a good life and a
thriving career in Bombay, where he can practice his art in
accordance with his bedrock principle: never let yourself be
typecast. (His hero is Alec Guinness).
</P>
<P>
   ``Om has unusual range for an actor,'' Prasad says. ``He seems
equally natural playing an illiterate villager or a powerful
intellectual.'
</P>
<P>
   And equally content. Like Parvez _ and unlike George Khan _ the
man adjusts. ``I am happy to be recognized here in New York,'' Puri
says near the end of our conversation. ``But it was only two
people, and I will not work just so that next time it will be 10
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he says something that, coming from an actor, strikes
me as astonishing, and that may at least partly account for the
extraordinary mixture of intensity and serenity that informs an Om
Puri performance. ``I, frankly, don't dream, because I want to
remain happy. When you dream too much and the dream doesn't come
true, you hurt yourself. And I don't want to hurt myself. So I
don't dream. I take things as they are.'' (af)

 &HT;    University of Georgia revokes fraternity's rights as probe into
fatal wreck continues
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ University of Georgia officials suspended a
fraternity Tuesday as authorities continue to investigate the death
of one of its members in a one-car crash on a quiet country road.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Folsom Grantham III, 20, of St. Simons Island died
Thursday after the crash in nearby Watkinsville. Oconee County
Sheriff Scott Berry said that at the time of the accident, Grantham
was handcuffed and blindfolded as he rode in the cargo hold of the
Infiniti sports utility vehicle driven by a fraternity pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department and UGA officials are investigating
whether his death was the result of hazing by Alpha Tau Omega.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel at this point that we need to send a very serious
message to the organization,'' said Richard Mullendore, UGA's vice
president for student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Under UGA's policy governing organizations, the interim
suspension is imposed ``when the alleged action of the organization
is of such an egregious nature as to require an immediate
response.'' The fraternity may not hold any social or recruitment
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn Smiley, the fraternity's executive director, agreed with
the suspension and said the national organization has issued its
own suspension of UGA's chapter as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   But Smiley and Berry disagree on several facts surrounding the
accident:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Grantham was handcuffed and blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether there were two or three cars carrying fraternity
brothers in a caravan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether fraternity members left the scene of the accident
before help arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also want to know whether Grantham was forced into
the vehicle _ or a willing participant.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said a group of ATO pledges took Grantham from his
apartment near the UGA campus Thursday night and loaded him into
the back of an Infiniti SUV driven by fraternity pledge Walter
David Penn Jr., 20, of Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said it started as a harmless fraternity prank _ a ``road
trip.'' The fraternity tradition involves takingsomeone off-campus,
leaving him and letting him find his way back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding at this point is that Ben knew about it, he
was prepared for it and he was a willing participant,'' Smiley
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he has not seen any evidence that Grantham was
handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The prank took a tragic turn south of Watkinsville. The SUV
flipped and hit a tree. Three people, including Grantham, were
thrown from the vehicle. Investigators say none of the five
passengers wore seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, who underwent surgery Monday for two broken legs, remains
in fair condition at an Athens hospital. Rob Bailey, 18, of Dalton
was in good condition Tuesday. Authorities have not identified the
two other occupants of the car. Officials said they were not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Grantham probably died moments after the 11:37
p.m. crash. ``The wounds that he received from the crash were
mortal wounds,'' Oconee County coroner John Simpson said. Abrasions
around Grantham's wrists indicated he had been wearing handcuffs or
some kind of restraints when he died, Simpson added.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said officers found handcuffs at the scene of the accident
and that they may have been taken off Grantham after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said the handcuffs didn't make any difference in
Grantham's chances for survival, ``but not wearing a seat belt and
being in the back of the vehicle didn't help his situation any.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said information indicates that there was a three-vehicle
caravan of ATO members. Berry also said that when authorities
arrived at the wreck, the other two vehicles were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said only one other vehicle with ATO members was in the
caravan. The other vehicle took Penn to the hospital because the
members knew Grantham and Bailey needed medical assistance, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the (third) car just happened on the scene,'' Smiley
said. ``Maybe it was high school kids or something,''

RESIGNATION OF JAPAN'S CABINET PAVES WAY FOR NEW PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs to reorganize, recast top grafs, raise Watanabe's quote
to 4th graf.) 
(See also JAPAN-OBUCHI-REACT) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's Cabinet resigned Tuesday, setting the stage for
a rapid succession after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi fell into a
coma on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Formalized at a brief meeting Tuesday evening, the cabinet's
resignation is expected to be followed by the nomination of the
Liberal Democratic Party's candidate to take over the government.
That nomination may come as early as Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is already widely reported be the party's
second-ranking official, Yoshiro Mori. Once he was nominated,
Parliament would vote almost immediately to ratify him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question about the choice,'' said Kozo Watanabe,
vice speaker of Parliament's lower house. ``The central commission
of the LDP will announce Mr. Mori's selection, and their junior
coalition partners will support it. In that event, we will have a
new prime minister before Parliament tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   With tears streaking down his cheeks, the caretaker prime
minister, Mikio Aoki, said Tuesday afternoon that the dissolution
of the government was made ``based on the judgment of the doctors
and from the viewpoint that we should not allow even one moment's
political vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   The news came after persistent reports throughout the day that
Obuchi's condition was steadily worsening and that the prime
minister was brain dead. Aoki denied that, calling himself ``very
upset'' at news organizations for passing on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians close to the transition process and several Japanese
political analysts said Tuesday that the governing party had used
the extraordinary 22-hour news blackout surrounding Obuchi's
hospitalization early Sunday, and the carefully stage-managed
process since, to engineer the selection of Mori as its unopposed
candidate for the succession.
</P>
<P>
   The party has a long history of running things; it has governed
the country alone or in coalitions for all but two and a half years
since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive handling of the news of Obuchi's hospitalization
and the back-room machinations drew renewed criticisms Tuesday from
several quarters, with the view that the episode revealed a side of
Japan that was neither altogether modern nor democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who is 62 and has been the party's secretary-general, won
support by demonstrating a strong loyalty to Obuchi. Even more
useful to him were his close ties to the party's major coalition
partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's ratification by the parliament, or Diet, is already
considered a foregone conclusion, since the coalition, led by the
Liberal Democratic Party, has a large majority.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said Tuesday, however, that by choosing Mori _
a burly, raspy voiced politician not especially known for his
personal popularity or campaigning skills _ the party was taking a
huge risk in national elections that are expected to be held before
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The choice spoke volumes, they said, about some unusual
imperatives in Japanese politics _ loyalty to partners and allies
in a crunch _ rather than to the party's immediate political needs
and even potentially to its survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that the LDP lacks people who could enjoy
popularity,'' said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor of politics at
Niigata University of International and Information Studies.
``There is Mr. Kono and Mr. Kato, both of whom would probably be
more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, and Koichi Kato, a former
chief Cabinet secretary, were both believed to aspire to the prime
minister's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the LDP is basing its decision on who has a good
relationship with Komeito,'' Ishikawa, a former senior political
correspondent of the daily Asahi Shimbun, said. ``They are not
thinking of the reaction of the people of Japan, and this behavior
is very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, many analysts were already describing the Liberal
Democratic Party's choice of Mori on the basis of the New Komeito
Party's comfort as a recipe for electoral difficulties, because the
coalition between the two parties has been deeply unpopular since
it was formed last October. Opinion polls have consistently shown
that Japanese voters disapprove of having a party with religious
affiliations in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The new government will have to dissipate growing criticism of
the secretive, seemingly antiquated mechanics of a succession in
which Aoki was allowed to become caretaker merely on the basis of
what he described as a private conversation with Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Further contributing to the image of a process of party barons
meeting in smoke-filled rooms to keep the public in the dark was
the way in which Mori was selected.
</P>
<P>
   Some political insiders spoke Tuesday with almost reverential
approval of the off-stage consultations that produced Mori as
Obuchi's successor, describing it as a confirmation of the
efficiency of Japan's political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Aoki's reaction to Obuchi's collapse was very tactful,''
said Watanabe, the deputy speaker. ``If he had waited a week or 10
days after Mr. Obuchi collapsed, somebody else could have raised
their hand as a candidate, and there could be some chaos. But by
the time Mr. Aoki announced the condition of Mr. Obuchi, it was
already virtually decided who would take over.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for independent politicians and commentators,
and indeed much of the public, the process provided a field day of
introspection about how, 55 years after World War II, Japan has
remained a democracy largely in name rather than in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Japanese politicians keep saying `minshushugi' there
is no spirit of democracy in this country,'' said Kaoru Okano, a
political commentator who is a former president of Meiji University
in Tokyo, using the Japanese word for democracy. ``There are
statesman and politicians in the west. In Japan there is a third
category, wheeler-dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Okano said that the current crisis had revealed Japan to be
dominated by this latter category.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other commentators said the failure of the country's leaders to
operate in a more open manner and include the people in their
decision making had contributed to widespread public distrust of
politicians and disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of choosing a successor has revealed itself as not
very democratic, and is indeed very closed,'' said Shusei Tanaka, a
political scientist at Fukuyama University in Hiroshima. ``I have
the feeling that whoever comes out of this coalition will probably
be the same, and the people of Japan feel much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that even if the prime minister changes, the
policies won't. We are in need of dramatic reforms of Japanese
politics.''

CONSULTANTS AND STATES SIPHON MILLIONS IN MEDICAID FOR YOUNG, SAYS
GAO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicaid money
designated for disabled poor children has been siphoned off by
consulting firms and state governments, federal investigators said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report on Medicaid in schools, the General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, described many ``improper
payments,'' accused schools of overstating their Medicaid costs and
said the problems had been allowed to fester because of weak
supervision by federal Medicaid officials.
</P>
<P>
   School districts often pay contingency fees to private firms to
help them prepare and submit Medicaid claims, then bill Medicaid
for these fees, in violation of federal rules, the investigators
said. The consultants typically charge fees equal to 10 percent or
15 percent of any federal Medicaid money they get for schools, but
some firms charge 20 percent or 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The contingency fees tend to ``encourage questionable claims,''
the accounting office said. Schools and consulting firms operate in
``an environment of opportunism,'' filing ``improper Medicaid
claims for administrative activities'' without providing
appropriate services to needy children, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy M. Westmoreland, the top federal Medicaid official, said
he generally agreed with the findings. ``The GAO found problems and
made recommendations,'' he said. ``We concur. We'll take steps to
make sure Medicaid money is used only for children and services
covered by Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   But state health officials took issue with the criticism. They
said the Clinton administration had never given them clear guidance
about how federal Medicaid money could be used in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Tuesday that they were trying to
establish the exact amount of the improper payments and might try
to recover some of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was requested more than a year ago by Sens.
William Roth, R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance Committee, and
Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the senior Democrat on the
panel. The committee plans to hold a hearing on the issue
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to 41 million
people, including 13 million school-age children. States have
increasingly used the schools as a way to deliver health care to
children, especially those with physical and mental disabilities,
mental retardation, autism and similar problems. Many schools also
identify children eligible for Medicaid and help them enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in 47 states received $2.3 billion in Medicaid payments
for school-based health services last year. The average claim for
each child on Medicaid ranged from a high of $818 in Maryland to
less than $1 in Mississippi. Claims averaged $703 for a child in
New York, $248 in New Jersey and $174 in Connecticut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its report, the GAO's office of special investigations made
these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Schools, states and consulting firms use ``creative billing
practices'' to maximize the money they get from the federal
government for school health services, but states often keep much
of the money. Schools in some states, like New Jersey, receive as
little as $7.50 in federal Medicaid reimbursements for every $100
they spend on health care for needy children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some schools improperly claimed Medicaid money for health care
and medical evaluations provided to children who were not eligible.
</P>
<P>
   _ In some states, schools got more than $600 a month from
Medicaid simply because an eligible child attended school for one
day a month, regardless of whether the child received any health
care services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Schools charged Medicaid for school bus transportation never
provided to children, ``resulting in improper Medicaid
reimbursements.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Group therapy sessions were billed as individual therapy
sessions,'' and as a result schools received higher Medicaid
payments than they should have.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the consulting companies included Maximus
and Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   Rachael A. Rowland, a spokeswoman for Maximus, based in McLean,
Va., said such companies played a legitimate role. ``Small and poor
school districts would not be able to obtain Medicaid funds and
provide services to the disabled if they did not have consulting
firms to help them'' file claims, she said. But, she added, ``some
firms other than Maximus do charge excessive fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche did not return calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said that schools in Michigan had received tens of
millions of dollars from the federal government for staff training
and other activities supposedly related to Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   But, it said, the activities had no connection to Medicaid, the
program was not mentioned in training sessions and ``the staff did
not know what Medicaid covers, where or how to apply for Medicaid
or who might qualify for coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Geralyn A. Lasher, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of
Community Health, defended the state's practices. ``We are
providing health care to children who need it,'' Lasher said. ``For
four or five years, we have been asking the federal Health Care
Financing Administration for guidance on school-based health
services. We got no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said, ``I find it appalling that anyone would take
advantage of a system designed to serve children who are
predominantly poor and disabled.'' Senator Moynihan said: ``The GAO
is obviously right. Medicaid needs to be policed and administered
to make sure the money is used for medical care for children, not
to offset other costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said schools often ended up with a small part of what
Medicaid paid for the services they provided. For example, it said,
when a New Jersey school files a claim for $100, the federal
government pays half of that amount, or $50. But, it said, the
state keeps $42.50 of the federal payment, leaving $7.50 for the
school district.

 &HT;    Analysts call Coca-Cola's 15% profit growth estimate too high
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Innovation. Innovation. Innovation.
</P>
<P>
   For five hours Tuesday, Coca-Cola Co. executives hammered on
that theme as they outlined the company's strategic plans to about
250 beverage analysts and institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first or last time Coca-Cola has reinvented
itself,'' Chairman Doug Daft said at a Wall Street hotel only a
stone's throw from the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Daft told analysts that the ``new'' Coca-Cola will be creative
and flexible enough to produce long-term profit growth of about 15
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   While that number is lower than the previous company target of
15 percent to 20 percent earnings-per-share growth, several
analysts think it's too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year in and year out, it's an ambitious strategy,'' said
Andrew Conway of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. A more realistic goal,
Conway said, is 12 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Cohen thinks the number should be 13
percent, while Bill Pecoriello of Sanford Bernstein estimates it at
13 percent to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Every percentage point is important because the company's stock
price is largely dependent on whether it hits its targets.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock posted a strong gain Tuesday despite a rocky
trading session. The stock closed at $51.75, up $2.43 3/4. It was
higher in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Daft announced that the company was comfortable keeping its
target for growth in case sales _ a key indicator _ at 7 percent to
8 percent a year. Several analysts also thought that was too high,
by a percentage point or two.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company announced that case sales for the first
quarter rose by only 3 percent. For the year, officials said, case
sales should rise by 5 percent to 6 percent, before returning to
target levels as economies continue to rebound around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Missing targets in recent years is one of the reasons the
company's stock has fallen so much. It's also one of the reasons
why Daft and the company's other top executives spent so much time
and energy talking about the innovation that will pump sales in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   From top to bottom, they said, the company's major
reorganization will make it far less bureaucratic and much more
able to meet local beverage needs in the 200 markets it serves. The
company also promised to react much more quickly to changes in
those markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the concentration on innovation is to say that we can
come up with the products, packages and distribution ideas to meet
our long-term targets,'' said Manny Goldman, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch. ``I think meeting those targets are a challenge. But
I think they have a good chance. It will get back to how innovative
they can be.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of Coca-Cola execs from throughout the world paraded
in front of the podium to explain their strategies. Those included
creating new local drinks for different markets, relying more on
noncarbonated drinks to meet more consumer needs, employing
e-commerce marketing strategies to take advantage of the Internet
and teaming with retailers to drive sales with joint marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we have increased your conviction that we can do
it,'' President Jack Stahl told the analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Coca-Cola said it will be taking a charge of $400 million to
write down its bottling assets in India because of excess capacity
and a substantial tax increase there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daft told reporters he could not comment on the settlement
negotiations regarding a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by
former and current African-American employees. He said he did not
agree with the plaintiffs' claims that the company has
systematically discriminated against African-Amercians in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that diversity is one of his top priorities and
that the company is committed to making changes that improve the
situation.

GROWING NUMBER OF COMPANIES MONITOR EMPLOYEES' E-MAIL

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Quinn, a systems manager for a toy company near Montreal,
is starting to learn more about his fellow employees than he had
ever wanted to know. He has found that one co-worker has a penchant
for herbal remedies, another likes jokes about women drivers and
another checks the lottery numbers each morning.
</P>
<P>
   He knows these things because, about a month ago, Quinn
installed a new piece of software on the computer network that
enables him to monitor not only every Web site that his employees
browse, but every e-mail message that they send or receive. With a
few clicks, he can open a window on a computer screen and see the
senders, recipients and subject headings of each message. Those
details, he said, help him figure out exactly what is straining his
e-mail server, which has been crashing at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy, he's sending e-mail to his girlfriend,'' Quinn said
as he scrolled through messages sent by employees of his company,
Ritvik Toys, on a recent afternoon. ``But this message here, that's
for business. And that one's for business, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To office workers elsewhere, Quinn's surveillance might sound
like Big Brother in action. But if they think it is of no immediate
concern to them, they should think again. Ritvik Toys is one of
hundreds of companies that are looking at workers' correspondence
on a routine basis. And the number of companies doing so is
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market for e-mail monitoring has basically doubled in size
over the last year,'' said Abner Germanow, a research manager at
the International Data Corp. ``And we anticipate it to grow very
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Company managers give a variety reasons for installing such
software. Some, like Quinn, are on the lookout for oversize e-mail
attachments that clog their networks. Others seek to dissuade
employees from using their systems for personal activities. And
others want to make sure employees are not sending harassing e-mail
messages that could cause trouble for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the snooping raises ethical questions.
Should managers really be peeking into people's private lives like
this? And what should they do with sensitive information that, if
disclosed, could jeopardize an employee's career?
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's original purpose in installing the software, called
SuperScout, was to manage his mail server more efficiently. But he
has since grappled with the privacy issue, deciding against
programs that would let him store and review the text of messages,
rather than just the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's none of my business,'' said Quinn, an amiable computer
guru with a hint of a Scottish accent, abundant freckles and a
beeper on his belt. ``I'm not just sitting here to watch people.
But if there is a problem, I want to be able to pinpoint it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, electronic monitoring applied mostly to Web
browsing. It was easy for managers to look through logs of Web
sites visited by employees. By contrast, tracking e-mail meant
sitting in front of an e-mail server for hours, watching lines of
text stream by. Few managers bothered.
</P>
<P>
   But the last six months, software has become more advanced,
enabling companies automatically to record, filter and sort every
word that streams through their networks. SuperScout, a product
made by SurfCONTROL, for example, can generate bar charts showing
the 10 people who receive the most e-mail, the top 10 who send the
most e-mail and the top 10 who send the biggest messages. Another
product, xVmail, made by xVault, enables managers to view and
search the text of messages. Symantec Corp. and GFI Fax and Voice
have also introduced e-mail monitoring products the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said employees' habit of sending personal e-mails never
bothered him him _ until the messages overwhelmed Ritvik's
electronic network. ``It's all about bandwidth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritvik, which employs about 700 people year-round and 400 more
in the summer and fall, is a decidedly old-economy company. A
showroom in its headquarters just west of Montreal displays dozens
of models, from castles to cowboys, that can be made with its
colorful plastic blocks, called Mega Bloks. Huge molding machines
whir and hiss on the building's first floor, where the toys are
made seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   But like most manufacturers, Ritvik relies more and more on the
Internet to get the job done. Its 200 salaried employees now file
purchase orders, do product research and make sales calls by e-mail
and on the Web. A few years ago, the company put in a
high-bandwidth telephone line, known as an ISDN, and will move to
an even faster line, a T1, this month. But even then, Quinn said,
the stream of data will probably fill those pipes until bigger ones
come along.
</P>
<P>
   So, he said, ``Instead of just buying more bandwidth, we decided
to address the problem.'' This week, a month after installing the
software, Ritvik planned to instituted a new policy requiring
employees to use discretion in their use of the network. It will
also warn them that their e-mail messages may be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Such disclosure is a good business practice, according to the
American Management Association. At some point, it may be required
by law in much of the United States. One bill in the works, for
example, would make secret monitoring illegal in California.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is hoping disclosure will be a powerful deterrent. From
what he has seen, at least 50 percent of the company's e-mail is
not related to work. And, he says, certain names keep appearing on
lists of heavy e-mail users, including an employee he has nicknamed
the herbal-remedy guy, who has spent hours looking at the Web site
of Deepak Chopra, the author of spiritual books, and sending
messages about herbal therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Others send jokes. ``Look at this guy,'' he said, as he pointed
to a subject heading titled, ``Joke of the Day'' and another titled
``Women Drivers.'' He scrolled further, displaying even more jokes
all sent by the same employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all he's been doing for the last hour,'' Quinn said,
throwing up his hands. It is not his responsibility to monitor
employee productivity, he said, but he cannot help but wonder how
such people get their work done.
</P>
<P>
   Ritvik employees had mixed emotions about the planned policy.
``It is a breach of your privacy, I guess,'' said Karen Trainor,
the company's North American distribution supervisor. ``If someone
knows everything you are writing, that's not really fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, she had heard that the company was trying to
shore up its networks and might need to check e-mail traffic to do
so. Besides, she has known Quinn for years and trusts him. ``If
that's what they are doing, I guess they have a reason to do it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For all its usefulness, though, e-mail monitoring raises the
question of who exactly should be put under the lens. The
technology department at the Southern California Edison Federal
Employees Credit Union, for example, recently installed GFI Fax
software. But while one employee was reprimanded for sending 150
e-mails in one day, said Tony Salse, director of information
technology, the credit union's senior managers and board members
need not worry about a similar fate. ``We'll probably exempt them
from that kind of scrutiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the delicate question of how hard to clamp down.
After all, most people send out the occasional personal greeting or
joke to family members and friends, and banning that would be
overkill, in the view of Chris McNierney, the manager of
information systems at Seaboard International, a lumber wholesaler
in New Hampshire. McNierney installed xVault software on his
network in January to track the origins of viruses and offensive
messages.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``People are going to have friends and make
relationships in an office. Obviously you are going to have e-mails
going back and forth, and I'm not sure you want to suppress that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, his goal was to spot ``questionable e-mail''
before it gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can head things off before we have to make an example of
somebody,'' McNierney said.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have, in fact, fired people for what is contained
in their e-mail. At The New York Times Co., 23 employees at an
office in Norfolk, Va., that handles most of the company's
personnel records, accounting and payroll operations were dismissed
in December for sending what were considered obscene messages,
according to Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The Times Co.
Catherine Mathis, another spokeswoman, said the messages were
discovered as a result of a separate investigation into an
employee's use of company stationery to obtain unemployment
benefits for a friend. The Times Co. said it does not routinely
monitor its employees' e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Once monitoring becomes routine, it also falls into grayer areas
of the law, according to some lawyers familiar with workplace
privacy issues. A few lawyers have argued that a casual e-mail
exchange is more like a telephone conversation than a printed memo
and should be protected in the same way that wiretap laws prohibit
government agencies and some businesses from secretly listening to
personal conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you entrust the government with this kind of
information?'' asked Jeremy E. Gruber, legal director for the
National Workrights Institute at a recent New York Bar Association
discussion on electronic privacy. ``Why do we think that employers
will use it in a wonderful way?''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn acknowledges that monitoring systems can be abused. For
example, he has no trouble imagining a network manager who takes
offense at an e-mail message most people would consider innocuous _
and who makes life difficult for the sender as a result. ``You have
to ask: whose opinion draws the line?'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has become a true believer in his company's new
tracking software. Among other benefits, he says, it has helped him
plug a security hole he might not otherwise have spotted: hackers
who have sneaked into Ritvik's e-mail server and are using it as
their in-box.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he is,'' Quinn said, pulling up a list of e-mail
messages from someone using an account at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio. He said he plans to install a fire wall this month to
keep such impostors out.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn pulled up a bar chart of the top-10 e-mail senders for the
afternoon. ``And, the winner today is . . .'' he said with a
flourish. The top bar, in blue, showed the name of a Ritvik sales
representative. ``OK, that's legit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the hacker in Ohio? Pointing to the screen, Quinn said, ``He
only came in fourth.'' &QL;

THE CORPORATION AS FANTASY VILLAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   Phillip Lopate's most recent book is ``Totally Tenderly
Tragically,'' a collection of film essays.  
 By PHILLIP LOPATE c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through ``Erin Brockovich,'' I began to peel off from
that hugely likable movie and consider its curious new genre, whose
template has already hardened. Once again, as in ``The Rainmaker''
and ``A Civil Action,'' a David law firm was suing a Goliath
corporation on behalf of the company's victims.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the corporation was responding with a conspiracy of
silence and intimidation. And once again I had that uneasy feeling
that something was missing: a credible, complex opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Erin, the white-trash paralegal, was silencing with her earthy
eloquence the top legal brains of Pacific Gas and Electric, as well
as her snooty Ivy League superiors. Like a Capra hero facing down
Washington bigwigs, she was shaming them all with populist lectures
on decency.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it mattered somewhat that Erin was played by Julia
Roberts, and most audiences were willing to suspend disbelief to
see their adorable, cleavage-baring audience-surrogate making
mincemeat of the boys and girls in suits. It was wish-fulfillment
time. Never mind that Erin Brockovich was based on a true story of
a lawsuit that PG&AMP;E settled for a record $333 million; it could not
have been this easy in real life.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the results are less triumphant, as in ``The
Rainmaker,'' Francis Ford Coppola's elegant 1997 rendition of the
John Grisham novel, or ``A Civil Action'' (1998), the lugubrious
screen version of Jonathan Harr's fine book, this is a strangely
compromised genre. Suing the big bad corporation for its misdeeds,
you might say, is the old Kurosawa revenge plot with a non-violent
twist: instead of laying waste to the castle for ruining the
villagers, the hero invades it in order to bring them back an
indemnification check.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the dramatic problem is that it is so hard to put human
features on the narrative's villain, the corporation. Since
corporate power has become so diffuse, it's not easy to locate a
center of authority. Though millions of Americans work for
corporations, it's curious how reluctant movies are to show the
corporate world from inside. The last time Hollywood seriously
tackled corporate life was in the 1950s and '60s, when movies such
as ``The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,'' ``Executive Suite,''
``Patterns,'' ``The Apartment'' and ``How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying'' dealt with the conforming stresses the
individual employee faced in making his way up the corporate
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, except for the occasional Michael J. Fox or Michael
Douglas vehicle, the emphasis has shifted to the investigative
outsider trying to bring down the blood-stained corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Why are corporations made the villains now? They began to be
demonized in the '60s as part of the attack on the
military-industrial complex. And now, with the Cold War over and
big government under siege, big business would seem to be the only
power in town. Yet there is also no socialist alternative being put
forth in the political discussion; a booming stock market beckons
even the smallest investor.
</P>
<P>
   And movies are made by entertainment conglomerates, so a
Hollywood attack on corporatism must pull its punches. (On the
other hand, one often has the sense that filmmakers, seeing
themselves as mavericks, smuggle into these projects their
resentment against the studio bean counters who oversee them.) How
much can we Americans bear to see corporations treated as villains?
</P>
<P>
   The movies in question show a deep ambivalence on this score.
Backing off from a nuanced presentation of corporate life, the
filmmakers opt for melodramatic caricature. Thus, even in ``The
Insider,'' probably the most subtle of the recent anticorporate
films, the Big Tobacco executive played by Michael Gambon is shown
stroking a tabby cat, a sure sign of his diabolical nature.
</P>
<P>
   The closest we come to a corporate face in ``A Civil Action'' is
the Grace executive played by Sydney Pollack, who (perhaps
preparing for his debauchee role in ``Eyes Wide Shut'') demands
that the hero put his feet up on a glass coffee table _ that's the
extent of his characterization.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake of ``A Civil Action,'' besides miscasting John
Travolta as a worldly lawyer, was building the film around a
successful middle-class character who gets idealism and suffers
financially as a result. A rule of the genre is that the hero who
takes on the corporation must do so from the outside: from a tiny,
marginal law firm, preferably as a working-class paralegal such as
Erin Brockovich (the Danny DeVito character in ``The Rainmaker''
never got his law degree, either).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first, often most satisfying, act of these pictures follows
the straitened protagonists, chasing jobs and cockroaches,
scrambling around a hardscrabble trailer- camp milieu, until they
discover the Big Wrong, a trail of ordinary folk victimized by
corporate misconduct. The investigators confront the corporation
with their suspicions: a camera panning up the glass-curtained
tower leads to the scene with the Suits, a phalanx of well-dressed
lawyers facing off against the good guys in a conference room.
</P>
<P>
   Though we are meant to get a chill from the steel and glass,
there is invariably something enticing about this corporate decor,
especially after all the broken-down bungalows and motel rooms we
have been treated to. Here is the first ambivalence: the audience
has been ushered into the dragon's den, only to find nothing very
sinister and much that is glossy-magazine appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the inability to differentiate the wall of
Suits, who speak as one, means that they come off as comically
weak, afraid to make decisions or negotiate. Ultimately, the
consensus nature of corporate power is distorted as bureaucratic
cowardice; the CEO, if he appears at all, is only another empty
suit. The fact that corporations may have their own intelligent,
articulate rationales for what they do, however self-serving, is
rarely made clear.
</P>
<P>
   The genre alternates between the working-class and corporate
worlds: the protagonists try to keep the victims united under one
legal strategy (scenes of worsening illness and death stiffen the
team's resolve), then return to the corporate fortress for more
jousting with the Suits.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bloated, protracted quality to these films; they tend
to sag in the middle, and go on for half an hour too long. The
lassitude that invades their second acts comes partly from the loss
of confrontational edge. As the Enemy recedes from definition,
turns increasingly vaporous, the vacuum on one side of the conflict
can only be balanced by more dogged ``procedure'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Procedure is also a way of demonstrating the heroes' work ethic.
It pays off in the ``leak'' or the location of the missing document
at the end of Act Two, which cracks the case.
</P>
<P>
   Anticorporate films are only seemingly subversive. In fact, they
enshrine the capitalist principles of individualism and hard work.
The old American ethos declared that if you worked hard you might
become a millionaire; the new one says, if you pound the pavements
and scan the computer records long enough, you might nail a
millionaire. And maybe become one in the process, as shown by the
having-your-cake-and-eating-it ending of ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   She gets a $2 million dollar bonus and continues to ring
doorbells to help the little people. Meanwhile her boss (played by
Albert Finney) moves his law firm from its modest digs to a sleek
tower. If you can beat them, join them. There is no perceptible
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood seems unable to portray corporations
realistically, it uses the more manageably compact law firm as a
surrogate. Hence our obsession with lawyers, those middlemen
between the powerless public and the glacial corporation. The law
firm, the hospital and the Mafia are all being pressed into
metaphorical service for corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   But until our movies give us an intelligent working model of
corporate life, there will be a fairy-tale thinness to the screen's
representation of the way our society functions at this moment.

 &HT;    Simply put, Tiger's The Man
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Tiger Woods admitted it. Right there in front of
100 reporters and CNN and the world. Didn't bat an eye, didn't
pause, just flat-out blurted that, indeed, it was true.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Tiger Woods has been intimidated on a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Not lately, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thomas Bjorn and Rocco Mediate start hyperventilating
about their chances in the 64th Masters, which begins Thursday,
they should be forewarned. This once-in-a-storybook-lifetime
revelation came more than a decade ago when the best golfer on this
planet was playing in the Junior World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger was 11.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing on the tee staring at a par-4 hole 290 yards
away when Woods' 12-year-old opponent, whose name he can't even
remember, drove the green. Drove it. At age 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little taken aback,'' he conceded. ``It was the first
and only time in my life I was intimidated on a golf course. I felt
like there was no way I could compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Tiger's gotten over it. Now it's Tiger who
intimidates, who dominates, who sends golfers fleeing in his path
at first sight of his name on the leader board. Davis Love III has
all but said as much when he said, ``He's driving this tour right
now. If anybody starts beating you like he does, you start
thinking, `Can I beat him?' And he thrives on that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Love's the fourth-ranked player in the world. After losing
four times head-to-head to Tiger, Love said what probably 98
percent of the PGA Tour had to be thinking. The tour's become Tiger
and everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   First- or second-place finishes in 10 of his last 11
tournaments, including six straight victories for the longest such
streak since Ben Hogan in 1948, have a way of convincing people
Tiger is unbeatable. Only Hal Sutton, after his one-stroke win over
Tiger at The Players Championship two weeks ago, spoke as the voice
of hope when he suggested that Woods is not God.
</P>
<P>
   Some who have seen Tiger's drives might argue that point. In
fact, there is a new Web site up whose self-deprecating address is
TigerWoodsIsGod.com, complete with a photo of a Zeus-like figure
superimposed atop the leader board at the 18th as Woods won here in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The site welcomes you to the First Church of Tiger Woods and
even posts a Ten Commandments that begins with ``Thou shalt not
wear red on any day but Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' he said Tuesday in typical understated fashion.
``That's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Tiger has yet to be seen walking on water and, in fact,
spends very little in the stuff. He doesn't necessarily refute the
idea of his own divinity, but it's safe to say that very few of his
rivals have a prayer of standing up to the 24-year-old phenom who
won here by a 12-stroke margin in his first Masters as a pro and
has since improved.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Augusta National has new teeth in the form of
tighter fairways, more pitched greens and the identical 1 3/8-inch
rough that was introduced last year only plays to Tiger's strength.
Tiger said he didn't understand the need for the Masters to
constantly tweak the course by adding rough here and a bunker
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just something they like to do around here,'' he
said. ``Maybe they get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   One would think Tiger might have a similar problem, given his
dominance over the last year and his 18 tour victories in only 3
1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, since he left here a year ago, he comes better equipped
to win his third major and gain more ground on the 18 major
championships of Jack Nicklaus, a specific goal of Tiger's and a
list he kept taped on his bedroom wall growing up.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters? Heck, he's already got his sights set on a
modern-era Grand Slam. I wrote three years ago that that goal was
well within his reach and little has changed to dissuade that
opinion. His answer on the subject was flippant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win the right four tournaments,'' he said, ``you're
doing all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is obviously doing better than that. He's likely to erase
all golf records before he's 35 and, with $14 million in earnings,
has already made more money than Nicklaus has in his entire career.
If you have first pick in your Masters office pool, the choice is
obvious. Gonzaga might be a trendy selection in the basketball
pool, but other than David Duval, Darren Clarke, Phil Mickelson or
maybe even Love, Tiger's the man. In his last 12 rounds here, he's
20 under par.
</P>
<P>
   And with his tunnel vision, coupled with better 20/15 eyesight
after laser surgery to correct his nearsightedness, that can only
be scary for the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it, ``I've been targeting this.''
</P>
<P>
   So were his victories in the Mercedes and AT&AMP;T and Bay Hill
afterthoughts? Rather, his life is coming around in a way that
perfectly complements his golf game. He is more at ease with the
press, gets along better with his fellow golfers and has a better
understanding of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger comes to the Masters with a new, tighter, more compact
golf swing, a new, more positive and upbeat caddie, a new
less-serious manager, a new, 25-pounds-heavier physique, even a new
girlfriend. A girlfriend who the sacrilegious Web site reminded is
named Joanna Jagoda, or JaGODa.
</P>
<P>
   However, he still has that same old mind-set. That's got to
worry his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he no longer has any feelings of inadequacy, of
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``if I stepped into a ring with Tyson, I
wouldn't feel too good about my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Masters, however, is Tiger's own personal ring. Oh, and that
junior tournament in which he was outdriven? Tiger came back to win
that one, too.

ELIAN WAITS INSIDE AS TENSION GROWS OUTSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs to rewrite and update throughout; note byline change.) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez teased a phalanx of news
photographers Tuesday by making faces at them through a window in
his great-uncle's home, demonstrators broke through metal police
barricades while the police stood by and watched.
</P>
<P>
   And, when an untrue rumor spread that an Immigration and
Naturalization Service van was approaching the house, demonstrators
formed a human chain around the yard to defy federal officers who
never came.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they would take no action until the nearly 200
demonstrators calmed down, and then would move those nearest the
house back behind the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Day 132 of the Elian saga passed much like many recent days, as
government officials and Elian's family members again tried and
failed to work out a plan for the peaceful, uneventful transfer of
the Cuban shipwreck survivor from the Miami house to his father.
Talks were expected to resume on Thursday. Immigration officials
said the father's trip to the United States from Cuba was imminent
without saying when it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, will have legal custody of
his son as soon as he lands in the United States, said Maria
Cardona, a spokeswoman for the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   But how the actual reunion will be accomplished is still much in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, was expected to leave for
Cuba Tuesday evening to help arrange the father's trip, although
visas for only five of the 27 people that President Fidel Castro
has ordered to accompany Gonzalez have been granted.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Gonzalez would go with the smaller group if he could
return quickly with the boy, and not have to wait for the outcome
of a court fight over Elian's custody in the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Visas have been granted for Elian's father, his stepmother, his
half-brother, a cousin, his pediatrician and his kindergarten
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government wants to send a larger delegation on the
trip to retrieve the boy, including a psychiatrist, Elian's
classmates and Ricardo Alarcon, the president of the National
Assembly and an adviser to Castro. The other visa requests are
still being considered, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives want three psychologists to evaluate the
emotional trauma the boy may suffer if he is sent back to Cuba. In
return for their help in peacefully handing over the child, they
also want a guarantee from immigration officials that Elian will
not be sent back to Cuba before the appeals process is over.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Elian's cousin and closest friend here,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, was hospitalized for the second time since
Elian's rescue at sea, after an emotional interview Tuesday morning
in which she pleaded that Elian not be sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on Thanksgiving Day.
His mother was among 10 people who died after their boat sank in
the crossing from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As the stalemate continued, polls showed that almost two-thirds
of those Americans questioned want Elian returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll found that of 998 respondents, 64
percent said the child should be returned to his father. An ABC
poll of 930 people found that 59 percent wanted the father and son
reunited.

JOSEPH IS BLAND, BUT CHECK OUT THOSE TEETH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are there sunspots? Meteor showers? Something else akimbo with
the cosmos? Surely so, because PBS is packaging Andrew Lloyd
Webber, Donny Osmond and Joan Collins into one gaudy package
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the public network's slogan says: If PBS won't, who will?
Excellent question. Well, who? I'm waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a newly filmed version of Webber's ``Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' a freaky, creaky, campy bit of
stagecraft based on the Genesis story of Joseph, the son of Jacob,
triumphing after his 11 envious brothers sell him into slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A dewy-eyed and dentally endowed Osmond is Joseph in the
80-minute production, as well as PBS' host for a whole three hours
of Webbermania.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first ``PBS Showcase'' from the ``Great
Performances'' folks _ an entire night of programming wrapped
around a single theme.
</P>
<P>
   First it's ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
Then Osmond will guide viewers into a documentary about Webber.
Next come peeks at Webber's ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' _ a new
production is brewing _ and ``Whistle Down the Wind.'' Finally,
there's a repeat of a 1985 television production of Webber's
``Requiem,'' with Placido Domingo and Sarah Brightman.
</P>
<P>
   After that it's bedtime, and a strong likelihood of disturbing
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' was filmed at
Pinewood Studio in London. Besides Osmond, it stars a mainly
decorous Richard Attenborough as Jacob, Maria Friedman as the
Narrator, Robert Torti as the Pharaoh, Ian McNeice as Potiphar,
Collins as Potiphar's horny wife, and seven or eight showgirls
barely attired in fishnet.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen the stage version knows that ``Joseph'' is
colorful, energetic, eclectic enough to encompass calypso, rock 'n'
roll and country music, and plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   The musical evolved from a minutes-long presentation at a London
school in 1968 and was the first collaboration between Webber and
lyricist Tim Rice. ``Evita'' and ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' came
later.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Joseph'' lyrics range from maple to oak. I'd like to think
that even Rice would cringe today at ``I look handsome, I look
smart, I am a walking work of art.'' Or, as a chorus of fellow
prisoners in Egypt tell our despairing hero, ``Don't give up,
Joseph, wait and you'll see. We've been outside and you're on the
marquee!'' Brother.
</P>
<P>
   McNeice squeezes chuckles from his short stint as Potiphar, the
Egyptian mogul who buys Joseph. And Torti, coiffed in a slick
pompadour, turns the pharaoh into Elvis with a sort of ``Beach
Blanket Babylon'' pizzazz. Collins is onscreen only briefly, in
high-glam mode. She's adorned in a Nefertiti getup, and the pasties
over her bodysuit suggest that the emphasis is on the proper
syllable.
</P>
<P>
   Osmond has toured extensively in the title role, and PBS says he
was Webber's choice. It isn't much of a challenge, really, singing

FOR GREENSPAN, THE MARKET GIVETH, THE MARKET TAKETH AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, STOCKS-MARKETPLACE) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan got just what he wanted Tuesday
morning: a sharp break in the stock market's ever-upward psychology
and a broad downturn in prices that took a big chunk of wealth out
of investors' bulging pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But then the markets snatched it back. After a stomach-churning
plunge, stock prices rebounded smartly in the afternoon, closing
with losses that, while not trivial, were hardly paradigm-changing.
The prevailing assumption _ that every dip is a buying opportunity
_ remained more or less intact, though day traders no doubt ended
the session wondering whether investing is as easy as it was last
year.
</P>
<P>
   And Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve were
left to wonder anew what it would take to rein in Wall Street,
which they have come to view as the channel through which inflation
is most likely to infect the economy.
</P>
<P>
   True, technology stocks have taken a battering over the past
week. But most of the wealth created in the market over the last
few years is still intact, fueling consumer spending and a general
sense of economic invulnerability. And by some measures, stocks are
still grinding their way upward.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's preferred measure of market performance, the
Wilshire 5000, which captures the movement of nearly all stocks, is
still up about 1 percent for the year, and up 10.9 percent since
last June 30, when the Fed began its current round of rate hikes.
For all its troubles in the past few weeks, the Nasdaq index is
still 54 percent higher than it was on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that nothing that happened Tuesday will
deter the Fed from continuing to raise rates. The very resiliency
of the markets might even lead the central bank to conclude that it
needs to raise rates further, and in bigger increments than it has
so far, to grab the attention of investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have neither a sustained correction in the stock
market nor a significant slowdown in the economy,'' said Sung Won
Sohn, an economist at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis. ``To keep the
market contained will require at least a couple more interest rate
hikes and a continued open-mouth policy on the part of chairman
Greenspan.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors will no doubt be listening intently when Greenpsan
speaks on Wednesday afternoon at a White House conference on the
economy. Greenspan is expected to discuss technology's effect on
the economy, a subject that would give him ample opportunity, if he
chooses, to assess the markets and signal his intentions for the
next Fed policy meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why the economy continues to stampede,
not least that low unemployment and rising wages are making most
people feel confident and willing to spend. But Greenspan has
repeatedly emphasized the potential for the wealth generated by the
market to be the force that leads the economy to overheat and start
throwing off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman has said repeatedly that he is not targeting
the stock market per se. But he has also made clear that, absent a
pronounced slowdown in some other sector of the economy, the
market's sustained rise would have to slow considerably to allow
the economy to remain on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has even set out a speed limit for the market: Asset
values should not rise faster than household income. His equation
roughly implies that stock prices should not rise at more than
around a 6 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   Measured from the start of this year, the markets are generally
within the speed limit, at least as measured by the Wilshire 5000.
</P>
<P>
   But over longer periods the upward surge in equity prices
remains too rapid for Greenspan's taste. And with markets so
volatile, it is hard to say whether there is a sustainable trend of
deceleration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at where we are today relative to the beginning of
the year, you'd say we're not too far from the beginning of the
neutralization of the wealth effect,'' said Richard D. Rippe, an
economist at Prudential Securities. ``But since the market is so
volatile, your perception can change substantially in a couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a
consulting firm, said the decline in the Nasdaq has only taken the
index back to where it was two months ago, ``and we don't recall
seeing much evidence back in February that the economy was slowing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   If stock prices stabilize where they are now, ``we think there
will probably be some measurable impact on consumer confidence over
the next month or two,'' Shepherdson said. ``But it will not be
enough to slow the economy as much as the Fed wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The next big indicator of the economy's performance will come on
Friday, when the Labor Department reports on job creation and the
unemployment rate for March. If the economy continues to create
jobs at a robust pace, and if the unemployment rate falls back to 4
percent or below, it would be another sign that economic growth
remains at a level far beyond what the Fed considers prudent.

COMMENTARY: THE ERIN FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some Gore backers are excited about two things in
``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   No, two other things.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats think that the allure of the movie about a saucy
working-class divorcee who wins a whopping class-action suit
against a California utility that poisoned a town's water augurs a
Gore victory because the story is pro-environment and pro-tort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has one of the worst records on the environment, while
it's Gore's signature issue,'' crows a White House official. ``And
Bush is for tort reform, which is basically denying people the
right to redress grievances through the court for having their
lives blasted away.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, John McCain should have been the one to benefit from
a fascination with a Frank Capra fable about a little guy, or gal,
beating the big, bad special interests.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the senator's out, Democrats are hoping that the
vice president, who is chanting the words ``John McCain'' like a
Buddhist mantra, can catch the populist wave.
</P>
<P>
   They harken to 1975, when Robert Altman's classic movie,
``Nashville,'' eerily presaged Jimmy Carter's election after the
Nixon disillusionment. ``Nashville'' was about a populist Southern
presidential candidate, running on a platform assailing the old
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Al and W. are in a donnybrook to see who will win the beauteous
Erin. Both candidates are trying, with the language they use and
the issues they choose, to court waitress moms and soccer moms.
Bush (who's promising to ``cultivate the gardens of good will''
among children) and Gore (who's booking himself on Lifetime, the
network for women) are scaling back on the sports and war metaphors
and focusing on children, schools and the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about the fourth down with five yards to go is
offensive to a lot of women,'' explains Frank Luntz, the Republican
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   In guidelines written for Republican members of Congress, Luntz
advises: ``Women consistently respond to the phrase `for the
children' regardless of the context.'' And ``From getting the kids
out of bed, fed and off to school each morning to the demands of
working outside the home, women are working longer and harder than
ever. Empathize.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by Texas' grim record on pollution, Bush followed up
on the unwily Wylys (who announced on Tuesday they were dropping
out of politics after pumping $2.5 million into a barrage of
environmental attack ads on John McCain) with an environmental
initiative this week. He knows how effectively his dad hammered
Michael Dukakis for not cleaning up Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he did not want to leave ``future generations a world of
polluted air, toxic lakes and rivers and vanished forests,'' the
Texas governor offered a plan to help clean up contaminated
industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush wants to get rid of the Superfund and turn it over to the
states when the state of Texas is awash in smoke,'' scoffs a Gore
adviser, Bob Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are still counting on using quotes from Gore's book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' which is being re-released for Earth Day
2000, to make him seem flaky and extreme. Gore warns of ``an
ecological Kristallnacht'' and thunders that our children could
``inherit a wasteland.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are searching for his unedited text, which they hope
will sound even flakier.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz says that, polling for the Nature Conservancy, he came
away feeling that women don't want programs as extreme as Gore's:
``The suburban housewife wants to maintain the park down the
street, not close the state of Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   I called the real Erin Brockovich to see if she preferred Bush
or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I grew up in a family that voted Republican,'' she said,
still on the road, still on her cell phone and still battling
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric. ``But for years I've voted with the
Democratic Party. I would probably go with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked if she thought her movie was a good omen for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never let my ego go there,'' she said, laughing,
``that I might have any kind of impact that goes beyond wardrobe.''

UZBEKS ARE SAID TO SEIZE PAKISTANI NUCLEAR CARGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Border guards in the former Soviet republic of
Uzbekistan seized a radioactive cargo on an Iranian truck bound for
Pakistan last week, State Department officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The material is being tested by officials in neighboring
Kazakhstan, where it originated. American officials said they hoped
to know as early as Wednesday whether the seized material, found in
10 lead containers about the size of a thick briefcase, could have
been used to make a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared to say it is or isn't'' a senior State
Department official said on Tuesday night. ``We just don't know.
We're trying to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the material seized in such cases has been of poor
or useless quality, in terms of producing a nuclear bomb. No
weapons-grade nuclear material has ever been smuggled successfully
out of the former Soviet Union, to the knowledge of U.S.
intelligence services, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials described the case on Tuesday night
as a successful example of American efforts to halt international
smuggling. ``We have been cooperating with a number of countries in
the former Soviet Union to improve their border controls, precisely
for the purpose of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction,'' said a spokesman for the department, James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure was made Thursday, Rubin said, and customs officials
turned over the truck and its cargo to Khazakstan, where it is
being tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Uzbek officials had been trained and equipped by U.S.
Customs and Commerce Department officials, another State Department
official said. They were holding radiation detectors that they
passed around the truck and that found high levels of radioactivity
in the cargo, the second State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck was stopped at the Gisht Kuprik customs post, a border
crossing 20 miles from Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. The
driver said he was headed from Kazakhstan through Turkmenistan and
Iran to Pakistan, officials said. The stated destination was a
company in Quetta, a city near Pakistan's borders with Afghanistan
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate destination may have been Pakistan's nuclear
weapons complex. For decades, Pakistan has run a global ring for
buying, copying and stealing nuclear weapons technology. It has
built up to 12 nuclear warheads, and it tested two last year. But
it need many more to match India's nuclear arsenal.

 &HT;    Donovan, Gators turn their focus to future
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The pain of Monday night's 89-76 loss to Michigan
State in the NCAA basketball championship was only a few minutes
old when Florida coach Billy Donovan began looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these guys don't want to hear this right now, but I
wish it was Oct. 15 and we could start all over again,'' Donovan
said. ``We are excited about how far we have come. We're even more
excited about where we can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida (29-8) made a memorable run through the NCAA Tournament
in Donovan's fourth year as coach. It began with a near-loss to
Butler (69-68 OT) in the first round and included wins over
Illinois, Duke, Oklahoma State and North Carolina. Not bad for a
``football school.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night before 43,116 at the RCA Dome, the youthful
Gators were no match for the tenacity of Mateen Cleaves and
Michigan State. Florida was a young team trying to do something
bold. Michigan State's seniors _ Cleaves, Morris Peterson and A.J.
Granger _ were delivering their school a national championship in
their final game.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators did not dwell in their disappointment. With only one
senior, Kenyan Weaks, on the squad, talk of the future came
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And what will that future be? Can the 34-year-old Donovan, after
punching most of the right buttons at so young an age, sustain this
success?
</P>
<P>
   After last season's Sweet 16 appearance, athletics director
Jeremy Foley renegotiated Donovan's contract into a five-year $3.5
million deal. After this, Donovan is bound to become an even hotter
hot property.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL came calling on Steve Spurrier several years ago,
Foley made him college football's highest-paid coach at $2 million
per season. It's a sure bet that the NBA will be knocking soon on
Billy D's door.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said he is prepared to rework Donovan's contract again,
``if that becomes necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida has made the commitment in every other phase of the
basketball program. It spent more than $10 million in improvements
to the O'Connell Center, which has been voted as the toughest home
court in basketball. The school is about to break ground on a new
$10 million practice facility, scheduled to open in August 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The team loses only Weaks, but the concern is about sophomore
forward Mike Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-8 Miller did not have a memorable Final Four, with just 20
points in two games, and said he will take some time to evaluate
his situation. Underclassmen have until May 14 to declare their
intention to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it tempting? Yes, but I haven't allowed myself to think
about it during the tournament,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Donnell Harvey, the former Mr. Georgia Basketball, has
said he will return to Gainesville next season. But there are
rumblings that Harvey still might decide that college is just not
the place for him.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, meanwhile, has continued to recruit. Next season, he
adds 6-5 swingman Orien Green, Florida's Mr. Basketball. Of the 10
players on the floor Monday night for Florida, four were freshman,
three were sophomores and two were juniors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Florida's third year under Donovan, the Gators reached
the Sweet 16 and were within a basket of advancing to the Elite
Eight. In 2000, they reached the national championship game. Now,
Gator fans want to know if the program will keep moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to be successful once,'' Donovan said. ``Now
what we have to do with our program is take the next step.''

   Microsoft Antitrust Ruling Could Generate Lawsuits
</P>
<P>
   The federal antitrust ruling against Microsoft could lead to a
wave of class-action and other consumer lawsuits against the
company. With Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson having ruled on Monday
that Microsoft is a ``predatory'' monopolist that repeatedly
violated antitrust laws, private plaintiffs have a far less

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AIRLINES IMPROVE FILM-VIEWING OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication notice: also sent with `t' code)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the way the movie business tends to fill up the available
screens mostly with lowest-common-denominator blockbusters and not
much else, the best place to find a wide selection of films may
eventually be in the premium seats on an intercontinental flight.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines, for example, is spending about $18,500 a
seat to install a fiber optic in-flight entertainment system that
provides a menu of 25 movies, 50 short films and documentaries, and
50 full-length audio CD's for passengers in first and business
class, with the videos shown on individual screens at each seat.
Singapore says the real innovation is that the system, based on
digital technology developed by Matsushita Avionics Systems, allows
passengers to freeze, forward, pause or rewind movies and CDs just
as they could on a home entertainment system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get halfway through the movie and want to take a nap,
you can hit pause and resume watching when you wake up,'' said
James Boyd, a spokesman for the airline, which introduced the
system last week in the front of the planes on flights from New
York and Newark to Asia via Europe. The airline expects the system
_ which is being marketed as a way for premium-class passengers to
feel more in control of their environment on long hauls _ to be
installed in flights to Asia from the West Coast by the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's international flights already have individual video
monitors at each seat, including those in coach. But the coach
sections will continue to have the old entertainment system, which
provides a choice of 13 movies as well as video games and music
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The Matsushita engineers who developed the system say they are
leading the way in revolutionizing in-flight entertainment and
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Matsushita system now has a capacity of 100 hours of movie
content and about 50 CDs, said Kevin Munday, the company's manager
of technical marketing. ``But within a year and half to two years,
you're going to see easily a quadrupling of that capacity, and the
direction downstream is not just to provide movies and audio but
full-on Web and multimedia content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The JetBlue Experience
</P>
<P>
   The good news about the new regional start-up airline JetBlue
Airways, based on a recent business trip I made from New York to
Tampa, Fla., is that the planes are comfortable and so new that
they smell like just-bought cars. The chipper flight attendants and
ticket clerks seem actually delighted to see you; the flights
depart and arrive on time, and advance purchase fares are low.
</P>
<P>
   The other news, not bad, but certainly worth noting for business
travelers, is that those low fares can get higher if, as is common
among business travelers, a change or two of schedule is required
after the initial reservation. And for travelers who live in the
sprawling New York metropolitan area, the inconvenience and expense
of getting to Kennedy International Airport are also factors to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I found: Booked over two weeks before departure, my
original fare was $119 from New York to Tampa, and $79 for the
return trip. A few days before departure, I needed to change my
schedule to leave and return a day later. The $119 fare to Tampa
became $159, with a $25 change fee. The $79 return fare went up to
$159, with another $25 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   So the original $198 round-trip fare now was $368 _ still a
pretty good price. However, Kennedy is notoriously difficult to get
to from outside New York City. From my home in New Jersey, 15 miles
from Manhattan, the airport car-service fare to and from the
airport is $90 (plus tip). So that added another $216 to my costs,
for a grand total of $584.
</P>
<P>
   Still not bad, considering it can cost twice that much to book a
last-minute flight on a major carrier. But wait: a few hours after
I changed my JetBlue itinerary, I went to the two major online
booking services to comparison shop for fares to Tampa from Newark
International Airport. Even at the last minute, Expedia.com offered
a choice of Delta flights for the same days at a round-trip fare of
$530. Travelocity.com had flights on AirTran, same itinerary, for
$535. Add the airport car-service fare of $30 (plus tip) to the far
more convenient Newark airport, and for me the JetBlue competitive
edge began to fade for that itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: For the sort of last-minute itinerary changes that
characterize business travel, it can pay to do some quick
comparison shopping on the online travel sites.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue, which now flies between Kennedy and Tampa, Fort
Lauderdale and Buffalo, plans to add about 10 more destinations
this year. ``Our focus has been for travelers across the board, not
strictly corporate or leisure,'' said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a
spokesman for the airline. In general, he pointed out, ``business
travelers can fly us for 65 percent less, and still experience new
planes and leather seats.'' &QL;

ADVERTISING: NEW ECONOMY CHANGES HOW 2 AGENCIES OPERATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two well-known agencies based here are reorganizing
in ways that are indicative of the substantive shifts taking place
along Madison Avenue to try matching the pace of change in
cyberspace and at client companies.
</P>
<P>
   One agency, Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG,
is combining under one roof a variety of services outside the realm
of traditional advertising that include interactive marketing,
sales promotion, retail advertising, data base management, direct
marketing and design.
</P>
<P>
   Those communications services are being offered by Messner
Vetere, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising,
under the name Fuel North America. That had been the name of a unit
devoted to handling the retail account of a large client, Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   And Mezzina/Brown, an agency that has added a skein of dot-com
accounts to a client roster that includes DuPont; Goldman, Sachs;
and R.J. Reynolds, is being reorganized under the name Mezzina
Brown &AMP; Partners. The goal of the principals of Mezzina Brown, who
are teaming up with outside companies that include Netcentric
Partners, a venture capital firm, is to place additional emphasis
on business development for so-called new-economy marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Berger, chief executive and chief creative officer at
Messner Vetere, offered an explanation of the shifts at his agency
that described the motivations of both shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to design and evolve the agency's offerings to reflect
where the world is today,'' Berger said, ``building on our
experience with brands and our clients' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuel North America has about 140 employees handling assignments
with billings estimated at $100 million, which include the Volvo
retail account, creating campaigns for the automaker's dealer
associations, as well as for other Messner Vetere clients like
Intel, MCI WorldCom, J.P. Morgan, New Balance, Philips and
Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   Among the operations being combined under the Fuel North America
banner, in addition to the Volvo unit, are the New York office of
Cohn &AMP; Wells Partners, which specialized in direct marketing;
Compelling Content, an interactive agency acquired in September by
Cohn &AMP; Wells; and the Messner Vetere divisions focused on design,
sales promotion and Internet ad work.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel North America, which reports to Berger, has four partners,
headed by Beth Waxman, 37, managing director, who continues as a
partner at Messner Vetere, where she had been overseeing the Intel
account. The other partners at Fuel North America, all creative
directors, are: Bertrand Garbassi, 40; Marshall Karp, who declined
to give his age; and Paul Trantanella, 37.
</P>
<P>
   At Mezzina Brown, which has about 120 employees and billings
estimated at $145 million, a highlight of the restructuring is the
formation of a specialty division, MB Capital and Consultancy,
``devoted to helping pre-IPO dot-coms identify business models,
determine efficient revenue streams and even if necessary write
their business plans,'' said William G. Brown Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 52, becomes senior partner and chief executive of the
agency after serving as president before the reorganization. John
Mezzina, 51, shifts from chairman and executive creative director
to senior partner and chief strategy officer. Mark A. Morrissey,
41, executive vice president and client services director, becomes
partner and chief operating officer. And David Frutko, 49,
continues as chief financial officer while moving from executive
vice president to partner.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that Mezzina would take ``a temporary leave of
absence'' from the agency to focus on Freeride.com LLC, an Internet
company spun off from Mezzina/Brown in 1996 that offers computer
users rewards meant to strengthen their ties to companies with
which they do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's leave is to shepherd that business to the next level,''
Brown said, smiling. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say initial public offering?
</P>
<P>
   Among the dot-com clients of Mezzina Brown, which started an
interactive division in 1993, are Freeride.com, NexGenix, Newsweek
magazine, Real Media, VarsityPlanet.com and Wit Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to the new economy, we've created our consultancy
group,'' Brown said, ``which can also help source capital through
Netcentric Partners,'' with a war chest planned to reach $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl L. Benton is joining Mezzina Brown as managing director
for interactive services, overseeing the MB Interactive division.
Benton, 49, had been executive vice president at JMCP Touch
Interactive, a division of Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro
RSCG, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas.
</P>
<P>
   In another change, seven top executives at Mezzina Brown are
being promoted because, Brown said, ``with the dramatic shift in
the marketplace for key talent, it's important to offer
partnerships to our key players.''
</P>
<P>
   The new partners are: Jean Andrews, 38, manager for strategic
support services; Robert Earl, 58, managing director for direct
marketing creative services; Robert Moore, 47, managing director
for account services; Clark Moss, 38, managing director for
creative services; Donna L. Walters, 36, managing director for
graphic services; Gary Watson, 40, managing director for client
services; and Margaret A. Williams, who declined to give her age,
managing director for administrative services. The majority
shareholders are Brown, Frutko, Mezzina and Morrissey.

 &HT;    Giddy ride before fall: Day 1 lead
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Before Tiger Woods turned the 1997 Masters into
his personal showcase, most of the attention was on one John
Huston. The first-round leader capped a solid day with an eagle on
the 18th hole from near the 10th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Huston felt good that night. His dinner tasted better. His bed
was more comfortable. Family and friends were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   It is a routine that Day 1 leaders of the Masters often
experience. But it can be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Many first-day leaders of the tournament descend the leaderboard
rapidly and drop right out of contention. Being atop the year's
first major _ which begins Thursday morning at Augusta National _
is a satisfying position. Even for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Huston isn't an outwardly expressive person, but he still had to
suppress his emotions; there were still three days of golf ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as you feel about being in the lead,'' he said, ``you
haven't done anything. Being at the top of the first-round
leaderboard doesn't mean anything. It's nice to be there, but
there's a long way to go. So, while I was glad to be in front, I
wasn't overly excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Huston was right not to get too giddy. He shot a 77 on Friday.
Meanwhile, Woods ate up the field, and Huston was forgotten; he
finished 21st. ``There's potential after a good first day to do
good things,'' Huston said. ``I felt good about my game, of course,
after that day. But in golf, that means nothing. Tiger came along
and that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest fall in the last 10 years was by Mike Donald. In
1990, Donald shot 64 for the first-day lead.
</P>
<P>
   His euphoric feeling lasted less than a day. He came back to
shoot an 82 and wound up 47th by the end of the tournament. ``It's
not easy to stay up there,'' said Brandel Chamblee, who shared the
lead after the opening round last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee made his debut at the Masters after ``learning the
course from watching it on television,'' he said. ``So, it was just
a big thrill for me to be there. It's a tournament unlike any
other. I thought before I went to Augusta how great it was, but I
was even more in awe of the place afterward. There was no letdown,
even after the way the rest of the tournament went for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After his opening round of 67 and a four-way tie for first, ``it
was almost unreal,'' he said. ``You can imagine yourself there, on
top of the leaderboard, but it's nothing like actually being there.
My family and friends were ecstatic.... There was a lot of smiles
and celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too much by Chamblee, however, ``Still three days left,'' he
said. And sure enough, the game that was wonderful the first day
was not the second. Or the third. Chamblee tied for 17th. Worse, he
missed being eligible to return to this year's Masters, by one
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have shot one lower, but I can't complain too
much about my experience there,'' Chamblee said. ``I was in first
after one day. It was great. It wasn't an intimidating position,
but it's one you'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   People might have forgotten that even Jack Nicklaus, a six-time
Masters winner, had his own fade after a first day of glory. It was
1993, and Nicklaus shot an opening 67 to assume the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, the Day 1 leader four times, led the whole tournament
only once, in 1972. In 1966, he led after the first round, fell to
third, retook the lead after three rounds and won it in an 18-hole
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight Masters champions have led the tournament from
Thursday to Sunday. Arnold Palmer did it twice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Nicklaus shot a 75 on the second day, 76 on Saturday
and a 71 on Sunday. Bernhard Langer won for the second time;
Nicklaus finished 27th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad company to be in,'' Chamblee said. ``If Jack Nicklaus
can lead after one round and then disappear, it can happen to
anybody.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AIRLINES IMPROVE FILM-VIEWING OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `f' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the way the movie business tends to fill up the available
screens mostly with lowest-common-denominator blockbusters and not
much else, the best place to find a wide selection of films may
eventually be in the premium seats on an intercontinental flight.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines, for example, is spending about $18,500 a
seat to install a fiber optic in-flight entertainment system that
provides a menu of 25 movies, 50 short films and documentaries, and
50 full-length audio CD's for passengers in first and business
class, with the videos shown on individual screens at each seat.
Singapore says the real innovation is that the system, based on
digital technology developed by Matsushita Avionics Systems, allows
passengers to freeze, forward, pause or rewind movies and CDs just
as they could on a home entertainment system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get halfway through the movie and want to take a nap,
you can hit pause and resume watching when you wake up,'' said
James Boyd, a spokesman for the airline, which introduced the
system last week in the front of the planes on flights from New
York and Newark to Asia via Europe. The airline expects the system
_ which is being marketed as a way for premium-class passengers to
feel more in control of their environment on long hauls _ to be
installed in flights to Asia from the West Coast by the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's international flights already have individual video
monitors at each seat, including those in coach. But the coach
sections will continue to have the old entertainment system, which
provides a choice of 13 movies as well as video games and music
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The Matsushita engineers who developed the system say they are
leading the way in revolutionizing in-flight entertainment and
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Matsushita system now has a capacity of 100 hours of movie
content and about 50 CDs, said Kevin Munday, the company's manager
of technical marketing. ``But within a year and half to two years,
you're going to see easily a quadrupling of that capacity, and the
direction downstream is not just to provide movies and audio but
full-on Web and multimedia content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The JetBlue Experience
</P>
<P>
   The good news about the new regional start-up airline JetBlue
Airways, based on a recent business trip I made from New York to
Tampa, Fla., is that the planes are comfortable and so new that
they smell like just-bought cars. The chipper flight attendants and
ticket clerks seem actually delighted to see you; the flights
depart and arrive on time, and advance purchase fares are low.
</P>
<P>
   The other news, not bad, but certainly worth noting for business
travelers, is that those low fares can get higher if, as is common
among business travelers, a change or two of schedule is required
after the initial reservation. And for travelers who live in the
sprawling New York metropolitan area, the inconvenience and expense
of getting to Kennedy International Airport are also factors to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I found: Booked over two weeks before departure, my
original fare was $119 from New York to Tampa, and $79 for the
return trip. A few days before departure, I needed to change my
schedule to leave and return a day later. The $119 fare to Tampa
became $159, with a $25 change fee. The $79 return fare went up to
$159, with another $25 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   So the original $198 round-trip fare now was $368 _ still a
pretty good price. However, Kennedy is notoriously difficult to get
to from outside New York City. From my home in New Jersey, 15 miles
from Manhattan, the airport car-service fare to and from the
airport is $90 (plus tip). So that added another $216 to my costs,
for a grand total of $584.
</P>
<P>
   Still not bad, considering it can cost twice that much to book a
last-minute flight on a major carrier. But wait: a few hours after
I changed my JetBlue itinerary, I went to the two major online
booking services to comparison shop for fares to Tampa from Newark
International Airport. Even at the last minute, Expedia.com offered
a choice of Delta flights for the same days at a round-trip fare of
$530. Travelocity.com had flights on AirTran, same itinerary, for
$535. Add the airport car-service fare of $30 (plus tip) to the far
more convenient Newark airport, and for me the JetBlue competitive
edge began to fade for that itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: For the sort of last-minute itinerary changes that
characterize business travel, it can pay to do some quick
comparison shopping on the online travel sites.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue, which now flies between Kennedy and Tampa, Fort
Lauderdale and Buffalo, plans to add about 10 more destinations
this year. ``Our focus has been for travelers across the board, not
strictly corporate or leisure,'' said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a
spokesman for the airline. In general, he pointed out, ``business
travelers can fly us for 65 percent less, and still experience new
planes and leather seats.'' &QL;

JURY INDICTS 11 PARENTS BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE TRUANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In a new attack on truancy, a Jackson County
grand jury has indicted 11 parents in two school districts on
charges that their children constantly skip school.
</P>
<P>
   County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said Tuesday that this was the
county's first use of a 1963 law that made it a misdemeanor for
parents not to have their children in school.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the parents in the Kansas City and the Fort Osage
School districts who were indicted Friday would remain sealed until
they received subpoenas, Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   They will be ordered to report to Circuit Court, where
conviction is punishable by up to 15 days in jail and up to a $500
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the last thing we want to do,'' Beaird said of the
jail time. ``We want to work with them to get these children back
in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents may be ordered into parenting or family programs or
drug treatment, Beaird said. Those who cooperate and get their
children to attend school will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they live up to their moral responsibility,'' Beaird said,
``we'll dismiss the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said prosecutors should be active in fighting truancy
because children who dropped out of school were at a higher risk
for committing crimes and suffering other social ills.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach has been used in at least one other area
jurisdiction. The Buchanan County prosecutor first used it about
three years ago against a few parents of chronic truants.
</P>
<P>
   The indicted Jackson County parents were repeatedly warned by
the school districts and by letters from the prosecutor's office,
Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gotten every chance times 10,'' Beaird said. The new
approach, he added, ``puts some teeth behind our bark.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Hammock, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City School District,
said Tuesday that the district had worked with prosecutors for
months in planning the stronger attack on the truancy problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a last resort,'' Hammock said. ``It should get
parents' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June the district discontinued a program designed to round
up truants. Budget cuts forced the district to lay off 12
parent-school liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the district does not keep statistics that break out
truants separately from students who are legitimately absent,
police have delivered 171 students to the district's drop-out
center this academic year.

McENROE IS REBEL WITH A CAUSE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John McEnroe's voice rises like a lob whenever he
talks about the Davis Cup. His passion for the competition goes
right over the heads of all the mercenary millionaires in his sport
who would sooner lose their entourages than pay tribute or taxes to
their countries.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, McEnroe has engaged in verbal volleys
with some of this country's best tennis players. Everybody from
Jimmy Connors to Pete Sampras has felt the sting of McEnroe's
shots, has heard him rail that their refusal to play in the Davis
Cup is ``a dagger in the heart of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   He's about as subtle as an overhead smash. Get McEnroe talking
about those tennis players who can't be bothered by the Davis Cup
and his voice takes on that ``absolute pits of the world'' pitch
that's like an air raid siren to chair umpires the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, too, has felt the heat from a McEnroe fallout. The L.A.
resident turned back every challenger to his world No.1 ranking for
six straight years but in the end was no match for McEnroe. Sampras
re-enlisted for Davis Cup duty at the end of last year after going
AWOL for a spell. He came to his senses with the help of all those
smelling salts McEnroe kept shoving under his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get so consumed with your personal goals and being
No.1, you can lose sight of what the sport needs,'' Sampras
admitted, saying in a more sanitized way what McEnroe has been
screaming for years.
</P>
<P>
   A tear in his right hip muscle kept Sampras out of the U.S.'
first-round victory against host Zimbabwe in February. A rift in
communication between the world's No.3-ranked player and McEnroe in
the wake of the injury threatened to sideline Sampras from the U.S.
squad's quarterfinal tie against the Czech Republic Friday through
Sunday at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Americans is Sampras' hip is better and so is
his relationship with McEnroe, 40, who was named the U.S. Davis Cup
captain last September. McEnroe roiled the waters in Zimbabwe when
he questioned the severity of Sampras' injury, which he had
suffered the previous week during a tough semifinal loss to Andre
Agassi at the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time McEnroe had challenged Sampras'
sincerity. At the 1996 U.S. Open, Sampras vomited on the court
during a fifth-set tiebreaker in his quarterfinal match against
Alex Corretja, which Sampras somehow went on to win. Afterward,
McEnroe was quoted as saying, ``That's pretty tremendous acting. If
you're that out of it, you don't serve 120 miles per hour. No one
does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched by a former No.1 player, McEnroe's words hit like a
stink bomb, causing mostly just a foul odor. Speaking as the Davis
Cup captain, McEnroe's words did more damage. They were like a hand
grenade that singed bridges and wounded an ego.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe responded to the unfolding crisis as a captain should.
He phoned Sampras and patched things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn to sort of do what it takes,'' McEnroe said.
``This is what the (captain's) job is about. It's about a bigger
picture. I have to keep telling myself that it's about something
bigger than me or Pete Sampras.''
</P>
<P>
   And there it is: one small step for diplomacy never McEnroe's
strong suit and one giant step for the Davis Cup, which has
suffered lately for not having the game's top players involved.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Don Budge deemed the event important enough
that he turned down $50,000 to turn pro so he could represent the
U.S. in the 1938 Davis Cup. The event meant enough to McEnroe that
he cleared room for it in his schedule for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Like the expletives he is quick to hurl at others when his own
play has him furious, McEnroe's passion for the Davis Cup would
seem to be misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the player whom the British press once dubbed
``Superbrat'' comes across as an unlikely ``Superpatriot.'' This
is, after all, the same man who used to speak of USTA officials as
though they were kept administrators, the same man whose whining
during the 1984 Davis Cup final in Sweden nearly cost the United
States Tennis Association its corporate backing for future Davis
Cup events (and did lead to a written code-of-conduct that the U.S.
players were required to sign).
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the high jinks of the high-maintenance McEnroe and
the higher-maintenance Connors would effectively cost Arthur Ashe,
whom McEnroe once deemed ``too passive,'' his Davis Cup captaincy.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, like sandpaper, McEnroe has a softer side. He once
said he played Davis Cup to keep a promise to his mother, Kay.
</P>
<P>
   That might have been true. But what started out as something
McEnroe did to make somebody else happy quickly evolved into
something he did because of how it made him feel.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, McEnroe enjoyed wringing out his ego, that sponge
of self-absorption. He still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I'm selfish like all those other tennis guys,''
McEnroe said. ``We all have our selfish tendencies. In the Davis
Cup, you get to see people who generally are thought of as selfish
trying to play together as a team and do something not just for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to me that is magical about the camaraderie
that develops, hopefully, when you get a team together to play
another country.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it; the biggest difference _ the only difference,
really _ between McEnroe the player and McEnroe the captain:
Instead of a racket, he wields a wand. It's now his spell to cast. &QL;

STARR HAS A FEW KIND WORDS FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Former independent counsel Kenneth Starr
isn't the most likely person to publicly praise President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Starr, in Kansas City on Tuesday, complimenting
Clinton for his ``enormous gifts,'' his intelligence and his
ability to communicate and empathize with people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a political level, he is indeed `first in his class,' &UR; ''
Starr said, referring to a best-selling biography written about the
president. ``I don't see anyone who's been a close second to him in
the boomer generation in terms of political skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's kind words ended there. The president's chief antagonist
in his tortuous impeachment battle then began a discussion about
character, honor and the importance of truth.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the Declaration of Independence, which Starr
said placed a premium on the concept of truth. He referred to
President Lincoln, who once issued a statement that his oath of
office was ``registered in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after mentioning school honor codes that demand students
not lie, cheat or steal, Starr said: ``I think that has been
unfortunately the aspect of presidential character that has been
wanting these past seven years. And we as a nation have suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who spoke Tuesday night at the University of Kansas in
Lawrence, Kan., resigned as independent counsel in October. He is
writing a book on the U.S. Supreme Court and serves as an adjunct
professor at the New York University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his months-long probe of the president, which cost
taxpayers more than $52 million, as critical to preserving the rule
of law and preserving high standards for public officials. He
insisted that he faithfully discharged his duties, which resulted
in 14 convictions _ including one of former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy
Tucker, who was forced to resign from office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr acknowledged that his work took a long time and that the
public grew weary of what seemed to be an endless probe. On that
score, Starr acknowledged that he should have refused the added
duties of investigating the White House travel office
(``Travelgate'') or the case of the misplaced FBI files
(``Filegate'').
</P>
<P>
   Those matters might have been handled faster by other
independent counsels, although that would have added to the overall
cost of investigating the Clinton White House, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most efficient, cost-effective way of conducting
the investigation,'' Starr said. ``But sometimes cost savings can
come...at the cost of public confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Killing the independent counsel law was a wise move, Starr said.
The statute, which was enacted in the wake of Watergate,
effectively worked to ``shoehorn a fourth branch of government''
into the nation's three-branch system.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to handle investigations of top government
officials is for the attorney general to appoint an investigator,
the former federal judge said. That way, accountability for the
investigation remains with the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   The nation has relied on such a system, now back in place, with
great effectiveness dating to the Civil War, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress departed from that historical lesson'' when it
enacted the independent-counsel law in 1978, he said.

DAVID DUCHOVNY, WITH FACIAL EXPRESSIONS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a Tuesday morning on the set of ``The
X-Files'' and David Duchovny is working three jobs. He has just
changed out of his FBI agent suit _ the uniform for the brooding
but sartorially conformist Fox Mulder _ into an orange T-shirt and
jeans, director chic.
</P>
<P>
   The episode he is directing (and wrote) is about an old '60s
activist who becomes Jesus, and something supernatural called the
Lazarus Bowl; one character is called the Cigarette Smoking
Pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny settles into a director's chair in front of a tiny
monitor (what he describes as ``the obligatory autopsy scene'' is
being rehearsed); somebody brings him a nice hot cup of soy milk
and coffee. He suggests a longer lens, so it will be scarier when
the corpse sits up. He jokes about doing ``the Austin Powers
thing'' by placing an object strategically in front of the corpse's
(presumably naked) nether regions.
</P>
<P>
   He corrects an actor's pronunciation of noli me tangere.''
Accent on the first syllable, as in Tanqueray, he explains; that's
what seven years of Latin will do for you. (Collegiate, Princeton
undergraduate, Yale graduate, Manhattan, Scots-Jewish, Leo, and he
enjoys contact sports and yoga.)
</P>
<P>
   At this point no one knows for sure how much longer Duchovny
will be a part of ``The X-Files,'' Fox's most popular drama series,
or even if this is the show's last season altogether. They just
know he's been spending a lot of time publicizing his new movie,
``Return to Me,'' a romantic comedy about a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Is film his future? Or can he never escape the identification
with Mulder, a strangely emotionless man obsessed by government
conspiracies, space aliens and his sister? And most important, is
he a truly talented actor or just a really lucky guy who got cast
as the one character he was born to play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about doing movies,'' he says. ``I feel like I'm
just beginning that part of my career, which seems weird at what I
feel to be an advanced age.'' He is 39, facing his 40th birthday in
August.
</P>
<P>
   To say ``Return to Me,'' which opened on Friday, is a change of
pace for Duchovny is an understatement. He smiles more in the
film's first 15 minutes than he has in seven seasons of ``The
X-Files.'' He also cries, long and hard (his perfect wife, played
by Joely Richardson, is killed in an auto crash early in the film),
and evokes the semi-hidden emotions of a nice guy on a bad blind
date.
</P>
<P>
   And he has to react with some complexity when he learns what the
audience has known about his new girlfriend (Minnie Driver) for an
hour and a half: as one character blurts out, ``Grace has Bob's
dead wife's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot is sentimental and a bit of a stretch. Not what you
might expect from the bitingly humorous Bonnie Hunt, the film's
director, co-writer and co-star (as Driver's supportive best
friend).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairy tale,'' Duchovny says. ``When Minnie and I were
talking about `How do we act this?' it was our opinion that you
just have to believe in the fairy tale. And that as characters you
can't wink at the audience and say, you know, we're hipper than
this. You really have to commit to the innocence of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is no less plausible than that of ``Moonstruck,'' he
points out, or of movies about winning the lottery. Same odds. The
odds were also against Duchovny being able to play the anti-Mulder
_ a simple, likable guy with a pleasant disposition _ and still
send out those leading-man vibes on screen. He has his own point of
view about the audience's reaction to his character: ``How can you
not pull for this guy? He's got a dog. He's friendly with a
gorilla. His wife dies. He never has sex with his new girl.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man just starting out in movies, Duchovny has made an
awful lot of them: 14 features before this. All but a couple,
however, were released before he became a national heartthrob. And
some of the parts were so small they seem to have disappeared. He
is supposedly in the scene of Joan Cusack's engagement party in
``Working Girl'' (1988), for instance, but you can no longer prove
it, even by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laying in bed with my wife and I was like, `Oh, I'm in
this movie,''' Duchovny recalls of the last time the film was on
television. ``She said, `Really, when?' I said, `I'm not sure.'''
They _ his wife of almost three years is the actress Tea Leoni;
their daughter, Madelaine, will be a year old this month _ never
spotted him.
</P>
<P>
   The roles did get larger. In ``The Rapture'' (1991), he played
the sleazy swinger whom Mimi Rogers bedded, then converted to
fundamentalist Christianity and married before he was shot to death
by a disgruntled employee. (He might want to think twice if a film
role ever calls for that pageboy-length hair again.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beethoven'' (during which he met Hunt, still a close
friend), he was the obnoxious yuppie businessman who said ``ciao''
and ``Beamer'' a lot and ended up being dragged down a sidewalk in
a patio chair by a St. Bernard who didn't like his attitude. He did
two films, ``New Year's Day'' and ``Venice/Venice,'' for Henry
Jaglom, the independent film director whose taste for improvisation
makes Robert Altman look formalist. Jaglom once told Duchovny that
they would be doing a scene together. ``I said, `What's it about?'
He said: `Don't worry about it. Action.'''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny's favorite film role before now was in ``Kalifornia,''
a violent 1993 drama best known because he and Brad Pitt appeared
in it just before both burst into stardom. Duchovny plays a hip
East Coast writer who thinks serial killers are a fascinating topic
for a book until he and his girlfriend accidentally give a real one
( Pitt) a cross-country ride.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny's last film _ not counting the 1998 ``X-Files'' movie,
in which he played Mulder with a bigger travel budget _ was
``Playing God'' (1997). He agrees with the vast majority of critics
and moviegoers that the film, about a drug-addicted doctor who has
lost his license and ends up as a mobster's one-man emergency room,
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Playing God' was a mistake only because we didn't have a
script ready,'' he says. And the film couldn't wait because it had
to be done during his two-month hiatus from the series.

 &HT;    Wall Street says 'whew' after wild day
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology stocks took investors Tuesday on a
gut-wrenching ride that had the Nasdaq composite plunging as much
as 13.6 percent in the worst fall since the 1987 crash, then being
rescued from disaster by a rally that recaptured almost all the
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's plummet pulled the recently surging Dow Jones
industrial average down by more than 500 points before the saving
rally took hold there, too.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound gave some analysts reason to think the worst of the
recent sharp slide in mostly ``new economy'' stocks may be near an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows we are still in a bull market,'' Standard &AMP; Poor's
senior analyst Joe Tigue said of Tuesday's heart-pounding
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Tigue and other analysts attribute the rally to the combination
of a still-strong economy, an upbeat outlook for first-quarter
profits and falling Treasury bond yields.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, he said the sell-off created ``terrific
buying opportunities'' that attracted investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq has had a tremendous run here recently, and it's
natural to have some type of pullback _ which we felt was coming,''
said Paul J. Marshall, senior vice president-investments for Robert
W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After rising 86 percent in 1999, the Nasdaq peaked March 10 with
a close of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a correction that may be over in another
week or month, but eventually the Nasdaq will turn back up because
of the new realities of the new economy,'' said Fred C. Allvine,
director of the Georgia Tech Stock Market Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize the extent to which the Internet will
change our economy. The Nasdaq is down but don't count it out,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are never sure why a sell-off occurs. But after the
Nasdaq, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and Russell 2000 small stock indexes
set highs in March, the market was shaken by a series of events,
including a stock panic in Japan, sudden weakness in the
biotechnology sector, several warnings of disappointing earnings
and a recommended 5 percent reduction in stock holdings by
superbull Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rally Friday, but the optimism turned to pessimism
over the weekend when bellwether Microsoft failed to settle its
antitrust lawsuit with the government. The Nasdaq fell 7.6 percent
in heavy volume Monday, even before the federal court ruled against
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Microsoft deal should not have had that big an
impact by itself. They blame the selling pressure in part on
investors forced to sell securities to meet margin calls _ demands
for more collateral for loans used to buy stocks _ and on day
traders selling to meet April 15 income tax obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the trigger, investors found reasons to go back into
the market Tuesday afternoon, making for the busiest day in Nasdaq
history, with almost 2.9 billion shares trading hands.
</P>
<P>
   At its lowest point, the Nasdaq composite was down by 574.57
points, far exceeding Monday's record one-day point decline of
349.15.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's temporary fall of 13.6 percent surpassed the 11.4
percent loss of Oct. 19, 1987 _ the steepest ever for Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed at 11,164.84, down 57.09 points, or 0.5 percent.
At its lowest, the Dow traded at 10,717.80, or almost 5 percent
below its Monday close.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 small-stock index was down as much as 51.96
points, or 10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of Nasdaq and small-cap losses comes after a
week of almost uninterrupted declines knocked the Nasdaq composite
and Russell 2000 indexes down by more than 10 percent from their
recent highs, putting the two groups into a correction by most
definitions.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness has pushed the Russell 2000 index below where it
ended 1999, having been up 20 percent at its March 9 record close.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite stands 17.8 percent below its record close,
but at one point Tuesday was almost 28 percent below its recent
all-time high, well below the 20 percent level that generally marks
a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Baird's Marshall said the next month and a half of first-quarter
earnings reports is a reason for optimism that the rally that
halted the plunge will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week or so of earnings reports is typically weak,
but then in the latter weeks you will see stronger reports,'' he
said.

 LOS ANGELES: the series.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I should have just bailed out, but I didn't know,'' he says.
``Now I know. That's really too bad because I really think that's a
good idea for a movie and now it'll never get made because we
screwed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``I had a lot of pain involved because I was attacked
personally,'' adding that his wife liked the film. He has never
actually seen it, but he imagines an old age in which he will.
``One day I'll be like Howard Hughes, in a room, touching things
with Kleenex,'' he says, ``and watching `Playing God' over and
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times review of ``Playing God,'' by Janet Maslin,
declared him ``utterly lifeless and without charm.'' And there are
those who still contend that he's not a particularly brilliant
actor, that he'd be nowhere without Mulder. (Others say it's vice
versa. He is suing 20th Century Fox over his share of the show's
syndication-rights sale.)
</P>
<P>
   His supporters, however, are enthusiastic about his potential
and suggest that playing Agent Mulder, with his general lack of
affect, is harder than Duchovny makes it look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that David is a much smarter actor than people give
him credit for,'' says Kim Manners, an ``X-Files'' supervising
producer who has just directed his 37th episode. ``David is a very
clever actor. He doesn't see Mulder as a hero, just a guy, but it's
interesting the way Mulder comes off on camera. When you look at
him, you see a guy who doesn't have any airs about him, who wears
his heart on his sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   (Mulder also comes across, his fans say, as the screen's first
sexy nerd, a description that his portrayer understands. ``He's
completely committed to what he does,'' Duchovny says of his
character. ``And even though it doesn't involve girls at all,
commitment is attractive to people.'')
</P>
<P>
   And, Manners adds, Duchovny often does things his own way. In
the recent episode in which Mulder was reunited all too briefly
with his sister, the script called for him to embrace her and break
down in tears. Instead, ``he just took her in his arms,'' Manners
recalls. ``There was a peace, a great calm about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt thinks ``Return to Me'' could indeed be the beginning of a
new phase of Duchovny's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, for David, the first time he was in his element,''
she says, ``where he could really expand his wings.'' She says she
had no problem breaking him of his longtime television character's
habits. He, however, remembers her walking over after a scene,
shaking her head and telling him, ``That was so Mulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many television stars have trouble making the switch
to feature films? Is it true that some actors who are great on the
home screen are just not ``big'' enough? ``I think probably 90
percent of it is luck,'' Hunt says. ``I wouldn't even attempt to
philosophize about it. But sincerity of character helps, maybe more
so in film because the screens are so much bigger and you have the
audience's undivided attention.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain on screens of any size: the man has a sense
of humor, although he says people are always surprised to learn
that. Clearly those people never saw Duchovny on ``The Larry
Sanders Show.'' The two episodes in which he played himself as a
guest on the HBO series' fictional talk show _ and declared himself
in love with Larry (his pal Garry Shandling) _ are regarded as
classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think David has a great career in comedy,''
Manners says. ``He's a very, very funny man and he has impeccable
timing. He could do a Cary Grant thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless he starts enjoying the behind-the-scenes work too much.
After all, when he first started taking acting classes in New York,
he envisioned a screenwriter's or playwright's career. He
reconsidered and went into acting because, he says, ``it was more
fun for a man of the age I was,'' and ``I was probably rebelling in
some way against using my mind too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He's over that now. And it could make a huge difference in his
future. He denies (with a laugh) reports that he was offered $1
million an episode to stay with ``The X-Files'' for another season.

NEW OFFERINGS DELAYED AMID STOCK TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With stock prices sinking fast, cracks are starting to appear in
the market for new issues of shares, sending companies scrambling
for other ways to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   Several young, technology-based companies have postponed plans
for initial public offerings and others are finding that demand is
weak for their second or third stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advising people who are in registration and ready to
launch to hold back and take it day by day,'' said Peter Blanton, a
managing director in equity capital markets at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``At noon, things looked pretty dire, but at the end of the
day, they didn't look so bad. We're saying, `Let's just wait a day
or two.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the turmoil, some representatives of the old economy are
soldiering on with initial offerings. Investment bankers Tuesday
night priced first-time stock sales for two companies that existed
before investors had heard of the Internet: Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that neither of those offerings would have much
effect on the overall market for new stocks because each is
anomalous in its own way. At $2.88 billion, Metropolitan Life's
initial offering is an unusually large offering that is part of the
insurer's conversion from a mutual owned by its policy-holders to a
public company.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated process of demutualization reduced the chances
that the sale would be delayed or canceled, analysts and investors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme, by contrast, is a niche offering raising $63
million for a company with a strong brand name but no connection to
the Internet, other than its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Professional investors said they expected Krispy Kreme's shares
to rise when they start trading Wednesday but not enough to give a
boost to the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already seen an erosion of the IPO market,'' said Mark
Hantho, a managing director of equity capital markets at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. But that market has held up better than
the market for secondary stock offerings, which has become ``very
difficult,'' Hantho said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are still willing to take chances on first-time
offerings in certain industry sectors, especially Internet
infrastructure plays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But already public companies will have a hard time tapping the
capital markets again unless they are within a quarter or two of
turning their first profit, analysts and investors said. That
leaves out most Internet retailers, a group that already is among
the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need money because you are trying to pay for a branding
strategy, then it will be hard to get financing,'' said David
Golden, co-director of investment banking at Chase Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist. ``Unless companies are on the cusp of profitability, it will
be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies may have to resort to other traditional
forms of raising cash, either by selling bonds or other debt
instruments. Executives at investment banks say the number of calls
from companies seeking debt financing in the past few days has
increased fourfold.
</P>
<P>
   A particular favorite among the tech set are bonds that can be
converted into stock. Convertible bonds are sold to investors at a
discount to the current stock price _ usually 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because they offer investors the opportunity to switch from
holding IOUs to being shareholders in fast-growing companies, the
bonds carry lower interest rates of 5 to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, convertible bonds are being issued at a record
pace _ more than 65 companies sold $23 billion worth of them in the
first quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is because the company does not have to pay the
double-digit interest payments of the more common high-yield, or
junk, financing. But investors should heed the risks in convertible
bonds before stocking up on them as voraciously as they pursued the
stocks of Internet companies, said James Breyer, a partner at Accel
Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment bankers see the deterioration in the tech-stock
market as a prelude to a new wave of merger activity in which
better-capitalized Internet companies will devour cash-strapped
competitors. It could be the ultimate spring sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking through Macy's where everything has a red
price tag on it,'' he said. ``You know some furniture will be ugly,
but that doesn't mean you still won't take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Already it has begun and Breyer, a director of Walmart.com,
knows this firsthand. He said that as many as two dozen e-retailers
are shopping themselves to traditional brick-and-mortar companies,
including to Walmart.com, the Internet venture between Accel and
Wal-Mart stores.
</P>
<P>
   While the new-economy companies scramble to obtain financing,
their old-economy counterparts are getting a warm reception.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Metropolitan Life's underwriters at Credit Suisse
First Boston priced 202 million shares at $14.25 each, near the
middle of the expected price range.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Krispy Kreme's investment bankers at Deutsche Banc
Alex Brown was more encouraging: They priced 3 million shares of
the doughnut-seller's stock at $21 each, above the projected range
of $18 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the consumer stocks and the financials outperform
the market as the new economy becomes old and the old economy
becomes new,'' said Hantho.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in Metropolitan Life's favor was the relatively strong
recent performance of stocks of insurers and other financial
companies, said James K. Schmidt, manager of the John Hancock
Financial Industries fund.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's co-manager, Thomas Goggins, said that this week's
selloff bodes well for financial stocks because it increases the
chances that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
only one more time to cool the economy, instead of twice or three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme was the second company to sell its initial offering
for more than expected. Tuesday, shares of Cabot Microelectronics
rose more than $4 from its offering price of $20, cheering
investment bankers who worried that the long, hot market for new
stocks would dry up altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Having developed a cult following in New York and other cities
it has moved into in the last few years, Krispy Kreme is selling a
24 percent stake to the public. Some of the proceeds will be spent
refurbishing some of the 58 company-owned stores, but the company
does not plan to build many more of its own. Instead, it has turned
to franchising, charging store owners royalties of 4.5 percent of
their sales.
</P>
<P>
   Another $7 million of the proceeds will be paid to existing
shareholders, some of whom are officers and directors of the
company. Only two of the company's officers and directors are not
also franchisees.

U.S. COURT STAYS EXECUTIONS OF 2 TENNESSEE PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two Tennessee inmates who were scheduled to die this
week in back-to-back executions received last-minute reprieves
Tuesday when a federal appellate court ruled that more time was
needed to review their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' said Jim H. Walker, a lawyer for Robert Glen
Coe, who had been scheduled to die at 1 a.m. Wednesday, 15 hours
after the stay was issued. ``We got pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Coe would have become the first murderer executed in Tennessee
in 40 years. Tennessee is one of 8 states among the 38 with death
penalty laws that have not executed an inmate since capital
punishment was reinstated in the 1970s. The U.S. Supreme Court
struck down the death penalty as unconstitutionally arbitrary in
1972, thereby commuting the death sentences of 629 inmates. States
then began revising their death penalty laws to satisfy the court's
objections, and Tennessee did so in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the men who were scheduled to die this week were spared,
at least temporarily, by the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals,
which sits in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Coe, who was convicted of raping and murdering an
8-year-old girl in 1979, a three-judge panel of the court ruled
Tuesday morning that the execution should be stayed while it
reviewed whether Coe was mentally competent to be executed. State
law says that an inmate cannot be executed ``if he lacks the mental
capacity to understand the fact of the impending execution and the
reason for it.'' Coe, 43, has a long history of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court also stayed the execution of Philip Ray
Workman, 46, who was convicted of killing a Memphis police officer
in 1981 while fleeing a fast-food restaurant he had robbed. He had
been scheduled to die 24 hours after Coe, at 1 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Workman's lawyers were also breathing easier Tuesday. ``Talk
about being at death's door,'' said one, Jefferson T. Dorsey,
adding that Workman shared his relief. ``It's the first time I've
seen color in his face in about two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey and other lawyers maintain that ballistics evidence that
was not explored at the trial demonstrates that the fatal shot was
most likely fired by another officer, not by Workman. They contend
that Workman was hit over the head while scuffling with police and
involuntarily fired two shots but that neither killed Lt. Ronald
Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a three-judge panel of the appellate court denied
Workman's request for a hearing to examine new evidence. But the
full court said Tuesday that a majority of its members had voted to
review the case, superseding the decision of the three-judge panel.
Workman's lawyers have until April 17 to file a brief about a
recently discovered X-ray that they believe is exculpatory and
about the recanted testimony of a man who swore at the trial that
he saw Workman fire the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's attorney general, Paul G. Summers, said Tuesday that
his heart went out to the families and friends of the victims. ``We
are disappointed for those people,'' he said in a statement, ``who
expect their justice system to work efficiently in a timely
manner.''

MINORITY ENROLLMENT REBOUNDS AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years after race-based admission policies
were abolished at the University of California, the number of
black, Hispanic and American Indian freshmen who will enter next
fall has rebounded to above what it was when affirmative action
measures were in place.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant disparity can still be found at the
university's flagship campuses here and at Berkeley, as well as at
San Diego and Santa Barbara. And the percentage of those minorities
enrolled as freshmen will decrease to 17.6 percent in the fall of
2000 from 18.8 percent in 1997, the last year of affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California at Berkeley, the number of
black, Hispanic and American Indian freshmen will drop to 1,169
this fall from 1,778 in 1997. Still, that is an increase over the
717 admission in 1998 and 990 in 1999. The figures at the
University of California at Los Angeles were much the same, with
underrepresented minorities down 1,449 next fall from 2,010 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, in the eight schools in the state university system,
enrollment of minority freshmen will rise to 7,336 next fall, from
7,236 in 1997. At the same time, the number of black, Hispanic and
American Indian students on the Irvine, Riverside and Santa Cruz
campuses will increase to 6,650 this fall, from 4,822 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers seem to play out the theory that abolishing
affirmative action in the selection process would lead to a
two-tiered system in the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is your two flagship campuses will be sort of
reverse ghettos, with Asians and whites and a lack of color,'' said
Bill Bagley, a regent who opposed the abolition of racial
preference in admissions. ``That's not good for those
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ward Connerly, the regent who led the campaign to end race
preference in university admissions, the shift is simply a
redistribution of students to where they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the numbers overall demonstrate that the absence of
racial preferences, also known as affirmative action, does not mean
that minority kids will not be educated at one of the best
educational facilities in the country,'' Connerly said Tuesday.
``They'll just be redistributed to less competitive campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the change, the university has focused on outreach
programs to address disparities at underperforming schools. The
programs seek to improve the quality of teachers and inform
students of what is required for college admission.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, policies have been established guaranteeing the top
4 percent of graduates in each high school a place at the
University of California if they meet eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still know there's a lot of work left to do, not just to
get back to where we were but to increase the diversity far beyond
what it was in 1997,'' said Terry Lightfoot, a spokesman for the
University of California.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the university voted to prohibit the consideration of
race and sex in admission decisions. The policy took effect in
1998. In a separate initiative in 1996, California voters passed
Proposition 209, which prohibits the consideration of race and sex
in hiring, contracting and university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bagley acknowledged that progress was being made through
outreach programs, but he said much remained to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a generation being lost of qualified minority
students until the outreach program is perfected and until we do
more to equalize high school preparations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagley also expressed concern about a loss of talented
graduate-level students to other universities. ``Very high-quality,
top-of-the-line minority graduate students are choosing to go to
places like Harvard, Yale and Stanford for two reasons: One,
they're recruited, and two, they're suffering from the feeling we
don't want them here,'' he said.

 Microsoft Rivals See Opportunity  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft's rivals in the operating systems market took heart from
the software giant's resounding legal defeat on Monday, and
investors rewarded them with a slight uptick in share price
yesterday.
<P>
   But analysts warned that Microsoft's legal entanglements and
depressed stock price may not lead its competitors to Easy Street.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, Corel and VA Linux all saw their shares edge
up yesterday, while Microsoft's again declined, in the first full
day of trading after U.S. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's historic
decision. The judge ruled that Microsoft broke state and federal
antitrust laws to protect its monopoly in operating systems _ the
platform on which other software like Internet browsers and
spreadsheets run.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to agree with the firms who say the ruling
could boost alternatives to Windows such as the Linux operating
system, which is gaining momentum in the Web server market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace was already looking for a choice,'' said Tim
Buckley, chief operating officer at Red Hat of Durham, N.C., which
markets a commercial version of Linux. ``This elevates the issue
(and) helps the alternatives to Microsoft that the consumer may be
looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Red Hat, and Sunnyvale's VA Linux, a maker of
servers and workstations for Linux, have seen a groundswell of
support for the ``open source'' operating system, which, like its
cousin Unix, is generally thought to be speedier and more stable
than Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But software industry analysts warn that Microsoft won't become
an also-ran anytime soon, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   That's because corporate networks are one thing, while consumer
and business desktop machines, where Microsoft owns an a huge chunk
of the market, are quite another.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there are very few workaday Linux-based
applications like spreadsheets and word processing.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, products like Sun Microsystem's StarOffice, a free
suite of office applications that has been downloaded roughly 2
million times, have yet to eat into Microsoft's 95 percent market
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question people who are saying new competition and choice
will happen'' as a result of the ruling,'' said Clay Ryder, an
analyst at Zona Research. ``The thought that Linux will become the
operating system of choice for home users ... that's a bit
far-fetched.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Linux won't catch on with corporate
users. Red Hat, whose sales tripled last year to $42 million, says
about 30 percent of the servers on the Internet run Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision ``allowed the market to question how powerful
Microsoft is,'' said Brian Biles, vice president of marketing at VA
Linux Systems. ``It allowed customers to think (Microsoft) they
 &LR; might be vulnerable after all. That can't do anything but help
us.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft won't likely sit idly by if Linux creeps into
more high-end corporate networks. The company has made an
aggressive push into the market with its Windows 2000 product, the
newly released successor to NT 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   As the case winds toward the penalty phase and then the appeals
process, the software landscape will remain largely unchanged,
according to Jeff Tarter, editor of SoftLetter, an industry
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is divided into Microsoft customers and everybody
else, and there happens to be a lot of Microsoft customers and not
a lot of everybody else,'' he said. ``I don't think there are going
to be more than a tiny portion of customers that change their
buying based on this legal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts admit that could change if the Justice Department
decides to break the company up into smaller pieces made to
function on their own. But even if the judge orders that, the
process will likely be tied up for years in appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Microsoft rivals may just have to hope that the rise
of Internet appliances, gaming consoles and cell phones creates new
opportunities for their wares.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, as it has so many times in the past, Microsoft will
probably make inroads. Recently, the company unveiled a prototype
for the X-Box, a gaming machine due out in late 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 15 years, everybody has envisioned scenarios
where Microsoft gets killed, and it never happens,'' Tarter said.
``Certainly they have their vulnerabilities. Every company does.
But this is a competitive company. This is not a company that
ignores their vulnerabilities.''

   ``If you're on the wrong side of something like this, it's
awful,'' he said. ``This is the biggest move I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the market was redefining the term ``thrill ride,''
traders still found plenty of opportunities to joke around and blow
off steam. They had a good laugh after one stealthily taped paper
spurs to the heels of a Chronicle reporter.
</P>
<P>
   And they nudged one another when a TV camera approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy!'' they suddenly screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sell!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to hell!''
</P>
<P>
   The camera moved on and the traders shared a good chuckle. Then
it was back to business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun five-eighths!''
</P>
<P>
   Options trading is definitely a guy thing. Few women were among
those fighting for elbow space in the pits, and most of the men
carried themselves with a hitch-up-your-pants cowboy swagger.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner on the main floor of the Pacific Exchange,
where stocks rather than options are traded, the mood was
infinitely calmer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street might have been twisting around like a pretzel, but
the stock traders were doing their best to maintain an even keel.
About 27 million shares changed hands, compared with an average 23
million a day last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no panic on the floor,'' said trader Jonathan Werts.
``There's some anxiety, but no panic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Nasdaq started tanking, Werts said he quickly sold off
tech stocks. Then he sat back and tried to get a fix on what was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest sell-off we've ever had on the Nasdaq,''
Werts noted as the index hit bottom. ``It's a hectic job by nature.
On a day like this, it's even more hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   For some traders, the day only worsened as it went along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disaster has struck,'' groaned Brian Fuller as the numbers
changed on his screen. ``This has been pretty ghastly.''
</P>
<P>
   As his losses piled up, he said he could only keep his fingers
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope it's going to turn around,'' Fuller said. ``Sometimes
it does.'' He gazed at his screen with a stricken expression.
``Today it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hal Requa, yesterday's action constituted a huge buying
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a typical, massive three- or four-day correction,'' he
said. ``Luckily, we caught the downdraft fairly early.''
</P>
<P>
   Among investors, a similar roll-with-the-punches attitude
prevailed at Charles Schwab's main branch on Montgomery Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bear market _ we're not quite there yet,'' said Al
Karahdian,  &LR; Karahadian, 83, who said he routinely hangs out at
Schwab and watches the ticker scroll past. ``But we're getting very
close.''
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the old-timers like himself were able to take
yesterday's gyrations in stride. But he noted scornfully that
things are different among the younger investors, who ``have been
cockier than hell'' riding tech stocks to stratospheric highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never seen a sell-off,'' Karahadian sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he will probably wade back into the market in
another day or two and pick up some bargains. Others weren't
bothering to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is upstairs buying right now,'' said Pauline
Maloof, a Florida resident whose visit in San Francisco was put on
hold because of the market's brief collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ben Briggs, a 30-year-old San Francisco jewelry store
owner, seized the opportunity to purchase 200 more shares of 3Com.
``Every time it goes down, I buy more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Briggs' experience as a market player is brief. He has
invested his life savings in stocks over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bank, I was making zip,'' he observed. ``In the first
two weeks after I started trading, I made $4,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's barely breaking even.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the options exchange, traders grew increasingly frantic
as the session drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Paper littered the floor and shouting erupted intermittently.
Tempers were barely held in check at the Microsoft pit, where a
pair of traders bickered over the price of a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically not this exciting here,'' said trader David
O'Neal. ``When things go down this far, you start getting scared.
But if you start selling, that's panic. That's how you get yourself
into a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked around at the crush of last-minute activity as the
closing bell was about to ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drink a lot of coffee around here,'' O'Neal said. ``On a
day like this, you don't need much at all.''

INSTEAD OF PROTECTING HEART, ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT MAY INCREASE
RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 4th graf for clarification on bone health; subs 6th graf to
amplify Lenfant's statement)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have informed about 25,000 women taking part in a
federal study of hormone replacement therapy that, far from
protecting the heart as many researchers had assumed, the therapy
may have put the women at a slightly higher risk of heart attacks
and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, known as the Hormone Replacement Therapy trial of the
Women's Health Initiative, is the first large-scale controlled
clinical trial asking whether hormone replacement therapy prevents
heart disease in healthy post-menopausal women. But in letters sent
out Friday, participants were told that those who had been randomly
assigned to take estrogen were having slightly more heart attacks,
strokes and blood clots in the lungs than those who had been
assigned to take dummy pills for comparison. While the effect was
not sufficiently pronounced to stop the study, the researchers
themselves were taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported Tuesday by The Washington Post and
The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 million American women take Premarin, an
estrogen that was approved only to alleviate the symptoms of
menopause, like hot flashes, and for the prevention and management
of osteoporosis. The drug's maker, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a
subsidiary of American Home Products Corp., says the estrogen is
the best-selling prescription drug in America.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and individual women say that one reason for estrogen's
popularity is that there is a widespread belief that it will
prevent heart disease. But that hypothesis came from indirect
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, said in a statement Monday that the new
information is ``preliminary.'' It does not address the larger
issue of long-term benefits and risks of hormone replacement
therapy, he said, ``and, therefore, it should not influence current
medical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that women who take estrogen after
menopause have fewer heart attacks than women who do not. But since
women who take the hormone tend to be better educated, less likely
to smoke and more likely to eat balanced diets and exercise, it was
hard for researchers to tell whether the therapy or other factors
in their lives contributed to their lower risk. The only way to
know for sure was to do a large study like the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw, who is acting director of the hormone
replacement trial, said in an interview Tuesday that even though it
was too soon to say whether the increased risk of heart attacks and
strokes would hold up as the study continued, he felt morally
obliged to inform the women about the finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't anticipated when they enrolled,'' Rossouw said.
``We told them all about the risks and benefits but we didn't tell
them there might be an increased risk of heart disease.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added that he fervently hoped that the women would stay in
the study and that other women would not panic because the number
of women who had had heart attacks and strokes was minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my women friends ask me, `How does this affect me?', my
advice is it doesn't change a thing,'' Rossouw said. ``I would say
there never was proof that hormones help heart disease and there
still isn't. The only qualifier is, if you're expecting an early
benefit from heart disease it looks less likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators emphasize that only a small number of women in the
study actually had heart attacks, strokes or blood clots in the
lungs or the legs. The exact numbers were in the hands of an
independent committee that oversees the study, and its members
would not reveal them even to the study investigators. But overall,
only about 1 percent of all the women, who were 50 to 79, had these
medical problems in the first two years of the study. The effect
seems to be diminishing as the study continues, the researchers
say. Yet, apparently, these grave medical problems were
disproportionately concentrated in the women taking hormones that
were supposed to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most widely prescribed drug in America,'' said
Cindy Pearson, the executive director of the National Women's
Health Network, an advocacy group in Washington. ``A lot of the
women are taking it because they've been told by their doctors that
it will prevent a heart attack. Those are the women who should be
sitting up and taking notice and going to their doctors and saying,
`Why am I taking this? What's the point of this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said that, in her opinion, no woman should be taking
estrogen to prevent heart disease outside of a clinical trial
asking if it has that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some heart disease researchers said that they already were wary
about estrogen because it can elicit blood clots, which can cause
heart attacks and strokes. Birth control pills, which contain
estrogen, may cause clots, and a recent study found that women who
already had heart attacks might not be protected from new ones if
they take estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The study, directed by Dr. Stephen Hulley of the University of
California at San Francisco, found that in the first year, women
taking estrogen actually had more heart attacks and other
manifestations of heart disease than those taking a placebo. The
effect diminished in subsequent years, and by the fifth year the
women taking estrogen did better than those taking the placebo. But
the study failed to show that overall, women who had had heart
attacks were helped by estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, decades ago, in which men took estrogen in the
hope of preventing heart attacks, had to be discontinued because
the hormone was causing heart attacks instead.
</P>
<P>
   Those who hoped estrogen might benefit healthy women pointed to
the studies showing that women who happened to take estrogen had
fewer heart attacks than those who happened not to take it. They
also noted that estrogen increased the amount of beneficial
cholesterol in the blood, the HDL fraction, in the blood, while
decreasing the fraction of the harmful LDL cholesterol. But, Hulley
noted, his study of women who had had heart attacks indicated that
those changes in cholesterol levels could be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a nice 10-percent rise in HDL cholesterol and a
10-percent drop in LDL cholesterol, on average,'' Hulley said.
``This suggested to us that we were going to see a beneficial
effect on coronary heart disease rates.'' When that did not happen,
he said, ``we were very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, investigators said, the Women's Health Initiative remains
scientists' best hope of learning whether estrogen replacement
therapy is helpful or harmful to healthy women.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else is going to do a study this big on hormone
replacement therapy,'' said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a Stanford
University professor who is chairwoman of the study's steering
committee. ``If we don't answer the questions on hormones, they're
never going to be answered,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In the letters they received, participants in the Women's Health
Initiative were urged to stay in the study. The study, they were
told, ``is more important than ever.'' So far, said Rossouw, the
women are reacting calmly. ``It seems that we're not going to lose
any participants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, said Dr. Michael Criqui, an investigator in the
study who is a professor of family and preventive medicine at the
University of California at San Diego, ``one cannot recommend to a
woman to take estrogen to prevent heart disease at this time.'' So
far, he said, ``there's no evidence that it will.''

EVERYONE IS ROOTING FOR NORMAN AT AUGUSTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The fans filing through Augusta National Golf
Club's gates Tuesday seemed to have two predominant spring
thoughts: Please don't let it rain and let Greg Norman reign.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn broke drizzly after this city spent Monday night under a
tornado watch, which, contrary to public belief on the PGA Tour
these days is not the same thing as awaiting the arrival of Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Woods has been a force of nature on the golf course
this year. The 24-year-old has finished first or second in six of
his seven starts (the lone exception being L.A.'s Nissan Open),
making him the prohibitive favorite to win his second green jacket
when the 64th Masters tournament commences Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the patrons' favorite and the sentimental choice of
even a few of the players would appear to be the 45-year-old
Norman, whose window for winning a Masters tournament is closing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   The affable Australian, who has won 74 tournaments worldwide,
including two British Opens, readily admits Augusta National Golf
Club has this week and next year to settle its considerable debt
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically,'' he said, ``in the next two years if I stay
focused, then I can perform.''
</P>
<P>
   He has performed well here before, only to have victory elude
him every which way. He was stomped by a charging 46-year-old Jack
Nicklaus in 1986, stunned by Larry Mize's 140-foot chip-in on the
second extra hole in 1987 and strangled by his own hand in 1996.
That was the year Norman frittered away a six-stroke lead with a
closing six-over-par 78 to hand the tournament to Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has come close here so many times, it's a wonder he
hasn't changed his company's logo from a shark to a horseshoe.
</P>
<P>
   The gracious way he handled his collapse in 1996 elevated him in
the eyes of the badge-holding patrons. As he walked the packed
grounds Tuesday, voices in the crowd cried out, ``This is your
year, Greg,'' and ``We love you, Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods oozed empathy for his rival, saying, ``You know, it's
a shame that he hasn't won (here) because he's such a great player.
It's tough for me to imagine somebody going through all the
(heartbreaks) he has had here and coming back again and again and
putting himself in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman insists he doesn't step on Augusta National's grounds and
die a little, remembering all her slights. ``I can walk to every
hole and remember the good shots I hit on that hole,'' he said. ``I
don't let ... the negative energy of this place pollute my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Jose-Maria Olazabal, who answered Norman's
finishing kick last year with a better one of his own, is hoping
good karma follows Norman around the course like his biggest fan.
``I want to see Greg win the Masters,'' Olazabal said. ``Then I
think he can retire in peace.'' &QL;

FOR MANY JAPANESE, SECRECY AND POLITICS ARE INSEPARABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXPANDS 5th graf to sum up Japanese reaction) 
(See also JAPAN-POLITICS) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Their prime minister was lying in the intensive care
unit of a local hospital, kept alive by a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   The media was full of stories about how their elected
representatives had lied about the gravity of his condition in
order to put in place a succession plan before critics could raise
their voices. The very legitimacy and credibility of their
political system had been thrown into question.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese people barely shrugged. ``I am from Kagoshima
prefecture, where a former governor collapsed and the prefectural
officials hid it for some time,'' said Yoshiko Sano, a 48-year-old
housewife hurrying through Ginza, Tokyo's premier shopping
district, who described herself as a ``typical'' Japanese.
``Everything here is always hidden behind a veil, which means that
even if they make timely announcements, I am doubtful about the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden stroke that put a sudden end to Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's tenure and focused world attention yet again on the
back-room horse-trading that determines how this country _ the
world's second-largest in terms of economic muscle _ functions
politically has elicited little more than a shrug from most
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of outrage that in the West might have greeted the
deliberate obfuscation that surrounded Obuchi's illness and the
peremptory manner in which elders of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party determined his successor was treated as business as usual by
Japanese interviewed on the streets. Judging by their reactions,
some Japanese were clearly pleased that stability and process were
being protected, even if it was at the expense of full disclosure.
Other simply dismissed the fog that surrounds Obuchi's health as
the sort of thing that they have come to expect. ``Hiding important
things is done everyday,'' said Reiko Inoue, a 49-year-old
housewife. ``And it doesn't matter who becomes prime minister.
Nothing will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some even expressed a bit of understanding about the way news of
Obuchi's tragedy has been handled by the political leadership. ``I
suspect that they may be concealing a lot more, but there are a lot
of things probably only the insiders can understand,'' said Kiyoshi
Kojima, a 54-year-old salary man. ``You know we salarymen, even
among ourselves, there are a lot of things that are hard to explain
to outsiders.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many had assumed from the beginning that they were being lied
to. Obuchi fell ill after a meeting with Ichiro Ozawa, the leader
of one of the ruling party's coalition partners who has a
well-known history of ``kumogakurei,'' literally ``hiding behind
the clouds,'' when faced with adversity. Ozawa had told Obuchi that
he and several members of his party intended to abandon the
coalition, and many people assumed that the prime minister had
simply reached into Ozawa's bag of tricks and done a disappearing
act in response to the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the news that he was in the hospital, I
doubted that it was really true,'' said Masashi Higuchi, 30, who
works at a trading company. ``I suspected he had simply fled to the
hospital to hide after his meeting with Ozawa.''
</P>
<P>
   Makiko Ezoe, 24, said she initially assumed the same thing.
``When I heard his secretary had said he didn't know where he was,
I thought of Ozawa and his habit of kumogakurei,'' she said. ``But
then I had second thoughts. Mr. Obuchi is not the kind of person
who would do that. He seems too kind-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several of those interviewed expressed a tender fondness
for their soon-to-be former prime minister that was often lost in
characterizations of him that compared him to ``cold pizza'' and an
``oji-san,'' or old, bumbling man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that Mr. Obuchi was really kind and gentle to the
people around him,'' said Goro Takano, 33, a literature major at a
local university. ``Probably his life was shortened because he
worried too much about taking care of others. In that sense, I feel
sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, many yearned for a different kind of
leader, someone less concerned with the traditional effort to
promote consensus and harmony and more of an activist, someone more
like Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara. ``Personally, I want someone
like Ishihara, who has strong leadership and solid beliefs,''
Higuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiro Mori, the secretary-general of the ruling party and the
man widely reported to be Obuchi's successor, is a polar opposite
of Ishihara, whose recent success in passing a bill that will levy
a special tax on big banks has made him something of a folk hero
among city residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want somebody who is young and fresh and can exercise
leadership to replace Mr. Obuchi,'' said Shinji Yamada, a
55-year-old salaryman. ``But I can't have such great expectations
about Mr. Mori. There's nothing new and fresh about him.''

GORE SPEAKS OF CUBAN BOY, REPEATEDLY BUT NOT CLEARLY 
</HEADLINE>
  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore made three different
statements Tuesday on Elian Gonzalez, but by the end of the day it
was not entirely clear what he had meant to convey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore prompted harsh criticism from fellow Democrats last
Thursday when, breaking with President Clinton, he endorsed
permanent residency status for Elian. The vice president did not
speak publicly again on the matter until Tuesday morning, when he
was interviewed on the NBC News television program ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gore seemed to suggest that the boy should be
returned to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. ``Nobody from the
start has disputed the fact that this child eventually ought to go
back with the father, if that is what is clearly decided is in the
best interests of the child,'' Gore said, although he also said
Gonzalez ought to first say on American soil that he wants to take
the boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore refused to answer directly the question, posed three
times, whether Gonzalez should be granted custody if he comes to
the United States. ``If the father says on free soil that he
believes the son should go back to Cuba with him, that of course is
likely to be determinative,'' Gore said, carefully sidestepping
whether that would be his own preference.
</P>
<P>
   About three hours after his appearance on ``Today,'' Gore's
staff issued a statement in his name that sought to clarify his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving Elian, and his father and family, permanent resident
status would allow this matter to be handled in family court and
would allow his father to express what is in his heart,'' the
statement said. ``We need to ensure that his father can speak,
freely in a court of law on free soil. I believe a ruling by a
court of this kind, with these guarantees, would be respected by
all parties.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours later, Gore appeared on the Lifetime cable
television network, whose programming is aimed mostly at women. He
said a Senate bill that would give Elian permanent residency
status, which he has endorsed, ``would have the legal effect of
making it much easier to have this dispute resolved in a family
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gonzalez should be allowed to take Elian home to Cuba,
Gore said, ``I think that if the father comes here with his wife
and new baby, and in an atmosphere free of intimidation makes his
true wishes known, then obviously a family court that traditionally
decides such matters would take that heavily into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he did not say that this was the preferable outcome, only
that it was the outcome he thought likely.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks provided fodder for his presidential campaign
rival, Gov. George W. Bush, who has made much of what he says is
Gore's inconsistency on a number of topics. Bush has said since
January that Elian should be given American citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, issued a statement
saying: ``When it comes to the future of Elian Gonzalez, it's
becoming increasingly hard to understand what Al Gore believes in
or what he thinks should be done.''

 &HT;    Path Elder opened hardly used
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga., _ Twenty-five years ago, Lee Elder became the
first black man to play the old South's favorite golf tournament,
the Masters. At that same tournament, Rod Curl joined the field as
the breakthrough American Indian. The place that celebrates all the
colors of spring had begun indulging the human spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In the year 2000, Tiger Woods is the one player of
African-American lineage in the field. Notah Begay the solitary
Native American. Vijay Singh is another player of color; and there,
quickly as that, we have finished the diversity roll call.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a tribute to the immutable nature of Augusta
National and the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The trailblazer returns _ greatly honored _ only to find that
the trail he blazed is going virtually unused. If the
groundskeeping wasn't so good around here, there'd be weeds and
vines choking the path that Elder cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see more (minority players) here today,'' said
Elder, ``but it just so happens that we don't have any that's in a
position to qualify here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there many applicants on the horizon. ``I don't see any
who really has the game to come out, be productive and be able to
qualify. I think it's going to take some time,'' he said. Elder's
65 now, with time no longer such a friend.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping score at home, there is one black player on
the developmental Buy.com Tour. And one African-American woman on
the LPGA Tour. Elder's legacy and Woods' popularity have yet to
translate into a tidal wave of participation. The economic and
cultural barriers to golf clearly have not been overcome at the
highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the future Elder had hoped for when he made the
first nervous drive down Magnolia Lane in 1975. Over his lifetime
he had known a ``Caucasian-only'' clause in the bylaws of the PGA
of America (repealed in 1961). He had seen the Masters pressured by
Congress to invite him to the tournament, but much more
meaningfully, Elder would earn his way there. At a tournament site
where six years before he had been refused entrance to the
clubhouse _ the Pensacola Country Club _ Elder won the 1974
Monsanto Open and his Masters invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Elder tells of sweaty palms on his first drive up Magnolia Lane.
Death threats had followed his victory in Pensacola, and a natural
suspicion accompanied him through the gates. ``I really felt it was
a racist place in the fact that they had not invited a black. Very
few blacks had even been around the Masters, besides the waiters
and caddies,'' Elder has said.
</P>
<P>
   He tells of trembling on the first tee. How could he not? Elder
was not allowed the luxury of being a mere 40-year-old Masters
rookie. He was a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, missing the cut in the first of his six Masters
appearances, was what helped assure Elder he belonged here. ``I had
more people come up to me and say, `Lee, that was a magnificent job
you did. Just because you didn't play good golf doesn't mean you're
not a good person or have a good character.'''
</P>
<P>
   Inside these gates, Elder found the Masters experience
everything it should be. He said he was treated with all due
respect, even warmly greeted by the late Clifford Roberts, the
tournament's hard-edged chairman. Now, he is regarded as an
important historical figure, who just had to be on the grounds
during Woods' 1997 victory march.
</P>
<P>
   On this anniversary of his first Masters appearance, he'll be
honored by the Golf Writers Association of America tonight, then
spend the rest of the weekend at the tournament with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woods will command his attention. But Elder also is
keen for perhaps the whitest man in the field. ``I think it's high
time for Davis (Love III) to come to the top here,'' he said. There
is a beautiful balance in this little corner of golf.

JAILED MEXICAN WINS ENVIRONMENTAL PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IGUALA, Mexico _ Humble Mexicans who stand in the way of
depleting the country's natural resources have often faced brutal
treatment, but one such man has discovered in recent days that he
has international friends to help him fight his cause.
</P>
<P>
   The man is Rodolfo Montiel, who organized peasants to block
roads after loggers began felling virgin forests near his village
in the mountains north of Acapulco. That peaceful 1988 protest
slowed the logging, but it infuriated wealthy landowners and the
generals at a nearby garrison.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen have since killed several members of Montiel's rural
ecological organization, and last May soldiers seized and tortured
Montiel, he said, accusing him of drug and weapons crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were riddled with contradictions, but were enough to
send him to a penitentiary pending a felony trial. One of the human
rights lawyers defending him has been kidnapped, twice.
</P>
<P>
   But last Friday, Amnesty International declared Montiel to be a
prisoner of conscience, provoking a flood of protest letters to the
Mexican authorities. And on Wednesday, a San Francisco foundation
is to announce that it has awarded him a $125,000 environmental
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only award I've gotten from the government is prison, so I
don't know quite what to think about this prize from foreigners,''
Montiel, a robust, nearly toothless man of 44, said in an interview
Monday in a federal prison in Iguala, two hours' drive south of
Mexico City. ``Are you sure this doesn't involve some hidden
punishment?''
</P>
<P>
   (David Najera, a government spokesman, said Tuesday that
President Ernesto Zedillo was unaware of the details of Montiel's
case. ``But it worries us, and we'll focus on it now,'' he said,
adding that Zedillo's government has emphasized respect for the
environment.)
</P>
<P>
   The government showed only hostility to Montiel's complaints in
1995 after local authorities began to promote logging in the
mountains of Guerrero State, signing timber contracts with Boise
Cascade, the Idaho-based lumber company.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel, who has only a first-grade education, sent letters to
Mexico's environment minister, to the governor of Guerrero and to a
dozen other authorities, reporting that laws were being trampled,
local rivers were drying up, and thousands of fish were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense of the forest is a struggle for our way of life,''
Montiel wrote in one letter. ``The earth without trees becomes a
desert, because the soul of the water lives in the cool of the
forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one authority ever responded: a Guerrero official accused
Montiel of belonging to ``an ecological guerrilla organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Montiel's group blocked roads to stop the timber
trucks in spring 1998, Boise Cascade pulled out of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   (Doug Bartels, a spokesman, said on Tuesday that Boise Cascade
left because it could not get enough logs to keep its 100-employee
sawmill running. Referring to the arrests of Montiel and a friend
in May 1999, he said, ``If these two individuals have been wrongly
arrested, that's regrettable.'')
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers who detained the two men tied and beat them, held them
for two days partly submerged in a river, forced them to hold
marijuana plants and rifles as soldiers took photos, and later
pressured them to sign a confession, Montiel said. Montiel urinated
blood for months after his torture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Montiel's lawyers last fall, army
officers contradicted themselves over details of his arrest. Days
later, one of the lawyers, Digna Ochoa, was kidnapped and beaten by
assailants in Mexico City. In October, intruders accosted Ochoa
again for hours in her home.

DUCKS LOOK AHEAD, NOT BEHIND
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO _ The Mighty Ducks play game No.80 of the season tonight
in Chicago with their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim would be in much better position had it not lost to the
likes of Tampa Bay and the New York Islanders this season and
squandered some third-period advantages, especially during one
stretch in February.
</P>
<P>
   However, coach Craig Hartsburg says now is certainly not the
time to be looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in the middle of something, you can't look at the
things you have done wrong or should have done,'' he said. ``That's
for when the season is over _ that's when you look at the areas
that hurt you and you need to fix _ and hopefully that is not for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   PUTTING ON PRESSURE: The Ducks will begin their final three
games several hours ahead of the teams they are battling with, and
they hope to put some pressure on their rivals by posting early
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do what we have to do and make them feel the
pressure,'' said defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, who knows one loss
will likely end the Ducks' postseason hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim captain Paul Kariya, as usual, had the most logical
response when asked if playing early is an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got to win whether you play before or after them,''
he said. ``It's the same with them, they have to take care of their
own business too.'' &QL;

   (NYT44) NEW YORK -- April 4, 2000 -- GUN-DEALER -- Anthony
Imperato's family owns the oldest gun shop in New York City.

never once went hunting. ``We didn't shoot at targets. None of our
hobbies ever involved guns. Guns were a job. Maybe the guys who run

2 PHONE GIANTS SAID TO BE NEAR DEAL TO MERGE WIRELESS UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to create a national giant in wireless communications,
BellSouth and SBC Communications are near a deal to merge their
North American wireless operations, executives close to the
negotiations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' boards were scheduled to meet Tuesday night to
approve the deal, the executives said, and the companies hope to
announce the agreement as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and SBC, which does business as Ameritech, Pacific
Bell and Southwestern Bell, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fragmentation, the wireless communications
business is now in a period of furious consolidation. As wireless
companies merge and form wide-ranging joint ventures, they are
searching mostly to expand their geographic reach.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling a national network allows a wireless carrier to
attract customers looking to use their cellular phone across the
nation. But at least as important, a nationwide system also allows
carriers to achieve economies of scale in advertising and marketing
and allows them to reduce the ``roaming'' fees they pay when their
customers use other carriers' systems.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and SBC, both created in the breakup of the American
Telephone and Telegraph Co. in 1984, are each titans in the local
telephone business. SBC, the No. 1 local phone company, is the main
local carrier from Illinois to Texas and also in California.
BellSouth is the dominant local phone company from the Carolinas to
Florida to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But neither company's wireless operation yet enjoys national
scope. By merging, the combined BellSouth-SBC wireless unit,
concentrated in the fast-growing Sun Belt, would be able to serve
more than half the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   The combined wireless unit would serve more than 16 million
total subscribers and would have annual revenue of more than $8
billion. Based on the valuations that investors have given other
wireless companies, the combined unit would probably have a market
value of at least $60 billion were it publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said that BellSouth and SBC do intend
to offer stock in the new unit to the public, though perhaps not
until early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bell Atlantic and Vodafone AirTouch PLC reached a
similar deal to merge their U.S. wireless operations and on Monday,
Bell Atlantic announced that it would call the new venture Verizon
Wireless. Tuesday, the new Bell Atlantic-Vodafone operation said it
would sell stock to the public but did not say when the initial
offering would take place or how much stock would be put up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the numbers are likely to be big for both Verizon
and the combined BellSouth-SBC unit. Last week, AT&AMP;T said that it
intended to raise up to $13.2 billion when it sold new shares meant
to track its national wireless operation. AT&AMP;T's offering will
probably take place late this month.
</P>
<P>
   Because federal rules do not allow one company to own multiple
major wireless licenses in any given market, Bell Atlantic,
Vodafone and GTE, which has agreed to be acquired by Bell Atlantic,
have faced the prospect of shedding broad swaths of their
overlapping wireless properties. SBC dealt with the same issue
after it agreed to acquire Ameritech; SBC and Ameritech were
wireless competitors in markets including Chicago and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   It would take months for SBC and BellSouth to win regulatory
approval for their joint venture, but they would not face nearly as
much of a divestiture problem because the two companies' wireless
units do not overlap much, analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   What will overlap, however, are the two companies' management
roles. According to executives close to the talks, SBC and
BellSouth will have equal power over management decisions in their
new venture, overseeing a single chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   That is something of a departure for SBC, which has
traditionally preferred to control its ventures outright. But
BellSouth insisted that it not be a junior partner to SBC,
executives close to the talks said, and in the end SBC agreed to
share control.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the first time the two companies had had that
discussion. Before SBC agreed to acquire Ameritech in 1998, SBC had
in fact preferred the idea of acquiring BellSouth, according to
people close to those discussions. But BellSouth would not sell and
Ameritech would.
</P>
<P>
   In the new wireless venture, SBC will control 60 percent of the
economic interest while BellSouth will control 40 percent,
reflecting the fact that SBC's existing wireless business is bigger
than BellSouth's, according to an executive close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the deal said that SBC and BellSouth had not
yet decided on a chief executive for the new operation. The person
added that SBC and BellSouth intended to form a new brand for the
new unit, but said the companies had not yet created it.
</P>
<P>
   The new wireless venture, which is to involve the companies'

Imperato's family owns the oldest gun shop in New York City.
Growing up in Bensonhurt, Imperato said, he and his father, Louis,
never once went hunting. ``We didn't shoot at targets. None of our
hobbies ever involved guns. Guns were a job. Maybe the guys who run
Lobel's meat market are, you know, vegetarians. You never know.''

HAYLEY-MILLS-THEATER -- Hayley Mills has been working the London
stage for the last 30 years. But in this country she is still best
known as the saucer-eyed little girl in such popular Disney films
as ``Pollyanna'' (for which she won a special 1960 Academy Award)
and ``The Parent Trap.'' The London-born actress, who turns 54 next

Rodolfo Montiel, 44, who organized a protest by peasants against
logging in the mountains north of Acapulco, at the federal
penitentiary at Iguala where he is being held pending trial on
drugs and weapons charges. But last Friday, Amnesty International
declared Montiel to be a prisoner of conscience. And on Wednesday,
a San Francisco foundation will award him with a $125,000

OM-PURI-FILMS -- Om Puri, in SoHo last month, plays a Pakistani
Muslim married to an Englishwoman in 1970s Manchester in ``East Is
East.'' Although Om Puri has appeared, by his own estimate, in
something like 140 films in his 24-year screen career and has been
characterized by one expert on Indian cinema as ``the finest actor
of the post-independence generation,'' he is still far from a

DUCHOVNY-FILMS -- Is film David Duchovny's future? Or can he never
escape the identification with Mulder from ``The X-Files,'' a
strangely emotionless man obsessed by government conspiracies,
space aliens and his sister? Is he a truly talented actor or just a
really lucky guy who got cast as the one character he was born to
play? ``I feel good about doing movies,'' he says. ``I feel like
I'm just beginning that part of my career, which seems weird at
what I feel to be an advanced age.'' He is 39, facing his 40th

Third Place'' (1998), part of an exhibition, titled ``Fact/Fiction:
Contemporary Art That Walks the Line,'' at the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art through next Sunday. Morimura's exhibitionism seems
like an inevitable outgrowth of his earlier works' more discreet
campiness, fired by the same desire to reinvent the world rather
than merely comment on it. (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art/The

   (NYT31) UNDATED -- April 4, 2000 -- WINE-TALK -- Argentina is
one of the great wine-producing nations, right up there after
France, Spain, Italy and Spain. But hardly anyone knows this. Well,
maybe a few people do, but they are mostly in Argentina. Why?
Because it was a closed-in country, an economic and political
basket case for 40 years. Until now. Bodegas Etchart's Rio de Plata
wines are a good value at around $7 a bottle. (Tony Cenicola/The

Grand Central Terminal on Tuesday. The trio is to tour arenas this
summer with two singers who joined the Supremes after Ross left the

Philadelphia. (Ruby Washington/The New York Times)

   (NYT29) NEW YORK -- April 4, 2000 -- DINNER-PARTY -- The
dinner-party instinct is irrational. More often than not,
entertaining involves blood, sweat and tears, and can be a one-way
ticket to recrimination and regret. For the guests, of course, it's
a sweet deal. They bring a bottle of wine or a bouquet and they're
inside the velvet rope, ready for a stress-free evening of food and
wine. A tarte flambee was the inspiration for the author's dinner
party. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)

   (NYT28) PORTLAND, Ore. -- April 4, 2000 -- DOTCOM-FAMILIES -- In

30-whatevers, an increasing number of chief executives are turning
to their parents to tap into their elders' experience. Gregory P.
Sullivan, center, with his father, Kevin, left, and stepfather,

Provident, a disability and life insurance company. ``I live with

sometimes have to tell me to slow down and yell for people nearby

   (NYT25) NEW YORK -- April 4, 2000 -- STOCKS-MARKETPLACE-2 --
Frenzied activity on the floor of the Nasdaq 100 futures pit at The
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Tuesday. Midway through one of the
weirdest and wildest days in stock market history, the Nasdaq
composite index had plunged 634.31 points, shearing 13.6 percent
off its value. Had it closed there, it would have been the worst
one-day decline in Nasdaq history. But a flood of buying rescued
the composite, bringing it to close with a loss of only 1.72
percent on the day. (Steve Kagan/The New York Times)

President Clinton stops to thank David Mercer, of Mercer and

collaboration between the public and private sectors in making the
Internet more accessible to less affluent Americans, Tuesday at the

Lespert, left, and Jean-Claude Vallod in ``Human Resources.'' The
film slowly and deliberately spirals its ingenuous hero down a
treacherous rabbit hole of duplicity and corporate politics at a
French factory, and eventually threatens to put him and his father
on opposite sides of a war between management and labor. As
directed by Laurent Cantet, the film explores class differences,
corporate behavior, labor relations and father-son strife with an
unusual depth and subtlety. (Film Society of Lincoln Center/The New

city's last umbrella store, Uncle Sam Umbrellas and Canes, which is

   (NYT17) NEW YORK -- April 4, 2000 -- MARKETPLACE -- People look
through the window at the Nasdaq Marketsite on Times Square,
Tuesday. Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in
stock market history, the Nasdaq composite index had plunged over
633 points, shearing 13.6 percent off its value. Had it closed
there, it would have been the worst one-day decline in Nasdaq
history. What stock market investors wanted to know after Tuesday's
bizarre bungee-jump in share prices was, what did it signify? (Fred

   (NYT16) UNDATED -- April 4, 2000 -- SONG-FILM-REVIEW-B&AMP;W -- Anna
Simpson in ``Our Song,'' Jim McKay's drama about three young women
growing up in Brooklyn. In the course of the film, which moves with
the ease and warmth of its season and place, Lanisha, Jocelyn and
Maria face the usual dilemmas and frustrations of teenage life in
America - and in the movies - today. But ``Our Song'' is so unlike
most Hollywood coming-of-age stories as to seem downright
revolutionary. (Film Society of Lincoln Center/The New York Times)

treasures at the Museum of Natural History. Neff, who calls himself
a piscatorial bibliophile, has taken his personal library of rare
books on fishing and, using the book binder's art he took up 20
years ago, transformed them into desktop fishing expeditions. By

Maxfield Parrish's landscape painting hangs near where bank tellers

Maxfield Parrish painting from this little branch office and , as
one art gallery discovered last winter, you'll face the wrath of a

stems of red chard and its white-stemmed cousin are edible. Chard
leaves can be used in most recipes calling for spinach (salads are
the exception, since chard leaves are too tough to eat raw), but
the ``chard equals spinach'' formula ignores the fact that the
stems of the two vegetables are very different. Spinach stems are
stringy and fibrous and don't make very good eating. Chard stems
have a delicious, earthy flavor and a distinctive texture that is
silky and meaty when cooked. (Tony Cenicola/The New York Times)

11 U.S. SOLIDERS HURT IN KOSOVO AS SERBS PROTEST AN ARMS ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eleven U.S. soldiers were injured Tuesday in
southern Kosovo by an angry crowd of Serbian villagers who were
protesting a Serb's arrest in a case that involved illegal arms
possession, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   A Polish peacekeeper and an interpreter were also injured in
what was supposed to have been a routine arrest by NATO forces in
Sevce. The melee began after 150 Serbs had surrounded the suspect's
house and blocked the troops' exit.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcements were flown in by helicopter from the U.S. base at
Camp Bondsteel to rescue the squad of U.S. military police
officers, the Pentagon said. They were joined by Polish troops, who
set up a roadblock to stop an additional 300 Serbs from Jacinze,
two miles away, who were trying to join the protest.
</P>
<P>
   The security forces suffered what the U.S. Army described as
``non-life-threatening injuries'' while arresting the Serb because
he had reportedly hid two hand grenades in his house. A Pentagon
official said the crowd was throwing rocks and sticks at the
security forces, who fired rubber bullets, holding off the crowd
until reinforcements arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Army offered no estimate of the number of civilians injured
near the house or at the roadblock. Beta, the independent Yugoslav
news agency, reported that 4 Serbs were hurt at Sevce and 12 were
wounded by rubber bullets at Jacinze.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said arrests of Serbs and Kosovar Albanians
over illegal possession of weapons were almost daily events.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most upsetting about this incident is the number of
people who came out to confront the peacekeepers and came out
quickly,'' the official said. ``Maybe it was an organized
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. soldiers were slightly injured in February in a weapons
search in Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The incident Tuesday prompted new Pentagon complaints about
using soldiers for police duties. ``When peacekeepers are forced
into police duties all the time,'' the official said, ``they are
perceived as taking sides.''

TRAINER SAHADI USES GENTLE TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The Deputy, a big three-year-old colt with
tons of promise, walked onto the track at Santa Anita and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was just enjoying the warm sun on his back or the
stiff wind in his face. Whatever. He was stopped and not in much of
a hurry to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   His trainer Janine Sahadi, surrounded by a busy television crew,
walked over and smiled. In a fleeting, but candid moment, before
the crew had their equipment set, Sahadi gave her charge a nice pat
on the head and sent him off to do a workout as if there was no one
else within miles.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that his mood changed and The Deputy galloped off to
begin his workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very good horse,'' she said. ``I think we're
finding out now just how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy is one of six horses scheduled to run in this
Saturday's $1 million Santa Anita Derby. Depending on his
performance it's likely he'll take a shot at the Triple Crown
beginning with a run in the Kentucky Derby on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   If The Deputy runs in both derbies, Sahadi, a 34-year-old
resident of Pasadena, would be the first woman to train a horse in
both events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's upbeat,'' she said. ``It's been fun with him ...
training for the Santa Anita Derby and Kentucky Derby, so it's
exciting in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame Jockey Chris McCarron, himself the winner of two
Kentucky Derbies and a pair of Santa Anita Derbies will be aboard
The Deputy on Saturday. As a guy who's ridden for some of history's
top trainers, McCarron holds nothing but praise for Sahadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very understanding to ride for,'' McCarron said.
``Janine is very frank _ she speaks her mind. She tells you exactly
what's she's thinking, which I like in a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a tremendous amount of success together so it's been
a good relationship,'' he continued. ``She's been really great with
(The Deputy), she's asked me for input, she's allowed to
participate in some of the preparation and everything, she's asked
me my opinion and it's been an enjoyable experience.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time, Sahadi has been in the spotlight for
breaking down walls separating the sexes in the horse racing
community. In 1996, she became the first woman to win a Breeder's
Cup race _ and a $1 million race _ when Lit de Justice won the
Breeder's Cup Sprint at Woodbine.
</P>
<P>
   She followed that up with a win in the same race in 1997 at
Hollywood Park with Elmhurst. The list of Sahadi's training
accomplishments goes even further.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi's won stakes at Santa Anita, Oak Tree, Del Mar, Hollywood
Park and Turf Paradise. In 1996, her earnings of more than $3.4
million ranked her 12th nationally and is the national record for
money won by a female trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Although she didn't begin training until 1993, Sahadi isn't new
to the game. Her parents, Fred and Helen Sahadi owned Cardiff Stud
Farm and Sahadi's been around thoroughbreds all her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My high school graduation present was a race horse,'' Sahadi
said. ``Cutting Line. He broke his maiden and probably raced a few
times after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi graduated from USC with a degree in journalism and after
that went to work at Hollywood Park in both the publicity and
marketing departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the trackwas owned by Marge Everett. I got a
great background working for her and she and I got along real
well,'' Sahadi said. ``Under other circumstances things might not
have been so good. But she was pro-woman. I couldn't have asked for
a better opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven years at Hollywood park, Sahadi went to work as an
assistant trainer to Julio Canani between 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In her work on the backside, Sahadi gained a reputation for
caring about the horses she took care of. It's a reputation she
maintains to this day. While some in the gritty racing business may
look upon that as a weakness, plenty of others admire that quality
in Sahadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this about the women that I've ridden for,'' said
McCarron. ``They tend to be more conscientious. More like an animal
lover than the average male trainer. They really love their horses
and treat them like family.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a jockey's standpoint, when it comes to Janine,''
McCarron said, ``I think that's a great quality.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Sahadi, who can be found at the track most mornings before
dawn, clad in her trademark sweatshirt and John Lennon sunglasses,
is proud of her pro-horse stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses need to be the priority,'' she said. ``They are not
here to be just exploited. Fortunately, the people I train for
understand how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That kinder, gentler treatment of the animals is a large part of
Sahadi's training philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to be a rocket scientist to do this,'' she
said. ``I treat my horses like pets. After that it's all a little
bit of luck and a little bit of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feed him right and train him right, you are going to be
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, despite her success on the track and her attitude
toward the hores in the stable, Sahadi has a difficult time
maintaining a full barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would venture to say that if a man was in the same position
as me he would have a lot of clients,'' Sahadi said. ``But, I
haven't been inundated with clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all that is about to change, but for now Sahadi's got to
get The Deputy ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something to do,'' she says, walking away. &QL;

   THE REPUBLICANS: ADVOCATE PULLS OUT
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly, the Texas financier and supporter of Gov. George W.
Bush, says he has learned his lesson and is retreating from
presidential politics. During the primary season, Wyly sponsored a
hard-hitting _ and widely criticized _ advertising attack on Sen.
John McCain's environmental record. More recently, Wyly called Vice
President Al Gore a regulation-happy environmentalist and mused
about cranking up an anti-Gore advertising campaign. But Tuesday,
speaking to an environmental group in Seattle, Wyly said that he
actually admired Gore, especially since reading his book on the
environment. Then he added: ``I learned from it. Many of you are
aware of my recent foray into presidential politics. It is to be my
last.''
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS: GORE AND BUSH TIED
</P>
<P>
   Two new polls indicate that the 2000 presidential race is still
a tossup. An ABC News/Washington Post survey of 1,083 voters, has
Gov. George W. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore by 47 percent to
45 percent, while a CNN/USA Today/Gallup survey of 998 voters has
Gore leading Bush 45 percent to 44 percent. Both polls were
conducted March 30-April 2 and have a margin of error of plus or
minus three percentage points. The ABC News/Washington Post poll
confirmed the judgment of both candidates that improving education
is among the foremost concerns of voters _ 76 percent called it
``very important.'' Asked which candidate would best carry out that
task, 48 percent of the respondents said Gore, compared with 39
percent for Bush. Some earlier polls indicated that voters believed
that the candidates could handle the job about equally well.

   THE SENATE: RHODE ISLAND DEMOCRATS PICK
</P>
<P>
   Party endorsements matter less than they once did in Rhode
Island, given that parties now have less cash and patronage to
spread around. Still, it was a slap to Representative Robert A.
Weygand when the state Democratic Party voted Monday to give its
endorsement for senator to Weygand's opponent, Richard Licht, a
former lieutenant governor. Licht has been trailing Weygand in
polls in the race for the party's nomination and the chance to take
on the Republican incumbent, Sen. Lincoln Chafee, who took over the
seat last year when his father, John H. Chafee, died. Licht last
held a state office 12 years ago. But party stalwarts, urged Monday
by the powerful speaker of the Rhode Island House, John B. Harwood,
voted 111-65 to support Licht over Weygand, now in his second term
in Congress.

to visit with Gore at a desert reception.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was sound. There was fury. But what stock
market investors wanted to know after Tuesday's frightening bungee
jump in share prices was, what does it signify?
</P>
<P>
   Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in stock
market history, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index had
plunged 574.57 points from its close the day before, shearing 13.6
percent off its value. Had it ended there, it would have been the
worst one-day decline in Nasdaq history. But a flood of buying
rescued the index, propelling it up almost 500 points, to close
with a loss of only 1.77 percent on the day. In a single trading
session, the index moved an extraordinary 1,074 points.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nasdaq plummeted, the more established gauges fell
alongside it. About 1:15 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average had
fallen 4.5 percent and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost
5.9 percent. But these gauges bounced back as well, with the Dow
closing the day down 0.51 percent and the S &AMP; P 500 ending with a
loss of 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the markets recovered by the end of the day, traders
and investors were shellshocked by the extraordinary moves. Ten-
and 15-point trading ranges were commonplace among even established
companies like American Express, Intel, General Electric and Cisco
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The selling seemed to represent the first serious threat to the
all-technology, all-the-time stock market investors have come to
love. Technology stocks have dominated investors' psyches in recent
years and have been responsible for titanic gains among those
buyers willing to suspend their disbelief about what the future may
hold for these companies. As a result, investors bid up the prices
of both untested companies with no sign of profits and established
companies with enviable earnings growth to levels that were never
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks are trading on psychology, and ultimately markets
are efficient,'' said Edward Kerschner, chief market strategist at
PaineWebber. ``Our view is that part of the excesses have been
corrected, but not all of them.'' Kerschner thinks that the 20 most
popular technology stocks with no earnings, like Amazon.com and
Juniper Networks, have to go down another 40 percent before they
can begin to be considered for purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Many strategists think Tuesday's mood shift among investors has
staying power. ``Panic is setting in among people who have big
gains,'' said David Eidelman, money manager with Eidelman, Finger &AMP;
Harris in St. Louis. ``At first, when stocks go down, you have
complacency among investors. Then people start to wonder, `Can I
lose everything I've made?' In a lot of these stocks'' with high
price-to-earnings ratios, ``you don't really have a comfortable
feeling for where the bottom is.''
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval in the market on Tuesday acted to level out some of
the peaks and valleys seen in the main market gauges this year. The
Nasdaq, which had been up 28 percent at its March 10 peak, is now
up 1.96 percent on the year after closing Tuesday at 4,148.89, down
74.79 points. The Dow , which had lost 14.8 percent in early March,
is now down only 2.89 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said that Tuesday's selloff accelerated when calls for
additional money went out from brokerage firms to their customers
who had borrowed to buy shares. For the investors whose shares
declined precipitously Monday, those margin calls went out on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One employee at a large online brokerage firm who declined to be
identified said the firm made a record number of margin calls on
Tuesday, four times what is typical. Almost none of the customers
put up the additional money, this person said, and were therefore
forced to sell some or all of their holdings. This accelerated the
declines in already weak stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking cover from the carnage in stocks, investors fled to the
traditional safe haven of U.S. Treasury bonds. Yields on the
30-year Treasury bond dropped to 5.65 percent from Monday's close
of 5.81 percent. The Treasury bond ended the day at a yield of 5.77
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers were scarce until the turnaround, which came before 2
p.m. Even so, the feeling among traders was more that the selling
had subsided than that huge buyers had stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two trading days, the Nasdaq composite has lost 9.3
percent. It remains up 1.96 percent on the year, but is down 17.8
percent from its March 10 peak. Volume was heavy. More than 1.5
billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the
biggest day ever. It was also the busiest day on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   While the rout in the Nasdaq got started early in the day, the
Dow and S &AMP; P held up until late morning. Then, traders said, large
investors began to experience trouble getting out of their Nasdaq
shares and started selling the stocks they could. This meant many
of the big NYSE stocks that make up the Dow and the S &AMP; P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions we deal with are extremely calm, but they're
frustrated because there is a ton of volume, but no natural
liquidity,'' said Bill Schneider, head position trader at Warburg
Dillon Read. ``To some extent we have seen some buyers. But buyers
who have bought the dip are a little more cautious this time
particularly in Nasdaq.'' One of the reasons for the lack of
liquidity in Nasdaq stocks is that the traders acting as market
makers in these shares are only required to buy or sell 100 shares
at their specified price. In the 1980s, market makers had to buy or
sell 1,000 shares at their quoted prices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, traders said that many dealers on Tuesday bought
100 shares from a customer, as they were obligated to do, and then
posted their next price so far below the prevailing market that few
investors would be interested in taking the other side of a trade.
This essentially guaranteed that they would not be stuck buying
shares in a falling stock. Traders also said that the differences
between what dealers were willing to pay for a stock and what they
were willing to sell it for _ called the spread _ widened
significantly as the Nasdaq plummeted, driving away all but the
most desperate investors.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday's gyrations in the Nasdaq were recordbreaking,
they are a continuation of extreme swings seen in that market for
months. ``In January and February, 70 percent of the trading days
qualified as high volatility moves of 1 percent or more, day to
day,'' said Steven Leuthold of Leuthold Weeden Research in
Minneapolis. ``In March we probably kicked this up to 75 percent of
trading days, the highest we've seen in the history of the Nasdaq
index.'' As for the broader market averages that have been around
longer, volatility is higher than it has been since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Leuthold said that in addition to being unprecedented, the
swings are scary. ``High volatility normally indicates a market in
transition,'' he said. ``I wouldn't be surprised if that is the
message we're getting right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the increasingly volatile Nasdaq is where many
investors have placed their bets. According to AMG Data Services,
over half of the $113 billion investors have put into mutual funds
this year has gone into those that specialize in technology stocks
and speculative growth shares. ``This is the most focused the flows
have ever been,'' said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data
Services. ``The point is technology and all bets are pressed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, technology stocks have become much more popular
among hedge funds, investment vehicles for wealthy individuals.
According to the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group, new capital
earmarked for technology funds this year is four times the capital
going into the average hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schwab, director of shareholder communications at Strong
Funds in Milwaukee, reported that investors who called into the
fund's headquarters were concerned but not panicked. Those who did
sell shares, exited technology funds and went into money market
funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One trader said that when Nasdaq had given up all of its gain
for the year on Tuesday, the selling seemed to increase, reflecting
the desire of investors to keep the market's rout from cutting into
1999 gains. Further selling pressure in Nasdaq stocks likely came
from executives of newly-public companies eager to nail down some
of their gains before they evaporate altogether. Because these
executives typically agree to hold off from selling their shares
for months after an initial public offering, selling pressure does
not emerge for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many of these so-called lockup periods are
expiring and stock is coming onto the market. Indeed, according to
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., a research firm in New York, in the
past two weeks, stocks with upcoming lockup expirations are down
over 24 percent, almost three times the overall Nasdaq's decline.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Tuesday's decline, some strategists said, is
that it could ease some of the Federal Reserve Board's worries
about increasing demand for goods driven by an overheated stock
market. ``We think this decline in the stock market, if it
persists, could change the Fed's thought process radically,'' said
Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. ``The
plunge today is serious enough that any thought of wealth driving
the economy is going to be tempered at a minimum, and unless
there's a reversal right away, the Fed is more inclined to be more
mild with their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at The Wharton School and
author of Stocks for the Long Run, argued that Tuesday's move was
healthy because it took some of the speculative fever out of Nasdaq
stocks. ``This should surprise no one,'' he said. ``There's no way
you can make these valuations reasonable. When you have that sort
of market, when it finally falls you get tremendous gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors who have watched the technology craze from the
sidelines see a return to sanity among investors. ``We sense some
sort of balance may be coming back into the market,'' said Anthony
M. Maramarco, portfolio manager for the Babson Value Fund in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Gradually people will come to their senses and
realize that there's more out there than just technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is fundamentally strong,'' Siegel said. ``But I
think there's going to be a lot of unfulfilled hopes and
expectations among people who thought they were entering the new
world and are now finding it's a pretty harsh reality.''

A FEW WORDS IN PRAISE OF THE UNEXCEPTIONAL SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for EDUCATION-PARTY)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the best science teacher I ever had was one who didn't
believe in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Newby, who taught seventh- and eighth-grade math and
science, scorned the idea that humans are related to apes. He
recommended not Darwin but Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Since he did not know much about either math or science, he was
a pretty awful teacher by any conventional measure. Yet I remember
his classes vividly.
</P>
<P>
   In our desperation to figure out what we believed in, we
students reflected on the simian eyebrows of some grown-ups we
knew. We pondered why humans lacked useful things like tails.
</P>
<P>
   So in the end Mr. Newby taught science pretty well. Since moving
to New York a few months ago, and seeing firsthand the incredible
drive of parents to get their children into ``good'' schools, I've
been thinking of Mr. Newby again.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone through schools that most New Yorkers would regard
as terrible, I have a soft place in my heart for ``bad'' schools.
It's not exactly that I believe in bad schools, of course, and I'm
hypocritical enough to send my own children to a school with a
strong academic reputation. But I do think professional parents
often exaggerate the impact if their children do not get into the
most competitive preschool and then rigorous schools all the way.
</P>
<P>
   I went to grade school and high school in Yamhill, Ore., in a
rural area where far more children studied welding than French. And
the reason was not just that my high school French teacher did not
speak French.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the French class underscored the school's flexibility.
The teacher spoke beautiful Spanish, having been a Mormon
missionary in Mexico, and when a few of us expressed interest in
French, he agreed to teach himself and stay one lesson ahead of us.
</P>
<P>
   The main lesson that I derive today from that French class is
that the most important credential for a teacher is often not a
degree or even knowledge, but enthusiasm. As Yeats said,
``Education is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire.'' (Alas,
this injunction is taken literally by some youthful pyromaniacs.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, enthusiastic teachers may be harder to find anywhere
these days, and the bad schools that I'm praising are not the huge,
overcrowded ones with metal detectors, chaotic classes and teachers
who burn out within a few years. I'm fonder of bad small schools
than bad big ones. But I do think that an enjoyable school is just
about the best one, and that many parents worry more than they need
about their own children's school (partly because any parent who
frets so much is going to be a good influence from home).
</P>
<P>
   Small bad schools offer several advantages. One is the chance to
take part in extracurricular activities that a kid is awful at; in
high school I was pressed into service as a distance runner,
despite a lack of any ability, and running ultimately became an
important part of my life.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is diversity. Of course, good schools try to
achieve some kind of racial or ethnic diversity, but invariably one
kind of student is hugely underrepresented: the dumb one. And it is
useful to be exposed to nonacademic types who do not believe in
fractions and are disgusted by the Diet of Worms.
</P>
<P>
   In my sophomore year of high school, we boys judged ourselves
largely on our ability to make straight welds in vocational
agriculture class. School had generally been easy for me, so it was
mortifying _ but also painfully edifying _ to discover that I was a
terrible welder.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are obsessive about good schools partly because it is
getting harder to enter good colleges. But one reason is that
Harvard now admits more graduates of ``bad schools'' and fewer from
Andover and Exeter than it did a generation ago. And the Internet
reduces the academic price that students pay for going to less
rigorous schools.
</P>
<P>
   The virtues of (particularly) public schools have been on my
mind because Betty Krier, my high school social studies teacher,
died last month, and the whole community turned out to mourn her.
In three decades as a teacher in Yamhill, she had shaped the
community in important ways, and everybody recognized that she was
a great teacher _ even if she never had the degrees or expertise
that would have enabled her to get hired by a good New York school.
What she offered was warmth and enthusiasm, and that made all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   A small, nonacademic school is unlikely to offer calculus, an
excellent library or advanced placement classes. But what most
people regard as a second-rate school may compensate in other ways.
It may open minds by introducing a parallel universe in which
welding skills are paramount. It may force debate about evolution
or a search for the monkey in all of us. And it may jump-start
students along life's roads with the passion of a teacher like
Krier. (af)

 &HT;    Proposal would disclose political groups' backers
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett is taking aim at an
exploding number of mystery groups using a provision in the federal
tax code that can help them propel political candidates into office
with no disclosure about the groups' makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat from Austin, Texas, wants to force groups such as
Republicans for Clean Air, which ran ads attacking Sen. John McCain
days before the March 7 Super Tuesday primaries, to disclose the
names of the people who control the group, people who receive
payments of more than $200, and donors who contribute at least $200
in a reporting period. Failure to disclose the information to the
Federal Election Commission could cost the groups $100 a day and as
much as $50,000, under the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas businessman Sam Wyly, a friend of Gov. George W. Bush,
formed such a group, which then launched a $2.5 million ad campaign
slamming McCain's environmental record in three critical states
days before the heated May 7 primaries. Wyly's role was revealed by
the media.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly formed his group under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue
Code written more than a quarter century ago. Such groups do not
have to tell the IRS or the FEC that they exist, and there are no
limits on how much they can take in or spend. They can run ads
touting positions on issues but are prohibited from expressly
calling for the election or defeat of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 527 is not a bird or a plane, but it is rapidly becoming
Superman, the political superweapon of choice in this year's
elections,'' Doggett said. ``Operating as a clandestine political
committee, a 527 can secretly accept unlimited amounts of money
from unidentified contributors to fill the airwaves with hate and
the mailboxes with disinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Doggett called on Republicans and Bush to support his effort.
``To those Republicans who have so steadfastly fought campaign
finance reform by urging the alternative of full and immediate
disclosure, now is the time to put up or shut up,'' he said. ``I
have written every one of my Republican colleagues to invite them,
in the reform spirit of John McCain, to join in cleaning up this
mess and stopping these covert operations now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign posts contributors on the Internet, and Bush
has called for near-instant disclosure as one way to help reform
the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes groups should let the sun shine in and
fully disclose who is funding their ads,'' campaign spokesman Scott
McClellan said. ``But he recognizes that the Supreme Court has
repeatedly held that organizations such as the NAACP or Sierra Club
cannot be forced to disclose their donors or members.''
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 groups cover the spectrum of tactics and ideology.
The Sierra Club set one up in 1996, and Scott Reed, former Sen. Bob
Dole's 1996 presidential campaign manager, established one to help
win Hispanic voters to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The 527s often ``aren't really organizations in the conventional
sense,'' said Frances R. Hill, a University of Miami law professor.
``It can just really be a checking account.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Doggett's bill places no limits on how much the
nonprofits can spend, Hill said, it shines light on the groups
without gagging citizens who want to express their views on issues.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has 153 co-sponsors, all Democrats. Hill discussed the
issue with Doggett as he prepared the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's mounting evidence that the new 527s are in place
primarily to preserve the anonymity of the sources of funds, the
very thing that voters seem to have some interest in knowing,''
Hill said. ``Some may not care what the source of funds might be.
Others will.''

ABC NEWS RETHINKING INTERVIEW DICAPRIO HAD WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG and BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC News executives are rethinking a decision to show an
interview of President Clinton conducted by the screen star
Leonardo DiCaprio amid internal debate over whether it is
appropriate for the news division to use an interview conducted by
a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, a representative for DiCaprio and executives at
ABC News each offered differing versions of events that led up to
DiCaprio's interview of the president on Friday on the patio
abutting the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Segments from the 20-minute interview were to be shown during an
ABC News special, ``Planet Earth 2000,'' on global warming, which
is scheduled for broadcast later this month in connection with the
30th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22. DiCaprio is chairman of
the Earth Day 2000 celebration committee.
</P>
<P>
   No one involved with the interview disputed that plans had been
discussed for weeks concerning some sort of videotaped talk about
the environment between DiCaprio and Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC News president, David Westin, said in an e-mail to his
staff members, many of whom were irate over the interview, that on
Friday he had been told that ``Mr. DiCaprio was visiting the White
House (at the request of the White House).''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was his understanding that DiCaprio would ``be
doing a walk-through taking a look at some of the things the White
House has done internally with an environmental slant (things like
recycling its trash and insulating)'' and that the president might
appear during that walk-through.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, when the crew and DiCaprio arrived at the White
House on Friday, they were told that the president wanted to be
interviewed by DiCaprio. ``We did not send him to interview the
president,'' Westin wrote. ``No one is that stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that a formal interview did take place, he wrote,
the interview might not be broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing a copy of that e-mail Tuesday, a White House
spokesman, Jake Siewert, said it was ``rife with inaccuracies'' and
maintained it was ABC that requested the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the time and the schedule, we made it clear that we
would actually do a sit-down interview instead, and that was
perfectly clear, and they came prepared to ask questions,'' Siewert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Sunshine, a spokesman for DiCaprio, said the actor was fully
prepared for an interview, regardless of whether it happened during
the walk-through or as a sit-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was well prepared to engage in a serious discussion with
the president about the issue of global warming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine said that DiCaprio approached ABC News executives about
a special on the environment earlier in the winter and that the
host of the special, Chris Cuomo, a ``20/20'' correspondent and son
of the former New York governor, acted as a contact between
DiCaprio and the news division.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio's representatives originally pitched the idea for an
Earth Day special to NBC Entertainment a year and a half ago,
executives at NBC said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News executives said that they agreed to work with DiCaprio
because he is a popular face for the younger generation of viewers
that every network news division has had a difficult time reaching.
They also said they were already discussing some sort of Earth Day
special.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the differing versions of how the interview took
place, an ABC News spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy said, ``I think we're
just going to have to disagree on it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said everybody in the Washington bureau initially ``was
outraged'' about the interview, but that they have since calmed
down.
</P>
<P>
   One offended ABC News producer summed up his feelings this way:
``There is a line that has been crossed often in the past couple of
years between entertainment and news. The line has been pushed and
pushed, and I think this pushes it way too far, beyond where it's
been before.''

SEATTLE POLICE ADMIT FAILURE ON '99 PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Referring to protesters as a ``well-trained and
equipped adversary,'' Seattle police officials issued a report
Tuesday blaming inadequate financing and lack of preparation for
the violence that marked the World Trade Organization's meeting
here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it admitted its own organizational failures in preparing
for the protests, which led to the resignation of the police chief,
the report angered many protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening to think that members of the general public,
nonviolent protesters and people of conscience are being viewed as
adversaries by the Seattle police,'' said Juliette Beck, an
organizer with Global Exchange, a human rights organization in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The police used tear gas and rubber pellets to contain
protesters estimated at up to 45,000 in a march on Nov. 30 that
ended in Seattle's downtown, blocks from where trade delegates were
scheduled to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Many Seattle residents were angered that the police had used
such tactics on peaceful protesters while a much smaller group of
vandals, a few blocks away, went virtually unchecked as they
smashed windows, ransacked stores and caused more than $17 million
in damage.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 500 people were arrested during four days of
protests, but city prosecutors have since dropped most of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The police report issued Tuesday said the city did not spend
enough money to prepare, in part because city officials had
underestimated the determination of many protesters to stop
delegates from attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``SPD commanders put their faith in historical precedent, the
Seattle tradition of peaceful protest, in assessing the needs for
policing the WTO event,'' the report said. It added that the
department was ``taught a hard lesson'' by protesters who used the
Internet, cell phones and walkie-talkies to marshal demonstrators.

KINGS LOSE SMOLINSKI FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Doctors confirmed Tuesday what the Kings
feared when Bryan Smolinski's right knee buckled in the final
moments of Monday's loss at Phoenix. His season is over.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how does a team already lacking in offensive
depth compensate for the loss of its second-line center with the
playoffs set to open in just over a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am there if they need me,'' said Ian Laperriere, the
third-line center who will be moved to the second unit. ``At this
point in the season you do whatever it takes. We are not going to
fold up and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a team missing Ziggy Palffy (sprained right shoulder)
and Nelson Emerson (broken left index finger) from the top two
lines, news that an MRI revealed a torn medial collateral ligament
in Smolinski's right knee doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jason Blake, who washed out in a brief appearance on the
first line earlier this season, will remain a winger on the fourth
line. Blake is quicker than Smolinski and has shown some good
chemistry with Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake has five goals and 23 points. Even though Smolinski's
scoring was down in the second half, he had 20 goals and 56 points,
tied with captain Rob Blake for fourth on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The injury comes at a time the Kings playoff seeding still is in
doubt. Right now they are fifth with 89 points and face the
unenviable task of playing Detroit in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But they are just two points ahead of No6 Phoenix, which has one
more victory and four wins in six meetings head to head. If the
Kings can pass the Coyotes, they probably will play Colorado in
their playoff opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we play as well as we sound,'' said coach Andy Murray,
who held individual meetings Tuesday with each of his players.
``They talked about all we've been through with injuries earlier in
the season and how we came through. They expect to come through
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, who will not require surgery, was injured with 16
seconds remaining in the Kings' 2-1 loss that clinched a playoff
spot for Phoenix. Coyotes forward Travis Green fell and landed on
the outside of Smolinski's right leg.
</P>
<P>
   The team flew here after the game, but did not work out Tuesday
in preparation for tonight's game against the Vancouver Canucks.
Smolinski returned to Los Angeles on Tuesday morning and underwent
the MRI. &QL;

 &HT;    ELIAN TALKS BOG DOWN - AGAIN; PROTESTERS VOW TO KEEP HIM IN U.S.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The city swirled with rumors and uncertainty Tuesday as
negotiators failed to reach agreement over the fate of 6-year-old
Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez and once again postponed their talks.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors briefly toppled police barriers outside the home
where the boy has been living with his Miami relatives, and one of
Elian's chief caregivers, his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez,
collapsed in emotional exhaustion and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boy's father was issued a travel visa in Cuba but
continued to say he would not come to the United States without a
guarantee he would be given custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's Washington D.C.
attorney, Gregory Craig, reportedly flew to Havana to try to smooth
out arrangements for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   But a conclusion to the long-running saga remained elusive, as
both sides refused to budge on demands that complicated the
transfer of the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Miami relatives who want to keep Elian in this
country said they do not want to turn the boy over to his father
until he is examined by a panel of psychologists who would
determine what is best for Elian. They also want a promise that the
boy won't be returned to Cuba until their appeal of a court ruling
can be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials refused to grant those conditions, however,
insisting they have the authority to turn the boy over to his
father once he arrives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the government continues to be on how best to
accomplish the reunion of Elian with his father,'' said Robert
Wallis, head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's
Miami office.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis and attorneys for the Miami relatives agreed to take a
one-day break Wednesday and resume their talks Thursday morning.
They have failed to reach agreement despite four full days of
negotiations stretching over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The possible visit by Elian's father seemed to be the spur that
might break the deadlock, although the visit was still up in the
air late Tuesday. The Cuban government has said that Gonzalez would
live in the home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area during
the visit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wanting a guarantee that Gonzalez will be given
custody of his son, Cuban officials want travel visas for 22 other
people, including Elian's classmates and a team of psychologists,
as well as Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials in Havana issued visas Tuesday for
Gonzalez, his second wife, their infant son, Elian's teacher and a
pediatrician, they said applications for the other visas would be
handled on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Cuban officials would allow Gonzalez to
come without assurances that the other visas would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's ordeal began Thanksgiving Day, when he was found
floating in an inner tube off the Fort Lauderdale coast. His mother
and 10 other people drowned when the boat they were using to flee
Cuba sank.
</P>
<P>
   In January, federal officials ruled the boy must go back to his
father in Cuba, but Elian's Miami relatives challenged the decision
in a federal lawsuit. A Miami federal judge ruled against them in
late March, but they immediately appealed to the 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta, which has set oral arguments in the case for
May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the stalemate over the boy's fate are the intense
emotions surrounding the case among Miami's Cuban exiles. Hundreds
of protesters snarled traffic and briefly blocked the entrance to
Miami's bustling seaport in January after the initial federal
decision to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a small but determined group of protesters has kept
a nearly constant vigil outside Elian's Little Havana home, the
crowd swelling at times to hundreds. They have vowed to lay down
their lives to keep Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a group of about 60 demonstrators knocked aside
police barricades after they heard a rumor that federal officials
might be coming for the boy. They locked arms in front of a fence
surrounding the modest home, chanting, singing and praying.
</P>
<P>
   Police stood aside, saying they would allow the protestors to
vent their emotions. Calm returned after about an hour as the
barricades were re-erected and the protestors slowly moved away
from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up marked a day that began with Marisleysis Gonzalez
giving several interviews with the network morning shows, begging
the American public to understand the family's heartbreak over the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they care about is pieces of paper and a signature,'' she
told NBC's ``Today'' show, referring to federal immigration
officials. ``I don't see anybody caring about this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also said she was convinced Elian would be taken away
from his father and brainwashed if he is returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After several more interviews, she collapsed in a dizzy spell,
then was taken to Coral Gables Hospital by paramedics. She was
expected to remain hospitalized overnight. She has been
hospitalized one time previously during the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Lazaro Gonzalez, visited her and then made a brief
statement to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the government expects,'' he said. ``All
we're doing is protecting the child. The government is destroying
this family.''

 &HT;    Favoritism seen in Fulton's waste water bids
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fulton County Commission is expected today to award a nearly
$40 million long-term contract to a firm that will operate and
maintain its three Northside waste water facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the industry's biggest players are in the running for
the high-profile job, which has generated fierce competition and
behind-the-scenes grumbling by the firms.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton administrators have recommended the 10-year contract be
awarded to Operations Management International Inc., a subsidiary
of the Denver-based consulting and engineering corporation CH2M
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials with the other companies _ U.S. Filter
Operating Services Inc., United Water Services and Azurix _ are
complaining privately about the selection process. They want it
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The four vendors are bidding to run the north Fulton portion of
the system, which includes operation and maintenance of the Big
Creek, Little River and Johns Creek plants and 29 pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
   The county evaluated the firms based on their technical
expertise and cost. United Water had the lowest cost during the
10-year period. U.S. Filter had the highest technical score.
</P>
<P>
   The Fulton contract has been held through a series of short-term
contracts since 1992 by United Water, the same company that
operates Atlanta's drinking water system.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to keep the contract, but it has been under
fire for a series of spills. The most recent occurred last month,
when about 600,000 gallons of partially treated sewage spewed into
the Chattahoochee River from the Big Creek plant. State
environmental officials have fined the county $433,500 for the
spills.
</P>
<P>
   United Water officials argue that their overall record of
service, despite the most recent incident, has been exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a 99.5 compliance rate in running the facilities,''
said United Water Vice President Mark Halleman.
</P>
<P>
   Though United Water submitted the lowest cost, OMI was ranked
the highest based on cost. In their analysis, Fulton administrators
essentially concluded United Water had low-balled its bid and would
be unable to provide the service at the price it stated based on
current expenses.
</P>
<P>
   As the front-runner for the work, OMI, which manages the waste
water systems in Rockdale and Forsyth counties, has been the target
of behind-the-scenes sniping by some of its competitors. They have
questioned several aspects of the selection process, but none of
them will talk about it on the record for fear of losing future
county work.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints center largely around cost and why OMI ranked
higher than United Water although United Water's bid was lower.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism also was leveled at the county for demanding bidders
to submit a best and final offer, then throwing the offers out
after receiving them.
</P>
<P>
   The move raised suspicion among some vendors that county
staffers favored one firm over the others and didn't want to
require the favored firm to meet the rock-bottom price offered by
the other vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton Public Works director Terry Todd said the offers were
thrown out because of an unfounded suspicion that vendors may have
found out what their competitors were offering.
</P>
<P>
   OMI faced similar charges of favoritism when bidding for the
Atlanta job in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Groselle, an OMI regional vice president, said, ``This is
a very competitive industry. There is always a loser that's never
satisfied with the outcome.''

MICROSOFT COULD FACE WAVE OF LAWSUITS AFTER ANTITRUST RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert new 4th graf and 3 new grafs at start of 2nd take.
Adds 3 grafs at end.)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of a federal judge's harsh antitrust ruling,
Microsoft Corp. now faces the threat of a rising wave of consumer
class-action cases and other private lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   With Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson having ruled Monday that
Microsoft is a ``predatory'' monopolist that repeatedly violated
antitrust laws, private plaintiffs have a far less daunting
challenge in suits already filed _ and in actions being considered
by companies that believe they have suffered from abuse of
Microsoft's market power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now an awfully big invitation to plaintiffs'
lawyers,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia
University law school. ``We may have reached a point for Microsoft,
as there was in the tobacco cases, that basic attitudes have
shifted, and a powerful defendant is no longer seen as
invulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Microsoft's leading rivals, and even its biggest
customers, could bring private suits, according to legal experts.
But they will almost surely hold off, at least until they see what
sanctions the courts approve against Microsoft _ sanctions that
could, among other things, limit its ability to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson's judgment was not surprising, after his findings
of fact in Jackson's judgment was not surprising, after his
findings of fact in November sided with the version of the case
presented in court by the Justice Department and 19 states. But
this week's ruling was a crucial step because it means that many of
his findings _ that Microsoft is a monopoly, for example _ may be
accepted as proof by other courts in private suits.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies that could now step forward as plaintiffs sent
witnesses to Jackson's courthouse to testify on behalf of the
government, including Netscape, America Online, Sun Microsystems,
Apple and IBM. In his ruling, Jackson cited all those companies as
having suffered from Microsoft's ``oppressive thumb on the scale of
competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled, for example, that the company used its market
power to defend its monopoly in operating systems, but that it also
illegally tried to monopolize the market for Internet browsing
software. The principal victim of that tactic was Netscape
Communications Corp., the pioneer in the browser market, which was
acquired by America Online in late 1998. That judgment makes it far
easier for America Online to sue for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Because the judge ruled that Microsoft's monopoly power allows
it to overcharge for Windows, the big personal computer makers
including Dell, Compaq, Gateway and IBM could have cause to file
suit. If they won, such judgments could yield hundreds of millions
of dollars each for big PC makers using Windows. The treble damages
in private antitrust cases would cover every PC a company sold over
four years, the statute of limitations in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft could find itself in a very tight pincer here, since
these companies could regard it as being in their fiduciary
interest to file private suits,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a
professor at the University of Iowa law school.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, lawyers say, is probably the most likely to
file a private suit against Microsoft. It is a bitter head-to-head
competitor of Microsoft and has little to lose. For all the others,
the calculation would be more complicated because they rely in one
way or another on Microsoft's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies named in Jackson's ruling declined to
comment Tuesday on the possibility of private antitrust suits
against Microsoft. Still, an executive at one of the companies
said, ``It is clearly something we will consider, but there has
been no substantive internal discussion of that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the companies may decide against suing Microsoft for other
reasons. First, parts of Jackson's legal conclusions _ though not
his findings of fact _ could be reversed on appeal. And second, the
companies may not see it as in their long-term interest to bring
suit against Microsoft, even if they do not fear retaliation from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks, which makes software for playing multimedia
programming on personal computers, was mentioned by Jackson as
among the targets of Microsoft's tactics. Yet Rob Glaser, chairman
of RealNetworks, said Tuesday that he had no plans to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think Microsoft has behaved unethically at times and
this judge found that it broke the law, my focus is going to be on
doing everything I can to make sure RealNetworks remains ahead of
Microsoft in our business,'' Glaser said. ``The government was
absolutely right to prosecute Microsoft. But it doesn't make sense
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But companies are not the only potential litigants. More than
100 class-action suits have already been filed against Microsoft in
two dozen states, nearly all of them in the aftermath of Jackson's
powerfully worded findings of fact last November. Those suits,
legal experts say, were the early starters as plaintiffs' lawyers
jockeyed for leadership positions in what will likely become a
broader class-action assault on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   More consumer class-action suits are expected, and lawyers
involved in the early cases said that Jackson's rule was a
significant victory in their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the way the government case came
out,'' said Leonard B. Simon, a partner at Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &AMP; Lerach in San Diego, whose firm has brought many prominent
class-action cases. ``This is very good news for the consumer
class-action cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the ruling in the government case makes things easier
for private antitrust plaintiffs, it by no means insures that they
will win in court. The consumer class-action suits mainly contend
that Microsoft, as a monopoly, was able to overcharge for its
industry-standard Windows operating system, which run the basic
operations of nearly 90 percent of all personal computers sold
today.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled that Microsoft had the ability to ``price
substantially above the competitive level.'' And in his November
findings, he noted an internal Microsoft pricing study that said
the company could have charged $49 for a retail upgrade from
Windows 95 to Windows 98 but that the company chose to charge $89
instead because it was the ``revenue-maximizing price.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the numbers cited in the study were
arbitrary numbers, and that it could have also charged far more for
the Windows upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In the class-action confrontation, Microsoft says it has the
money and the patience to withstand what it regards as an
opportunistic assault on a deep-pocketed corporate target. In
addition, the company's executives express confidence in their
legal position.
</P>
<P>
   ``These class-action cases are just piling on,'' Bill Gates, the
Microsoft chairman, said in an interview over the weekend. ``There
is no economic theory to show that ours was not the aggressive
price for Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Jackson's ruling places Microsoft's liability
firmly into the legal record, the class-action suits must still
prove damages _ that is, what impact Microsoft's abuse of its
market power had on consumers. And even the class-action advocates
recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling in the government case simplifies our job, but it
does not make it easy,'' said Terry Gross, a lawyer in San
Francisco. ``We're up against one of the most powerful defendants
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The private litigation promises to be a marathon effort. A group
of seven federal judges, called the Multi-District Litigation
Panel, held a hearing last week in Palm Springs, Calif., on where
to combine all the federal class-action suits. That initial
decision is expected soon. But it is only a starting point.

JAPANESE STOCK STRENGTH DEFIES BAD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's languid economy slid into another recession late
last year, companies are struggling to overhaul themselves, the
government's debts are piling up and the prime minister is comatose
with a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   None of that news seems to have fazed the Japanese stock market,
which has outperformed the U.S. market over the last year. On
Monday, even with word that the condition of Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi was grave, investors bid up share prices, and the benchmark
Nikkei index reached the highest level since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The market demonstrated its resilience again Tuesday, retreating
only modestly despite the political uncertainties. And much of that
weakness was attributed to the carryover effect of the Nasdaq stock
market's severe drop Monday in the United States. [At midday on
Wednesday, stocks were a little more than 1 percent lower. The yen
weakened against the dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese market's recent strength does not necessarily
signal a better future for this country's economy, the world's
second largest, which has been struggling for years to recover from
the bursting of the speculative bubble a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The forces that have been driving the market higher reflect some
trends that have not been seen before. A flood of new Japanese
mutual funds, for example, has reversed a prolonged contraction in
the industry. Mutual fund activity, in turn, has spurred buying by
momentum investors, who hope to profit by purchasing shares that
big investors are buying.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, people have been moving their money into stocks that
reflect a modest boom in information technology, telecommunications
and the Internet, at the expense of traditional Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   Their moves are intensified by a shortage of stocks in those
sectors; only 12 Japanese stocks are pure Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the feeling that the worst of the economic news is
behind us,'' said Ichizo Takeuchi, marketing director at the
Kokusai Asset Management Co., which supervisors 11 trillion yen in
assets, currently $105 billion. ``Investment in information
technology is growing,'' he said, ``and the structure of the
economy is changing.'' Takeuchi added that the market this year has
been driven by Japanese investors, rather than the foreigners who
piled in last year, and by more individual investors than in the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are among the world's great savers, so any
indication that they are beginning to risk some of that money in
the stock market, where many had been badly burned in the early
1990s, could represent a new source of demand for shares. ``Because
of the large pool of savings here,'' Takeuchi said, ``once
households begin to share risks in the capital markets, that will
in turn contribute greatly to improvement of the Japanese corporate
sector in which they are investing.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinion is not necessarily shared by other money managers
here. Some worry that individual Japanese investors may be stepping
back into the market just in time to be wiped out again, as was
their experience when the asset bubble burst. ``My sense is that
those hurt when the bubble popped are not part of this thing,''
said Craig Chudler of Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. ``But new
companies that are listing and seeing their shares bid up very,
very rapidly _ you hear the `bubble' word come out of their mouths.
They're dumbfounded by the rise in stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last few weeks, a bit of air has come out of the
market. While the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues is up 8.77
percent since the beginning of the year, the Topix index, a much
broader piece of the market, is off 0.9 percent after having been
up 2.3 percent less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Evans, strategist at HSBC Securities here, said: ``I asked
two of my analysts the other day to tell me how the market had
performed without looking at their numbers, and both of them said
it was up somewhere in the range of 15 percent. That's not the
case, but their perception is one that is widely shared by many
investors, who are enthusiastic about Japan and its future.''
</P>
<P>
   That is most apparent in the mutual fund industry. The funds,
known here as investment trusts _ having been net sellers of stocks
for much of the last decade _ have been piling into the market.
From the beginning of the year through the second week of March,
funds made net stock purchases of 671 billion yen. They were
exceeded only by foreign investors, who were net purchasers of 991
billion yen in stock, though most have been investing in Japan at a
much slower pace than last year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that mutual funds account for a large part
of recent investment in the equity market, since there are so many
new ones. The most prominent so far is Nomura Securities' Big
Project N, the largest Japanese fund ever. Its success in
attracting 1 trillion yen to the stock market, a good chunk of it
from Nomura's own bond funds, helped expedite the creation of other
stock funds. From mid-January through mid-March, 62 new stock funds
have been introduced, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund
research company.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not include three new funds announced a few weeks
ago by Fidelity Investments. ``We've seen a significant increase in
our business almost across the board,'' said Robert H. Auld, chief
investment officer at Fidelity Investments Japan. Like others, Auld
sees differences between the stock market and the economy.
``Certainly, Japan has stumbled about from a macroeconomic policy
point of view, and everyone knows that,'' he said. ``But a lot of
companies are starting to restructure their businesses and in ways
that are independent from what the government is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes it easier to distinguish winners from losers.
``There's a little more divergence in the fortunes of individual
companies,'' Auld said. ``Where historically all companies tended
to rise and fall with the overall movement of the tide, there are
now companies able to determine their own fortunes independent of
whether the tide is moving in or out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the funds are the momentum buyers, who seek to exploit
the links between the funds and the indices they use as benchmarks.
Trading volume exploded earlier this year after Nomura announced
Big Project N, and momentum investors rushed to buy shares ahead of
the fund, hoping to profit from its need to hold certain stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Among those must-have stocks are NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest
mobile telephone company and the first company anywhere to
commercialize Internet access over a phone, and Sony, which has
sought to convince investors, with some success, that it is
transforming itself from a consumer electronics manufacturer into
an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   As had been the case in the United States, the most tenuous
connection to the Internet has commanded a high premium in the
market. Thus, shares of the Itochu Techno-Science Corp., the
company that developed a wildly popular system for tapping the
Internet using a mobile phone, have risen 425 percent since they
were first floated in December on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   CJK , which sells and services imported information-processing
and telecommunications equipment, has risen more than 250 percent
since its shares were offered about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Meikyosha Co., a retailer that sells games, software
and electronics, is up more than 50 percent over its offering price
since it went public in February.
</P>
<P>
   The voracious appetite for these stocks and others like them,
combined with their limited availability, has created risks for
investors. Of the 70 companies with the biggest market
capitalizations, the seven largest funds devoted to investing in
the domestic market hold shares in only 27, and only three are not
related to technology or information services: the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi; Takeda Chemical Industries, a pharmaceuticals
company; and Seven-Eleven Japan, modestly higher because of its
plans to link its business to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he thinks that concentration is too heavy and has
probably hurt the funds' performance so far. Of the 10 stocks that
have risen the most this year, half are old-line electronics
companies, like Mitsubishi Electric and Sanyo Electric, or
pharmaceutical companies.

START-UP NEED HELP? HIRE DAD OR MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY ZIPKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago, 34-year-old Gregory P. Sullivan enlisted a
retired financial executive in Lancaster, N.H., to help him launch
an Internet company called Flagship Communications that specialized
in e-support and telemarketing services.
</P>
<P>
   The older man, a one-time division controller at James River
Corp. (now Fort James Corp.) in Deerfield, Ill., became Sullivan's
first employee and, overnight, his workplace confidant. He accepted
a board position and even traveled to Portland, Maine, and stayed
in his new boss' guest house while the two worked around the clock
on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your child comes to you and has a need, you go,'' said
Kevin Sullivan, 58, who is Gregory's father.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates isn't the only Internet entrepreneur to put his dad
on the payroll. (He appointed the elder Gates co-chairman of the
$21.8 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last year.) In the
dot-com world, peopled largely by 20-somethings and 30-whatevers,
an increasing number of chief executives are turning to their
fathers and mothers to tap into the one qualification the nerdiest
whiz kid lacks by definition: experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how common it is,'' said Bruce Tulgan, president
of Rainmaker Thinking, a New Haven, Conn., consulting firm.
``People come up to me at conferences all the time and say, `I'm
working for my child, or my dad is working for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Experts cite a variety of factors for the trend, starting with
the youthfulness of dot.com CEOs. One 1998 study by the Wells Fargo
Bank of San Francisco and the National Federation of Independent
Business in Washington, D.C., showed that people under 35 were
responsible for 42 percent of all business startups. Perhaps the
biggest motivator is an intangible: the desire to have older people
around with old-economy skills, sound judgment and an unquestioned
commitment to the boss' well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children tend to trust their parents more than they could
trust someone else,'' says Linda Dash, 52. Her son Darien, 28,
founder of DME Interactive Holdings, a New York company that
provides Internet access and customized content to minority
households, hired her last May as general manager to oversee
operations after it began trading publicly. ``I never in a million
years expected to be doing this,'' Dash said. As a self-described
``do-everything person,'' she said she became computer-literate on
the job. One of only two employees over 35, she dispenses motherly
advice to co-workers by stressing the importance of education.
``I'm having a ball,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While parents like Dash bring enthusiasm and energy to their new
jobs, others boast resumes that would make them a catch almost
anywhere. Martin Kogon, 59, who was hired to run a unit of his
son's dot-com business last year, holds an M.B.A. from Wharton and
owned four businesses over the past three and a half decades,
including National Dynamics, Management Ventures and Central Metals
Recycling, all based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over as president of Websiteforfree.com, a
division of Definition 6, a Web development and design company in
Atlanta that his son Michael, 30, started in his garage in 1997,
Kogon has helped assemble a board of directors and taken a key role
in contract negotiations. In early January he relinquished the
title to become Director of Special Projects of the entire company.
</P>
<P>
   His co-workers affectionately call him ``gray matter,'' a
reference to both his hair color and his experience, and seek his
advice about everything from reading a person's character to making
a home purchase. Kogon  &UR; pere &LR; , though, takes care to rein in his
opinions about the business. Otherwise, he said, his fellow
employees would take his comments to mean, ``Marty said to do it
that way, either because I'm older or have more knowledge or I'm
Michael's dad.''
</P>
<P>
   At most, his son Michael says, he might tell a mid-level
manager, ``If the vote were mine, this is what my suggestion would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Father and son have an informal strategy for resolving
disagreements. ``I say if you're not nice to me, I'll tell your
mother,'' jokes the elder Kogon. In response, he says, Michael
usually says: ``Be nice to me or I'll tell my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the jesting, reversing the traditional power
relationship in an office setting can be tricky.
``Misunderstandings arise when roles aren't clearly defined or when
parents are used to telling the child what to do,'' said Ross W.
Nager, Executive Director of the Arthur Anderson Center for Family
Business, Houston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialists issue even direr warnings. Paul Karofsky,
Executive Director of Northeastern University's Center for Family
Business in Boston, says he can guarantee that going into business
together won't strengthen the bonds between parent and child and
might weaken them. ``When there's stress in the business, stress in
the family comes to the fore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Sullivan, the retired executive who helped his son
launch Flagship Communications in Maine last year, found that out.
When he switched from reporting to his son's former partner to
answering directly to his son, he found himself wanting to march in
and issue reprimands. ``The most difficult thing was the role
reversal,'' he said. ``In the office, you're Kevin, not Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Sullivan said he, too, had his doubts. And so,
shortly after a joint venture in which Flagship Communications was
a partner was spun off last January, Kevin Sullivan jumped ship and
became a partner at the new company.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory Sullivan apparently couldn't get enough paternal
advice. Three weeks before his father left, he hired his
stepfather, Bob Gilbert, 64, to fill the newly created position of
Executive Vice President of Operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing it because I love Gregg,'' said Gilbert, who has 23
years of experience in selling and implementing fulfillment and
lead distribution systems. Another reason for choosing Flagship
Communications over several competing offers, he said, was that it
didn't require relocation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has no regrets. ``I've told the human-resources guy:
Get a mix of people in here,'' he said. If I'm having this much
fun, why shouldn't other people?''

U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE MAY TAKE ACTION AGAINST MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, said Tuesday that Mexico was failing to support
competition in telecommunications and warned that she might take
action against Mexico before the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, it appears that progress towards a level playing
field for telecommunications carriers is now stalled,'' Barshefsky
said, calling the situation ``extremely serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States will decide by July 28 whether to lodge a
formal grievance against Mexico with the WTO, the Geneva-based
group that makes the rules for global commerce. If the WTO were to
rule in favor of the United States, Mexico could face punitive
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The notice to Mexico was part of an annual U.S. review in which
Barshefsky also threatened to file WTO complaints against South
Africa because its telecommunications monopoly had refused to
provide high-volume private circuits to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom have pressed the trade representative to
take Mexico to the WTO, arguing that Telefonos de Mexico SA has
abused its advantages as a former monopoly to suppress competition
in the Mexican telecommunications industry. Telmex stopped
providing dedicated lines for Internet and business service to
competitors and charges high rates to complete long-distance calls
carried by other companies, the competitors said.
</P>
<P>
   Between them the two international telecommunications giants
have invested more than $2 billion in building new networks in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The trade representative also criticized Mexican regulators for
not bringing Telmex into line. On March 27, only days before the
U.S. report was due, the Mexican regulatory agency announced new
rules to force Telmex to bring down costs and provide services to
its competitors. But Barshefsky's report noted that ``Telmex has
frustrated similar efforts over the past two years.'' Telmex has
vowed to challenge the regulator's new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized Israel for imposing extra charges on
calls to the United States and Canada that it did not charge for
any other country. Israel has announced that it would cancel the
surcharges by Dec. 31, 2001. The trade representative said she
could go to the WTO if Israel did not eliminate the charge.

ICAHN OFFERS $5.2 BILLION FOR ALL OF NABISCO GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carl C. Icahn stopped nibbling around the edges of
Nabisco Group Holdings on Tuesday and made an offer to buy the
entire company _ A1 Steak Sauce, Planters peanuts, Oreo cookies and
all.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, the New York financier, said he would bid $16 a share, or
about $5.2 billion, for the holding company that owns as its only
possession about 80 percent of the Nabisco food company. Shares in
the holding company, which had been trading at about $9 before
Icahn sought to buy a 30 percent stake last week and force a sale,
closed Tuesday at $14.50, up $2.125. Icahn now owns about 9 percent
of Nabisco Group Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement came one day after the company's board rejected
an earlier offer from Icahn to buy an additional 30 percent of the
company for $13 a share. But in a concession to his demands, the
board also said it had hired two investment banks to review its
options, including a sale of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn's latest offer amounts to the opening bid in an auction
that most analysts expect will end at a higher price. Icahn said he
agreed, so long as any takeover is not hostile. ``Nabisco alone is
a great company; it's just undervalued,'' he said in an interview.
``It's got so many good things that another food company would love
to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco's core brands, which also include Chips Ahoy!, Life
Savers and Ritz, have been performing well recently, said Eric R.
Katzman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. The stock has barely budged,
however, largely because of investors' disinterest in consumer
goods stocks and fears about liabilities Nabisco may face from its
years as a corporate sibling to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. RJR
bought Nabisco in 1986, and the parent company spun off the tobacco
business last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nomi Ghez, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said she thought the
holding company could fetch about $33 a share, based on its assets.
Even if investors decided that the potential for tobacco liability
required a large discount, Icahn's $16-a-share bid still appears
low, she added. The most likely buyers are other large food
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Nabisco's directors Tuesday, Icahn took a
confrontational tone, chiding them for rejecting his earlier bid as
too low even though they had not bought a large number of shares
for themselves when the stock was trading at less than $9. He also
asked that the company open its books to him and his financial
advisers. Otherwise, he wrote, the company's announcement that it
was considering a sale would look like an attempt to ward off his
effort to replace the board. .
</P>
<P>
   Henry A. Sandbach, a Nabisco spokesman, said the company had
received Icahn's letter and would respond to it ``in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Icahn and Nabisco have been battling for years. In the
mid-1990s, he and Bennett S. LeBow, another financier, tried to
take over RJR Nabisco and force a spinoff of the food unit. They
failed and, when the stock climbed in 1997, Icahn sold his stake
for a large profit. When it dipped in 1998, he invested again and
continued to press management to shed the food unit.
</P>
<P>
   The company instead spun off the tobacco business, in part
because Steven F. Goldstone, then the chief executive, thought it
would leave the two units in better shape to handle tobacco
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Icahn began another proxy fight and also made his
$13-a-share offer for 100 million shares, saying he wanted to
replace the current board with directors who would sell Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the holding company have fallen sharply since the 1999
spinoff, dropping from $20 in March 1999 to less than $9 before
last week. Its market value of $4.7 billion remains only 57 percent
of the value it would appear to have, based on the price of shares
in Nabisco Holdings. Shares of Nabisco Holdings closed at $39
Tuesday, up $6.625.

PRIMEDIA AND SONY PICTURES TO CREATE SOAP OPERA SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to find new ways to take advantage of the loyal
following attracted by television soap operas, Primedia and Sony
Pictures have reached agreement on a joint venture to create a new
online site for soap fans.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for the two companies said they expected the new
venture to generate revenue through everything from sales of items
of apparel worn by soap opera stars to pay-per-view telecasts of
episodes of shows that fans might have missed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas S. Rogers, the chairman of Primedia, said his company's
two magazines that cover the soap opera world, Soap Opera Digest
and Soap Opera Weekly, would combine with the Sony Web site
SoapCity.com, which is built around the two network soap operas
produced by Sony's Columbia television studio, ``Days of Our
Lives'' and ``The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   The result will be a newly branded Web site, which, Rogers said,
will expand greatly after broadband technology becomes widely
available, making possible such options as streaming video of
highlights of the day's soap episodes and features built on pieces
from the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Yair Landau, the president of Sony Pictures Digital
Entertainment, said they anticipated significant revenue from
e-commerce related to the soaps. ``The core audience for the soap
is intensely passionate about their shows,'' Landau said. He said
items like clothing and jewelry worn by soap stars would be
available for sale to fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to create  &UR; the &LR;  place for the hard-core
demographic interested in soap operas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said his strategy for Primedia, which publishes a wide
range of magazines for those with specialized interests, from
brides to hog farmers, is to ``become the biggest company for
enthusiasts.'' He added. ``This is a way to play to the passionate
viewer of soaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement should be completed in four to six months, Rogers
said. Sony has already moved its plans for building a secondary
revenue stream for its two soap operas away from a soap opera cable
channel, which would compete with the Soap Channel already started
by Walt Disney Co., and toward a plan to provide daily episodes as
a pay-per-view offering.
</P>
<P>
   A Sony executive said the company was ``a couple of months
away'' from offering the day's episodes to fans on DirectTV and
other pay-per-view outlets. The fee is expected to be small, as
little as a dollar or two.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, episodes could be retransmitted through video
streaming on the broadband Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Landau emphasized that Sony would still create ``far more
revenue from the network play of the soap operas than we can off
these new areas for a very long time.'' So he added, ``We have no
interest in endangering the core showing on the networks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Primedia does not want to undermine its publications either,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers stressed, however, that the new joint venture would open
``enormous opportunities for cross-promotion.''

   ATLANTA _ Braves bullpen experiment Day 2 failed, as the
countdown to the return of John Rocker and Rudy Seanez continues.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett saw his Braves debut spoiled on a bases-loaded
double by Jeff Cirillo in the seventh inning for a 5-3 Rockies win
on Tuesday night as the Braves' record evened at 1-1. He'd given up
a couple of soft singles and a walk to stir up trouble before
Cirillo sent his first pitch down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   That tarnished the Braves debuts of Bobby Bonilla and Rafael
Furcal as well, and the 400th start of Tom Glavine's career.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla had spotted the Braves a 2-0 lead with his first homer
and Glavine had survived one poor inning to leave with a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   From good guy to supposed bad boy, deep duties Tuesday night
fell to Bonilla, who followed Andres Galarraga's Monday heroics
with a two-run homer to right field in the fourth inning and his
first Turner Field ovation from a chilled crowd of 26,132.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with the Chipper Jones' double before it, was the
first noise off Rolando Arrojo, who was making his first visit to
Georgia since he defected from Cuba while playing for its national
team in Albany in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He made this trip memorable for his first major league hit in
his National League debut. The former Devil Ray helped even the
game 2-2 with a double off Glavine on a two-out 0-2 pitch in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who became only the second pitcher to make 400 starts
for the Braves along with Phil Niekro (689 games), got his season
off right, holding the Rockies to two runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine cruised through four scoreless innings, but he lost his
2-0 advantage in the fifth after a leadoff walk and a stray
two-out, 0-2 pitch to Arrojo that was hit over Reggie Sanders in
right field, scoring Neifi Perez. That and a Tom Goodwin triple
past Bonilla in left evened the game 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got a breath of fresh air from 19-year-old Furcal,
who came away with his first major league hit on a single to right
in the sixth inning in his third at-bat. He stole second and
advanced to third on an errant throw from catcher Scott Servais.
</P>
<P>
   In what's now speedy Furcal fashion, he made an impression in
his very first trip to the plate. He fought Arrojo for 12 pitches,
fouling off eight in a row at one point before striking out on an
offspeed pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal added his first major league assist with a rifled throw
to first to get Cirillo in the fourth inning and got his first
major league putout on a Cirillo liner an inning later to strand
two runners.

ATTORNEY GENERAL TO OFFER OLIVE BRANCH TO SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   by JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a speech at Stanford University and in
subsequent talks with executives of technology companies, Attorney
General Janet Reno will extend an olive branch to Silicon Valley
companies Wednesday over issues like digital surveillance and will
offer the government's support in fighting computer crime.
</P>
<P>
   During the last five years, strategies for fighting computer
crime and strengthening network security have been flashpoints
between the government, and high-technology companies and civil
liberties and privacy groups. The Justice Department has infuriated
those groups by demanding broad new authority and technologies to
conduct electronic surveillance while trying to weaken encryption
programs intended to protect individual privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the attorney general was
traveling to the nation's high-technology heartland in an effort to
build new trust and at the same time offer the department's support
in protecting against attacks on computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's outreach effort follows a spate of attacks
on the nation's largest e-commerce companies earlier this year. In
response to the attacks, which brought down the Web sites of
companies like Etrade, eBay, Yahoo and others, the Clinton
administration held an Internet security summit meeting in February
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the officials said, the attorney general will
spend the day searching for common ground and new ways to build
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some lingering concern among high-technology
executives about the government's role,'' said a federal official
who is involved in planning the meeting and who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``We're trying to address those concerns by
building trust and finding out how industry and law enforcement can
work together while protecting privacy and civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added that similar meetings were planned with
privacy and civil liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   After Reno speaks, law enforcement officials and corporate
executives will break up into working groups on subjects like
reporting incidents, conducting investigations and sharing
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry has been leery about being too close to government,''
said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America. ``Particularly an industry like ours which
has been so worried about government control.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that Reno's visit and subsequent meetings will
help build trust between law enforcement officials and corporate
executives. ``This is an educational process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the attorney general plans to visit a
``digital clubhouse'' in Sunnyvale, where she will meet with a
group of teen-agers to talk about computer ethics.

ALBANY'S LEADERS REACH AGREEMENT ON SPENDING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and leaders of the Legislature
agreed Tuesday on the outlines of a roughly $77 billion spending
plan that generously finances education, heath care, transportation
and tax cuts, clearing the way for one of the earliest budgets in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   With the state running a large surplus, the accord sets the
boundaries for a budget that is all but certain to include an array
of programs that the governor did not call for in his original
budget proposal _ from expansion of prekindergarten classes and
reductions in class size to low-cost prescription drugs for the
elderly. And state leaders also agreed to let voters decide in
November whether to spend $3.8 billion on a host of transportation
projects, including a new subway line on Second Avenue in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for spending $1.4 billion more than the governor
proposed in January. It propels the budget talks further along than
they have been at this date in most recent years, and it places
Pataki and the Legislature on a course to enact a final budget by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also calls for $1.2 billion in new tax cuts. But the
cuts are not expected to have a significant impact on this year's
final budget because they will be structured to take effect in
future budget years, legislative aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was due on April 1, but for the 16th consecutive
year, the governor and the Legislature failed to meet that
deadline. Last year's budget was adopted on Aug. 4, 126 days
overdue. With Tuesday's agreement, the action shifts to the
Legislature, where rank-and-file members of both houses will have
to negotiate the final details publicly in conference committees.
</P>
<P>
   The swiftness of the budget negotiations this year has been
propelled by the legislators' desire to get home early to campaign
for re-election, and by a continued surge in tax revenue that
allows lawmakers to avoid having to make many of the hard choices
of the past. It has also helped that Medicaid spending,
traditionally one of the most contentious areas of the budget, was
determined in a separate agreement in December.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and their leaders faced another incentive for a timely
budget: a 1-year-old law that withholds their pay for as long as
the budget is late.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate,
predicted Tuesday that the budget, the main business of Albany,
would be completed in slightly over a week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The accord announced Tuesday calls for $1.2 billion in new tax
cuts to be phased in over the next five years, including tax
credits for low-wage New Yorkers, as well as a reduction of a tax
that adds several dollars a month to the average gas and electric
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, agreement on how much to spend above the governor's
proposal has been the most difficult part of the budget
negotiations. But with tax revenue streaming into the state's
coffers, it was hard for Pataki to resist the Legislature's call
for more spending. Pataki had proposed spending $76.8 billion in
the budget he released earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Pataki has promised that he will not
attempt the sort of widespread vetoes he made in 1998, when he cut
more than $1 billion in programs, mostly Democratic, from the
budget that the two houses sent to him. But Pataki has privately
warned Bruno and Silver that he will abide by the agreement only if
they do not spend any more than the $1.4 billion that they agreed
to add to his original budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached Tuesday by Pataki, Bruno and Silver settles the
main issue that had held up negotiations for weeks: an overall
spending figure that all sides could accept. But aides to Pataki
and legislative leaders cautioned that some details still had to be
worked out before the budget was completed and then submitted to
lawmakers for approval. Conference committee hearings to consider
the budget will start convening as early as Wednesday.

<P>
   KALININGRAD, Russia _ If President-elect Vladimir Putin is going
to fight corruption and lawlessness in Russia, as he has vowed to
do in the wake of last month's election, he might start here on the
southern shore of the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   This territory of rolling farmland where Putin's wife, Lyudmila,
grew up and where the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant
devoted much of his life to the study of morality is about as
corrupt as any in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A region the size of Connecticut that was seized from Germany
during World War II, Kaliningrad was a closed city until 1990,
serving as the headquarters of the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Now
separated from the rest of Russia by 300 miles of Lithuanian and
Belarussian territory, the region and its capital, formerly known
as Koenigsberg, are today ruled by Gov. Leonid P. Gorbenko, a
political boss who is built like a refrigerator and is a law unto
himself.
</P>
<P>
   To many here, he is simply known by the Russian diminutive term
that translates roughly as ``Pappy,'' or maybe ``Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after the Soviet collapse, the rough-hewn and
hot-tempered Gorbenko rose from the waterfront, where he ran the
docks as port manager. Despite press coverage that he was under
investigation for embezzlement, he won election in 1996. Since
then, he has issued a decree as governor to take personal control
of the cigarette, auto and liquor import trade, positioning himself
as the essential middleman in the region's business. Here,
importers of duty-free goods must be licensed in an auction process
controlled by his office, which invariably rewards the governor's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   When the local parliament accused the governor of frequently
breaking the laws of fiscal accountability and of illegally seizing
budget money, the members of parliament said he simply turned off
the electricity of the parliament building for eight months last
year and stopped the salaries paid to members.
</P>
<P>
   The members of parliament who audit the budget said that tens of
millions of dollars of government funds had disappeared during the
governor's tenure, and that each year's audit of his budget had
been sent to the state prosecutor with a request to investigate
irregularities and missing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unfortunate fact that in Russia today the governors
have turned into untouchable barons reminiscent of feudal times
where they swear an oath to the sovereign but then do whatever they
want,'' said Nikolai P. Tulayev, a former naval officer who serves
as the deputy chairman of the Law and Order Committee of the
Kaliningrad Duma, or regional parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Added Aleksandr G. Khmurchik, editor in chief of Kaliningrad's
largest newspaper, Kaliningradskaya Pravda, ``What we have here is
an authority that is tied to criminality and does not function as
an authority elected by the people, but as a power that works for
itself and protects its own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the challenge for the newly elected Russian
president. Putin cannot lay the foundations for the rule of law nor
make the country safe for foreign investment nor usher in a new era
of economic development without doing something about the corrupt
regional overlords like Gorbenko.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Putin chooses to act, the task will not be easy, because
the governor, and many other regional officials like him, are not
exactly outsiders. Gorbenko, for instance, is one of the founding
members of the Unity Party, a coalition of governors, mayors and
other regional leaders who last fall formed a new power bloc to
support Putin's candidacy for president and to create a
pro-government majority in the national Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``What frightens us is that so far, Putin has not taken any
strict measures against Gorbenko,'' said Igor Rostov, a television
executive whose news programs have exposed corruption and
criticized the governor during the last three years. ``And because
Gorbenko is a member of Unity, it gives him the right to say that
any attack on him is an attack on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Rostov is also frightened because he believes that the governor
and his men have been behind attempts to silence criticism in the
news media through threats and intimidation, an accusation the
governor has denied.
</P>
<P>
   One evening in November, Rostov said he was walking from his car
to his apartment when a man wearing a hat pulled low over his brow
approached with a dog on a leash, and then wheeled suddenly to bash
Rostov on the back of the head with an iron pipe.
</P>
<P>
   A second man appeared and slammed another pipe against Rostov's
head, and the two assailants pummeled him as he screamed for help.
Had his wife, Olga, not heard his cries and come running to put the
attackers to flight, Rostov said he is sure that he would have been
killed. As it was, he spent three months recovering from his
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third such assault on journalists who have documented
allegations of corruption against Gorbenko and his deputies. The
offices of New Wheels, a newspaper, have twice been damaged, once
by a pipe-bomb planted just outside, and once by firebombs that
failed to explode when they were thrown through office windows.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, who report to the governor, have dismissed
those acts as ``hooliganism'' and ``street violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbenko declined requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He just returned last week from Moscow, where he delivered a
tough speech to the upper house of parliament calling for
amendments to Russia's press law that would make it easier for
public officials to use the courts to silence their critics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the governor's declared enemies is the Moscow-based NTV
television network, whose reports about corruption in Kaliningrad
and attacks on journalists have been distributed to a national
audience.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Gorbenko agreed to an interview with the network's
reporter, Eduard Petrov, but minutes into the taping session, he
became outraged at the tone of Petrov's questioning, which focused
on the governor's political migration to the Putin camp and away
from the Fatherland-All Russia Party formed by former Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov and Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not interrupt me! That's it. End of discussion,'' Gorbenko
said angrily as he threw down his pen, removed the microphone and
walked out of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising, one of the governor's deputies, Vasily
Kotov, then reportedly offered to pay $300,000 for the videotape
showing the governor's eruption. Kotov has denied making such an
offer, but in February, the NTV crew returned to Kaliningrad and
upon encountering Kotov on the street, recorded him on videotape
saying: ``I thought you would be afraid to come over here. I
offered you $300,000, but you showed such horse manure.''
</P>
<P>
   In tackling corruption, Putin will have to walk the fine line
between respecting the autonomy of duly elected regional officials,
some of whom have strong popular support, while insuring that such
officials do not flaunt the law. Some Russian political leaders
have advocated a consolidation of power under a strong president
like Putin, one empowered to appoint and remove governors. For the
moment, this idea has been beaten back by those who prefer
preserving a federal system where regional leaders remain
accountable to local voters.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Putin is woefully lacking in tools to enforce
anti-corruption standards across Russia's 11 time zones.
</P>
<P>
   The local police, prosecutors and judges _ in the absence of
federal financing _ are slavishly dependent upon governors to pay
their salaries and even to provide housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold governors accountable is difficult for both Moscow and
for localities,'' said Khmurchik, the newspaper editor. ``Moscow is
afraid to lose support of the regions, and here in the region,
everyone walks in the shadow of the governor, and it is difficult
to overcome their dependency on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even where there is proof of corruption, added Tulayev of the
Law and Order Committee, ``we are still lacking in an honest and
independent judicial system.'' And unfortunately, he continued, ``I
have to say that in the current situation, the price of justice is
equivalent to the price of an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaliningrad parliament is now considering legislation that
would set out clearly defined procedures for removing a corrupt
governor, but some opposition leaders here are privately hoping
that Putin and the central government will step in to conduct an
investigation that, in their view, would provide grounds to remove
Gorbenko.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes were raised last week when an inspection team of 50
officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal
Security Service arrived here for an unspecified but large-scale
investigation. The mandate of this investigative swat team remains
a mystery, but it is headed by Gen. Gennadi Y. Marshkov, who
publicly denounced Gorbenko's administration as corrupt before
leaving the territory last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the only time in history that the local head
of the FSB criticized the governor in the open pages of the
newspapers,'' Rostov said, referring to the general and the Federal
Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Kaliningrad holds the potential to become a rich
entrepot like Hong Kong on the northern rim of Europe. The region
is generously endowed with a deep-water harbor, a well-educated
labor force, one of the world's largest deposits of natural amber,
rich farmland and endless beaches. There are also modest crude oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But since Gorbenko's election in 1996, foreign investors have
fled the territory while organized crime figures who run the
smuggling, drugs and prostitution businesses have increased their
influence. A drug epidemic now rages here, fueled by high
unemployment and the ready availability of cheap heroin passing
through on the way to big markets in Europe. And Kaliningrad leads
the nation in HIV infections, a by-product of drug addiction and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in office, Gorbenko has delivered on few of the
promises he made to voters to work on their behalf, and it appears
that he has lost a great deal of trust.
</P>
<P>
   In an encounter with school teachers on hunger strikes last
year, one irate teacher complained to the governor that ``children
are not being fed at schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no money to feed them,'' Gorbenko snapped back.
``Nobody is paying taxes. They have destroyed everything, eaten
everything and sliced everything up. How can I get their money?''
Then, to the horrified teacher, he added: ``I want to ask why you
allowed them to destroy everything. I will now stand up and
leave.'' This exchange was also broadcast on national television.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent albatross still clinging to Gorbenko's neck is a
fiasco surrounding his chicken ranch. Last year, in violation of
all fiscal controls, he personally arranged for a $10 million loan
from a German bank to finance a poultry processing enterprise. But
no sooner had the loan been issued than the enterprise declared
bankruptcy and the money disappeared. Now the regional government
is saddled with paying on the debt. That case, too, has been sent
to the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the chicken ranch controversy calmed down than
someone in the governor's administration leaked the text of an
exclusive agreement he had signed with an Israeli company, Eurotech
Industrial Ltd., granting the company exclusive rights to develop
the amber industry, oil business and tourism in the territory.
Instead of applause, the agreement was greeted here by a howl of
protest because it had been negotiated in secret without bidding
and had granted the Israeli company such sweeping guarantees and
tax exemptions that the local taxpayers would end up covering any
losses.
</P>
<P>
   And just before last month's presidential election, Gorbenko
flew to Moscow hoping to win Putin's endorsement for an
extraordinary scheme to renationalize Kaliningrad's major
industries _ oil, amber, shipping, fishing, rail and air transport
_ under one super corporation to be headed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   This scheme prompted Khmurchik to ask whether one morning, the
citizens of Kaliningrad might wake up to find the name of their
region changed to Gorbenkograd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing President Putin can do in the face of a
governor such as ours is conduct an investigation so that he will
be held responsible for what he has done before the coming
elections,'' Khmurchik said, referring to the gubernatorial
elections in the fall in which Gorbenko is seeking a second
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Slisarenko, an opposition politician from the Yabloko
Party, warned that ``Any further criminalization of the government
authority must be stopped'' before criminals gain complete control
of Kaliningrad's economy.
</P>
<P>
   And so, like many Russians, they say they are waiting for Putin.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Considering the setting for the following interview _
a big, bustling gun factory in Brooklyn _ what comes next may be
hard to believe. But Anthony F. Imperato and his family have never
really been all that crazy about guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns were just not a part of our lives,'' he said. ``Other
than the fact that we sold them.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the business that supports the Imperato family seems
about as out of place in New York City as a kosher deli would be in
West Texas: The family owns both the gun factory, the only such
factory in the city, and a gun shop, the oldest in the city, in
Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But growing up in Bensonhurst, Imperato said, he and his father,
Louis, never once went hunting. ``We didn't shoot at targets. None
of our hobbies ever involved guns. Guns were a job.'' He reaches
for an apt analogy: ``Maybe the guys who run Lobel's meat market
are, you know, vegetarians. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   So over the last several years, as New York's gun laws have
become among the most restrictive in the country, and especially
over the last several weeks, as the national debate over gun
control has grown even more polarized, Imperato, 42, has become a
man in a strange spot.
</P>
<P>
   When the workday is over, he would much rather talk about food
than firearms. In a three-hour interview that started on a desolate
industrial street near the Gowanus Canal, continued through the
Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and ended in Little Italy, he did not once
mention the Second Amendment. But he is a member of the National
Rifle Association. And he is a businessman _ ``a very responsible
businessman,'' he said _ who has watched his livelihood come under
assault even though he feels he has never done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``My viewpoint on the right of people to own guns is the same as
it has always been,'' he says. ``But like anything else, the more
you're attacked, the more you think about whether to fight or
flee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're not going to flee,'' he adds resolutely. But the
family is certainly finding it more difficult to hold its ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperatos' storied Manhattan gun shop, with its famous
wooden pistol sign aiming due west, has seen better days. Called
John Jovino after its founder, a former Italian leather smith who
moved the shop to its address on Centre Market Place in 1911, it
was once in the middle of a block of busy gun shops that catered
mostly to the gun-toting men who worked across the street, at the
old Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I would go there as a kid with my father,'' Imperato
recalled, ``it was a sea of blue. It smelled like holster
leather.''
</P>
<P>
   He got into the business without thinking much about it. He grew
up wanting to play either center field for the Yankees or the piano
for Bruce Springsteen, ``but somehow that didn't happen.'' He
studied business at New York University, thinking vaguely about the
restaurant trade because he had always been something of a gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   But then his family gave him an apartment above the gun shop,
where he lived from the late 1970s to early 1980s. And so, he said,
smiling broadly and quoting from a character in ``The Sopranos''
who was quoting Al Pacino in ``The Godfather, Part III,'' ``Just
when I thought that I was out, they  &UR; p-u-l-l &LR;  me back in.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Imperato got into the business, it was a
different world on Centre Market Place. The police moved south in
1973. The city's gun laws gradually became tougher, requiring
buyers to wait anywhere from six to nine months for a permit. And
mostly for the first reason, but also for the second, said Imperato
(pronounced Im-per-AH-to), he and his father, who is now
semi-retired, were looking for a way to stay afloat by the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up looking into the past. In 1993, hoping to
capitalize on the growing interest in Civil War memorabilia, they
opened the Brooklyn factory, which now makes newly issued Colt
pistols and cap-and-ball revolvers, first manufactured in the
mid-1800's, along with reproductions of Henry rifles, first used in
the Civil War. (Henry's motto: ``Load on Sunday and shoot all week
long!'')
</P>
<P>
   The powder guns made do not require a permit, luckily. Like the
modern guns beneath the glass case in the store, they can still be
used to kill someone, of course. But the shooter first must learn a
whole lot about black powder, percussion caps, wadding, lead balls
and hand-strengthening exercises. ``The revolvers have a pretty
good kick,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Imperato spends most of his time at the factory, which
cranks out about 5,000 guns a year. ``This is where we put the
butter on the bread now, is right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of trying to keep the Manhattan store open at least
until its centennial, in honor of his grandfather, Frank Albanese,
who bought it from Jovino. But these days the store is mostly in
the hands of its manager, a friendly Chinese man who is known
around the neighborhood simply as ``Gun King Charley.''
</P>
<P>
   Imperato never apologizes for his work. ``Over the years,'' he
says, ``we know we've sold lots of guns to people who have used
them to protect their lives, and that's a good feeling.'' But he
adds that he sometimes worries about what his three children, 14,
11 and 8, will end up thinking of his career. ``Honestly, it occurs
to me. They don't ask about it, but I know they probably hear about
the issues in school, about how gun dealers are bad. And I don't
want them to think their father is bad.''

SPARTANS ADD SYMMETRY TO THE CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Magic Johnson watched from the floor, barely a
one-handed bounce pass away, as Mateen Cleaves stood on a
stepladder and snipped down the nets. There they were, two Michigan
State point guards separated by 21 years, but connected by a common
accomplishment: They took national championships to East Lansing,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tenuous line, but about the best you can do in trying to
link this National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball
tournament with those of the past. Johnson, after all, cut down his
souvenir as a sophomore in 1979, headed to the National Basketball
Association draft as the overall No. 1 pick and then changed the
professional game forever.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves is a senior. He will be drafted somewhere in the first
round, but odds-on it will be behind some high-school player no one
but hoops newsletter writers, scouts, agents and their surrogates
have heard of. Still, at least for 40 minutes on Monday, Cleaves
and two senior and two junior teammates made sense of a tournament,
of a college basketball season, that did not make much sense at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans were more experienced, played better defense and
thoroughly handled a young Florida team, 89-76, here at the RCA
Dome. They were the lone No. 1-seeded team standing in the field of
64 _ two others, Arizona and Stanford, did not even make it out of
the first weekend. Michigan State had won an ugly contest, 53-41,
in the semifinals Saturday against a Wisconsin team that
transported basketball aficionados back in time _ to 1941, to be
exact, when the Badgers' deliberate style sedated Washington State
and, you have to believe, anyone who was watching, 39-34.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin was the biggest surprise in a tournament full of them.
Its coach, Dick Bennett, wears a red sweater vest and has earned a
reputation as a genius among his peers after 35 years of taking
players who would be hard pressed to make an All Ivy team of any
year and turning them into giant killers.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a term from the business world, this ``old economy''
team may not have been fun to watch on the basketball ticker, but
Wisconsin earned its way here.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State earned the national championship in much the same
fashion. It was more talented than Wisconsin, but nearly as short
of marquee names. After Cleaves, who scored 18 points to go with 4
assists in the championship game, the Spartans were carried by two
other seniors: Morris Peterson, whose 15 second-half points buried
the Gators, and A.J. Granger, who had an unobtrusive 19 points and
9 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Florida, the ``new economy'' team, managed to generate
all the buzz before and, to some extent, after the Spartans made
them 2000's NCAA runners-up. Their 34-year-old coach, Billy
Donovan, lured a collection of seven blue-chip freshmen and
sophomores first to Gainesville, Fla., a football stronghold, and
then to the title game.
</P>
<P>
   They pressed full court, they bombed from 3-point territory and
one of them, Udonis Haslem, banged inside for a career-high 27
points on 10-of-12 shooting. Afterward, there was plenty of talk
about next year, as well as next week.
</P>
<P>
   That is when perhaps Florida's sophomore forward Mike Miller
will decide whether he will return to school or turn professional.
On the eve of the Final Four, Miller confirmed what documents
reviewed by The New York Times had shown, that he had spoken
extensively with a sports agent who was unregistered in Florida and
who did not inform university officials of the conversations, as
the state's strict agent law requires. The NCAA said the player had
done nothing wrong, but the agent, Andy Miller, is now under
investigation by Florida law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another strange twist in a strange season that,
unfortunately, perhaps upstaged Michigan State's title run. In the
weeks leading up to the tournament, a series of NCAA investigations
and player suspensions for everything from who paid prep school
tuition to improper contact with agents, prompted some of the
biggest names in college coaching to call college sports' governing
body names.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, such disparate people and institutions as a
basketball enthusiast implicated in a recruiting scandal at
Syracuse nearly decade ago, a Manhattan lawyer, a church with a
distinguished history earned in the civil-rights era and a famed
modeling agency have all been mentioned in connection with Erick
Barkley and a continuing investigation of St. John's basketball
team.
</P>
<P>
   That is only one part of the tattered mosaic of college
basketball that turned the NCAA president's state-of-the-game
address here into a bitter call for change. The president, Cedric
Dempsey, barely concealed his disdain for ``the culture'' of
college basketball and vowed to ``wipe it out.''
</P>
<P>
   So what should have been a celebration of coaches in sweater
vests with overachieving players and a senior-laden team
persevering to achieve a goal, or even a young, exciting troop full
of possibilities, was broken up even before it got started.
</P>
<P>
   Magic the person might have been on the court when Cleaves and
his Michigan State teammates cut down the nets, but little was
magical throughout the final months of the college basketball
season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, April 5: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volatility was redefined on Wall Street Tuesday. First the Dow
fell more than 500 points by 1:15 p.m. Then, miraculously, it
gained back all but about 57 points by the 4 p.m. closing. The
Nasdaq dropped 574 points before it too roared back to end down 74.
Comparing start and finish, there was not that much change. But for
investors already jittery after Monday's biggest point drop ever,
349, on the Nasdaq, Tuesday's whiplash market was jarring.
</P>
<P>
   At their low ebb, stocks had by one estimate lost about $1
trillion of value. That is a stunning amount of money for investors
to lose, even if temporarily. But of course no one knew at midday
that bottom had been reached. Some no doubt feared the revenge of
Alan Greenspan had come, three years after Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, had warned of the markets' ``irrational
exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   By many calculations stocks are overvalued, with prices about
twice their historical average when compared with corporate
earnings. Prices continue to rise faster than earnings. In the
high-tech sectors, it almost seems that the more a company loses,
the more attractive its stock becomes to investors. One eminent
economist recently predicted that the market would fall by a third,
even though it might take a decade or more. But who wants to be the
first to bail out?
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainty, it is not hard to understand why stock
prices swing wildly. The flimsiest rumors spook investors who are
guessing when other investors will take flight. Even a predictable
event like Monday's antitrust verdict against Microsoft appears to
send stocks into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a school of thought that says stock prices
are actually a bargain and will almost certainly soar over the next
few years. This view rests on the assumption that contrary to
conventional wisdom, stocks are no riskier than bonds over the long
haul. Though popular formulations of this theory have been
questioned by economists, some investors seem not to doubt its
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   So experts are sharply divided. Prices appear irrationally high
to some, temptingly low to others. A new breed of traders has
entered stock markets with an investment horizon measured in
seconds. No wonder stock prices roar up and down. (af)

NEW OFFERINGS DELAYED AMID STOCK TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change name of Chase Hambrecht and Quist to Chase H&AMP;Q.)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With stock prices sinking fast, cracks are starting to appear in
the market for new issues of shares, sending companies scrambling
for other ways to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   Several young, technology-based companies have postponed plans
for initial public offerings and others are finding that demand is
weak for their second or third stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advising people who are in registration and ready to
launch to hold back and take it day by day,'' said Peter Blanton, a
managing director in equity capital markets at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``At noon, things looked pretty dire, but at the end of the
day, they didn't look so bad. We're saying, `Let's just wait a day
or two.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the turmoil, some representatives of the old economy are
soldiering on with initial offerings. Investment bankers Tuesday
night priced first-time stock sales for two companies that existed
before investors had heard of the Internet: Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that neither of those offerings would have much
effect on the overall market for new stocks because each is
anomalous in its own way. At $2.88 billion, Metropolitan Life's
initial offering is an unusually large offering that is part of the
insurer's conversion from a mutual owned by its policy-holders to a
public company.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated process of demutualization reduced the chances
that the sale would be delayed or canceled, analysts and investors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme, by contrast, is a niche offering raising $63
million for a company with a strong brand name but no connection to
the Internet, other than its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Professional investors said they expected Krispy Kreme's shares
to rise when they start trading Wednesday but not enough to give a
boost to the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already seen an erosion of the IPO market,'' said Mark
Hantho, a managing director of equity capital markets at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. But that market has held up better than
the market for secondary stock offerings, which has become ``very
difficult,'' Hantho said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are still willing to take chances on first-time
offerings in certain industry sectors, especially Internet
infrastructure plays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But already public companies will have a hard time tapping the
capital markets again unless they are within a quarter or two of
turning their first profit, analysts and investors said. That
leaves out most Internet retailers, a group that already is among
the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need money because you are trying to pay for a branding
strategy, then it will be hard to get financing,'' said David
Golden, co-director of investment banking at Chase H&AMP;Q. ``Unless
companies are on the cusp of profitability, it will be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies may have to resort to other traditional
forms of raising cash, either by selling bonds or other debt
instruments. Executives at investment banks say the number of calls
from companies seeking debt financing in the past few days has
increased fourfold.
</P>
<P>
   A particular favorite among the tech set are bonds that can be
converted into stock. Convertible bonds are sold to investors at a
discount to the current stock price _ usually 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because they offer investors the opportunity to switch from
holding IOUs to being shareholders in fast-growing companies, the
bonds carry lower interest rates of 5 to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, convertible bonds are being issued at a record
pace _ more than 65 companies sold $23 billion worth of them in the
first quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is because the company does not have to pay the
double-digit interest payments of the more common high-yield, or
junk, financing. But investors should heed the risks in convertible
bonds before stocking up on them as voraciously as they pursued the
stocks of Internet companies, said James Breyer, a partner at Accel
Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment bankers see the deterioration in the tech-stock
market as a prelude to a new wave of merger activity in which
better-capitalized Internet companies will devour cash-strapped
competitors. It could be the ultimate spring sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking through Macy's where everything has a red
price tag on it,'' he said. ``You know some furniture will be ugly,
but that doesn't mean you still won't take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Already it has begun and Breyer, a director of Walmart.com,
knows this firsthand. He said that as many as two dozen e-retailers
are shopping themselves to traditional brick-and-mortar companies,
including to Walmart.com, the Internet venture between Accel and
Wal-Mart stores.
</P>
<P>
   While the new-economy companies scramble to obtain financing,
their old-economy counterparts are getting a warm reception.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Metropolitan Life's underwriters at Credit Suisse
First Boston priced 202 million shares at $14.25 each, near the
middle of the expected price range.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Krispy Kreme's investment bankers at Deutsche Banc
Alex Brown was more encouraging: They priced 3 million shares of
the doughnut-seller's stock at $21 each, above the projected range
of $18 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the consumer stocks and the financials outperform
the market as the new economy becomes old and the old economy
becomes new,'' said Hantho.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in Metropolitan Life's favor was the relatively strong
recent performance of stocks of insurers and other financial
companies, said James K. Schmidt, manager of the John Hancock
Financial Industries fund.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's co-manager, Thomas Goggins, said that this week's
selloff bodes well for financial stocks because it increases the
chances that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
only one more time to cool the economy, instead of twice or three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme was the second company to sell its initial offering
for more than expected. Tuesday, shares of Cabot Microelectronics
rose more than $4 from its offering price of $20, cheering
investment bankers who worried that the long, hot market for new
stocks would dry up altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Having developed a cult following in New York and other cities
it has moved into in the last few years, Krispy Kreme is selling a
24 percent stake to the public. Some of the proceeds will be spent
refurbishing some of the 58 company-owned stores, but the company
does not plan to build many more of its own. Instead, it has turned
to franchising, charging store owners royalties of 4.5 percent of
their sales.
</P>
<P>
   Another $7 million of the proceeds will be paid to existing
shareholders, some of whom are officers and directors of the
company. Only two of the company's officers and directors are not
also franchisees.

EDITORIAL: BUDGETING FOR NEW YORK STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, April 5: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With unexpected speed, Gov. George Pataki and the New York State
Legislature have agreed on a framework for a new $77 billion
budget. Producing a framework does not mean the legislature has
actually produced a budget on time _ a feat that has not been
achieved in Albany for the last 16 years. This budget was
officially late last Saturday. But the agreement on a budget
outline is definitely a sign of progress for legislators prodded by
an election this fall and the loss of their paychecks until the
budget is officially finished. Last year the legislature reached
this point in its budget negotiations in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   At press conferences in Albany, state leaders promised an
enticing list of possibilities such as reduction of school class
sizes and low-cost prescriptions for the elderly. Still, this
general agreement must be greeted cautiously until the details
emerge in the coming weeks. Despite the surge in state revenues,
primarily from taxes on Wall Street profits, the governor, the
Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver must be careful not to endorse either tax cuts or
obligations that would expand the deficit later.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders have identified an additional $1.4 billion available
for spending since the governor announced his budget, and want to
apply some of this to $1.2 billion in new tax cuts phased in over
the next five years. Some of the newly identified money is expected
to be used to cut the gross receipts tax on energy, which falls
heaviest on struggling upstate businesses, especially as energy
costs increase. There are also promises of earned-income tax
credits, an important way to help the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of a separate agreement on transportation is a
proposed $3.8 billion bond issue for next November, half going for
highways and the other half for mass transit. The bond issue has
been seized upon by state leaders as their part of the capital plan
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, particularly a $3
billion proposal to build a full Second Avenue Subway and a link
between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Bond issues have been a tough sell in recent years, and voters
in November may well be concentrating more on senate and
presidential races than on increasing the state's debt. They will
certainly be skeptical of authorizing more borrowing by the state
without a full explanation of how the money will be spent and when
these projects will be finished. Meanwhile, serious questions
remain about where the MTA will get the remaining funds _ whether
from city or state coffers, the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey or perhaps even an unpopular fare increase.
</P>
<P>
   This fat-year budget wisely offers at least some cushion against
leaner times, adding a reserve fund of $750 million as a hedge
against an economic downturn. Such measures will help shore up New
York's budget status even more than this sudden surge of
timeliness.  &QL;

MONITORS ACCUSE MRS. CLINTON AND GIULIANI ON SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two advocacy groups charged on Tuesday that Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have illegally collected
the largely unregulated donations known as soft money for their New
York Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The groups, Common Cause and Democracy 21, which both contend
that the campaign finance laws need to be tightened to reduce the
influence of money in politics, asked the Federal Election
Commission and the Justice Department in a formal complaint to
investigate the two candidates' soft money fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``These illegal schemes, unless they are stopped, threaten to
inject millions of dollars of federally illegal campaign
contributions into the New York Senate race,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who was campaigning Tuesday with Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, a leading proponent of campaign finance reform, brushed
aside a question about whether his soft-money fund raising was
illegal. A spokesman for the Clinton campaign, Howard Wolfson, said
Clinton had not violated finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department both
declined to comment on the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate has raised nearly $1 million in soft money in the
New York contest. Those amounts are dwarfed by the totals they have
collected for their official campaigns _ $19 million for Giuliani
and $12 million for Clinton. But soft money could play a crucial
role in the final weeks of the campaign, when money becomes scarce,
and candidates seek ways to harvest large sums quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money contributions are raised in unlimited amounts by
party committees, which are legally barred from using them to help
candidates directly; instead, the money is supposed to be used for
so-called party building activities, such as voter drives. Many of
the contributions come from corporations and unions that are
otherwise prohibited from giving political funds.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, soft money has become a gaping loophole in the
regulatory system, with parties increasingly using it in ways that
appear to assist candidates _ by, for example, running
advertisements that promote or attack candidates' views without
explicitly urging viewers to vote for or against the candidates
themselves. Federal regulators have been reluctant to crack down on
the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The two advocacy groups Tuesday focused their complaint on
special fund-raising committees that both Giuliani and Clinton
established in conjunction with the party committees run by the
Republicans and Democrats in the Senate. Other candidates around
the nation have set up similar committees.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates solicit soft money donations for the special
fund raising committees _ New York Senate 2000 for Clinton and the
Giuliani Victory Committee for the mayor. Under the law, the party
committees control the money in the special fund raising
committees, and cannot pledge to use it in the New York race.
</P>
<P>
   But the two advocacy groups asserted that in reality, the party
committees will spend all the money in New York, buying
advertisements that legally should come from the campaigns
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about the criticism from the two groups, Giuliani
said no soft money had yet been spent to assist his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person in this campaign that has spent soft money is
my opponent,'' he said. ``We've raised it and we're holding it, but
we haven't spent it. All of the ads that so far have been on
television for me have been paid for by my campaign. All of the ads
for her have been paid for by the Democratic National Committee
soft-money fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, the Clinton campaign spokesman, said, ``All of our
fund-raising has been perfectly legal.''

<P>
   NORTHPORT, N.Y. _ Sen. John McCain was back on a campaign bus
Tuesday, but this time in support of the U.S. Senate candidacy of
his friend, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who happens to be
in pursuit of the same independent and Democratic vote that made
McCain such a phenomenon in the presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the mayor and the senator tried to turn what even
Republicans say is Giuliani's biggest problem _ his temperament _
into a positive interpretation of character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that Rudy, like me, will be elected Miss
Congeniality in the United States Senate,'' McCain said at a Town
Hall meeting with Giuliani in Suffolk County, where McCain beat
George W. Bush in the March 7 New York primary. ``But I do believe
that he will be an instant star.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said at the meeting, at the Northport American
Legion Hall: ``We need more mild-mannered, even-tempered
individuals like Rudy and myself'' _ and was interrupted by
laughter _ ``who will never rock the boat or say anything that's
controversial in nature. So, I'm looking forward to having a soul
mate in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's appearance, his first on a campaign trail since
suspending his presidential bid in March, was clearly welcomed by
Giuliani, whose campaign has suffered from the mayor's aggressive
attacks on Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man shot dead in
March by police.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, of Arizona, seemed to have a positive effect on the
mayor. Giuliani laughed frequently throughout his morning on Long
Island, was cheerful with reporters and even made fun of himself
when a participant at the Town Hall meeting asked why Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the mayor's opponent, says that the mayor cannot
get along with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she say I can't get along with anybody?'' the mayor
shouted back, stalking toward the participants in mock rage. ``Sit
down! Shut up!''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd laughed and cheered, Giuliani predicted that his
performance would be used by his opponent. ``I can be in a Clinton
campaign commercial!'' he exulted. ``Paid for by soft money!''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was frequently dogged Tuesday by questions about his
own fund raising, which reached $19 million in March, particularly
since he was traveling with the man who made overhauling the
campaign finance system a centerpiece of his presidential campaign
and who vowed to renounce unregulated soft-money donations if he
became the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But as he has in the past, Giuliani said he was raising money as
a defensive tactic against the historically prodigious fund-raising
of the Clinton administration, even though Clinton has raised only
$12 million in this race and now expects the mayor to outspend her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fool,'' Giuliani said over a campaign-stop
breakfast. ``And I don't intend in October to have them pour in
$10, $20 million, have the unions spend $10, $20 million, and be
virtually defenseless against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain said that he was grateful for Giuliani's support
of his campaign finance bill, McCain-Feingold, but ``I understand
that when you are in this kind of a race, you have to raise
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani remained in buoyant spirits all morning, particularly
during an unusual _ for the mayor _ relaxed and open session with a
small group of reporters on a bus that Giuliani shared with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, it was a day of what he called ``very warm
memories'' of his old campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express,
where such sessions with reporters were constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been on a bus this nice before,'' Giuliani marveled
of the Peter Pan VIP coach with sofas and tables, suitable for a
touring rock band. ``This is terrific. The campaign bus that we
used in the past was like a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani supported Bush in the New York primary, but kept a
much-remarked-upon distance from him as he simultaneously praised
McCain and refused to engage in the tough state Republican Party
tactics used to defeat him. McCain publicly thanked Giuliani at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said the mayor would far prefer to have McCain
at his side than Bush, whose appeal to conservatives could alienate
the independents and Democrats Giuliani needs to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor acknowledged as much on the bus. ``He has proven that
he can put the good of the country as he sees it ahead of partisan
politics,'' Giuliani said of McCain. ``And I think that's very
appealing as it should be to independent voters, to Democrats who
are willing to consider voting for a candidate of the other party.
So I think having his support means a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Town Hall meeting , composed of invited
Republicans, legionnaires and enthusiastic walk-ins, asked
questions about home heating oil, gun control and Elian Gonzalez,
the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose mother drowned at sea while bringing
her son from Cuba to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Clinton, Giuliani said he supported legislation
granting Elian permanent resident status. ``His mother gave her
life so that this boy would not grow up in tyranny,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the bus, Giuliani and McCain also talked about the mayor's
favorite television show, ``The Sopranos,'' about a mafia family in
New Jersey. ``How authentic is it?'' said the mayor, a former
prosecutor. ``I mean, this is where I really spent my life. It is
very, very close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you the picture,'' Giuliani said, ``of a group of
people that aren't very different than everybody else but for the
pathological way in which they conduct their business. And
therefore, they can be totally horrible and totally evil, or they
can be these enormously complex people who love their children,
love their friends, but then every once in a while go out and kill
one of them.''

DUVAL SAYS IT'S HIS TIME; NORMAN IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ As the start of the Masters drew closer Tuesday,
so did the anticipation among the players. Greg Norman, preparing
for his 20th Masters, is running out of time to win a green jacket.
David Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked player, has been blunt about
his intentions to win a major this year. Tiger Woods, with three
victories and three second-place finishes in his last seven starts,
has never entered a major with more momentum.
</P>
<P>
   So while practice rounds continued at Augusta National Golf
Club, thoughts drifted toward Thursday, when the tournament will
begin, along with the drama.
</P>
<P>
   For Duval, waiting for the Masters has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure on me, because I put it on myself,''
said Duval, who vowed in January to win a major this year. ``I've
worked very hard, and I hope everything falls into place. We've
been talking about it for a few months. We're going to find out
very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The players will also find out about the impact of course
alterations that will give some of the holes a different feel. Some
fairways have been narrowed, new pin positions have been added at
Nos. 10, 12, 13 and 16. Most players expect the course's degree of
difficulty to increase, particularly if conditions are windy.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' record-setting winning score of 18 under par in 1997
appears safe. When asked about the course changes, Woods said
players may have to take a more cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest adjustment is going to be the fairways,'' Woods
said. ``They're smaller. Some of the rough lines are different.
It'll make it very interesting, I'll tell you that. You can't go
out there and take driving for granted like you used to around
here. It's going to be quite a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   For Norman, a return to Augusta means revisiting an assortment
of memories, including heartbreaking defeats. In 1987, Larry Mize
chipped in from 140 feet to defeat Norman in a playoff. In 1996, in
one of the most stunning final rounds, Norman squandered a
seemingly insurmountable six-stroke lead on Sunday, collapsing with
a final-round 78 and losing to Nick Faldo. Then last year, Norman
stormed into contention again, playing brilliantly before finishing
third, three strokes behind the winner, Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   With six finishes in the top three at Augusta, but no victories,
Norman thought he would have a green jacket by now. When asked if
he thought much about his disappointments, he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought about that, I'd go crazy,'' said Norman, who
turned 45 years old in February. ``To come up with a logical answer
is not logical. Of the 20 years being here, it has just been a huge
emotional roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman won the British Open in both 1986 and 1993, but he
expects to be competitive in only a few more majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality is reality,'' Norman said. ``When you start hitting
45, 46, it's a little hard to get out of bed. There's a few more
cricks and pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many players, however, Norman said he always feels better
once he arrives at Augusta. Olazabal was struggling heading into
last year's tournament, yet found his game and captured a memorable
victory. When Mark O'Meara won in 1998, he shot an opening-round
74, but found his putting stroke in time to win his first major at
age 41.
</P>
<P>
   Those kind of memories help make the Masters special, and
starting Thursday, the latest chapter will start to unfold. Duval,
along with many others, was glad that the wait was almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether there's rough or not, whether the greens are hard or
fast, whether they make alterations to the course every year, it
doesn't matter,'' Duval said. ``There's still going to be a Masters
champion come Sunday. And I'm very much looking forward to this.''

A TALL TEXAN MUST LEAD THIS DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ As an imported New York Yankee, Roger Clemens
has worked hard to fit into their championship cast, to be himself,
the down-home Texan and hard-throwing Rocket. Now if only Cy Young
will revisit his right arm and make him whole.
</P>
<P>
   He was not himself last season, or at least not the pitcher he
was in Toronto the previous two. In the final box score and
analysis, it didn't matter. Clemens left to a standing ovation in
Yankee Stadium the night this most famous franchise won the World
Series for the 25th time. A year of pitching dangerously had quite
the climactic ending, even if it came without the rest of the
storybook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the ring ceremonies when we get back
home,'' Clemens said before pitching against the Angels here
Tuesday night, and following a familiar Yankee formula _ strong
starting pitching plus timely hitting equals another save by
Mariano Rivera _ in the season opener Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens redeemed himself against Atlanta for his modest
performance last season (14-10, 4.60 earned run average), or at
least that was the spin on the postseason pitch. He was forgiven
for impersonating, or being, an aging power pitcher. He earned the
ring. Now comes what could be a trickier process, deserving a
raise.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't talk about next year, and neither do the Yankees, but
it is out there, the belief that George Steinbrenner made an
agreement with Clemens' agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks, to extend
his contract upon acquiring him last spring. Steinbrenner is not
likely to treat two leveraged player agents from the powerhouse SFX
the way he would the politicians who are trying to get his
commitment to remain in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Boss has been known to employ other methods of
dealing with star players (see Winfield, Dave) who have him backed
into a financial corner but whose performances have not met his
level of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Like any sure-fire Hall of Famer, Clemens has flattering goals
for himself, another 20 victories that would accelerate his pace to
300, from the 247 he began with Tuesday night. But he's also tasted
Champagne now, got high on Yankee success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won 20 numerous times and five Cy Youngs,'' he said. ``If
it means 15-15 and having the opportunity to pitch in the World
Series, that overrides any individual achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a bad pitcher last season, just not the same one who
was selected to baseball's All Century team. The Yankees sure made
their share of excuses for Clemens. He was trying too hard and he
was struggling with location and pitching to a new set of catchers.
The truth was, as David Cone said last night, ``We didn't see his
good splitter and slider last year.''
</P>
<P>
   There never was an urgency for the Clemens of old. Even in the
three postseason series, by the time he pitched, the Yankees had
their claws around the opposition's throat.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, in the last game of the 20th century, that was Cy
Young Clemens out there against the Braves, and his mother, Bess,
who suffers from emphysema, traveled to see him pitch, and back
home in Houston, his winter days were filled with more
``way-to-gos,'' than ever.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't watched the tape of Game 4, because the off-season, he
said, is about family, about fatherhood. ``I'm not the Rocket to
them,'' he said of his four children. Then again, they are named
Koby, Kory, Kacy and Kody, so down-home dad likely has more
invested in Rocket-hood than he lets on.
</P>
<P>
   Cone called him ``the greatest pitcher of our generation,'' and
remarked how strange it was to hear him booed in Boston, in Texas,
and when he struggled in New York. ``It was like he didn't have a
home,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston last week, Clemens had the whole team out to his
house. Cone has sensed a larger leadership role for Clemens this
spring. That said, it could get hot and sticky if Clemens doesn't
pitch with a vintage flourish this summer. For one thing, the
Yankees might actually find themselves in a pennant race. For
another, Cone, also 37, could have as good a year or better and not
be extended an invitation to return. And Cone has merely been a
pillar of support on three title teams, not to mention one of New
York's most engaging voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing unusual _ I've got the same target dates every year,''
Clemens said, making this one out to be like any other on the eve
of his 2000 debut.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't. Clemens rode a bandwagon last season, and took a big
bow at the finish. This time around, beginning Tuesday night, he
has to help steer.
</P>

EDITORIAL: A QUESTION OF LITERARY ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, April 5: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an irritable little book published late last year about The
New Yorker magazine, Renata Adler suddenly veers from her literary
prey to take a swipe at one of the heroes of the Watergate era,
Judge John Sirica. The passage, in ``Gone: The Last Days of The New
Yorker,'' is written as an aside, a dismissal of the respected
jurist as a ``corrupt, incompetent, and dishonest figure, with a
close connection to Sen. Joseph McCarthy and clear ties to
organized crime.'' Since Sirica is dead, he is unable to sue for
libel. But that does not lift the ethical burden from Adler to
support her charges with evidence she says exists _ evidence that
she and her editors at Simon &AMP; Schuster, for some unfathomable
reason, omitted from her book.
</P>
<P>
   Sirica, a tough jurist known as ``Maximum John'' in the
courthouse, relentlessly pursued the facts about the 1972 Watergate
break-in, a case that eventually led to the resignation of
President Nixon. Adler's charges startled some of the nation's best
investigative journalists who had covered Watergate and found
Sirica to be a principled jurist with no known connections to
organized crime. If Adler is raising a long-simmering allegation
that Sirica's father was a bootlegger during Prohibition, she will
need to document that unproven contention and show how it relates
to the judge himself.
</P>
<P>
   Adler was cavalier when she dismissed as ``deeply silly'' a
Times reporter's inquiry as to why she had not yet documented her
inflammatory charge. She was even more irresponsible when she asked
the reporter, ``Do you worry that much about people's
reputations?'' Of course we do, and so should she. Adler said she
would produce her evidence about Sirica ``soon, in a place I think
it appropriate.'' Only then will we know whether she has unearthed
some remarkable evidence of historical importance, or smeared a
renowned jurist who is no longer able to fight back.

EDITORIAL: THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, April 5: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the arrest this week of Momcilo Krajisnik, the
international war crimes tribunal is closing in on the architects
of the mass killing of Muslim civilians during the 1992-95 Bosnian
war. For the past four and a half years, NATO troops have kept the
guns of Bosnia silent. But NATO has been hesitant to pursue the top
officials responsible for the slaughter, fearing reprisals or even
a renewal of ethnic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik was indicted by the tribunal earlier this year for a
grim list of atrocities. These include the expulsion of hundreds of
thousands of Muslims and Croats from some 40 villages and towns,
the massacre of hundreds of civilians, and criminal activities at
11 prison camps where Muslims and Croats were tortured and executed
on his orders. He is the highest-ranking wartime leader brought
before the tribunal, and his trial will lend added authority to the
court. During the war, Krajisnik was the second most powerful
political leader on the Bosnian Serb side, subordinate only to
President Radovan Karadzic, who has been indicted for many of the
same crimes but is still at large. Also indicted but still
uncaptured is Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia now has perhaps its best chance since the Dayton
agreement to begin the difficult process of ethnic reconciliation.
Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president who encouraged violent
separatism among Bosnia's Croats during the war and then worked to
undermine the federation between Croats and Muslims after the
peace, died late last year. His successors in Zagreb favor
constructive cooperation between Bosnian Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the arrest of Krajisnik and others indicted for war
crimes rightly assigns accountability for the horrors of 1992-95 to
leading policy makers rather than to the entire Bosnian Serb
population. It may now be possible to arrest Karadzic and Mladic
without provoking a revival of ethnic conflict or exposing NATO
troops to retaliatory attacks. France's willingness to move against
indicted Bosnian Serbs _ Krajisnik was captured by French commandos
_ is especially encouraging. The risk to NATO forces must be
carefully weighed, but the alliance can serve the interests of
justice in Bosnia if it can arrest other indicted Bosnian Serb
leaders. &QL;

JACKSON HOPES KOBE WILL COOL IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Kobe Bryant took a retaliatory swing at the
Knicks' Chris Childs on Sunday, Lakers coach Phil Jackson said it
was a ``natural reaction.'' But he also hopes Bryant's first career
fight will be his last for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times in any game, in any season, that players will
do this,'' Jackson said. ``Even Michael Jordan took a swing at
(Indiana's) Reggie Miller. God knows he deserved it, but it still
doesn't mean it's right. Or it still doesn't mean he could get away
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, you get suspended. From that standpoint, with
the playoffs on our heels here and just a few games left in the
regular season, you've got to put your mind in a certain sense of,
`Hey, this could cost my team a game in the playoffs if I retaliate
like this.' It's a good reminder of how to keep your cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates saw Bryant's return fire as a good sign that the
21-year-old would stand up for himself and wasn't afraid to get
physical.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, who lectured Shaquille O'Neal after he was
suspended earlier this season for fighting, made it clear that he
doesn't want to see a repeat performance from Bryant either ``No, I
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said defenders are grabbing him more lately. Jackson said
that's a response to the Lakers' league-best record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not Kobe so much as every team wants to beat the
Lakers right now, because we're on a tear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to test on what level you'll play at, how far
you have to take (us) down to play at this level. So coaches are
probably animated, encouraging teams to get tough and play physical
and do all these things. So it's probably going to escalate from
here through the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   NO REST: Jackson confirmed that he's unlikely to place veteran
Ron Harper on the injured list, although he wouldn't rule it out
entirely. The combination of Bryant's suspension and Harper's
steady play of late made Jackson reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do it (today) if we wanted to (when Bryant returns),
but we don't feel like as much that it's necessary, perhaps,
because the end result, the rhythm he's playing with, being in
stride, all those things, takes a player a couple games to get back
into (it),'' Jackson said. ``If a guy misses too many games, he
needs enough games to play to get back in speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jackson will give Harper's tendinitis-stricken knees a
rest by cutting back his minutes and possibly holding him out of a
game or two once the Lakers clinch home-court advantage throughout
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works very hard weight-wise, he knows what conditioning
level he has to stay at with his strength in his leg,'' Jackson
said. ``He's playing great. I think he just put a little burst on
because he thought he was going to have a couple days off.'' &QL;
