<P>
   NEW YORK _ A portrait that Picasso painted in just two and a
half hours in 1932 sold at Christie's on Tuesday night for $28.6
million. While that work brought the highest price, Picassos of
different styles and dates accounted for the four top lots in an
auction of 20th-century art that several experts described as hot
and cold.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $72.9 million, in the middle of its estimate of
$64.3 million to $84 million. Of the 42 works offered, 34 found
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The evening made less money and sold fewer paintings, drawings
and sculptures than Christie's sale of Impressionist and
post-Impresssionist art on Monday night, which totaled $104.5
million for 42 sold out of 47 works offered. The big difference was
the atmosphere. Monday's bidders were both controlled and
controlling in terms of prices. On Tuesday night, top-quality works
tended to sell far above expectations; less desirable ones were
dismissed in short order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong market, but at the same time not crazy,'' said
Christopher Burge, Christie's honorary chairman, who was the
evening's auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The sale's one blockbuster _ ``Still Life With Tulips,'' the
1932 Picasso portrait of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter _
appeared to have three serious bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is particularly unusual: it is both a portrait and
a still life. It was painted on March 2, 1932, and on the back
Picasso recorded not simply the date but the hours he painted it: 9
to 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had estimated it would bring $25 million to $30
million and had given the seller, an unidentified European
collector who had owned it since 1957, a guarantee (an undisclosed
minimum price that an auction house promises the seller regardless
of the sale's outcome).
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, several theories about the identity of the buyer
were discussed outside Christie's. Some people sitting directly in
front of Burge said they thought the buyer was a Sammy Ofer, the
Israeli shipping magnate. Others said that the winning bid, which
was taken by Barbara Strongin, Christie's director of auction
operations, was made by Christie's, buying the painting back.
Auction house officials would say only that the painting was bought
by an ``anonymous buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four Picassos sold well above their estimates. ``Head
of a Woman With Bangs,'' painted on June 2, 1938, was estimated at
$2 million to $3 million. Five bidders tried hard to take home the
decorative portrait of the artist's mistress Dora Maar. It
eventually sold to an unidentified bidder for $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A far later Picasso, ``The Painter and His Model,'' executed
from April 2 to 6, 1963, shows the artist armed with a palette and
brush sitting at his easel painting a nude model facing him. Six
bidders went for the painting, estimated at $1.5 million to $2
million. It was finally sold for $3.7 million to Franck Giraud,
Christie's head of 19th- and 20th-century art worldwide, bidding by
telephone for an unidentified client.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso's ``Bust of Woman Seated on a Chair,'' painted on Oct.
12, 1939, also brought a high price, though not as high as
Christie's had hoped. Another unidentified telephone bidder bought
it for $4.7 million, just over its low estimate of $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include Christie's commission, 17.5 percent of the
first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates
do not reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   One record was set on Tuesday night, for a drawing by Matisse.
``Study for `Pink Nude''' (1935) attracted a seven determined
bidders. A preparatory drawing for a painting in the Cone
Collection at the Baltimore Museum of Art, it was expected to bring
$1 million to $1.5 million but was finally bought for $2.7 million
by a gray-haired man glued to a cell phone, whom Christie's
described as a European dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything did so well for Christie's. It had guaranteed a
Cy Twombly painting, ``Untitled'' (1968), one of the few works in
the artist's blackboard series executed on a white background. It
was estimated at $3 million to $4 million. Several people tried to
buy it, but only for the right price. It went to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Kline's ``Untitled'' (1958), a 52-by-91-inch example of
the Abstract Expressionist painter's black-and-white compositions,
was estimated at $2.2 million to $3.2 million. No one lifted a
paddle, and Burge stopped trying at $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also unsold was Andy Warhol's 1963 portrait of Elizabeth Taylor,
estimated at $1.8 million to $2.5 million; it never drew a bid
higher than $1.2 million.

INDUSTRY SET TO SHOW OFF NEW GAMES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1999, it was Sega's turn to be belle of the
ball, but in 2000, it's Sony's, as the video-gaming business
gathers in Los Angeles this week for its biggest dance of the year,
the Electronic Entertainment Expo.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling annual trade show, known as E3, consumes seemingly
every corner of the mammoth Los Angeles Convention Center. It gets
an early start today with press conferences from both Sony and
Nintendo, but officially runs Thursday through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is expected to finally reveal some of the details of the
U.S. version of the PlayStation 2, the eagerly awaited successor to
the most successful video-gaming console in history. More than 70
million PlayStation units sold worldwide since being introduced
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When it debuted in Japan in March, the PlayStation 2 sold a
whopping 1 million units its first week, despite what was largely
considered a mediocre set of initially available games.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. gamers have been eagerly awaiting the machine, all the more
so because the American launch titles look much more satisfying,
using the PS2's remarkable graphic and computing power to go beyond
even the Sega Dreamcast, which debuted strongly last September
after dominating E3.
</P>
<P>
   The PS2 offers substantially more powerful graphic capabilities
than the Dreamcast, and also plays DVDs and the thousands of games
created for the original PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   And Sony has been currying companies, such as movie studios and
record labels, outside the gaming industry to create new kinds of
interactive experiences for its machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has been hyped for so long, promising incredible
graphics and just about anything developers have dreamed of doing,
they can do with this machine,'' said Ben Rinaldi, senior editor of
Game WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   But Sony hasn't revealed crucial details about the machine's
U.S. version, such as its debut date or price (in Japan, about
$360). The best guesses are October and $299, said Rinaldi.
</P>
<P>
   Sony may also use the show to respond to Microsoft's recent
announcement of its own powerful new video-gaming console, the
X-Box, due out in late 2001. To compete with X-Box's remarkable
technical specifications, many observers believe Sony will add
features like a built-in modem or networking card for Internet
access and a hard drive to store character information, Internet
downloads and more.
</P>
<P>
   Expect at least most of those questions to get answered this
week. Much less, however, is expected to come from Nintendo's press
conference today at a downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company used E3 to announce initial plans for its
next-generation console, the Dolphin. Since then, Nintendo has said
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll continue to be silent,'' said John Davison,
editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, the largest
enthusiast magazine in the console business. ``Everyone is in kind
of glamorous, glitzy mode, but Nintendo will keep plodding along
with good first-party games and putting money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because though the Nintendo 64 seems woefully out of date
compared to the new machines, and most outside companies have
stopped making new games for it, Nintendo's terrific stable of
in-house developers are pumping out several much-anticipated titles
this year, including sequels to Goldeneye, Zelda and Banjo Kazooie.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo also sells the Game Boy handheld device, buoyed by the
fabulously successful Pokemon franchise, which will see at least
two more versions, Gold and Silver, released this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company also may show off its Game Boy Advance, which
combines gaming with a personal digital organizer and wireless
communication capabilities, in a bid to challenge popular devices
such as the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   The Advance, which is months from release, also faces
competition from the Cybiko, a handheld hybrid device debuting at
E3.
</P>
<P>
   The Cybiko is both a personal organizer and a gaming machine,
with an absolutely tiny keyboard and stylus. It has built-in
900-Mhz wireless capabilities, like some home phone systems, that
allow you to share information with other Cybiko owners within
about 300 feet. And it can link to the computer to send and receive
emails. The $149 device targets teens.
</P>
<P>
   Other kinds of hardware and tech toys will be on display this
week, like the Poo-Chi from Hasbro, whose subsidiary Tiger
Electronics scored big a couple of years ago with the Furby.
</P>
<P>
   The digital doggie isn't as sophisticated as Sony's Aibo robot,
but it's a lot cheaper, and still managed to be a huge hit in
Japan, selling out a 10,000-unit run in rapid fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides all the hardware, more than 2,400 games will be on
display, said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association, show's organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up (500 titles) from last year, which frankly was
surprising to me,'' Lowenstein said. ``Competition is pretty
intense out there. A lot of products go to market that don't
succeed, and certainly don't make money. One would think one would
see a tapering off of new titles. But it's been counterbalanced by
the whole casual-gaming segment that's growing.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the business generated nearly $7.5 billion in sales,
online and rental revenues last year, and is on track this year to
do slightly better, Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   That's despite the cyclical downturn characteristic when a new
generation of gaming consoles is about to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Casual gaming actually dominates this year's offerings, an IDSA
survey showed. Nearly two-thirds of the games on display will
target people who want lower-cost, graphically simpler titles that
typically are based on franchises they know from other media.
</P>
<P>
   That casual gamer market is broad-based, from people playing
solitaire online to families playing an electronic version of
Monopoly to arm-chair hunters picking off big game in the latest
knockoff of Deer Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   That emphasis also fits with a markedly different
political/cultural atmosphere from last year, when Lowenstein was
defending the industry in the wake of the mass killings at
Columbine High School in Colorado. The two youthful killers were
fans of gory, first-person shooter titles.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Lowenstein can point to an industry where the three
top sellers on the PC were ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
the clever and complex simulations ``RollerCoaster Tycoon'' and
``SimCity 3000.''
</P>
<P>
   He also can point to the rapid rise of Hasbro Interactive, which
in less than five years has become one of the industry's biggest
publishers by making video-game hits out of converted board games
like Monopoly and updated vintage titles like Frogger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This segment is growing and companies are looking at it,''
Lowenstein said. ``It's potentially a very profitable segment. Look
at the cost of making richer, deeper, more immersive games.
Companies realize if you make that investment (in a top-quality
game), it's not automatic that you'd have a profitable project at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there won't be upscale titles, and there won't
be controversy. Going into the show, controversy has most dogged
``Soldier of Fortune,'' a bloody game loosely connected to the
mercenary's magazine, and ``Panty Raider,'' a goofball revision of
the frat-rat pastime involving supermodels, lingerie and aliens
that has angered feminist and pro-family groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein called such protests an ``episodic'' hazard of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will continue to be the case as people see products and
hear about products they think go too far,'' Lowenstein said.
``They ignore the fact that the products represent an incredibly
small part of the market.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Undaunted by the slim odds of Tuesday night's draw, people in
several states rushed to join a ticket-buying frenzy for the
largest potential jackpot in the history of lotteries: $350
million.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of hitting a winning ticket for the seven-state
lottery called The Big Game, which is sold in Georgia, Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia, were
one in 76 million, said Tandi Reddick, a spokeswoman for the
Georgia Lottery Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not slow people intent on a chance at the jackpot.
In the Northeast, New Yorkers flocked over the bridges and through
the tunnels to New Jersey on Tuesday, to buy the $1 tickets in
anticipation of last night's drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Others relied on colleagues, friends and family members from New
Jersey to give them a shot at the prize. Justin M. Turner, a senior
associate at the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, put
in $5 and joined an office pool of about 40 tickets, bought by a
colleague from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your odds increase when you're in a pool, even though it is
still about a zillion to one that we will pick the right numbers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing took place on Tuesday night at 11 p.m. at the WSB-TV
studios in Atlanta; the winning numbers were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and
Big Ball 4. No announcement of any possible winners was expected to
be made until 6 o'clock Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The total jackpot, going to just one person, would pay, after
taxes, either $8.9 million a year for 26 years, or a lump sum of
$114 million.
</P>
<P>
   The enormity of these numbers drew a steady stream of ticket
buyers at a Krauszer's Food Store in West Orange, N.J., on Tuesday.
The buyers said that the prospect of winning, while remote, was too
remarkable to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they were underwhelmed by their own prospects, hope
sprang eternal for their relatives and friends across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Foster, a computer consultant from West Orange, was there
on Tuesday buying tickets for himself and his brother in Florida _
60 in total.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's prize had been growing since March 3, when one
winning ticket purchased in Massachusetts brought in a jackpot of
$18 million. Previously, the largest American jackpot was $295.7
million, drawn in a Powerball lottery by 13 machinists in
Westerville, Ohio, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In raw numbers, only one jackpot worldwide has been larger than
the one drawn Tuesday. In December, a lottery in Spain called El
Gordo, or the Fat One, reached $1.2 billion. But that sum was
broken up into thousands of prizes, spreading the individual
winnings thinner.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by a bipartisan cast of elder statesmen,
President Clinton Tuesday warned that failure by Congress to
approve permanent normal trade relations with China will only end
up hurting the United States economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we vote for this, 10 years from now we will wonder why this
was a hard fight,'' Clinton said at a White House event attended by
former Presidents Ford and Carter and former Secretaries of State
Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker III. ``And if Congress votes
against it, they'll be kicking themselves in the rear 10 years from
now because America will be paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The president brought out the all-star group as he intensified
his effort to convince lawmakers to ease trading relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote on the China trade bill scheduled for later this
month is expected to be close, with many members of the president's
party opposed to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest tally by the Reuters news agency, 161
House members have said they were supporting or leaning toward
voting for the trade measure, 57 votes short of the 218 needed to
clear the 435-member House. Ninety-seven lawmakers said they are
undecided and 163 have indicated they are opposed to the measure. A
total of 14 lawmakers did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   The trade measure is expected to pass the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is opposed by human rights advocates and
organized labor, who fear that American jobs will be replaced by
cheap Chinese labor.
</P>
<P>
   However, business and agriculture interests have backed an
improved trade relationship, saying it will open up a lucrative
overseas market to their products.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and others have argued that the trade deal would be
a boost to the U.S. economy. The president said that even if
Congress doesn't approve the deal, China still will join the World
Trade Organization, which will ease its ability to trade with Japan
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition of unions to the trade pact has put Vice
President Al Gore in a difficult position because he is relying on
organized labor's members and money to help in his presidential
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore showed up at the White House event and stood with
Clinton to strongly endorse the China trade pact, arguing ``it is
right for American jobs. It is right for the cause of reform in
China and I believe it will move us closer to the strong and stable
world community we all seek to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on their experience with China over the past decades,
the former presidents and Cabinet officials acknowledged human
rights abuses in China. But they said the United States would be in
a better position to encourage change in China by trading with the
huge Asian powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperative relations with China are in the American national
interest,'' said Kissinger, who helped engineer President Nixon's
trip to China _ a seminal event that helped thaw relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who noted that he first voted for a China trade agreement
as a House member in the 1940s, said the measure's defeat would be
``catastrophic, disastrous to American agriculture, electronics,
telecommunications, autos and countless other products and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carter, who has championed human rights issues around the
world, noted that most Chinese human rights advocates approve of
better trade relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``China still has not measured up to the human rights and
democracy standards and labor standards of America, but there is no
doubt in my mind that a negative vote on this issue in the Congress
will be a serious setback and impediment for the further
democratization, freedom and human rights in China,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who served as secretary of state in the Bush
administration, noted that over the years there has been bipartisan
support for improving trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush was unable to attend the White House
event, although administration officials were quick to note that he
backed the China trade bill.

HULL DECLARES STATEWIDE BUDDHA DAY  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - The Bible is out and Buddha is in when it comes to
Gov. Jane Hull's proclamation preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who last year vowed never to proclaim another statewide
``Bible Week'' because she didn't want to offend any religious
group, signed a proclamation May 3 ``to commemorate the birth of
Sakyamuni Buddha.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was unavailable Tuesday, but spokeswoman Francie
Noyes said the Buddha birthday proclamation differs from Bible
Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proclamation endorses the ideas of tolerance and
liberty,'' she said. ``The idea it promotes is one of religious
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull and Gilbert Mayor Cynthia Dunham are the only state
political leaders to honor the founder of Buddhism, who was born in
Nepal 2,540 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dunham recognized May 17 as Buddha's birthday during
the Town Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Eisenberg, director of the Arizona Civil Liberties
Union, had asked to speak at the meeting, but the mayor did not
acknowledge her before making the proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Arizona branch of the American Civil Liberties
Union sued Hull and Dunham for their Bible Week proclamations.
</P>
<P>
   Hull rescinded her Bible Week because of the suit. Dunham,
backed by lawyers from Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and
Justice, fought for hers.
</P>
<P>
   In September, U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver dismissed the
ACLU's suit on grounds the Gilbert residents named as plaintiffs
didn't prove they were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   She did not rule on the proclamation's constitutionality, and
the ACLU has asked her to reconsider the dismissal. Silver has not
yet ruled, and Dunham proclaimed Bible Week last year.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said she is to meet with the organization's legal
committee Wednesday to determine what action, if any, it will take
on the Buddha proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACLU fights for the free exercise of religion,'' she said.
``But government should not promote or endorse religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg earlier said she was surprised to learn Hull issued a
Buddha proclama tion ``because it is inconsistent with her stated
intent not to offend anyone with religious proclamations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Terry Kennard-Dhamapala of Chandler made the requests and
was notified of Hull's proclamation Tuesday. The Bible Week issue
inspired him to make his Buddha birthday requests.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunham insists her proclamations for the Bible and Buddha
are cultural and historical, not religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bible Week isn't about religion,'' she said. ``It's about
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull signed the proclamation just as Kennard-Dhamapala submitted
it, but Dunham cut the following: ``Religion is most free when it
is observed voluntarily at private initiative uncontaminated by
government interference and unconstrained by majority
preference.'' &QL;

FBI HAD FILES ON GOLDWA
 TER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY CAROL SOWERS 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - The late Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, creator of
modern conservatism, was once thought to be too liberal by the FBI,
in part because he was backed by ``a large percentage of Negroes''
during his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The files, which were published Monday by APBnews.com, a
Web-based news service, also show that FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover's G-men linked Goldwater to a mob ster and disclosed that
Goldwater had been the target of 20 threats, one of which forced
him to detour his plane during his 1964 GOP presiden tial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During Hoover's watch, the FBI was known for launching
investigations into political leaders and Black organizations, and
for its exhaustive search for Communists and mob figures.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater fell into that net, even though he was ``as straight
as a string,'' said John Rhodes, a former Arizona congressman who
served alongside the senator during more than 30 years in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, 83, said Tuesday that he was shocked to learn that the
FBI kept files on Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any reason why they would,'' Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FBI released only a portion of its files on the
senator, the documents reveal that the agency doggedly pursued
Goldwater, known as ``Mr. Conservative,'' during much of his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the senator defended Hoo ver and his investigations,
and the two were friends.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the most startling revelations in the 1,364 pages
ob tained by APBnews.com under the federal Freedom of Information
Act is the first entry, dated Feb. 3, 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI document says that Gold water, Arizona's newly elected
sena tor, had been mentioned several times during a meeting of the
Pro gressive Party in Phoenix in Novem ber 1952, the year he was
elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Party members, the FBI said, were talking about ``the manner in
which the Progressive Party might influence Senator-elect Goldwater
and cause him to support the program and aspirations of the
Progressive Party, since he was supported by a large percentage of
Negroes in the Phoenix area.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes laughed aloud at the entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' he said. ``I think they (the FBI) were a
little out of line worried about anyone being in the Progressive
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 entry also includes a letter from Hoover to Goldwater
indicating that the senator had re quested a look at his own FBI
files.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoover, who wouldn't be bound by the federal Freedom of
Informa tion Act until 1966, refused to give him the files.
</P>
<P>
   In a short note to Goldwater, Hoover said the ``files of this
bureau are maintained as confidential and avail able for official
use only.''
</P>
<P>
   Well into Goldwater's second Senate term, the FBI issued a
curious memorandum on the square-jawed senator.
</P>
<P>
   In the March 4, 1959, memo, the FBI connected Goldwater to
Phoenix racketeer Willie Bioff, who died in a car bombing in 1955,
and at the same time thanked Goldwater for supporting the agency on
the Senate floor five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Agents said Goldwater, who left the Senate in 1986 and died in
1998 at age 89, had once sought a presiden tial pardon for Bioff,
but made no other reference to their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes remembers Bioff ``as a Las Vegas gambling type'' and said
Goldwater ``had nothing to do with him officially.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 memo also praised Gold water for denouncing a magazine
article criticizing the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also detail 20 threats against Goldwater during
his unsuc cessful White House bid in 1964. Hoover wrote a July 1964
memo asking his agents to carefully list the threats so agents
wouldn't be con fused about which were under inves tigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 10, 1964, memo titled ``Threat To Assassinate Senator
Barry Goldwater,'' the FBI said an unidentified man in California
asked a woman whether she was ``as desperate about GOLDWATER as I
am, and wondered whether she knew of anyone else who felt as he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   That same day, while talking with another woman, the man said he
was going to assassinate Goldwater, the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   Just 11 days later, a man appeared at the FBI office in Phoenix,
calling Goldwater a ``buzzard, a ruthless individual who is a
fascist, Commu nist and one who would utterly destroy American
democracy if elected president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents escorted the man out of their office.
</P>
<P>
   Another threat in August 1964 forced the FBI to detour
Goldwater's plane from Washington National Airport to Dulles
International Air port, and two months later, a man was spotted
peering into Goldwater's home with binoculars.

FEDERAL JUDGE BARS U.S. FROM DEPORTING BOY FROM THAILAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge delayed the deportation of a
2-year-old boy to Thailand on Tuesday, saying that he had questions
about the boy's safety.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Dickran Tevrizian of U.S. District Court, acting at
the request of lawyers for the boy, Phanupong Khaisri, issued a
temporary restraining order against the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that prevented the agency from deporting him
for 10 days.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tevrizian said he had concerns about the boy's safety in
Thailand, and scheduled a hearing for May 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't, as a parent . . . just simply return this child back
to Thailand after what this child has been through,'' The
Associated Press quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would appoint two doctors to examine Phanupong, who
had suffered an ear infection and flu after he arrived in the
United States. The restraining order came shortly after members of
the Thai community here had gone to court to block Phanupong's
return as they sought custody safeguards similar to those afforded
Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy whose case has inflamed passions in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Phanupong had been taken into custody on April 11 by the
immigration service, which said he was being used as a decoy by a
group smuggling women into the United States. The boy had been
detained at Los Angeles International Airport with a man and woman
posing as his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates representing the child said they feared that sending
him back to Thailand without more investigation could put him in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai government, working with the immigration service, had
intended to return the boy to Thailand on Tuesday. But advocates
refused to give the boy to Thai officials on Tuesday morning and
filed a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   After he arrived in the United States, the boy had been placed
with a social worker through the Thai Community Development Center,
a nonprofit organization that serves the Thai residents in
California.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the boy's mother was sold into sexual
slavery at the age of 12, and Phanupong had been in the care of his
maternal grandmother until February, when his mother sold him for
about $260. It is believed that he had been used as a decoy at
least two other times.
</P>
<P>
   The father, according to the lawsuit, had contracted HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, and had committed suicide when the boy was
just a few months old.
</P>
<P>
   Although the paternal grandparents have agreed to adopt
Phanupong, advocates for the boy said they believed the case was
being rushed in a way that could further traumatize him. They said
they feared that the boy would be placed in an orphanage while his
adoption was processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the widespread nature of corruption, bribery and child
trafficking in Thailand, we are very concerned that unless custody
is transferred to his paternal grandparents he may find himself
back in the stream of illicit child trafficking once again,'' said
Peter A. Schey, president of the Center for Human Rights and
Constitutional Law, who filed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit had asked that the immigration service provide a
formal hearing before the boy leaves the country, that his parole
status be extended temporarily if the request is not granted and
that he be given temporary asylum while custodial arrangements are
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Schey said the U.S. Attorney's Office has agreed to try to
resolve the case in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman for the immigration service, said
officials have been working with the Thai government to assure the
boy's safe return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all working toward the same goal: to ensure the safety
and well being of the young boy,'' Ms. Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chanchanit Martorell, executive director of the Thai Community
Development Center, said that given the child's background and what
he had been through, extra care was needed in the transition to a
new home.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the boy question why the type of scrutiny that was
given to Elian Gonzalez, whose father was interviewed and brought
to the United States, was not being given to this child.
</P>
<P>
   They speculate that the United States is less inclined to go
against a country with which it shares political and economic ties
as opposed to a country such as Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   While there are few similarities between the two cases,
Phanupong has no relatives in the United States and no one is
seeking permanent residency for him, advocates feel that his case
should have been given similar scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has been treated with kids gloves by the attorney
general, the INS and the president,'' Schey said. ``This child is
being treated completely different.''

 ANALYSIS: PLAN MARKS CHANGE IN FOREST SERVICE DIRECTION  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it appears to have satisfied no one completely, the
U.S. Forest Service's proposed new policy on road building in
protected areas marks a dramatic change in federal land policy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was formally released Tuesday, offers a
``preferred alternative'' that would end road construction on 43
million of the 192 million acres of forests and grasslands
administered by the service, most of it in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the proposal changes the service's guiding mandate
from a ``multiple use'' approach emphasizing recreation, grazing,
mining and logging to one of forest preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impressive that the administration and the forest service
have changed from viewing forests as a source for (timber, minerals
and livestock feed) to considering them intrinsically important in
their own right,'' said Warren Alford, a conservation organizer
specializing in forestry issues for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple-use advocates viewed the new plan with suspicion,
warning that it raised the possibility of more stringent
regulations later on. Environmentalists generally applauded the
plan's broad goals but expressed concerns that the proposals didn't
offer sufficient protections.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would delay until 2004 plans to establish a
roadless policy for the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the
world's largest tract of pristine temperate rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also complained that the plan will allow
logging in roadless areas as long as no roads are constructed, and
that off-highway vehicles _ such as tractors and all-terrain
vehicles _ may be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logging and off-road vehicles are real threats to our
remaining wildlands,'' said Alford, ``and the decision to defer the
Tongass isn't in keeping with the president's commitment to a bold
vision for preserving important public lands.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will also allow roads for mining claims in roadless
areas, said forest service spokesman Matt Mathes, explaining that
the controversial federal mining law of 1872 still `'reigns supreme
in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The law allows ``reasonable access'' on legitimate mining claims
for gold, silver, copper, gypsum and barite. The new proposal could
restrict exploration and development for oil, gas, coal, geothermal
sources, sand and pumice.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will be open to public comment for 90 days. The
forest service is expected to make a final decision on a new policy
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   If the preferred alternative is adopted, different areas of the
country will be affected to different degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For example, far more road construction plans would be halted in
Idaho, Montana and Nevada than in California, said Mathes.
</P>
<P>
   That's because California's regional forest service supervisors
decided several years ago to refrain from building roads in areas
that didn't have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there was talk about entering a roadless area in
California for (logging or other projects) it was very
controversial,'' said Mathes. ``As a consequence, the proposal
doesn't affect this state as much as it does some others in the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists emphasize a simple proscription on roads
isn't enough to protect the Golden State's forests _ particularly
its diminished stands of old-growth timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some serious loopholes,'' said Scott Black,
the director of the California Wild Heritage Campaign, a coalition
of about 80 environmental groups devoted to obtaining protections
for California wildlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you can still log,'' said Black. ``You can log with
helicopters, or with cables and towers. The proposal also allows
for the construction of skid trails up to 700 feet long, so you can
ring a grove of old trees with trails, then take them all out by
tractor.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said several stands of ancient trees are threatened in
California because they can be logged by such alternative methods.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists aren't the only ones expressing
dissatisfaction with the plan. Groups favoring the forest service's
historic ``multiple use'' concept are also displeased.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface this looks fairly benign,'' said Don Amador, a
spokesman for the Blue Ribbon Coalition, a group that promotes
varied uses of public land, including recreation and logging.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you look at the Clinton land legacy generally _ his
planning directives, his recent creation of several national
monuments _ we think this could just be a precursor for more
restrictive policies later on,'' Amador said.
</P>
<P>
   Amador said the forest service promises meaningful public
dialogue before a final policy is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But given the administration's record, we aren't (convinced)
there will be legitimate public input at the local level,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amador said he has particular concerns about California in
regard to the new proposal. He said the amount of national forest
land in California available for multiple use almost precisely
matches the area designated to remain roadless under the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a coincidence that makes me nervous,'' he said, fearing
that all California forest land may be made off limits to
commercial and recreational use.

 FEINSTEIN INTRODUCES GUN-LICENSE LEGISLATION  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that the power of a million moms can
defeat the gun lobby, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced
legislation Tuesday to require that gun owners obtain licenses and
register their firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein introduced her measure as thousands of women began
traveling to Washington for a Mother's Day rally on the National
Mall in support of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by march organizers, Feinstein said the rally ``gives us
the opportunity to bring together people around a measure that I
think will be a pivotal one in the upcoming presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic senator's legislation would impose requirements
on gun owners similar to those that exist for drivers. Owners of
handguns, and semiautomatic firearms that use detachable magazines,
would need licenses, which would cost $25. All sales of such
weapons would be recorded and the information transmitted to the
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to say enough is enough and demand of
Congress the passage of commonsense gun laws,'' Feinstein said in a
Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Boxer Present
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was joined by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and they stood before an oversized photograph
of 10 children being led by police away from a Los Angeles day care
center after a shooting there last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, when you want to hunt, you get a hunting
license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license. But when
you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary,'' Feinstein said.
``That makes no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein chose to introduce the measure, nearly a year in the
making, in the days before the ``Million Mom March'' as a way of
galvanizing support and trying to apply pressure to the pro-gun
forces in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although the march is being sponsored by a nonpartisan group,
its leaders stood with Feinstein at Tuesday's news conference and
said licensing and registration is their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Several far more modest gun control measures _ including
legislation to require child safety locks, ban the sale of guns to
minors, and extend a three-day background check to gun shows _ were
passed by the Senate last year. However, they were not approved by
the House and are now languishing in a conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein acknowledged that her more sweeping measure has almost
no chance to pass the current Congress, saying that the most
powerful lobby in Washington is the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one counter-lobby that can stand up to them,''
she said, ``and this is the women in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the political climate in Washington will change
if Democrats prevail in November's election.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Million Mom March hope to attract at least
100,000 _ and perhaps as many as 250,000 _ supporters to the
National Mall on Sunday, and tens of thousands more at spin-off
rallies in 67 other cities, including Oakland (the Oakland rally
begins at 1 p.m. at the Lake Merritt bandstand).
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confrontational atmosphere surrounding the issue,
a Dallas-based group called the Second Amendment Sisters will hold
a counter-march to draw attention to the lives that are saved by
guns every year. Organizers said they ``want to show the American
public that not all women are pro-gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   The two marches will be on opposite sides of the Washington
Monument. The Million Mom March will go east from the monument to
the Capitol, while the Armed Informed Mothers' March will go west
toward the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Texas state Rep. Suzanna Gratia-Hupp will be the keynote speaker
at the pro-gun march. Gratia-Hupp was in a restaurant in Killeen,
Texas, in 1991 when a lone gunman killed 21 people in a shooting
spree, including her parents. She said she believes she could have
saved lives, had she been armed, by shooting the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Only two politicians will speak at the gun control rally:
Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed by a
gunman on a Long Island commuter train, and Maryland Lt. Gov.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, whose father, Robert, was assassinated
32 years ago as he ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's news conference included harrowing stories from
individuals whose families have been shattered by guns.
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Perry of Washington, D.C., told of a 3 a.m. phone call
in which she learned the son of a close friend had been shot dead
in the back and of her agonizing conversation informing the mother.
</P>
<P>
   As tears welled up in her eyes, and rolled down the cheeks of
many others gathered in Senate hearing room, she talked of the
misery inflicted on thousands of families and the loss of freedom
for so many kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't talk to me about your right to carry a firearm,'' she
said, warning lawmakers that they have a choice of either ``signing
on to active gun control legislation or signing out in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun supporters mocked Feinstein's proposed restrictions, saying
they would be followed only by law-abiding citizens and not by the
criminals who terrorize the public with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are fundamentally skeptical that gun
regulation will reduce violent crimes. They favor strict
enforcement of the existing laws,'' said Jim Manown, a spokesman
for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is familiar with the landscape of the Congress
knows that this bill isn't is  &LR; going anywhere,'' Manown said,
accusing Feinstein of engaging in little more than a publicity
stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the senator ever chooses to leave public service, she will
have a sterling career as a publicist.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has been a foe of the gun lobby since she was San
Francisco's mayor nearly two decades ago and sponsored a citywide
handgun ban that was approved by the Board of Supervisors but
ultimately struck down by a state court. In 1994, as a first-term
senator, she pushed through a ban on assault weapons.

 &LR; r &LR; t wrapper  &LR; i A Houston company is selling tickets to the moon
for $12,500, but you have to be dead first.
</P>
<P>
   The Celestis company is now booking reservations for its next
lunar voyage, scheduled for early next year. Space is available,
providing you can fit into a vial the size of a lipstick container.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the fourth flight for the company that, since 1997,
has been sending the cremated ashes of its customers on rockets
into space. Previous trips _ or ``missions,'' as the company calls
them _ have carried the ashes of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry
and drug guru Timothy Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to open the space frontier for everyone,'' said
Charlie Chafer, co-founder of Celestis. ``Baby Boomers want to do
things a little differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has announced exciting plans for anyone planning to
be dead by next year. Not only will there be a second mission to
the moon, but another ship full of ashes will be dispatched into
deep space, on a flight that could last until the end of time. That
one costs $12,500, too.
</P>
<P>
   The ashes are carried aboard commercial rockets launched from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California. Each rocket can
carry 200 vials containing what the company calls a ``symbolic
portion` of a customer's ashes, about 1 percent of the amount from
a typical cremation. Remaining remains remain cq all 3 &LR;  remains  &LR; on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site (www.celestis. com) the company called $12,500
space rides for dead people ``remarkably affordable ... when
compared to the cost of an average funeral.'' Trips into Earth
orbit are even cheaper, at only $5,300.
</P>
<P>
   Payments may be made on the installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who choose the cheaper flight, into Earth orbit, do
not get to stay in space forever. Eventually, the orbit of the
Celestis ``memorial satellite'' decays, and the craft reenters the
atmosphere and ``vaporizes like a shooting star,'' the company said
_ meaning that the customer gets to be burned up twice.
</P>
<P>
   The lunar flights end with a crash landing on the moon. The
company calls it an
</P>
<P>
   ``impact.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker,
whose ashes were aboard the Lunar Prospector spacecraft when it
crashed near the south pole of the moon in 1999.

LAPD OFFICIALS ADMIT THEY NEED FEDERAL HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH, BETH BARRETT AND ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Backed into a corner and embarrassed by U.S.
Justice Department threats, Los Angeles officials admitted Tuesday
that they have failed to reform the LAPD and needed federal help.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders, however, stopped short of saying the city should
give up control of the police force to federal authorities through
a consent decree that would allow a judge or another monitor to
oversee LAPD operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have essentially blown it and that's why the Justice
Department has come in because we haven't done our job,'' said
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to acknowledge that we have failed. We have failed to
push forward an agenda of reform of this city that the citizens ...
said in clear terms was a mandate,'' the councilman said.
</P>
<P>
   As the day passed, it became increasingly clear that the city's
legal wiggle room is extremely limited unless local politicians
demand to see the details of the threatened federal civil rights
lawsuit or are willing to fight the action in open court.
</P>
<P>
   The only option the city has been given to hold off the lawsuit
is to enter into a consent decree with the federal government,
according to a letter that Bill Lann Lee, acting chief of the
Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and a former Los Angeles
civil rights lawyer, hand-delivered to City Attorney Jim Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal government's demands in previous consent decrees
are any indication, the voluntary settlement would include
stripping final control of the LAPD away from the mayor, the Police
Commission and the City Council, and placing it in the hands of a
federal court-appointed monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, in Washington, D.C., to meet with
congressional representatives and other officials on a variety of
issues, argued local leaders - not federal authorities - should
reform the LAPD and continue to control the force.
</P>
<P>
   Standing firmly behind Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Riordan
said in a telephone interview: ``I think there's no one better to
make reforms than the chief, the command staff, the Police
Commission, the inspector general, the independent task force, the
council and myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is local control. I'm convinced we can solve our
own problems,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those tough words, the mayor refused to say whether he
would oppose federal control over the LAPD if it meant avoiding a
civil rights lawsuit that would bring out the full record of
allegations of how the department has ``a pattern and practice'' of
violating civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   He also wouldn't take a stand on a consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to be certain,'' Riordan said. ``I'm not afraid
to work with anybody to resolve our problems. While I'm convinced
we can solve our own problems, we welcome working with the Justice
Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks, also in Washington D.C., could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sat silent throughout a two-hour meeting of Justice
Department and city officials on Monday and has not spoken publicly
about the threat to sue the city unless a consent decree can be
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The details and strength of the Justice Department's case
against the city remain unspecified.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's four-page letter charged that lax supervision within the
LAPD has prompted police officers to engage ``in a pattern or
practice of excessive force, false arrests and unreasonable
searches and seizures.'' The violations go well beyond the alleged
abuses by Rampart Division officers who are now at the center of
the worst police corruption scandal in city history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious deficiencies in City and LAPD policies and procedures
for training, supervising and investigating and disciplining police
officers foster and perpetuate officer misconduct,'' Lee wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year federal review of the Police Department also found
citizen complaints of officer misconduct are not responded to
properly; poorly trained officers are not identified for retraining
or counseling; and the Police Commission and inspector general do
not have the resources to conduct meaningful oversight of the LAPD
in a consistent, ongoing manner.
</P>
<P>
   City officials thus far have not asked to see the details of the
federal case, although meetings with the Justice Department to
discuss the threatened lawsuit are scheduled to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said the LAPD's problems are well documented from the
Rodney King beating to the findings of the Christopher Commission
to the recent internal Board of Inquiry report compiled in the wake
of the Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for us to argue Los Angeles doesn't have problems,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Justice Department says there is a history of
those problems back to Rodney King, and the Christopher Commission
found that there were numerous problems. We still haven't
implemented all the Christopher Commission reforms. Then you pile
on top of that the Rampart scandal,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a court fight would be risky since a federal judge could
order even more stringent controls.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a consent decree, which the City Council could
enter into at any time, could be worded to give the city a role in
selecting a monitor to oversee the reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because there's a monitor doesn't mean you don't have a
police chief,'' Hahn said. ``The department continues to function
and the chief is in charge. If the monitor isn't satisfied, they
can go in and ask for the (case) to be reopened and other steps can
be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said Justice Department officials have offered the consent
degree as a way to bring credibility to the process of reform.
Similar consent decrees have been signed by Pittsburgh and
Steubenville, Ohio. New Jersey politicians also have signed a
voluntary agreement with the Justice Department to give up local
control of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the loss of local control less than desirable, Hahn
said, city and federal officials share the same commitment to
police reforms and getting to the bottom of the Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said any federal lawsuit would likely rely heavily on
materials the city and LAPD have provided the Justice Department
over the past four years. ``There's no dispute we've had
problems,'' Hahn said. ``Whether that rises to the level that
establishes a pattern and practice (of civil rights violations), is
something we'll evaluate further. We can't be in a position of
denying there have been significant problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Protective League, the police labor union that
represents most LAPD officers, has taken no position on federal
control of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said from the very, very beginning that this all is
about management, oversight, and accountability. When you look at
this, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if the
feds have come in they have repudiated LAPD management,'' said PPL
President Ted Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feds are saying, LAPD management, we don't trust you. You
can't do the job. We have met with the Justice Department for quite
a long time now. We know that they listen to what we have to say.
We are not pals, but have a cordial, professional relationship in
which we have an excellent dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a briefing by Hahn, the City Council discussed the
issue with some members blaming their own leadership for the LAPD's
failings and others attacking the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has just given a very clear message
to us that it is not comfortable with the laissez faire approach
that we have been taking,'' Councilwoman Laura Chick said. ``They
are saying good intentions are not good enough and that they want
to see action.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs said the council and mayor need to push
forward on reforms in a public form.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Justice Department was happy with what we're doing in
cleaning our house, they wouldn't come here in the first place,''
Wachs said. ``They are here basically to tell us that we haven't
done the job and that they are here to make sure the job gets
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden, however, called the letter a smear
tactic that lacks any new revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter, in my view, is a boilerplate accusation that
could be used against any police department in the country,''
Holden said.

   RUSSIA-IRAN-MISSILES (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ As concerns
mount in the United States and Israel that Iran's secretive missile
and nuclear weapons programs could pose new threats in the region,
the case of Yuri Savelyev, a leading Russian missile scientist who
persisted in his efforts to aid the Iranians in the face of
official sanction, illustrates the behind-the-scenes cooperation
between the Russian and U.S. governments to stem the flow of
missile technologies to Iran. But at the same time, it also reveals
the deep-seated resistance within the Russian establishment against
abandoning Russia's strategic role in cultivating clients and
contracts for transferring military technology. By Patrick E.

   TURKEY-ARMENIANS (Elazig, Turkey) _ Groves of mulberry trees at
lakeside resorts are about all that remain from the days when this
region was a center of Armenian life. Here in eastern Turkey, the
passage of several generations has not been enough to wipe the
killings of 1915 from memory. To most Turks the events of 1915 seem

constant presence. Awareness of what is simply called ``the
genocide'' is acute in Armenian communities around the world. By
Stephen Kinzer.

   PALESTINIAN-ANTHEM (Bethlehem, West Bank) _ With scores of
pinstriped businessmen milling about the hotel ballroom, it looked
like any other shareholders meeting. But when the meeting was

impossible to control the traffic in any kind of digital

possible to acquire or exchange such material anonymously while
frustrating any attempt to remove the information from the Internet
or determine its source. Clarke is one of a group of programmers

   CIO-MANAGEMENT (Undated) _ In corporate America, an increasing
number of chief information officers _ the folks in charge of the
computers _ are amassing greater power as top bosses and company
boards realize how crucial technical expertise is in staying ahead
of the competition. A recent survey found that companies are
increasingly looking to a new generation of chief information
officers to be business strategists, and that these ``new'' CIOs
spend at least half their time outside the information-technology
department on efforts like developing and incubating new prospects
for electronic commerce. By Sana Siwolop.

   TATE-MODERN (London) _ What are people going to say in 100 years
about all these new museums for modern art that we're building? The
latest behemoth is the new Tate Modern, across the Thames from St.
Paul's. The queen inaugurates it Thursday and on Friday the public
arrives. The museum is of course a contribution to contemporary
art, not just here but throughout Europe, and a major achievement
by Nicholas Serota, the quietly subversive Tate director. To
Britons who for decades got admirable but tepid Ben Nicholson and
Barbara Hepworth when they went to the old Tate for modern art, the
new Tate must seem like a revolution. Dozens of living artists of
different generations and nationalities (Bruce Nauman, Matthew
Barney, Juan Munoz, James Coleman, Ilya Kabakov, Tatsuo Miyajima,
Rebecca Horn _ the list goes on) are mixed in among Brits. No doubt
the choices will cause grumbling because all choices do, but they
seem fine. And all this comes when London is suddenly vying with
New York as the mecca for contemporary art. A Critic's Notebook by

IN VICTORY FOR TEACHERS UNION, DAVIS RELENTS ON SCHOOL
SPENDING  LEVEL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A day after thousands of teachers rallied at the
Capitol, Gov. Gray Davis cut a deal Tuesday to bring California's
schools close to the national average in per-pupil spending in
return for the state's most powerful teachers union dropping an
initiative that would have forced him to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Davis agreed to give schools an additional $1.84 billion in
discretionary funding, which he said equals $328 more per pupil.
</P>
<P>
   That would bring California's spending on each student to $6,353
for the next fiscal year, according to Davis' figures. The most
recent available national average is $6,638 for 1997-98, according
to the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the money pledged Tuesday, public schools will receive
$3.6 billion more than they did last year, and Davis said there
will be even more when he announces his revised budget later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the end of it,'' Davis told reporters. ``That is
just the portion we're talking about today. There will be more
proposals later in the week which will take the number up higher.''
</P>
<P>
   After Davis makes his revised budget numbers public, he and the
Legislature will begin the process of negotiating on all of the
spending. By June 15, the Legislature is required by law to pass a
budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, but last year was
the first in several years in which that deadline was met.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the money will cover cost-of-living adjustments that
were not paid to California schools during times of budget deficits
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though our economy is booming, teachers are still
suffering from the recessionary cutbacks of the early 1990s,''
Davis said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon after hours of
closed-door meetings with the president of the California Teachers
Association and the Democratic leaders of the Assembly and Senate.
``Today's proposal repays California's debt in full.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers association, one of Davis' biggest supporters when
he ran for governor, was also hoping to avoid spending millions on
the ballot initiative, especially because Davis has said he would
oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the group will use its political muscle to try to
defeat another measure already on the November ballot that would
allow parents to use public money to send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political climate has changed,'' said teachers union vice
president Barbara Kerr. ``We seem to be headed in the right
direction with the Legislature, and we want to be focused on
defeating the voucher initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said the commitment brings California much closer to the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we significantly closer, but school districts
will know that the money will be there next year, so they can do
long-range planning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since education spending in California reverted to state control
after Proposition 13, per-pupil expenditures have crept up at a far
slower pace than elsewhere in the nation, coming to a virtual
standstill in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   While other states, like New York and New Jersey were pushing
their per-pupil dollars beyond the $10,000 mark, California's
hovered at about half that amount. It was only last year that
per-pupil spending in California began to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.84 billion is the amount schools lost from 1991 to 1994,
when no cost-of-living adjustments were made on school spending.
Local school districts are owed $1.79 billion and county offices of
education $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leadership in the Legislature helped broker the
deal, arguing that the time was right to put forth the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to have this initiative on the ballot that would
have been counterproductive, shall we say. And now we're not,''
said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.
``But the important deal is more money for school districts to do
their business. It could mean new football jerseys, a kick in
starting-teacher salaries, music programs. Whatever a district
feels is important to their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement avoids a nasty fight over the union's proposed
initiative, a fight that both sides could live without.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely good news,'' said Kevin Gordon, a spokesman
for the California Association of School Business Officials. ``It
was going to be a very uncomfortable fall campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Monday, 8,000 teachers poured into Sacramento to show their
support for the union-sponsored initiative and to demand more
discretionary funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate budget approved this week gave school districts $1
billion in discretionary money. Davis' announcement increases that
to $1.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is a big jump in discretionary funding over last year, when
schools received a little less than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will provide local districts an opportunity to establish
their own spending priorities,'' said Sen. Jack O'Connell, D-San
Luis Obispo. ``Many of the reductions imposed on districts in the
past can now be restored _ teacher salaries could see a potentially
significant increase. Also, what works for rural districts, what
they need to spend money on, is often very different from a major
urban district.''

 BIG MITT TOO CLOSE FOR MCGWIRE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If Mark McGwire can't hit a home run into the
giant glove atop the left-field bleachers at the Giants' new
ballpark, I say the guy is a fraud. A wimp. A palooka.
</P>
<P>
   The glove is 501 feet from home plate. McGwire is king of the
tape-measure home run; he should be wearing that glove out.
Especially with the new, improved major-league ball, 20 percent
livelier than last year's model.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's lords deny they juice up the ball, but they can't
explain this year's epidemic of homers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the cows. Ball covers are made of cowhide, and it
could be that due to the hormones we use to fatten cows, their hide
is thicker and springier. Maybe that's what is meant by ``and the
cow jumped over the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, playing their fans for suckers, are offering $1
million to some fan if a Giants' player hits a homer into the big
glove. Barry Bonds? He ain't got 500-foot pop, especially not to
the opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the big-mitt shot will happen next season, when the
baseball lords juice up the ball another 20 percent and Dusty Baker
makes his comeback as a player.
</P>
<P>
   NOW THAT the Board of Supervisors has voted to outlaw
discrimination against large people, does that mean all those dorky
losers have to peel off their ``No fat chicks'' bumper stickers?
</P>
<P>
   STRANGE THOUGHTS lurk in the minds of readers.
</P>
<P>
   The recent scientific scoop here _ that rats and cockroaches who
eat baking soda, unable to burp, explode _ has people thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you suppose baking soda would have the same effect on
newspaper executives and politicians?'' ponders Dennis Green.
``Let's find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Save your baking soda, Dennis. Scientific studies show that
politicians and newspaper execs are incredibly efficient at
expelling hot gas.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cameron has an idea for luring kids away from violent video
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Ant Farm, which came with live ants and a food
supply?'' Cameron asks. ``How about Roach Farm, complete with live
cockroaches and baking soda. For $1,000 in unmarked bills, I'll let
you and the mayor in on the IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Ron, you want to engage in day-trading of cockroachbellies
with the old horse-trader?
</P>
<P>
   A LEGEND has checked out.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Winters, who presided behind the bar at Capp's Corner in
North Beach for the past 27 years, sat down at the bar last
Thursday, had a heart attack and was dead before he hit the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sam, a star lineman at USF in the Matson-Marchetti-St. Clair
glory days, was the very model of the gruff bartender with the
heart of gold. He never asked for a favor but granted a million. He
wasn't much on mixing exotic drinks, and his prices, for the
regulars, got stuck somewhere in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was like his front room,'' says Capp's owner Tom
Ginella.
</P>
<P>
   On weekend mornings, Sam's loyal legion of NBRs (North Beach
Regulars) would be waiting at the door when he opened at 6. On
Sundays they'd go to church and come back for Sam's free
picnic-type buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Ginella says the free lunches will continue. Wouldn't want to
get the big guy sore.
</P>
<P>
   WHY YOU SHOULD always have an English teacher proofread your
school buses:
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburg, Pat Wille pulled up to a traffic light behind a
Pittsburg Unified School District bus with large letters painted on
the back: ``Stop when red light flash.''
</P>
<P>
   IN TRANSACTIONS, the Sporting Green's fine-print capsulization
of the day's trades and injuries, Jim Sullivan spotted this: ``NBA
Entertainment named Cliff Kaplan senior vice president, global
media programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Crows Sullivan, ``I'm stoked, because I picked Kaplan in my
sports administration fantasy league.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm down. I drafted the Giants' exec who said, ``Hey, the plans
for this new ballpark have way too many urinals.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GENTRIFICATION of the city continues, and Lotta Dotz wonders
if citizens don't deserve a new newspaper _ The San Francisco
Monocle.
</P>
<P>
   You know, a paper fine-tuned to the refined sensibilities of the
haves. The paper would be placed on your ``Welcome, depending'' mat
each a.m. by a correctly liveried cyclist on a titanium Merlin.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper would be a tough project to get off the ground,
but maybe with a JOA with the devil ...
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER Baba Ram Dass, the guru kind of guy who introduced
Timothy Leary to LSD and had many celebrated followers, including
the Beatles?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Baba rented a house in Tiburon from Joe Rinehart. A friend
asked Joe, ``Have you talked with Ram Dass?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Joe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he give you words of wisdom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the toilet's broken.''
</P>
<P>
   SO NOW IT'S brainwashing if Elian decides he wants to stay with
his dad and return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith (R-N.H.) says the kid is being kept in a
``concentration camp'' and hints that Elian is being drugged so
that he'll go along with the commie propaganda program.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that Republicans always get the funny lines?
</P>
<P>
   There's no question Elian would have better toys, now and as an
adult, if he stayed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, maybe, blood is thicker than Big Wheels.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
A five-run deficit after three innings would be akin to getting
sentenced to a loss at most ballparks. But at Enron Field, parole
is just around the corner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A poor outing by Scott Elarton was pardoned by a relentless
offensive attack led by Craig Biggio and Ken Caminiti, who powered
the Astros to a 13-8 come-from-behind victory over the Colorado
Rockies on Tuesday night before a crowd of 32,130, a season low for
the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio and Caminiti had two hits and four RBIs apiece, and four
Astros relievers held the Rockies to a run on two hits in 4 innings
as the Astros snapped a three-game losing streak at Enron Field,
where they are 4-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hitters' game tonight,'' said Astros manager Larry
Dierker, whose team outhit the Rockies 11-10. ``But it was also a
pitchers' game in the sense that we kept hitting and they didn't.
We haven't had too many wins here, so we'll take one any way we can
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros trailed by six runs after 4{ innings, setting the
stage for their largest comeback of the season. They scored five
runs in the bottom of the fifth, highlighted by Caminiti's
Enron-aided grand slam, and took the lead with a four-run sixth
inning highlighted by Biggio's three-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not out of any game at any time in this ballpark,''
Caminiti said. ``It was good to see us put up a couple of big
innings. The way things have been going for us, we need some
positive things to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefthanded reliever Yorkis Perez pitched a perfect sixth inning
to qualify for his second victory, and Mike Maddux and Billy Wagner
also delivered scoreless work out of the Astros' bullpen. The only
blemish on the bullpen's performance was Todd Helton's
eighth-inning solo homer off Doug Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Just as impressive as the bullpen's solid work was the tenacity
of the Astros' offense, which kept piling on runs even after the
victory appeared secure. In fact, their three-run eighth inning
robbed Wagner of a save opportunity, which he'll gladly sacrifice
in any victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept getting after it,'' said Astros catcher Mitch
Meluskey, who replaced Tony Eusebio in the bottom of the sixth
inning. ``We'd better start doing that (piling on the runs) because
that's what other teams have been doing to us in this ballpark. We
need to play to win all the way to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio was taken to Methodist Hospital after he was hit on the
left elbow by a pitch from Rockies reliever Julian Tavarez. X-rays
were negative, and Eusebio's status will be evaluated daily.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the Astros had to fret about Tuesday was
the pitching of Elarton, who allowed seven runs on eight hits in 4
innings, matching his shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elarton's outing wasn't good,'' Dierker said. ``He didn't have
any kind of curveball, and his control of his fastball was shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton struck out the first batter he faced, Curtis Goodwin, on
three pitches but immediately started falling behind hitters and
paid the price. Mike Lansing doubled on a 3-1 pitch and scored on
Jeff Cirillo's two-run homer _ on a 2-0 pitch _ off the left-field
limestone. Cirillo has hit in a career-high 15 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got behind hitters, threw the ball down the middle of the
plate, and they made me pay for it,'' Elarton said.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton settled down in the second and was coasting in the third
until the defense abandoned him. Larry Walker lifted a
harmless-looking two-out fly ball down the left-field line, and
three Astros _ left fielder Matt Mieske, shortstop Russ Johnson and
Caminiti, the third baseman _ converged on the ball. The ball
dropped among them and skipped into the seats for a ground-rule
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get better at catching pop flies,'' Dierker said.
``I've seen more pop flies drop this season than I did all of last
year. I'm not going to cast blame; I'm just going to say that
somebody should have caught that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of resting in the dugout after what should have been the
third out, Elarton faced a challenge with Cirillo due to bat. He
walked Cirillo and served up a three-run homer to Todd Helton, who
leads the National League with 38 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros finally joined the scoring in the fourth inning when
Roger Cedeno scooted home from third on a Scott Karl breaking ball
that Rockies catcher Brent Mayne was unable to handle. But Colorado
responded with two more runs in the fifth to go up 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's 1,000th hit in an Astros uniform was a memorable one.
Although the fifth-inning fly probably would have been an out in
most ballparks, at Enron Field it was good enough for the sixth
grand slam of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got another run in the inning on Biggio's
fielder's-choice grounder to pull within 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit it far, but it was high,'' Caminiti said of his
grand slam. ``Because it's so short out there, I knew it had a
chance. I was blowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``That was definitely an Enron slam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took the lead in a four-run sixth inning that
featured Biggio's three-run triple and an RBI single by Richard
Hidalgo. Prior to Tuesday, Biggio was hitting .188 with just one
RBI and one extra-base hit in his previous 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got big hits all night,'' Dierker said, ``and that was good
to see.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Thirty years and two days after Willis Reed hobbled out
of the Madison Square Garden tunnel and set a New York standard for
big-game heroism, there are examples everywhere that the
contemporary professional basketball player has been living up to
the legend quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the American Airlines Arena on Tuesday night, Patrick
Ewing discarded his ice packs again and continued his mission to
become a limping champion in his own right, while Tim Hardaway
taped up his badly sprained left foot and returned to his pursuit
of local Willis-hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in this league doesn't play with any pains or nicks?''
Ewing said before the Knicks evened their war of halfcourt
attrition with a wildly uneven 82-76 victory over the Heat in Game
2 of the Eastern Conference semifinal, a game so unsightly you
wondered if everyone, including the refs, was in need of medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the postseason of playing with pain, for muscular
forwards and frail guards, aging warriors and young bucks,
franchise players and scrappy vets. They didn't put up with 82
regular-season games and all those insufferable practices to let
their bodies deprive them of rich post-season desserts.
</P>
<P>
   So Grant Hill tried to play on a broken ankle against Miami in
the first round. Karl Malone shook off a recent sprain after
scrambling off the bench when a teammate dove into it. Jason Kidd
rushed back from what was supposed to be a season-ending broken
ankle. Allen Iverson has played on with a medical chart that is
longer than him. His Philadelphia backcourt partner, Eric Snow,
pushed himself Monday night until the dam broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was bawling, right?'' Chris Childs said, posing as a
question what he already knew because he would have preferred for
the camera to have lied.
</P>
<P>
   Childs had only seen Snow on the bench during Indiana's victory,
then tuned out before the Turner Network cameras later found Snow
still in tears, and out for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, really sorry, to hear that,'' Childs said. ``I know
him, just from being cordial around the league. Allen's the best
player on that team but he would be the first to tell you that
Eric's their leader. It's a shame. He played. He tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller ran Snow until his injured foot gave out. Tuesday
night, the Knicks had Charlie Ward attack Hardaway and Ward, of all
people, was their leading scorer for much of the game. On the
court, there is no sympathy, only matchups to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
   The players are paid handsomely, but their money is guaranteed
and they don't have to play when they are hurting and they all know
exactly what Hardaway is feeling when Ward or Childs turns him on
defense and lights what Hardaway said feels like a fire inside his
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand what a high threshold of pain we have
to have to just get to this level,'' said Childs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy said, ``Some players don't like to be out there
when they can't play their best.'' Not Hardaway or Ewing. Between
visits to the acupuncturist for back spasms, Ewing has often looked
glacial in this series but there he was, hitting the biggest basket
of the game, lofting a sweet jumper over Alonzo Mourning in the
third quarter after Miami had surged to within 51-50. And there he
was again, putting back Latrell Sprewell's missed drive with a 1
minute 34 seconds left to snuff out one final Heat charge.
</P>
<P>
   As Ewing learned last spring, no doctor can guarantee that an
injury can't be made worse by playing. Hardaway, in a contract
year, said his father has told him, ``Do what you have to do but
don't be foolish and go out there and hurt yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He's vowed to ``fight through the pain'' and he gave Pat Riley
another valiant 30 minutes and 13 points on Tuesday night. Hardaway
just doesn't have the mobility for dribble penetration, and Miami's
offense has no margin for error when Mourning is contained, as he
was on Tuesday night. Conversely, the Knicks won despite Sprewell
and Allan Houston shooting a combined 5 for 27. It's a long shot
that Miami can survive. Hardaway will probably have to settle for
an opponent's respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big men go up and back,'' Childs said. ``He's a guard, cutting
this way and that way. He wants to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, most of the players do, but they are
vulnerable, human. At a time when more and more fans have grown
tired of the corporate hype, and when premier games are as tough to
watch as last night's, that's not a bad marketing thought for a
sport under television-ratings siege.  &QL;

 EDITORIAL: McCAIN'S MEDICINE  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 10:
</P>
<P>
   For a defeated candidate in the Republican presidential race,
Sen. John McCain has not suffered from lack of attention. With his
high poll numbers, McCain might have made a credible third-party
candidate in November. On Tuesday, however, he took the prudent
course and endorsed Gov. George W. Bush, joking that he preferred
taking his medicine now rather than later. Clearly he figured that
he had a brighter future inside the GOP than as a spoiler outside
it. It was disappointing that Bush offered no concessions on
campaign reform or other issues in return for an endorsement he
really needed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain GOP ritual for defeated candidates to endorse
the nominees of their parties, but it often goes awry. In 1976 Gov.
Ronald Reagan of California gave such a tepid endorsement of
President Gerald Ford that Ford never fully recovered. Back in 1960
Richard Nixon, then the vice president, was so eager to win the
endorsement of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York that he agreed
to a set of party principles, known as the Fifth Avenue compact,
that made him suspect among party conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In approaching the meeting with McCain on Tuesday, Bush seemed
to have this history in mind. He made it clear that he wanted the
senator's endorsement, but did not want to seem to want it too
much. In their joint news conference the governor tried to stress
how much they had in common. But he did not look especially pleased
about McCain's vow to continue pressing his agenda. He may have
been wondering whether the senator would try to do that at the
convention in Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing popularity of McCain can be seen in many surveys,
including a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showing that 23
percent of the voters would prefer him over Bush or Vice President
Al Gore. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows him with higher
approval ratings than either man. The Bush campaign has always been
quick to assert that McCain got his biggest victories in states
where independents and Democrats could join with Republicans and
vote in the primary. But it is these independent-minded voters who
will determine the winner in November. It will not be easy for
either Bush or Gore, both wealthy political heirs, to attract
voters who are drawn to McCain's outsider appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, has been resistant to identifying with two
issues that seem intrinsic to McCain's appeal. One is campaign
finance reform, particularly the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban,
which Bush opposes. Another is McCain's opposition to a gigantic
tax cut that would use up the budget surplus. Bush probably feels
locked in on taxes, but he would be smart to adopt McCain's stand
on campaign finance reform. Otherwise he may find that McCain
voters are as hard to get as the senator's endorsement was.

EDITORIAL: JOHN DEUTCH AND THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 10:
</P>
<P>
   If the director of central intelligence transfers highly
classified materials to insecure computers at his home, he may well
be violating the law, and his conduct requires an immediate and
full investigation. But when faced with just such actions by John
Deutch in late 1996, the CIA and the Justice Department badly
fumbled the case. They are now scrambling to make amends, with
Justice belatedly initiating a criminal investigation. But the
affair once again demonstrates that the agency cannot adequately
investigate itself and that Attorney General Janet Reno has
consistently failed to enforce the law against top Clinton
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was a demanding and effective leader of the CIA who did
much in his short tenure to address the agency's past abuses and
reform its practices. But enlightened leadership does not provide
immunity from the law, and Deutch's carelessness cried out for a
rigorous investigation by the FBI under the direction of a seasoned
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it received cursory examination by the CIA and no
investigation by the FBI. Historically, the CIA has put more energy
into covering up mistakes and misconduct than investigating them.
Ironically, Deutch worked hard to change that culture. But when his
own behavior became an issue in December 1996 as he was preparing
to return to private life, some of the very aides he had recruited
to help reform the CIA may have tried to protect him. Nora Slatkin,
who served as executive director, and Michael O'Neil, who was the
agency's general counsel, failed to insist on a thorough
investigation and may have tried to impede examination of the case.
Both deny doing so, but their conduct was sharply criticized by the
agency's inspector general and a White House intelligence board.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA security staff, which never bothered to interview
Deutch, wrote an anemic report in 1997. By the time the agency got
around to notifying the Justice Department, the one-year time limit
for appointing an independent counsel had expired. In April 1999
Reno inexplicably decided not to pursue the matter, without
ordering an F.B.I. investigation. George Tenet, Deutch's deputy and
successor, removed his security clearances in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that Deutch received special treatment because he
was a top official, and that Reno gave him the benefit of the
doubt, just as she has done for others in the administration. For
an experienced prosecutor, she has an uncanny instinct for ignoring
or misreading the evidence and the law when top officials are
credibly accused of misconduct. Before the books are closed on this
case, the actions of Deutch and his former colleagues must be
carefully examined. If the evidence warrants prosecution, the high
positions they held should be no barrier. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THOROUGHLY MODERN MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 10:
</P>
<P>
   Despite their many differences, New York's Senate candidates,
Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, hold at least one
belief in common. Both assert that there should be what Clinton
calls a ``zone of privacy'' around the personal lives of elected
officials and their families. Both, it seems, also have a talent
for stirring public curiosity about their inner lives and an
inclination to accuse the media of pursuing information for which
the public has no real appetite.
</P>
<P>
   What the public finally decides about this Gothic novel of an
election and these two fascinating, highly polarizing personalities
is the key question, of course. Assuming, as everyone hopes, that
Giuliani's health allows for a full campaign, the answer is seven
months away. Our guess is that in the interim the non-tabloid press
will respect the request for privacy from Giuliani and not go in
search of further information about him, his wife, Donna Hanover,
or his friend Judith Nathan. Notwithstanding the complaints of
President Clinton's defenders about shifting standards of privacy,
the mainstream press has never been quick to carry information
about politicians' personal conduct unless that information issued
from official sources or seemed related to officeholders'
fulfilling of their public obligations.
</P>
<P>
   But candidates cannot expect journalists, strategists or voters
to be brain-dead when it comes to analyzing the political impact of
the full public record. In the current U.S. Senate campaign, that
record includes the candidates' comments, in press conferences and
interviews, about their marriages and, in Giuliani's case, social
engagements that occurred in public view. In New York's chaotic
information environment, the record also includes paparazzi photos,
gossip columns and tabloid news, and this fact poses a special
challenge for journalists who are commenting on the campaign. Like
it or not, voters have a right to reach conclusions about a
candidate's judgment and temperament based on what they learn from
a variety of sources about the person's life. They also have a
right to commentary that sorts through what is central and what is
peripheral to the task of electing a leader.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, such judgments cannot ignore local history. This
state has the widest strike zone in American politics when it comes
to candidates' private lives and domestic arrangements. Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller's re-election in 1962 after a very public divorce
testifies to that fact. While Clinton's and Giuliani's stories are
very different, they may now be on something like an equal footing
in regard to drawing on that tradition of tolerance. Early polls
showed that Clinton had suffered among professional women for being
perceived as too tolerant of a misbehaving husband. But the issue
of marital balance may be neutralized, especially if the mayor is
perceived as the less sympathetic partner in his family
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no one knows how deeply the tradition of tolerance runs
among voters who identify themselves as cultural and religious
conservatives. Clinton has been anathema to many of them. Giuliani
could now face slippage in sectors of that coalition _ for example,
Catholics, Orthodox Jews, upstate independents _ where he had
expected an advantage. While a Daily News poll showed that 77
percent of those contacted viewed Giuliani's friendship with Nathan
as a private matter, 12 percent said they viewed him more
negatively. In a close election, fractional shifts can be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   If these factors seem to tip in Clinton's favor, it may be
simply a matter of her difficult news being out earlier. And
Hanover's statement on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral about
``decisions'' to come could portend additional headlines for
Giuliani. But the mayor, for his part, seems confident that the
Clintonian privacy zone will work in his favor, or else he would
not have used his daringly transparent description of Nathan as a
``very good friend.'' That ``very'' could become the most famous
adverb in a campaign that, if it keeps running at this pace, will
be remembered as a Rorschach test of contemporary New York
attitudes toward candidates, their private lives and their public
marriages.

U.S. TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN EMBASSY ATTACKS, DEFENSE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Attorney General Janet Reno has authorized federal
prosecutors in Manhattan to seek the death penalty against at least
one defendant in the bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa
in 1998, according to defense lawyers in the broad terrorism
conspiracy case.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision, which has not been made public, sets the stage
for the first death penalty case in the United States involving an
act of international terrorism, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-`Owhali, has been accused
of being a passenger in a truck that carried the bomb in the
explosion at the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug. 7,
1998. That bombing, along with a nearly simultaneous explosion at
the embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed more than 200 people
and wounded more than 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Al-`Owhali is one of three defendants in custody in New York who
are eligible for the death penalty in the bombings; no decision has
been made in the cases of the other two. All three have pleaded not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   David I. Bruck, a lawyer for al-`Owhali, confirmed late Tuesday
that he had been told of Reno's decision, which he called
``folly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government claims that this young man has already tried to
detonate himself into paradise,'' he said. ``Now it's offering to
do the job itself, providing him with a glorious death while the
world watches. Is this how to deter terrorism?''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White,
declined to comment on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have described al-`Owhali as a would-be suicide
bomber in the Nairobi blast. The government has charged that he
admitted to investigators that he tossed a dummy grenade at a
security guard seconds before the bomb was to go off, and that the
bombing was intended as a ``martyrdom operation in which he did not
expect to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Bruck and another lawyer, Leonard F. Joy, told
Judge Leonard B. Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan that
their client had ordered them not to go to Washington for a recent
meeting with Reno's staff, where they had intended to argue against
the death penalty. The lawyers did not explain their client's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Reno must rule on all requests from federal prosecutors to seek
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The three men facing capital charges are to be tried later this
year with three others, who could face life in prison, for their
roles in the embassy bombings and in what prosecutors say was a
worldwide terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities suspect that the conspiracy was masterminded by
the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be living in
Afghanistan under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Bruck, in his sharp criticism, said Reno's decision could
complicate the government's efforts to win other countries'
cooperation in returning bin Laden for trial because ``it implies
that the U.S. intends to execute bin Laden, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since no Muslim country is likely to hand him over to be
killed,'' Bruck said, ``it may really mean that the U.S. has given
up on ever getting bin Laden, and has decided to content itself
with killing his foot soldiers instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruck added: ``In our new role as global executioner, we're
about to learn the hard way what Israel and England _ countries
facing much greater terrorist threats _ have long understood:
turning accused terrorists into martyrs only makes a bad situation
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, recently sought Reno's
authorization for a death penalty case against a second of the
three defendants eligible for the death penalty, Khalfan Khamis
Mohamed, who has been accused of a role in the Tanzania explosion.
Reno has not ruled on that request.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the third defendant, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, White
has not yet indicated whether she will seek the death penalty. But
death penalty experts who have followed the case say they
ultimately expect the government to seek the death penalty against
all three.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bruck said he hoped Reno would reconsider her
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in an unusual strategy, the defense lawyers for all
three of the defendants facing capital charges filed a 30-page
memorandum with Justice and State Department officials, arguing
that seeking the death penalty would harm this country's foreign
policy and damage its counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer in the broader terrorism case said that the death
penalty case against al-`Owhali has been limited by Reno to those
counts charging his participation in the Nairobi bombing, in which
more than 200 people were killed. Al-`Owhali was also indicted in
the bombing in Tanzania, although prosecutors have not offered
evidence publicly of his involvement in that attack.

A SLAM DUNK FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. - The date, time and place for Shaquille
O'Neal's coronation as the biggest, baddest, most dominant player
in the NBA was set Tuesday. When the moment at last arrived, he
embraced it not with the ferocity of a backboard-altering slam
dunk, but with the style and grace of his slickest spin move to the
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   It took eight seasons for O'Neal to evolve from a player with
great abilities into simply the greatest player on the floor. That
time has arrived, and the gap between O'Neal and the rest of the
league is so wide that he claimed Most Valuable Player with the
greatest mandate in history - 120 of 121 possible first-place
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the game's most physically imposing individual accepted the
mantle with dignity, humility, gratitude - and, of course, his own
unique sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day on,'' O'Neal said, ``I would like to be known as
`The Big Aristotle.' Because it was Aristotle that said,
`Excellence is not a singular act, but a habit. You are what you
repeatedly do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And this year I just wanted to come out and be very consistent
and dominate and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, repeatedly and habitually, in true Aristotelian manner.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal outpaced the league in scoring average (29.7 points) and
field-goal percentage (.574). He was the first player since Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar in 1976-77 to finish among the top three in scoring,
rebounding, field-goal percentage and blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   It was a season for the record books, capped by a vote for the
record books. With 99.2 percent of the first-place votes, O'Neal
eclipsed the 96.5 percent Michael Jordan garnered in 1995-96, when
he received 109 of 113.
</P>
<P>
   The award was a slam dunk long ago, leaving only the question of
whether O'Neal would become the first to win the media vote
unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction was lost when Fred Hickman of CNN gave his
first-place vote to Philadelphia's Allen Iverson (and listed O'Neal
second).
</P>
<P>
   At one time, such snubs would elicit a snarl from O'Neal. But at
age 28, he has evolved off the court as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to thank you all for voting for me,'' he said,
``and the one guy who didn't vote (for me), thank you too. I
appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Neal seemed humbled by his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of hard to believe, that I had the highest
percentage, because I've always felt that Michael Jordan and guys
like Magic (Johnson) and Kareem and Wilt (Chamberlain) were the
greatest players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For O'Neal to join that roster, he had to complete his game.
That was a challenge put forth immediately by coach Phil Jackson,
O'Neal's hand-picked mentor, when he was hired last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Shaquille's always been an indomitable kind of
force,'' Jackson said. ``He's been a dominator inside as a scorer
in this league, averaging from 27 to 30 points a game over a long
period of time, and everybody knew he could score, but yet the
whole aspect of his game - passing, rebounding, assists, blocked
shots, turnovers - all those things were very important for a
basketball team at the other end. And I think when Shaquille took
those as indicators of his ability to work within the team and the
system, I think that was really what was another growth step for
him, and made this an MVP season. Scoring's not the only thing that
attracts people, but defense and domination in there is the thing
that's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   MVP was a goal mentioned more often by teammates and friends
than O'Neal himself, but upon accepting the Maurice Podoloff Trophy
for the first time, he said ``I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal - in his own words ``knick-knack injury free'' for the
first full season since signing with the Lakers in 1996 - put good
health, great conditioning and Jackson's tutelage to work. His
rebounding average (13.6) and blocked-shots average (3.03) were the
best since his rookie year in 1992-93. His assists average (3.8)
was a career high, and second on the Lakers only to Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant (who received a fourth-place MVP vote) also
smoothed over some well-publicized tensions to become arguably the
best one-two punch in the league. Their combined talents led the
Lakers to a 67-15 record, best in the league and second best in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers are prohibitive favorites to win the
championship. They hold a 1-0 lead in their conference semifinals
series against the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season, when I was out with a broken hand, he
stepped up and played at a high level every night,'' Bryant said.
``I knew then he was going to be MVP. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his consistency. Night in, night out, he performs at a
higher level than anybody else in the league. That's why he's the
MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   How consistent? O'Neal missed just two games due to injury, one
due to suspension and averaged a career-high 40 minutes in the
other 79 games. He got 10 or more rebounds in all but 15 games,
scored at least 20 points in all but seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Showing he can cure any ailment, O'Neal even appeared to heal
his Achilles' heel - the free throw. After the All-Star break, he
made 58.5 percent of his foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was surprising to the man who lured O'Neal from
Orlando to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, this gentleman works very, very hard at this
game,'' said Lakers executive Jerry West, who predicted the MVP
season in October. ``I'm not a person who makes idle predictions,
but I saw something at training camp from the first day of training
camp and I made a prediction,which I'm happy I made. ... Laker fans
have an awful lot to look forward to in future years here.
Shaquille, I can't tell you how proud I am of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate team award is to win an NBA championship,'' West
said, ``but the ultimate individual award is to win this award,
because truly this was the best player in the NBA this year, by an
awesome amount.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal honored his parents and family and said his father, Sgt.
Phil Harrison, cried when he told him the news. He also thanked
West, owner Jerry Buss, Jackson and of course, his teammates - who
were happy to return praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only person that can stop Shaquille O'Neal is
Shaquille O'Neal,'' said Glen Rice. ``And thus far that hasn't
happened. And he's just going to continue to keep running through
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Charting O'Neal's development from great player to MVP,
teammates always came back to one word: desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that desire to be good. And he wants to be the best
player there,'' said Ron Harper, who once played alongside
five-time MVP Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   What does the MVP award mean for the Lakers? ``That you better
step up and win a championship is what that means,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's next on O'Neal's menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Mr. West said, the ultimate goal is to win a
championship,'' O'Neal said. ``And I feel real good about my team.
As a matter of fact, this is the best team I've ever played on. I
like our chances. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get it done this year, it would be nice. My plate
will be full as a player. Right now, I'm missing the macaroni. I
got the chicken, I got the salad, I got the rice, but right now I'm
just missing the macaroni. Get the full-deal meal.''

POLICE COMMISSIONER SAYS BIOPSY CONFIRMS CANCER OF THE PROSTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an announcement that underscored the prevalence of
prostate cancer, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said on Tuesday
that he was told last week that he had the disease. He announced
the news just a week and a half after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
learned that he had the same kind of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, 58, said his cancer, like the mayor's, had been detected
by a routine blood test conducted as part of an annual physical
examination and was then confirmed by a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said his doctors have told him the cancer is in
an early stage and treatable, and should not affect his ability to
continue as police commissioner, aside from the few weeks he might
take off should he elect to have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky they caught it early,'' he said in an interview.
``The C word is a scary word because it is something that you have
very little control over, but fortunately this is treatable and
curable.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he had told the mayor about his cancer last Thursday
night at Gracie Mansion and that Giuliani had been reassuring and
had shared with him a bevy of research into treatment options. On
Tuesday afternoon, during a news conference at Police Headquarters,
the two men spoke of their deep affection for each other and then
hugged in front of a room filled with reporters and senior police
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't write this script,'' Safir acknowledged. The
mayor said: ``This is a very strange and ironic thing. We're both
dealing with the same thing at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before the 3:45 p.m. conference, Safir met with his
senior staff members to tell them the news. ``They were shocked,
subdued, but supportive,'' said a senior police official who was
present.
</P>
<P>
   That two high-profile public officials were told within days of
each other that they had prostate cancer illustrates just how
common the problem is. It is diagnosed in an estimated 184,000
American men each year, making it the second most common type of
cancer in men, after skin cancer. The chances for a cure are 80
percent to 95 percent if it is detected at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   Like Giuliani, Safir said he hoped that discussing his cancer
publicly would persuade other men over 50 to be tested for the
disease. During the conference, Safir, who can seem stiff in public
settings, appeared unusually relaxed, standing next to his wife,
Carol, who at times rested her hand on his shoulder or swung her
arm around his waist. At one point, the commissioner recounted a
conversation with his doctor in which he had asked, ``Am I going to
die from this?'' The doctor, whom he declined to identify, told
him, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the cancer in his prostate, a walnut-sized gland
behind the penis, had been detected last week when the results of a
test showed elevated levels of PSA, or prostate-specific antigen,
in his blood. After the diagnosis was confirmed by a biopsy, Safir
said, he underwent a bone scan and CAT scan on Thursday that
determined that the cancer had not spread.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said the proximity of his tests to those of the
mayor was a coincidence.

FANS CAN APPRECIATE SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The newly crowned King of basketball honed his
game last summer on the outdoor courts in Manhattan Beach alongside
bankers and techies and soft-bellied attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   He'd appear without fanfare at Live Oak Park, wait his turn to
play and then work up his wind, as he put it, while showing off a
wicked crossover dribble and a dagger of a 3-pointer as well as his
usual array of low-post moves.
</P>
<P>
   And then the 7-footer would sign a few autographs, fold himself
into his Bentley or his souped-up sports utility vehicle and drive
off, leaving behind a group of gaping rank-and-file players.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before he was named the league's MVP in a
near-unanimous vote, Shaquille O'Neal joked about being ``a park
legend,'' and the sheer idea of it made us smile.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity culture has conditioned us to expect stars to drop
out of the sky before one drops in on the commonalty. We don't
expect Julia Roberts to prepare for her next role by playing Emily
Webb in our community's production of ``Our Town.'' We don't wonder
if we'll find Britney Spears warming up her pipes at the local
karaoke bar.
</P>
<P>
   And so it's wonderful in a winsome way to know O'Neal laid the
groundwork for his greatest season as a pro not in the comfort of
the basketball court in his spacious home or in some elitist gym or
among his privileged peers, but right there in public.
</P>
<P>
   It's consistent with the way O'Neal leads his life, behaving
much more like Everyman than Superman or like Everyman would if he
hit today's $325 million Big Game jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   He works in a building constructed so the obscenely rich never
have to share Chardonnay with the merely wealthy. And yet O'Neal
moves freely among all people, isolating himself from no one.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a city that manufactures celebrity the way Detroit
does cars. But fame hasn't driven O'Neal behind the tinted windows
of a stretch limousine. Heavens, no. O'Neal rides our roads on a
custom motorcycle, or in a convertible with the top down and the
music way, way up, and he takes a childlike delight in confirming
the obvious. (begin ital)Yep, it's me. Whassup? Beautiful day,
wouldn't you agree?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' eighth-year center was easing out of the team's
practice facility the other day. Just past the security gate, where
fans gather like dandelions, is where a couple of his teammates,
departing minutes earlier, had chosen to speed up. O'Neal slowed to
a stop, hopped out of the car and signed autographs and posed for
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he cranked up his car stereo system to tinnitus-
inducing levels and smiled impishly as the music's bass sent a soda
bottle hurtling off the hood to its demise.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court as well as on it, O'Neal clearly aims to
entertain.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is such a joy to watch that Hollywood flocks to Staples
Center to pay him homage. On game nights, people who are
entertainers in their own right are content for a couple of hours
to bask in the reflected glow of somebody's spotlight, not their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there also are the famous faces who come not to
applaud but to be applauded. They are the ones for whom the Staples
Center is but an extension of The Ivy.
</P>
<P>
   You see them at every game, celebrities who turn the simple act
of sitting into a kind of performance art. They're usually spotted
at courtside, feigning indifference to the cameras even as they
superciliously play to them.
</P>
<P>
   We wish they'd watch O'Neal with the same intensity they do
their own reflections, these luminaries so caught up in playing a
superstar it wouldn't seem at all out of character for them to
demand that the Laker Girls promise not to make eye contact with
them while performing their dance routines.
</P>
<P>
   What they'd see is a superstar who beguiles us with his gift but
doesn't act like he's God's gift to the planet. He has plenty of
weight to throw around, but he saves it all for opposing forwards
and centers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has, in the words of his coach, Phil Jackson, ``the
biggest physical presence, the biggest athletic presence in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   His presence off the court is just as immense. But he manages
not to step on a lot of toes with those size-22 feet of his. The
closest O'Neal comes to causing a commotion is when he blasts his
car stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers forward Robert Horry said of O'Neal, ``I just think he
lives his life like a normal person.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the tributes O'Neal received Tuesday, that just might
have been the greatest.

DiSARCINA WILL BE EXAMINED FURTHER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, placed on the 15-day
disabled list after leaving Monday's game with a sore shoulder, was
examined Tuesday by orthopedic specialist Dr. Frank Jobe but team
officials said there were no results to report and that he would be
looked at further today.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, who began the season on the 15-day disabled list with
a bruised left thumb, was bothered by shoulder problems late last
season and sat out the previous five games to rest it.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, 7-5 with DiSarcina in the lineup and 10-12 without
him, will rely on utilityman Benji Gil to replace DiSarcina, who
was batting a team-leading .395 with 11 RBIs. Two of his five
errors this season have come in his last two games, both poor
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts in a lot of ways,'' Manager Mike Scioscia said when
asked what losing DiSarcina for an extended period would mean.
``Taking nothing away from Benji Gil, but this is a veteran,
experienced player who's the glue to the club on and off the field.
You see the way the infield reacts when he's out there. He's a guy
you hope is not out long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent Durrington, a second baseman for the Angels last season,
was recalled from Triple-A Edmonton to fill DiSarcina's spot on the
roster. He worked out Tuesday at shortstop and will backup Gil and
second baseman Adam Kennedy, and also give the Angels a
pinch-running option, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Ortiz may have made his last start as an Angel for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who was hit for three homers and eight runs in 3 2/3
innings, is scheduled to make his next start Saturday against
Texas. But that's also the day that Jason Dickson is due to come
off the disabled list. With Jarrod Washburn pitching well at
Edmonton, even Ken Hill's injury may not give Ortiz a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said before Tuesday's game that no decision has been
made regarding Ortiz, the club's No.1 pitching prospect, but he
hinted that the 24-year-old right-hander --- who is 2-2 with a 6.90
in six starts --- may be better served trying to develop in the
minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Consistency has been the problem. Monday, for example, he got
nine consecutive outs at one point, then walked two hitters and
gave up a three-run homer to Jeremy Giambi. That was followed by
two singles and a homer by Terrence Long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's shown some baby steps (in improvement),''
Scioscia said. ``But honestly, it's tough to learn things at the
major league level. He's got a lot a lot of things going for him
--- he has a tremendous arm and he's a competitor. With guys like
Ortiz, (Jarrod) Washburn and (Scott) Schoeneweis, the big picture
is always in mind. We want to keep every option open to serve his
development in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival says he learned a lesson from his blown save
Friday in Seattle: don't always leave your curveball in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   He brought it with him Monday and as a result Percival closed
out a 9-8 victory over Oakland for his ninth save in 10 tries.
After Ben Grieve ripped a fastball down the right field line for a
one-out double, Percival struck out pinch hitter Olmedo Saenz
looking at a curveball and Jeremy Giambi on a check swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotta throw that pitch,'' Percival said of his curve.
``Against Seattle, I got myself in that rhythm (of fastballs).

DODGERS' BROWN TO FACE JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The games become blurs. Playing 162 of them across six
months makes it difficult to distinguish one from another in most
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But now and again one comes along that takes on a very different
personality, and one of those times arrives tonight at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of light-hitting infielders smashing home runs to the
opposite field, once in a while a pitcher's duel is possible, and
that's what everyone is expecting as Arizona lefty Randy Johnson
opposes Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to step back and watch it from the front row of
the seats,'' Dodgers second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. ``It's
an all-time matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Johnson is the most dominant pitcher these
days. He's on his way to a second straight Cy Young award, tying a
major-league record with six wins in April and going 7-0 with a
0.93 ERA in seven starts. In 58 innings, Johnson has 75 strikeouts
and has allowed 31 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who spent two weeks on the disabled list with a broken
right pinkie, is 2-1 with a 2.45 ERA. He's 1-1 with a 1.23 ERA
since returning from the injury.
</P>
<P>
   What's made Johnson so devastating in the past few seasons is
his control. A bugaboo early in Johnson's career was his walks, but
he began cutting that total down three years ago. Now, it's reached
the ridiculous stage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who's thrown four complete games and pitched in all but
4 of the possible innings in his starts, has walked 13 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year he's probably been more dominant than ever,'' said
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, whose teams are 6-1 lifetime against
Randy Johnson. ``He's throwing the breaking ball more and throwing
it over. At times earlier in his career, he would overthrow and be
wild, and you could come in and bop him. But he's throwing that
breaking ball and backdooring it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks center fielder Steve Finley has seen it from both
sides. Finley was a teammate of Brown's on the San Diego Padres
team that lost to the Yankees in the 1998 World Series. And he's
spent the last two seasons with Johnson in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know if he's throwing the ball better this year
than last year, because he pitched so well last season, but he's
been awesome,'' Finley said. ``I faced him in the minor leagues and
when I was in Baltimore, but he was a different pitcher than he is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time in two seasons the pair have met, but there
isn't nearly the hoopla and excitement surrounding this
confrontation. They met opening day last season, after the Dodgers
pursued both heavily in the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson opted to come home and pitch for the
Diamondbacks, signing a four-year, $52.4 million contract. Brown
went to the Dodgers for $105 million and some chartered jet rides
over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   And the opening-day matchup at Dodger Stadium never came close
to fulfilling the expectations. Brown allowed 10 hits, including
three homers, and five runs in 5 innings. Johnson pitched seven
innings and allowed two runs on five hits, but he walked six. All
of which mattered little when Raul Mondesi homered in the 11th
inning for a Dodgers win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two guys like that facing each other, it's good
for baseball,'' said Dodgers utility infielder Jose Vizcaino, who's
4 for 10 lifetime against Johnson. ``I get excited for one side but
not for the other. You know there won't be a lot of runs.''

ANGELS LOSE GAME, HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels' most pressing question is no longer how
will their young pitchers hold up or how will they respond to
rookie manager Mike Scioscia or how long can they stay in the AL
West race.
</P>
<P>
   The question they're grappling with now is who will it be today?
</P>
<P>
   One day after shortstop Gary DiSarcina - ``the glue to the
club,'' according to Scioscia - was placed on the disabled list,
the Angels lost staff ace Ken Hill, who strained a muscle in his
rib cage early in Tuesday's 5-2 loss to Oakland before 15,308 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Hill sank to his knees and buried his face in the ground after
throwing a 2-0 pitch to Miguel Tejada in the third inning. He
stayed there a few minutes until he was helped to his feet and
escorted off the field by trainer Ned Bergert and Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's injury was serious enough that he didn't even attempt a
throw to see if he could stay in the game, and afterward the club
placed him on the disabled list and said he would undergo an MRI
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fifth time in just over three seasons that the
34-year-old Hill has landed on the disabled list. Most of the
previous problems centered around an arthritic right elbow, on
which he had surgery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hill looked uncomfortable on the previous pitch to Tejada but
waved Scioscia and Bergert back to the dugout. When Scioscia
arrived on the next pitch, he said Hill had a hard time catching
his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bad,'' Scioscia said of the injury. ``There's a
pretty wide range depending on the severity. It can be two to three
weeks or two to three months. I'm speculating. I don't have M.D.
after my name, but I'm speaking from experience.''
</P>
<P>
   So, even though the Angels are hovering around the .500 mark and
playing with renewed enthusiasm and vigor under Scioscia, it's
beginning to look like last season as far as injuries are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hill hadn't pitched well - he is 3-4 with a 7.41 ERA
- his presence on the young staff was valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hit with a couple of tough injuries,'' Scioscia said.
``You look at Gary DiSarcina and Ken Hill - those are two big parts
of our ballclub. But that's part of baseball and part of a 162-game
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn said the Angels can't afford to look back on last year
when injuries were only part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just got to stay positive and regardless of who's out
there, go out and play ball,'' Vaughn said. ``We're still right in
the thick of it. There's too many months left. The next guy just
has to step up and do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent Durrington was recalled Monday to replace DiSarcina and
Mike Fyhrie will take Hill's spot on the pitching staff. However,
Jason Dickson returns from the disabled list Saturday and could
take Hill's start on Sunday, though Scioscia was noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury Tuesday was the way Oakland right-hander
Gil Heredia tamed the Angels, shutting them out on four hits until
Darin Erstad led off the eighth inning with a booming home run to
center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added another run in the ninth, but Jason
Isringhausen got Erstad to ground into a fielder's choice to earn
his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia (4-2), who walked two and struck out two, had only two
major threats but stranded two runners in the second and the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics gave Heredia an early cushion, jumping to a 2-0
lead in the second and adding solo homers by Ben Grieve in the
fifth and Jeremy Giambi in the seventh, and making it 5-0 when the
Angels couldn't turn a bases-loaded double play in the eighth.

<P>
   PHOENIX - This year's bullpen was a strength for a month, but it
has turned into last year in the past week or so.
</P>
<P>
   The set-up men aren't setting up, or they're limping to the
ninth. And when given the opportunity to closer, Jeff Shaw isn't
closing.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen was battered again, culminating with a five-run 12th
inning, and the Arizona Diamondbacks got a grand slam from Damian
Miller off Orel Hershiser in an 11-7 win against the Dodgers on
Tuesday at Bank One Ballpark.

   It's the Dodgers' third straight loss, and they're 5 games
behind Arizona and in third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to lose, and you hate to lose that way,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``Orel, he's used to starting and
getting in a little better rhthym and locating better, but I had a
lot of confidence bringing him in. It never should have gotten to
that point a three-run lead in the eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 7-6 lead in the top of the 12th on Todd
Hollandsworth's RBI fielder's choice. But Hershiser, trying for his
first save since 1988, couldn't hold it.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley had a bases-loaded sacrifice fly to tie the game.
After Hershiser hit Kelly Stinnett with a pitch to load the bases,
Miller hit a hanging slider for a grand slam with one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more difficult than I thought,'' Hershiser said of
relieving. ``Maybe I've underestimated how tough it is to get
rhythm and experience just coming in as a reliever. It's been one
speed and one location out of the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen collapse began in the eighth, in a situation that
screams for a lefty reliever, of which the Dodgers didn't have. The
Dodgers led 6-3, but Arizona marched its lefties to the plate to
load the bases off Terry Adams. Steve Finley singled in a pair of
runs to make it 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who's blown three straight save chances, allowed one-out
double to Danny Klassen. A passed ball on catcher Todd Hundley
moved Klassen to third and forced the Dodgers to bring the infield
in. Switch-hitter Andy Fox tied the game 6-6 with a broken bat
bloop single to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke his bat in half,'' said Shaw, who has three blown
saves and a loss in his last five games. ``I'm doing everything
that I'm capable of doing to keep the game in hand. It's not that
I'm making mistakes, because I'm not. (Double) just inside the
line, a broken bat, what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the collapse of the bullpen was a strong effort from
starter Carlos Perez, who left after seven innings with a three-run
lead only to watch the Dodgers' bullpen have problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, Perez, who's won three straight decisions, was curious
as to why he didn't go out to pitch the eighth inning. He allowed
three runs on six hits and didn't walk a batter. He threw 94
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising to me that the way I'm feeling, I just got a
ground-ball double play and I know I don't have a lot of pitches
and there's a lot of left-handers coming up in the eighth, and I
find myself out of the game,'' Perez said. ``It's the manager's
decision, and I don't want to complain, but I wish he left me out
there for another inning. I know they had a lot of lefties coming
up.''

BUSS WANTS TO KEEP SHAQ AROUND
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Shaquille O'Neal is the NBA's Most Valuable Player,
and Lakers owner Jerry Buss hopes he'll be his team's MVP until the
day he retires.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, whose contract expires in 2003, is eligible this summer
to sign a three-year extension worth $83.5 million. That would take
him through his 34th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to and we certainly want to have him finish
his career here,'' Buss said Tuesday, after the league presented
O'Neal with the award. But as for the extension this summer, Buss
said, ``That, I don't know. I really need to talk to some people at
the NBA and see what direction they think our people should take.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Buss is enjoying the return on the original $124
million he invested in O'Neal in 1996. Like everyone else, Buss
said he saw a new level of dedication from O'Neal this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his devotion to the game, focused. Totally focused,
totally devoted to winning,'' he said. ``I don't think there's been
a doubt in anybody's mind from day one that he was on a mission to
see if he could lead us to the championship....
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good team, a very good team. I think they're at
their peak, and barring injuries and unforeseen things, I'm very
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss also expects general manager Mitch Kupchak to remain with
the Lakers, despite interest from the New Jersey Nets, who want to
make him their director of basketball operations. Buss gave
permission for Kupchak to interview with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a very, very important job, and anybody that
works for me I think always has the opportunity to investigate
other possibilities,'' Buss said. ``I don't expect Mitch to go,
quite honestly. But I do think he's entitled to his day in
court.... He's a Los Angelean, and we expect him to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to reality: Lost temporarily amid the hoopla of O'Neal's
big day was the Lakers' title pursuit, which for now consists of
beating the Phoenix Suns. The Lakers have a 1-0 lead in the
conference semifinal series, which resumes tonight at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers practiced hard Tuesday after taking a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important aspect of our stand, is this second
game,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``This is really important, that
we come out and play the kind of game we have to play to (keep)
this homecourt advantage, make that 2-0 thing important for when we
go into Phoenix. This is the next step towards putting Phoenix in a
position where they've got their backs against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant was suffering from cold symptoms
Tuesday but practiced and is expected to play tonight. Derek Fisher
was suffering from more severe symptoms and was sent home, though
Jackson expects him to be available tonight.

EDWARDS LONG A TARGET OF PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ After a remarkable roll in which he was elected to
four terms as governor of Louisiana, won fortunes in Las Vegas, and
flummoxed a generation of federal prosecutors, Edwin W. Edwards has
finally lost out.
</P>
<P>
   A fixture in Louisiana politics for nearly four decades, Edwards
was convicted Tuesday on 17 counts of racketeering and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's 45-year-old son, Stephen, was also convicted in
connection with an elaborate scheme to shake down investors in
Louisiana casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor, still debonair and speaking with the lilt
of his native Cajun country, said after the verdict: ``I regret it
ended this way, but that is the system. I have lived 72 years in
the system and I will live out my life in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began shortly after the first of the year,
transfixed the state for months. Federal prosecutors charged that
Edwards made raw demands to raise millions of dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic appearance on the witness stand, Edwards asserted
he was being victimized by zealous prosecutors and betrayed by
former friends.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and six other defendants were ensnared by a 33-count
indictment, charged with racketeering, conspiracy, extortion,
fraud, and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the case was an accusation against Edwards by
Eddie DeBartolo Jr., who owned the San Francisco 49ers before he
was implicated in the scandal. After reaching a plea bargain
agreement with prosecutors and paying a $1 million fine, DeBartolo
testified that Edwards shook him down for $400,000 in cash in
exchange for Edwards's help in winning a riverboat casino license
in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Though Edwards acknowledged receiving the money, he claimed it
was a legitimate consulting fee and said DeBartolo insisted upon
paying in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money was seized by the FBI during raids on
Edwards's home and office three years ago. Edwards had been a
target for months; the FBI wiretapped his telephones and installed
secret video and audio tape-recording devices in his home and
office.
</P>
<P>
   Another well-connected Louisiana politico, Robert Guidry,
testified that he passed on upward of $1.5 million to Edwards and
his son for their help in obtaining a license for his Treasure
Chest casino. Guidry, a longtime associate of Edwards, said he
agreed to place some of the payments in a garbage bin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dumpster might have gotten it, but I didn't,'' Edwards
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is the latest in a long line of colorful characters who
have held the office of governor in Louisiana. His career, now
ended, outlasted the political lifetimes of such figures as Huey P.
Long, the self-styled ``Kingfish'' who grabbed dictatorial powers
until he was assassinated in the halls of the state capitol in
1935; ``Uncle Earl'' Long, brother and successor to the slain
Kingfish, whose last administration was highlighted by his liaison
with a Bourbon Street stripper, Blaze Starr; and Jimmy Davis, the
``Singing Cowboy,'' a man better remembered for his recording of
``You Are My Sunshine'' than his stint in government.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Edwards defied convention. After winning a third
term in 1983, he chartered two jetliners to convey hundreds of
lobbyists and contributors on a gambling excursion to France.
Edwards charged each $10,000 for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   When he won a fourth term in 1991, Edwards moved his girlfriend,
Candy Picou, into the governor's mansion, where she hosted her high
school class's 10th reunion. They were married in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also held high-stakes poker games at the governor's
mansion and gambled frequently at Las Vegas, using such pseudonyms
as E. Nuff, T. Wong, and Muff Alotta. He estimated that he won
nearly $2 million gambling during a 10-year period that ended in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   His third term, in the mid-1980s, was marred by two trials in
which Edwards was accused of racketeering. Prosecutors said Edwards
intervened in the state licensing of hospitals after getting $2
million in payoffs. His first trial ended in a hung jury; the
second in acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's most memorable campaign came in 1991, in a run-off,
against David Duke, a Nazi sympathizer and erstwhile leader of a
division of the Ku Klux Klan. ``We're both wizards under the
sheets,'' Edwards quipped, alluding to his own reputation as a
ladies' man. Edwards's partisans produced bumper stickers saying:
``Vote for the Crook. It's Important.''

 &HT;    When did my lifestyle go high-dollar?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I just got the appraisal on my South Austin
house in the mail, and I can't figure out why the market value on
the house shot up this year from $83,193 to $91,585.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that people all over town are getting stuck with
appraisal hikes so the Austin Independent School District can send
$33 million next year to other parts of the state to educate other
people's children. But I don't think my little two-bedroom house is
worth $91,585.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to think what improvements I've made that might make
the Travis Central Appraisal District think I live in a -- ansion.
Maybe it's the kiddie pool. We got rid of the plastic kiddie pool
15 or 20 years ago. Ever since, the appraised value of my house
keeps rising.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that must be it. Maybe if I went out to Home Depot and
bought another plastic kiddie pool and set it in the back yard, my
taxes would go down.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that I've had a constant parade of Californians coming
by my house, trying to buy the place, either. In fact, since I
moved into my house 22 years ago, I have yet to have -- single
Californian come by my house, ring the doorbell and offer me
enormous piles of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my appraisal keeps going up because I live among the
glitterati. My next-door neighbor, Bernice, ran for Miss Williamson
County back in 1959. Too many stars _ maybe that's my problem.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, I have made some recent improvements that may have led
the appraisal district to jack up my appraised value more than
$8,000 in a single year. A few weeks ago, I broke down and bought a
lawn mower. Shortly after, I broke down and mowed the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe after I mowed the lawn the appraisal district figured out
my house is, in fact, inhabited. Making matters worse, ever since I
bought my new lawn mower, there's been a spate of lawn mowing going
on in my neighborhood, which may make the appraisal district think
I'm living in a swank area. For example, right after I got the new
lawn mower, my neighbor Rich Mann _ and that's his real name _
found out about it and came over and borrowed it. Then he mowed his
lawn, too. This is what you call a South Austin beautification
program.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the fact that I cleaned out my garage _ sort of _
a few weeks back. I loaded a pile of old clothes in the back of my
car and drove them over to Goodwill and dumped them off.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the appraisal district saw me lugging old T-shirts out of
the garage and decided the house was suddenly more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   I ought to get a special South Austin tax exemption because of
some of my neighbors, however. I ought to get a big tax break
because of the college-age guys who live in the rent house two
doors down. These guys are always playing the bongos in the back
yard. Boingy boingy boingy. Boingy boingy boingy boingy boingy.
It's like living next to a Tarzan movie, without the chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently these guys think they're Matthew McConaughey. Heck,
one of them may be Matthew McConaughey, for all I know. Don't ask
me if they're wearing pants, because I haven't been by to check.
</P>
<P>
   If the Travis Central Appraisal District people think this all
adds up to $91,585 worth of house, they have rocks in their head--

 &HT;    Women stand tall in honor
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gloria Anticoli couldn't help noticing the small
stature of the three women being awarded honorary doctorates at the
University of Dayton on Sunday. Virginia MacMillan Varga, Sister
Mary Peter Traviss, and Evangeline Lindsley all hovered around 5
feet, give or take an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them and think, 'the three Mighty Mouses,'''
Anticoli said, pointing to the banquet table where the women were
honored after the commencement. ``It makes me think about the power
of women.''
</P>
<P>
   The honorees all came of age when physical stature _ read gender
_ translated into intellectual and professional stature. When
people really bought into this stuff about ``the weaker sex.''
</P>
<P>
   And boy, did these women prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Varga became one of the first women inducted into UD's Athletic
Hall of Fame for her athletic exploits in no fewer than four
sports. But it was off the field that she truly distinguished
herself, opening Gloria Dei Montessori School _ the first program
in Dayton _ in 1962, and becoming nationally recognized as a leader
in the Montessori movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Peter Traviss is a Dominican sister dubbed ``The
First Lady of Catholic Education'' by Today's Catholic Teacher for
her work in Catholic education research. UD President Brother
Raymond Fitz praised her as ``among the top five people in Catholic
education in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In 41 years as a teacher at Roosevelt High School, Evangeline
Lindsley taught government and civics to generations of Dayton
youth. She incorporated real life into the lesson plan, fighting
for equality for women and for black students.
</P>
<P>
   The women exhibited a common humility, a greater eagerness to
share credit than to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Varga, a 1951 UD graduate, confessed that she made her husband
read the notification letter to make sure some clerical error
hadn't been made.
</P>
<P>
   Anticoli wasn't surprised by that reaction from her friend of
nearly 50 years. ``Ginny didn't talk a lot about what she was going
to do; she just did it,'' she said. ``These are women who knew who
they were and what they stood for. They did it quietly and didn't
expect the accolades.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Peter said the true glory belongs to her students
and their research. But, she conceded, ``Catholic education and its
quality are passions of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that ``old age has its privileges,'' Lindsley, 103,
remained in her seat. ``I stand today _ well, I'm not standing very
well _ on the shoulders of friends who, through their hard work,
carried our ideas to fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   False modesty? None of these women gave that impression.
</P>
<P>
   They projected, instead, a sense of interconnectedness, of women
building upon one another's accomplishments. As you went around the
room, you found guest after guest whose lives had been touched by
these women.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Turner of Dayton came to cheer on her relative, Evangeline
Lindsley. Yet she remembered the time, only 22 years ago, when her
oldest daughter was in grade school, and Ginny Varga was the only
one who would let her play soccer. There were no soccer leagues for
girls at the time, but Varga included girls on Gloria Dei's team
``even though that meant they automatically forfeited every game,''
Turner recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Girls didn't ``count'' in youth soccer then _ but they always
counted for Varga.
</P>
<P>
   These women are thrilled and honored by their newly minted
doctorates. But they never needed titles or caps and gowns to
remind them of the power of women.

 &HT;    San Francisco cracks down on menace to civil rights: the fat
joke
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas_ ``When the aliens come, they will eat the fat ones
first,'' declared a San Francisco billboard for an area fitness
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco was the wrong place to put a little humor into an
advertisement encouraging fat people to get fit.
</P>
<P>
   Fat San Francisco residents shouted, pouted and stamped their
ponderous feet.
</P>
<P>
   To San Francisco's hefties, this was a weighty issue. Just as
the Founding Fathers did with King George, beefy Bay-area residents
also demanded redress for their grievances.
</P>
<P>
   The oversized residents appealed to San Francisco's Board of
Supervisors for protection against harmful advertisements, fat
humor and remarks or actions that could cause them discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   As residents of the epicenter of America's sensitivity trends,
San Francisco's skinny people picked up on this new movement.
</P>
<P>
   Bony Bay-area natives weren't about to let fat people cut them
out of special protection from equally damaging scrawny jokes or
thinly disguised remarks and actions that hurt the feelings of
weight-challenged residents.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, but if fat and skinny people are going to get government
protection, San Francisco's short people didn't want to be left
out. Surely, said vertically challenged San Francisco residents,
short people deserve just as much protection as do fat people and
skinny people.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, if San Francisco's fat people, skinny people and
short people are going to get government protection, tall people
also deserve protection. After all, how would you like to be asked
``How's the weather up there?'' every day?
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Board of Supervisors expanded their proposed
``fat ordinance'' to include skinny, short and tall. Now it's
against the law in San Francisco to discriminate, in word or deed,
against fat, skinny, short or tall people.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents are doubly protected. Tall skinny people could be
doubly insulted by bean-pole jokes.
</P>
<P>
   According to a New York Times article by Evelyn Nieves, San
Francisco's new ordinance puts size in the same anti-discrimination
codes that already protect people based on race, religion, color,
ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability
and place of birth.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Wann, the 5-foot-6-inch 270-pound head of the local
National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, said, ``We don't
need a diet. We need an end to discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   One supporter of San Francisco's new anti-discrimination size
ordinance complained in the Times article that doctors often tell
fat people that they need to lose weight when they seek medical
treatment for specific ailments.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as though doctors now can be hauled into court if they
suggest while removing a corn that an obese patient should lose
some weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that this law passed because it can have
far-reaching implications outside of San Francisco,'' the woman
said. That scares the pants off the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   To add size to government protections for all people except
those who are dead-perfect average means that short, tall, fat or
skinny people who feel they were insulted, turned down for a job,
passed over for a raise or given a hard time by a sales clerk can
add to America's glut of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the intriguing problem of determining exactly who
does not deserve special government protection.
</P>
<P>
   What is tall, short, overweight or underweight? Can a
6-foot-four-inch NBA guard sue over short jokes by his teammates?
</P>
<P>
   If the San Francisco law spreads nationwide, there probably will
be one very bland white straight guy born in a small town in Iowa,
about 5-feet-10-inches and 167 pounds, who you could joke about.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com

<P>
   Q: Faced with high fuel costs, could motorists realize some
savings by mixing octane ratings? For example, if 10 gallons of
premium gasoline (93 octane) were mixed with 10 gallons of regular
(87 octane), wouldn't that work OK? Or is this not recommended by
the experts?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only problem with that would be the ``hassle'' of putting
in 10 gallons of one type, then clearing the pump before putting in
10 gallons of the other, said Ric Cobb of the Georgia Petroleum
Council. Beyond that, you're not likely to encounter any danger or
problem with engine wear from mixing octanes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb said when prices got so high recently, he would fill up his
car with the highest octane available. Then, after using about
one-fourth of the tank, he would top it back up with 89 octane
fuel. When he had used about half that tank, he would put in 87
octane. Although his car normally uses 93 octane, he experienced no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Only high-performance cars or old cars might suffer a bit of
knocking with lower-than-recommended octane levels, but for most
drivers it won't matter, Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard two sets of figures for the odds of winning the
Big Game jackpot. Some reports say 1 in 76 million, others 1 in 78
million. What is correct, and how are the odds determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you hear that the odds are 1 in 76 million, that's an
approximation. To be exact, the odds of getting 5 correct white
balls and the correct Big Money ball are 1 in 76,275,360 (per $1
play), according to the Georgia Lottery Corp. The GLC's Tandi
Reddick explained that the odds are determined by the total number
combinations possible with the 50 white balls and the 36 gold
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us some history of baseball's All-Star Game,
which is coming back to Atlanta on July 11?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tradition of All-Star Games in baseball dates to an 1858
series between teams of stars from Brooklyn and New York (they were
called ``picked nines'' in those days). But the current All-Star
series began in 1933, when Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward
persuaded hesitant league owners to go along with his proposal for
a game between stars from the American and National leagues, to be
played in Chicago during that city's Century of Progress
exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ward's plan, fans voted for the best players, who then
played each other. Various changes have been made since then in who
makes the choices, but as of 1970 the selection of starting lineups
has been returned to the fans. Each team's manager still selects
the pitchers, however.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Babe Ruth hit a home run in the first All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I never saw anything explaining how Regis Philbin was chosen
to host ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' I think he makes the
program, and is a valuable asset. Can you tell me how he got the
job?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's said that Philbin had been shopping around for something
to do _ other than ``Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee'' _ for some
time. ABC had suggested, among other things, a remake of ``Whom Do
You Trust?'' the 1950s quiz show that launched Johnny Carson's
career. But, as Philbin himself told a Newsweek reporter, he was
interested in ``something new.''
</P>
<P>
   When his agent gave him a tape of ``Millionaire,'' which already
was a smash hit in Britain, Philbin was captivated. He called
Michael Davies, ABC's executive vice president for alternative
series and specials, begging to do a U.S. version of the program.
``He totally `got' the show,'' said Davies, who had offered Philbin
other programs. ``He understood why it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Around the same time as the shootings at Kent State
University in Ohio, several students at Jackson State University in
Mississippi were shot by state troopers. Can you refresh my memory
about that incident and what, if anything, was done to the
troopers?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the early hours of May 15, 1970, 11 days after the
shootings at Kent State, some 40 Mississippi state patrolmen and 26
Jackson city policemen opened fire on a crowd of students gathered
around Alexander Hall, a women's dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the Kent State shootings, sentiment about the Vietnam
War, a history of angry confrontations between white motorists and
black students on a street running through the campus, and rumors
of the assassination of Charles Evers (mayor of Fayette, Miss., and
brother of civil rights leader Medgar Evers), students and
onlookers had set fires, overturned a dump truck and pelted cars
with rocks and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials cordoned off a 30-black area around
the campus and at one point a bottle exploded near Alexander Hall,
sparking rumors of a sniper. According to press accounts, that's
when the shooting began. The barrage left two dead and more than a
dozen wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year a federal grand jury in Jackson failed to return
any indictments, ending the possibility that officers involved
would be prosecuted. Families of those killed and wounded sued the
city of Jackson and the state of Mississippi, but in 1974 a federal
appeals judged ruled that damages couldn't be awarded because it
was impossible to determine who was to blame. In 1982, a final
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court failed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Big Game is played in seven states. Where does the
drawing take place? It seems to be in Atlanta every Tuesday and
Friday night, but does it rotate to other places as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: The drawings indeed are held in Atlanta, at the WSB-TV
studios, said Parquita Nassau of the Georgia Lottery Corp. The
drawings, originally held in Chicago, were moved here in 1998 and
do not rotate to any other city, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the word Dixie?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several theories, including one that it derives
from the Mason-Dixon Line, or another that it's from the French
word dix, meaning 10, which was printed prominently on the back of
$10 notes issued by a New Orleans bank before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But a more likely explanation, according to the Facts on File
Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins, is that the first Dixie
(or Dixieland) may have been in _ surprise _ New York.
</P>
<P>
   The encyclopedia states that the Charlestown Courier of June 11,
1885, mentioned that a person named Dixie had owned a large tract
on Manhattan Island. The story was that ``Dixie's,'' as the tract
was known, ``became synonymous with an ideal location combining
ease, comfort and material happiness of every description.''
</P>
<P>
   After slavery was abolished, the name apparently was transferred
when many people moved south, and presumably looked back to their
old homeplace with feelings of regret.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Steve Irwin, of the ``Crocodile Hunter'' cable
TV program on the Animal Planet, had died from a snake bite. Do you
have any information about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not so. A Discovery Channel spokeswoman said this rumor _
along with another one that he was killed by a crocodile _ makes
the rounds about once a month. It's ``totally false,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the Atlanta Braves were on their 15-game winning streak,
it was reported that the 1916 New York Giants held the record for
the longest one in Major League Baseball history, at 26 games. Who
were the members of that team?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fred Merkle, first base; Larry Doyle, second base; Art
Fletcher, shortstop; Bill McKechnie, third base; Dave Robertson,
right field; Benny Kauff, center field; George Burns, left field;
Bill Rariden, catcher; Charles ``Buck'' Herzog, utility; and
pitchers Jeff Tesreau, William ``Pol'' Perritt, John ``Rube''
Benton, Fred Anderson, Ferdinand ``Ferdie'' Schupp, and Harry
``Slim'' Sallee.
</P>
<P>
   The team, by the way, ended that season with 86 wins, 66 losses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wore an MIA bracelet for many years. I recently lost it and
would like to buy another, but the company where I got my first one
is out of business. Does anyone make them now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Bracelets for prisoners of war and those missing in
action still are available. As one company that sells them notes:
``These bracelets are still worn to keep the issue alive for more
than 10,000 of our brave soldiers still not accounted for.'' The
name, rank, branch of service, home state, date and country of
capture or disappearance are engraved on each bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   One manufacturer is BattleZone Ltd., P.O. Box 266, Towaco, NJ
07082, or e-mail at bzone(at)thebattlezone.com, or fax at
973-402-7226. Four styles are available, priced at $10.50-$16. You
can order them via its Web site,
www.thebattlezone.com/powmia/bracelets.html.
</P>
<P>
   Another source is Stemarco Engraving, 1908 E. 7th St., Odessa,
TX 79761 (915-334-6900). Bracelets, in eight styles, are $5-$50 and
can be ordered online at www.ov-1.com/misc/bracelet-order3.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about a man flying to the North Pole in an
open-cockpit airplane made me wonder: What would the windchill
factor be for someone in an open airplane, going about 160 miles an
hour, with the air temperature 40 degrees below zero Fahrenheit?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're thinking it might be several hundred degrees below
zero, the number may surprise you. It would be about 45.3 degrees
below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Yeaton of the Weather Discovery Center at Mount Washington
Observatory in New Hampshire explained that the actual increase in
windchill is minimal ``once you get beyond a 40 mph wind.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yeaton said, the Windchill Equivalency Temperature doesn't
compute well for extreme temperatures and wind speeds. Windchill
was developed in Antarctica in 1939-40 by Paul Siple and Charles
Passel to determine how the combination of cold and wind would feel
on exposed human flesh. ``The key is `exposed,' '' he said. ``When
you add any clothing, the formula would not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   The Antarctica experiments used the increased rate of freezing
in a cylinder of water at various temperatures and windspeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to determine windchill is to use the Web site
for the National Weather Service _
www.srh.noaa.gov/elp/wxcalc/windchill.html _ and plug numbers into
the calculator. Charts also can be found in World Book
Encyclopedia.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, there was talk about Mattel making a more
realistically proportioned, meaning smaller busted, Barbie. What
ever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reports in 1999 about Barbie being reduced were ``media
hype,'' a spokesman for Mattel told Q&AMP;A. He added that the company
never had any intentions of altering her proportions, and all that
was done at the time was to change her ``face sculpting.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the company is planning to introduce ``Jewel Girl''
Barbie this August, with bigger hips, a smaller bust and a ``more
athletic figure to appeal to teens,'' he said. She will have a
belly button and no seam, so she can bend and flex, which he
described as ``important changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the word ``ain't'' now acceptable in the English language?
I say it is, but an English teacher friend of mine insists that
it's not.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although it's heard fairly often, especially in the southern
and south-central states, ``ain't'' is considered ``nonstandard.''
So your teacher friend is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Even educated people use it in such expressions as ``She ain't
what she used to be,'' ``You ain't heard nothin' yet'' and ``Ain't
that the truth,'' but those are for deliberate effect or humor, and
still fall into the nonstandard category.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1972, a fire at the military personnel archives in St.
Louis destroyed the military records of thousands of people.
Recently I heard that some records had been found that possibly
could replace those that were lost. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Archives and Records Administration has received
numerous inquiries from people who have heard that ``10 million
medical records'' have been found. Like you, these people wondered
if they were duplicates of the records that were burned on July 12,
1973, at the National Personnel Records Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they were summaries for admissions to medical
treatment facilities, and contained limited medical information.
They numbered 7.8 million, not 10 million as the rumor had it.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 million-18 million official military personnel records
were lost in the fire. No duplicate copies were maintained,
according to the records administration, nor was a microfilm copy
ever produced. And there were no indexes created before the fire.
So they're considered to be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   The records involved were those from the Army, concerning
personnnel discharged between Nov. 1, 1912, and Jan. 1, 1960 (an
estimated 80 percent were lost); and Air Force, personnel
discharged between Sept. 25, 1947, and Jan. 1, 1964, with names
alphabetically after Hubbard, James E. (an estimated 75 percent
were lost).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have seen the letters PA in television listings for certain
programs, such as ``NYPD Blue.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It stands for Parental Advisory. Broadcasters use it before a
show airs _ and it's also included in TV listings _ to inform
viewers that there might be some material deemed inappropriate or
offensive (meaning strong language and/or nudity) to children or
even adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When readers inquire about the origins of words, Q&AMP;A
frequently mentions two books,``Morris Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins'' and ``The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and
Phrase Origins.'' Where can these reference works be obtained?
</P>
<P>
   A: If bookstores don't have them in stock, ask that they be
ordered. Bookstores get the data they need from ``Books in Print.''
The Morris work is published by HarperCollins; the encyclopedia is
published by Facts on File. Both are still in print. Several other
books on the same subject also are available in paperback and are
still in print.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Around the time of World War II, anyone entering the Navy was
given a seven-digit serial number. I always understood that the
first three digits indicated what part of the country the person
was from. Where can I get a listing of these numbers with the
related areas they represented?
</P>
<P>
   A: The idea that the first three digits indicate where a person
was from appears to be a rumor of long standing, said John Reilly
of the Navy Historical Center. He added that he had been in the
Navy himself and had heard it discussed over the years. However, he
said no person or agency, including the Navy Personnel Command,
could verify it or provide any information to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of author Kurt Vonnegut Jr.? Several months
ago I read that he was ill, but I never saw anything else.
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``Slaughterhouse Five'' and ``Breakfast of Champions''
novelist, 77, suffered smoke inhalation in late January after a
small blaze broke out on the fourth floor of his East 48th Street
brownstone in Manhattan. He was taken to New York Presbyterian
Hospital, where he initially was listed in critical but stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Hans von Stackelberg, was credited with saving
Vonnegut; his wife, photographer Jill Krementz; and their daughter,
Lily, 17, from serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut was released from the hospital in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain a copy of the 10-minute White House video
with President Clinton spoofing himself? I've seen only bits of it
shown on various TV programs.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's available for purchase, but only as part of a video of
the entire White House Correspondents' Dinner, held April 29 at the
Washington Hilton. Call C-SPAN Archives (877-662-7726) and ask for
item No. 156877. The cost is $31.95, which includes shipping and
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the body of Elian Gonzalez's mother ever recovered? If
not, was it just assumed that she drowned?
</P>
<P>
   A: The body of the mother, Elizabet Broton, hasn't been reported
found. So yes, it's assumed that she drowned along with her
companion, Lazaro Rafael Munero, and his brother, Jikary Munero,
whose bodies also weren't reported found.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's an online company, Webvan, that takes orders for
groceries and delivers them in some U.S. cities. Is Webvan publicly
traded? If it is, what is the stock symbol?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's on Nasdaq: WBVN. If you're interested in investing,
Webvan advises you to contact your stockbroker. Shares aren't
available through Webvan. Information online: www.webvan.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to be a bone marrow donor, or at least register to
become one. I found some information on the Internet, but it looks
like it will cost me $60-$100 simply to be screened. What can you
tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: To become a volunteer marrow donor, you must be between the
ages of 18 and 60 and in general good health, according to the
National Marrow Donor Program. A blood test administered through an
authorized donor center is required to enter your tissue type onto
the National Registry.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for the human leukocyte antigen tissue-typing test is
$35-$90, depending on the donor center, the level of testing
performed, and the laboratory that completes the test. However,
alternative methods for being tested may reduce the cost. For
instance, some donor centers will ask for whole blood or blood
component donations in exchange for the cost of the testing, and
there also may be funding available.
</P>
<P>
   Information can be obtained from local donor centers. For the
National Marrow Donor Program, call 1-800-627-7692. The program's
Web site _ www.marrow.org _ has information and outlines the
surgical marrow extraction procedure, which is done under
anesthesia, and the risk of possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, I read with interest about a man with AIDS
who tried an experimental treatment using transplanted bone marrow
from a baboon. I haven't heard anything since then. Do you have any
new information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The patient, Jeff Getty of Oakland, Calif., received a
transplant of baboon bone marrow on Dec. 14, 1995. The idea was
that, since baboons appear to be immune from the effects of the
AIDS virus, the AIDS-resistant baboon stem cells might take root in
Getty's bone marrow to produce AIDS-fighting cells. But it didn't
work. Baboon cells were found in his body for only two weeks after
the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Getty's condition improved dramatically during the
six-month period after the operation. His doctors couldn't explain
why. One possibility, Getty said, was that irradiation therapy
before the surgery slowed his immune system, which in turn weakened
the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Getty credited the experiment with
extending his life long enough so he could begin taking the latest
generation of AIDS drugs. In the meantime, Getty has become a
spokesman for ``xenotransplants,'' in which animal organs are
transplanted into humans.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been in the news for more than a year, but at last
report his condition was described as ``stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about the Navy vessel USS Gregory,
DD-802? My father served on it, and I was named for it. Also, what
does DD stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: DD is the Navy`s designation for a destroyer. DD-802, of the
Fletcher class, was built at Seattle-Tacoma Yard in Washington
state and commissioned in 1944. It had a displacement of 2,050 tons
and a length of 375 feet, 6 inches; a complement of 329; a speed of
35 knots; and was outfitted with five torpedo tubes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gregory eventually was turned over to the Naval Weapons
Center at China Lake, Calif., for use as a target, said John Reilly
of the Navy Historical Center.
</P>
<P>
   While some information is available online _
http://metalab.unc.edu/hyperwar/USN/ships/DD/DD-802Gregory.html _
everything that has been written about DD-802 or any Navy ships is
as near as a major library, Reilly said. Look for Volume III of the
Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the 10 longest tracks on the NASCAR circuit?
</P>
<P>
   A: The longest is Talladega Superspeedway, Talladega, Ala., at
2.66 miles, followed by: Pocono Raceway, Pocono, Pa., 2.5 miles;
Daytona International Speedway, Daytona Beach, Fla., and
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Indianapolis, Ind., 2.5 miles; Watkins
Glen International, Watkins Glen, N.Y., 2.45 miles; Heartland Park
Topeka, Topeka, Kan., 2.1miles; California Speedway, Fontana,
Calif., and Michigan Speedway, Brooklyn, Mich., 2 miles; Sears
Point Raceway, Sonoma, Calif., 1.9 miles; and Atlanta Motor
Speedway, Hampton, Ga., 1.54 miles. Information online:

   EDITORIAL-MOMS _ Editorial urges support for the Million Mom
March. (The Atlanta Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-CRIME _ One big flaw in Vice President Al Gore's
prospective crime program unveiled in Atlanta last week was his
advocacy of a so-called victims rights amendment to the

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   FILE 1 of 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: Faced with high fuel costs, could motorists realize some
savings by mixing octane ratings? For example, if 10 gallons of
premium gasoline (93 octane) were mixed with 10 gallons of regular
(87 octane), wouldn't that work OK? Or is this not recommended by
the experts?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only problem with that would be the ``hassle'' of putting
in 10 gallons of one type, then clearing the pump before putting in
10 gallons of the other, said Ric Cobb of the Georgia Petroleum
Council. Beyond that, you're not likely to encounter any danger or
problem with engine wear from mixing octanes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb said when prices got so high recently, he would fill up his
car with the highest octane available. Then, after using about
one-fourth of the tank, he would top it back up with 89 octane
fuel. When he had used about half that tank, he would put in 87
octane. Although his car normally uses 93 octane, he experienced no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Only high-performance cars or old cars might suffer a bit of
knocking with lower-than-recommended octane levels, but for most
drivers it won't matter, Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard two sets of figures for the odds of winning the
Big Game jackpot. Some reports say 1 in 76 million, others 1 in 78
million. What is correct, and how are the odds determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you hear that the odds are 1 in 76 million, that's an
approximation. To be exact, the odds of getting 5 correct white
balls and the correct Big Money ball are 1 in 76,275,360 (per $1
play), according to the Georgia Lottery Corp. The GLC's Tandi
Reddick explained that the odds are determined by the total number
combinations possible with the 50 white balls and the 36 gold
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us some history of baseball's All-Star Game,
which is coming back to Atlanta on July 11?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tradition of All-Star Games in baseball dates to an 1858
series between teams of stars from Brooklyn and New York (they were
called ``picked nines'' in those days). But the current All-Star
series began in 1933, when Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward
persuaded hesitant league owners to go along with his proposal for
a game between stars from the American and National leagues, to be
played in Chicago during that city's Century of Progress
exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ward's plan, fans voted for the best players, who then
played each other. Various changes have been made since then in who
makes the choices, but as of 1970 the selection of starting lineups
has been returned to the fans. Each team's manager still selects
the pitchers, however.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Babe Ruth hit a home run in the first All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I never saw anything explaining how Regis Philbin was chosen
to host ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' I think he makes the
program, and is a valuable asset. Can you tell me how he got the
job?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's said that Philbin had been shopping around for something
to do _ other than ``Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee'' _ for some
time. ABC had suggested, among other things, a remake of ``Whom Do
You Trust?'' the 1950s quiz show that launched Johnny Carson's
career. But, as Philbin himself told a Newsweek reporter, he was
interested in ``something new.''
</P>
<P>
   When his agent gave him a tape of ``Millionaire,'' which already
was a smash hit in Britain, Philbin was captivated. He called
Michael Davies, ABC's executive vice president for alternative
series and specials, begging to do a U.S. version of the program.
``He totally `got' the show,'' said Davies, who had offered Philbin
other programs. ``He understood why it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Around the same time as the shootings at Kent State
University in Ohio, several students at Jackson State University in
Mississippi were shot by state troopers. Can you refresh my memory
about that incident and what, if anything, was done to the
troopers?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the early hours of May 15, 1970, 11 days after the
shootings at Kent State, some 40 Mississippi state patrolmen and 26
Jackson city policemen opened fire on a crowd of students gathered
around Alexander Hall, a women's dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the Kent State shootings, sentiment about the Vietnam
War, a history of angry confrontations between white motorists and
black students on a street running through the campus, and rumors
of the assassination of Charles Evers (mayor of Fayette, Miss., and
brother of civil rights leader Medgar Evers), students and
onlookers had set fires, overturned a dump truck and pelted cars
with rocks and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials cordoned off a 30-black area around
the campus and at one point a bottle exploded near Alexander Hall,
sparking rumors of a sniper. According to press accounts, that's
when the shooting began. The barrage left two dead and more than a
dozen wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year a federal grand jury in Jackson failed to return
any indictments, ending the possibility that officers involved
would be prosecuted. Families of those killed and wounded sued the
city of Jackson and the state of Mississippi, but in 1974 a federal
appeals judged ruled that damages couldn't be awarded because it
was impossible to determine who was to blame. In 1982, a final
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court failed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Big Game is played in seven states. Where does the
drawing take place? It seems to be in Atlanta every Tuesday and
Friday night, but does it rotate to other places as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: The drawings indeed are held in Atlanta, at the WSB-TV
studios, said Parquita Nassau of the Georgia Lottery Corp. The
drawings, originally held in Chicago, were moved here in 1998 and
do not rotate to any other city, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the word Dixie?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several theories, including one that it derives
from the Mason-Dixon Line, or another that it's from the French
word dix, meaning 10, which was printed prominently on the back of
$10 notes issued by a New Orleans bank before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But a more likely explanation, according to the Facts on File
Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins, is that the first Dixie
(or Dixieland) may have been in _ surprise _ New York.
</P>
<P>
   The encyclopedia states that the Charlestown Courier of June 11,
1885, mentioned that a person named Dixie had owned a large tract
on Manhattan Island. The story was that ``Dixie's,'' as the tract
was known, ``became synonymous with an ideal location combining
ease, comfort and material happiness of every description.''
</P>
<P>
   After slavery was abolished, the name apparently was transferred
when many people moved south, and presumably looked back to their
old homeplace with feelings of regret.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Steve Irwin, of the ``Crocodile Hunter'' cable
TV program on the Animal Planet, had died from a snake bite. Do you
have any information about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not so. A Discovery Channel spokeswoman said this rumor _
along with another one that he was killed by a crocodile _ makes
the rounds about once a month. It's ``totally false,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the Atlanta Braves were on their 15-game winning streak,
it was reported that the 1916 New York Giants held the record for
the longest one in Major League Baseball history, at 26 games. Who
were the members of that team?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fred Merkle, first base; Larry Doyle, second base; Art
Fletcher, shortstop; Bill McKechnie, third base; Dave Robertson,
right field; Benny Kauff, center field; George Burns, left field;
Bill Rariden, catcher; Charles ``Buck'' Herzog, utility; and
pitchers Jeff Tesreau, William ``Pol'' Perritt, John ``Rube''
Benton, Fred Anderson, Ferdinand ``Ferdie'' Schupp, and Harry
``Slim'' Sallee.
</P>
<P>
   The team, by the way, ended that season with 86 wins, 66 losses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wore an MIA bracelet for many years. I recently lost it and
would like to buy another, but the company where I got my first one
is out of business. Does anyone make them now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Bracelets for prisoners of war and those missing in
action still are available. As one company that sells them notes:
``These bracelets are still worn to keep the issue alive for more
than 10,000 of our brave soldiers still not accounted for.'' The
name, rank, branch of service, home state, date and country of
capture or disappearance are engraved on each bracelet.

can be ordered online at www.ov-1.com/misc/bracelet-order3.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about a man flying to the North Pole in an
open-cockpit airplane made me wonder: What would the windchill
factor be for someone in an open airplane, going about 160 miles an
hour, with the air temperature 40 degrees below zero Fahrenheit?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're thinking it might be several hundred degrees below
zero, the number may surprise you. It would be about 45.3 degrees
below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Yeaton of the Weather Discovery Center at Mount Washington
Observatory in New Hampshire explained that the actual increase in
windchill is minimal ``once you get beyond a 40 mph wind.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yeaton said, the Windchill Equivalency Temperature doesn't
compute well for extreme temperatures and wind speeds. Windchill
was developed in Antarctica in 1939-40 by Paul Siple and Charles
Passel to determine how the combination of cold and wind would feel
on exposed human flesh. ``The key is `exposed,' '' he said. ``When
you add any clothing, the formula would not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   The Antarctica experiments used the increased rate of freezing
in a cylinder of water at various temperatures and windspeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to determine windchill is to use the Web site
for the National Weather Service _
www.srh.noaa.gov/elp/wxcalc/windchill.html _ and plug numbers into
the calculator. Charts also can be found in World Book
Encyclopedia.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: Some time ago, there was talk about Mattel making a more
realistically proportioned, meaning smaller busted, Barbie. What
ever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reports in 1999 about Barbie being reduced were ``media
hype,'' a spokesman for Mattel told Q&AMP;A. He added that the company
never had any intentions of altering her proportions, and all that
was done at the time was to change her ``face sculpting.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the company is planning to introduce ``Jewel Girl''
Barbie this August, with bigger hips, a smaller bust and a ``more
athletic figure to appeal to teens,'' he said. She will have a
belly button and no seam, so she can bend and flex, which he
described as ``important changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the word ``ain't'' now acceptable in the English language?
I say it is, but an English teacher friend of mine insists that
it's not.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although it's heard fairly often, especially in the southern
and south-central states, ``ain't'' is considered ``nonstandard.''
So your teacher friend is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Even educated people use it in such expressions as ``She ain't
what she used to be,'' ``You ain't heard nothin' yet'' and ``Ain't
that the truth,'' but those are for deliberate effect or humor, and
still fall into the nonstandard category.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1972, a fire at the military personnel archives in St.
Louis destroyed the military records of thousands of people.
Recently I heard that some records had been found that possibly
could replace those that were lost. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Archives and Records Administration has received
numerous inquiries from people who have heard that ``10 million
medical records'' have been found. Like you, these people wondered
if they were duplicates of the records that were burned on July 12,
1973, at the National Personnel Records Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they were summaries for admissions to medical
treatment facilities, and contained limited medical information.
They numbered 7.8 million, not 10 million as the rumor had it.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 million-18 million official military personnel records
were lost in the fire. No duplicate copies were maintained,
according to the records administration, nor was a microfilm copy
ever produced. And there were no indexes created before the fire.
So they're considered to be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   The records involved were those from the Army, concerning
personnnel discharged between Nov. 1, 1912, and Jan. 1, 1960 (an
estimated 80 percent were lost); and Air Force, personnel
discharged between Sept. 25, 1947, and Jan. 1, 1964, with names
alphabetically after Hubbard, James E. (an estimated 75 percent
were lost).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have seen the letters PA in television listings for certain
programs, such as ``NYPD Blue.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It stands for Parental Advisory. Broadcasters use it before a
show airs _ and it's also included in TV listings _ to inform
viewers that there might be some material deemed inappropriate or
offensive (meaning strong language and/or nudity) to children or
even adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When readers inquire about the origins of words, Q&AMP;A
frequently mentions two books,``Morris Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins'' and ``The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and
Phrase Origins.'' Where can these reference works be obtained?
</P>
<P>
   A: If bookstores don't have them in stock, ask that they be
ordered. Bookstores get the data they need from ``Books in Print.''
The Morris work is published by HarperCollins; the encyclopedia is
published by Facts on File. Both are still in print. Several other
books on the same subject also are available in paperback and are
still in print.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Around the time of World War II, anyone entering the Navy was
given a seven-digit serial number. I always understood that the
first three digits indicated what part of the country the person
was from. Where can I get a listing of these numbers with the
related areas they represented?
</P>
<P>
   A: The idea that the first three digits indicate where a person
was from appears to be a rumor of long standing, said John Reilly
of the Navy Historical Center. He added that he had been in the
Navy himself and had heard it discussed over the years. However, he
said no person or agency, including the Navy Personnel Command,
could verify it or provide any information to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of author Kurt Vonnegut Jr.? Several months
ago I read that he was ill, but I never saw anything else.
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``Slaughterhouse Five'' and ``Breakfast of Champions''
novelist, 77, suffered smoke inhalation in late January after a
small blaze broke out on the fourth floor of his East 48th Street
brownstone in Manhattan. He was taken to New York Presbyterian
Hospital, where he initially was listed in critical but stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Hans von Stackelberg, was credited with saving
Vonnegut; his wife, photographer Jill Krementz; and their daughter,
Lily, 17, from serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut was released from the hospital in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain a copy of the 10-minute White House video
with President Clinton spoofing himself? I've seen only bits of it
shown on various TV programs.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's available for purchase, but only as part of a video of
the entire White House Correspondents' Dinner, held April 29 at the
Washington Hilton. Call C-SPAN Archives (877-662-7726) and ask for
item No. 156877. The cost is $31.95, which includes shipping and
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the body of Elian Gonzalez's mother ever recovered? If
not, was it just assumed that she drowned?
</P>
<P>
   A: The body of the mother, Elizabet Broton, hasn't been reported
found. So yes, it's assumed that she drowned along with her
companion, Lazaro Rafael Munero, and his brother, Jikary Munero,
whose bodies also weren't reported found.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's an online company, Webvan, that takes orders for
groceries and delivers them in some U.S. cities. Is Webvan publicly
traded? If it is, what is the stock symbol?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's on Nasdaq: WBVN. If you're interested in investing,
Webvan advises you to contact your stockbroker. Shares aren't
available through Webvan. Information online: www.webvan.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to be a bone marrow donor, or at least register to
become one. I found some information on the Internet, but it looks
like it will cost me $60-$100 simply to be screened. What can you
tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: To become a volunteer marrow donor, you must be between the
ages of 18 and 60 and in general good health, according to the
National Marrow Donor Program. A blood test administered through an
authorized donor center is required to enter your tissue type onto
the National Registry.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for the human leukocyte antigen tissue-typing test is
$35-$90, depending on the donor center, the level of testing
performed, and the laboratory that completes the test. However,
alternative methods for being tested may reduce the cost. For
instance, some donor centers will ask for whole blood or blood
component donations in exchange for the cost of the testing, and
there also may be funding available.
</P>
<P>
   Information can be obtained from local donor centers. For the
National Marrow Donor Program, call 1-800-627-7692. The program's
Web site _ www.marrow.org _ has information and outlines the
surgical marrow extraction procedure, which is done under
anesthesia, and the risk of possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, I read with interest about a man with AIDS
who tried an experimental treatment using transplanted bone marrow
from a baboon. I haven't heard anything since then. Do you have any
new information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The patient, Jeff Getty of Oakland, Calif., received a
transplant of baboon bone marrow on Dec. 14, 1995. The idea was
that, since baboons appear to be immune from the effects of the
AIDS virus, the AIDS-resistant baboon stem cells might take root in
Getty's bone marrow to produce AIDS-fighting cells. But it didn't
work. Baboon cells were found in his body for only two weeks after
the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Getty's condition improved dramatically during the
six-month period after the operation. His doctors couldn't explain
why. One possibility, Getty said, was that irradiation therapy
before the surgery slowed his immune system, which in turn weakened
the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Getty credited the experiment with
extending his life long enough so he could begin taking the latest
generation of AIDS drugs. In the meantime, Getty has become a
spokesman for ``xenotransplants,'' in which animal organs are
transplanted into humans.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been in the news for more than a year, but at last
report his condition was described as ``stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about the Navy vessel USS Gregory,
DD-802? My father served on it, and I was named for it. Also, what
does DD stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: DD is the Navy`s designation for a destroyer. DD-802, of the
Fletcher class, was built at Seattle-Tacoma Yard in Washington
state and commissioned in 1944. It had a displacement of 2,050 tons
and a length of 375 feet, 6 inches; a complement of 329; a speed of
35 knots; and was outfitted with five torpedo tubes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gregory eventually was turned over to the Naval Weapons
Center at China Lake, Calif., for use as a target, said John Reilly
of the Navy Historical Center.
</P>
<P>
   While some information is available online _
http://metalab.unc.edu/hyperwar/USN/ships/DD/DD-802Gregory.html _
everything that has been written about DD-802 or any Navy ships is
as near as a major library, Reilly said. Look for Volume III of the
Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the 10 longest tracks on the NASCAR circuit?
</P>
<P>
   A: The longest is Talladega Superspeedway, Talladega, Ala., at
2.66 miles, followed by: Pocono Raceway, Pocono, Pa., 2.5 miles;
Daytona International Speedway, Daytona Beach, Fla., and
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Indianapolis, Ind., 2.5 miles; Watkins
Glen International, Watkins Glen, N.Y., 2.45 miles; Heartland Park
Topeka, Topeka, Kan., 2.1miles; California Speedway, Fontana,
Calif., and Michigan Speedway, Brooklyn, Mich., 2 miles; Sears
Point Raceway, Sonoma, Calif., 1.9 miles; and Atlanta Motor
Speedway, Hampton, Ga., 1.54 miles. Information online:

collective conscience. It was because he was brought in to protect
a ninth-inning lead but he provided the sort of relief that rat
poison would give to an upset stomach. By STEVE CAMPBELL.

   Yogurt. Do you remember the ads showing 100-year-old Russians
who survived to such a ripe old age because they ate yogurt? How
else could you convince people to eat that slightly tart mixture
when sour cream was so much creamier and sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Some terrible things have happened to yogurt since those good
old days. They have added artificial sweeteners, fake fruit
flavors, sugar, honey. It has gotten so that whatever tart taste
yogurt naturally had is now hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly isn't anything you want to find in a recipe for
goat cheese dressing, a cucumber yogurt salad or one made with
smoked fish and beets.
</P>
<P>
   Plain yogurt may be an acquired taste but it's a taste worth
acquiring. Not only does it drastically reduce the calories in many
dishes, it adds a very appealing taste to others.
</P>
<P>
   In the smoked fish and beet salad the yogurt cuts the sweetness
of the beets and the richness of the fish. It provides a similar
service in the cucumber, raisin, walnut salad. And in the goat
cheese dressing it provides the volume while reducing the calories
in the goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes call for nonfat yogurt, but if you aren't worried
about calories or fat you can use whole milk yogurt or low fat
yogurt. Each of these recipes can be prepared in advance and
refrigerated overnight. If you prepare the cucumber raisin salad
ahead, do not add the walnuts until just before serving.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite appearances, this was not gallows humor, James
Baldwin insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 1/2 hours before game time at Fenway Park, the Chicago
White Sox righthander was engaged in some good-natured _ and hardly
strenuous _ wrestling with bullpen catcher Man Soo Lee. It was a
short-lived match, lasting only until one of the White Sox looked
up from the day's ``Masterpiece Theatre'' fare on the clubhouse VCR
_ ``Dumb and Dumber'' _ and, with mock indignation, ordered Lee to
desist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave him alone,'' the protective teammate warned Baldwin's
adversary in horseplay. ``He's got to work tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a pulled muscle or some such calamity during pregame
hijinks might have been preferable to Baldwin's order of business:
taking the mound at Fenway Tuesday against a team that had savaged
him on the two catastrophic occasions he had ventured there last
season. In an aborted start June 26 and a punitive relief stint two
days later, Baldwin allowed a total of 11 hits and 10 runs in 2 1/3
innings _ a spiffy 38.57 ERA _ as the Red Sox bludgeoned Chicago by
scores of 17-1 and 14-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Baldwin claimed there were no scars on his psyche when he
returned to the scene of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always do that,'' he said of his pregame ritual with Lee.
``That's something that I never change, because you've got to keep
the guys loose. You can't worry about going out there and facing
those hitters all the time. If you're going out there thinking
about it, a lot of times you're not going to do too good.''
</P>
<P>
   For proof that ``What, me worry?'' are words to live by, Baldwin
never looked better than he did while doing the unthinkable to the
Red Sox. He made them look like an outtake from ``Dumb and
Dumber,'' flustering them to distraction while registering the
first shutout of his five-year career, a three-hit, 6-0
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The only ball hit with authority off him was Troy O'Leary's
first-pitch single to center field in the fifth inning. That was
sandwiched around a pair of Trot Nixon softies _ a bloop single to
left with one out in the first and an infield hit behind second
base opening the ninth _ as Baldwin disposed of Boston in a mere 2
hours 22 minutes, notching 71 strikes and eight strikeouts among
his 102 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this visit to his 1999 burial ground wasn't
particularly traumatic for Baldwin, but it seems nothing is. He
strives for simplicity, both in execution and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another ballpark,'' he said. ``Last year was last
year. This year is this year. I don't think about stuff like that.
All I think about is going out and throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   His impact was more profound than his assessment. So dominant
was Baldwin that he confounded even his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was him throw his fastball and curveball equally
well,'' said first baseman Paul Konerko, whose sixth-inning single
scored the only run Baldwin needed. ``It seemed that when they were
thinking fastball, he'd throw a curveball. And when they were
thinking curveball, he'd throw a fastball. It's almost like he knew
what they were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   He sure fooled Konerko, because Baldwin doesn't make things so
complicated. Perhaps that's one reason that while the venue may
have been unlikely, his success wasn't. At 28, the 6-foot-3-inch,
210-pound North Carolina native has blossomed into one of the elite
pitchers in the American League. His 6-0 record is tied for the
league's best, and his 2.34 ERA is among the league's lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox can dolefully attest that he is a revelation,
because while Baldwin has been a consistent double-figure winner
throughout his career, he's never exceeded 13 victories. But while
going an indifferent 12-13 last season, he provided hints of
excellence by winning eight of his last 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain the transformation? Simple, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I don't think I was attacking the hitters the way I am
this year,'' said Baldwin. ``I'm more aggressive this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he now ranks as the bona fide stopper on manager
Jerry Manuel's staff, a status he reinforced tuesday night with
Chicago on a 1-7 skid.
</P>
<P>
   ``JB has been a guy that's saved us a number of times this
year,'' said Manuel. ``Any time we've been on a little slide, he's
been the guy to stop it. You've got to be on a real good roll (to
do that).''
</P>
<P>
   The secret, Baldwin illustrated with his Fenway revival show, is
to roll with the punches. And forget the knockouts.

   For the first time since 1979, he will be sitting in the
visitors clubhouse when his team plays in Cleveland. What happened
to him last December _ when he was fired as Indians manager despite
winning five straight AL Central titles _ was a shocking reminder
that there is no substitute for winning world championships, even
if you've had one of baseball's most dominating ball clubs year
after year. His Indians twice made it to the World Series, in 1995
and 1997, but failed to win it all, and Hargrove was vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Hargrove, the Baltimore Orioles couldn't afford
to work with an all-or-nothing philosophy. They hired Hargrove to
manage, giving him a three-year contract with a club option for
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove's nine-year record of 721-591 appealled to Baltimore,
and he became the Orioles' fourth manager in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove knows he has stepped into a lion's cage. The club he
inherited has an average age of 32 years old. The club's mainstay,
Cal Ripken, is one of several players who can become free agents
after the season. That list also includes Harold Baines, Mike
Bordick, Charles Johnson, Will Clark, and Mike Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, Hargrove's teams averaged 94 wins a season the
last five years. Baltimore's average in that time was 83 wins per
season, and that includes seasons in which Johnson's team won 98
and 88 games, back to back. The Orioles made the playoffs those
years, and won their Division Series, but they lost in the ALCS
both time, to the Yankees and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove took nothing for granted in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been the only person who didn't concede the
division title to the Cleveland Indians,'' he said. ``Each year I
went in there with all my insecurities flaming. I never have
approached anything as a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what I'm feeling now is no different in that regard. We're
obviously in a lot more difficult position in the East Division
than it was in the Central. If I have to get up every morning and
affirm to myself that I'm a winner, then there is something
missing. I feel like I've been a winner for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   After a solid 14-10 April, the Orioles have slipped a bit in
May, but they are right on the heels of the Red Sox, with whom they
begin a three-game series in Camden Yards Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hargrove said, he had trouble making the adjustment to
a new organization. The break with Cleveland was not without pain.
Speculation persisted before the firing that his players were not
responding to his leadership. He'd been around the Indians
organization for 20 years and was an intergal part of the movement
that lifted the club out of the doldrums of the previous three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense of what happened and what went wrong,'' said
Hargrove. ``But you'd have to go to the other side to get a view of
what they felt brought this on.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem Hargrove had to deal with in Cleveland was
outfielder Albert Belle, who left as a free agent in 1996. The two
were reunited this spring and are apparently friends again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out he was here,'' said Hargrove, ``it didn't
bother me a bit. It was ironic but it didn't cause me to lose any
sleep. Albert has been fantastic since Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said the kind of success Cleveland has been enjoying
won't come overnight in Baltimore. In his first three full seasons
managing the Indians, 1992-94, they were a young team with little
real talent. They won 76, 76, and then 66 games (in the shortened
1994 season). During that period, they started signing up young
players like Belle, Sandy Alomar, Manny Ramirez, Carlos Baerga, and
Jim Thome to long-term contracts. A turning point was the opening
of Jacobs Field in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over the Indians in 1991,'' said Hargrove, ``it
was pretty much a mix of veterans and young players. We started the
rebuilding program for real in 1992. That took our payroll down to
$8 million-$10 million. It had been $32 million at the end of the
1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of credit has to go to John Hart for directing that
effort. He certainly didn't let any grass grow under his feet. One
of his favorite words is `proactive.' In other words, we would
trade a player in that regard _ too soon rather than too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Orioles can use that same system to cure what ails
them, Hargrove said, ``The Orioles haven't reached that point yet.
But we still feel that the talent level is here. If we get the
right breaks along the way, we can still compete with the Red Sox
and Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakness of this team so far is our pitching staff. We
haven't pitched well at all. It hasn't been just one player. It's
everybody. But we really feel that it's just a matter of the
pitching staff jelling. The strength is that we swung the bats and
scored runs. We aren't going to steal a lot of bases.''
</P>
<P>
   The retooling of the Orioles might come sooner than later,
according to Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony DeMacio, our chief scout, and his staff have done a good
job, especially in this last draft,'' said Hargrove. ``We hope to
stockpile our farm system. It's an ongoing process. I don't want to
say we're where we want to be yet but we've taken big strides in
that direction.''

CONDO PURCHASE COULD CRIMP RETIREMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to retire in two years and to buy a condominium. I
plan to copurchase this condo equally with my partner, and we have
set a $300,000 ceiling. I now rent, am single, and have no debts or
dependents. I add $50 a month to my investment in Putnam Growth and
Income and $60 a month to the money market fund. Is my plan
feasible?
</P>
<P>
   J.D., Newton Highlands, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know how much you feel you will need to live on in
retirement, but I would be more comfortable with a more modest
condo purchase than you seem to have in mind. Let's do some math.
With your current additions of $110 a month to your savings, you
would have $477,752, presuming an overall portfolio return of 8
percent for the next two years. If you then spent $150,000 of it
for the condo, you would have $327,752. You might anticipate a 6.5
percent yield on this if it were invested in a fixed-income
portfolio, providing you with $21,303. Add in Social Security and
you would have a $32,163 annual income stream.
</P>
<P>
   There are two questions here. One is whether that would meet
your living expenses, including condo taxes and maintenance. The
second problem is future inflation. If you put all of your savings
in fixed-income investments and spent the yield, you would have no
protection against the inflation of the later years of your
retirement. Yes, there will likely be small Social Security
increases, but not enough to make a major difference. A better plan
would be to leave a sizable chunk of money in growth investments,
such as the Putnam Growth and Income and MFS Massachusetts
Investors funds _ say $125,000. But that would then reduce the
yield from your fixed-income portfolio to $13,173, and with Social
Security included, you would have a $24,033 income stream in
retirement. Lots of people can live comfortably on such an income.
If you cannot, the alternatives include a more modest condo
purchase, saving more, or retiring later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to retire from my high-stress job as soon as
possible. I am single with no dependents and contribute $9,600 a
year to my company's 401(k) plan. I need about $50,000 in annual
income. I would do part-time and odd jobs to make up about $8,000
of that income, and draw from my investments for the rest. Am I
dreaming? If I retire now, what kind of income could I safely draw
from my investments? What should be my investment goal in order to
be in a position to retire the way I want?
</P>
<P>
   C.H., Laguna Miguel, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am guessing what prompted this question at this point.
Probably not by coincidence, if you put your $674,500 portfolio
into fixed-income securities, it would deliver almost precisely
that $42,000 that you feel you would need. But it also would
probably eventually loom as a monumental mistake. This is because
the earlier you retire, the more money you will need to have.
Certainly it is only prudent at your tender age to presume that
most of your life is ahead of you, and if you retire now on what
looks like a manageable budget, inflation will wreak havoc on your
plans _ and pretty quickly, too. I would think that, at a minimum,
you should count on working another five years. At that point, with
8 percent average annual portfolio growth and ongoing contributions
of $9.600 a year, you would have a $1,063,541 accumulation. By that
time, you would need $59,384 to support the life style that $50,000
income provides today. You would need a fixed-income portfolio of
roughly $900,000 to supply that, leaving you with only about
$163,000 to leave in growth vehicles that would protect you against
future inflation. Even that, I feel, is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   So I ran the numbers out to eight years, at which point you
would have an accumulation of $1,383,546 and would require $65,840
to support your target life style. That would mean a fixed-income
portfolio of roughly $1 million, with $383,000 in stocks as your
inflation hedge. A perfect situation? No. You would still be
retiring at age 53, and still have many years before you. The
buffer isn't really big enough, but you could probably pull through
at that stage.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portfolio, I suggest that you trim the money market
holdings to a minimum level that you would feel safe with as
emergency funds, moving the remainder to a Vanguard Index 500
holding. Other than that, it looks fine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Am I doing the right thing, having all my assets in Vanguard
funds? I am 96, but mentally 45. I have been in the markets since
1927 _ in and out. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   C.R., Chula Vista, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you have nothing to worry about. Although all of your
holdings are within the same fund family, what you own is five
separate and distinct business entities, which happen to have the
same management company in common. Each mutual fund within a family
holds its assets separate from those of other funds, and separate
as well from the assets of the parent company which manages the
family's funds. In the case of Vanguard, the parent company is a
mutual entity, owned by the shareholders of the funds that make up
the Vanguard Group. Although the Vanguard Group is a solid entity,
there is one small situation which might give shareholders pause.
This involves owners of the group's money market funds. When a
money market fund gets in trouble with an investment, the worst
possible outcome would be that the fund would have to break the
buck, which is industry jargon for going below the $1 constant
value money market funds seek to maintain. Never in the history of
money market funds has a retail fund broken the buck _ in every
case where such a situation loomed the parent company that
established it has made up the difference, taking blame for the
misjudgment that got the fund in trouble. But since Vanguard is a
mutual company, there are no assets which could be diverted to
rescue a money market fund if it got in trouble. Is this a matter
of scouring a pure blue sky for clouds?: You bet it is. Vanguard's
funds are conservatively and prudently managed, and this is a worry
so tiny that I consider it insignificant. And for the record, in
the past when I have had some cash to park, I have used Vanguard's
Prime Money Market fund _ and slept like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was raising two children when I left a job in 1989, so I
bought life insurance. Now the kids are gone, and I would like to
discontinue the policy, invest the cash value in a life insurance
fund, and use the money I had been spending on the premiums for
long-term health care insurance. My question involves the tax
implications. Is this considered ordinary income, or is it
claimable at all? The way I figure it, I paid in about $7,000, and
if there is any tax at all, it should be on what it has gained.
</P>
<P>
   R.C., Scottsdale, Ariz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. According to J.K. Lasser's ``Your Income Tax,'' you are
correct. If the cash received on the surrender of a policy exceeds
the premiums paid less dividends received, the excess is taxed as
ordinary income. So unless you received dividend checks, the tax
liability would be for about $3,300.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite appearances, this was not gallows humor, James
Baldwin insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 1/2 hours before game time at Fenway Park, the Chicago
White Sox righthander was engaged in some good-natured _ and hardly
strenuous _ wrestling with bullpen catcher Man Soo Lee. It was a
short-lived match, lasting only until one of the White Sox looked
up from the day's ``Masterpiece Theatre'' fare on the clubhouse VCR
_ ``Dumb and Dumber'' _ and, with mock indignation, ordered Lee to
desist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave him alone,'' the protective teammate warned Baldwin's
adversary in horseplay. ``He's got to work tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a pulled muscle or some such calamity during pregame
hijinks might have been preferable to Baldwin's order of business:
taking the mound at Fenway Tuesday against a team that had savaged
him on the two catastrophic occasions he had ventured there last
season. In an aborted start June 26 and a punitive relief stint two
days later, Baldwin allowed a total of 11 hits and 10 runs in 2 1/3
innings _ a spiffy 38.57 ERA _ as the Red Sox bludgeoned Chicago by
scores of 17-1 and 14-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Baldwin claimed there were no scars on his psyche when he
returned to the scene of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always do that,'' he said of his pregame ritual with Lee.
``That's something that I never change, because you've got to keep
the guys loose. You can't worry about going out there and facing
those hitters all the time. If you're going out there thinking
about it, a lot of times you're not going to do too good.''
</P>
<P>
   For proof that ``What, me worry?'' are words to live by, Baldwin
never looked better than he did while doing the unthinkable to the
Red Sox. He made them look like an outtake from ``Dumb and
Dumber,'' flustering them to distraction while registering the
first shutout of his five-year career, a three-hit, 6-0
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The only ball hit with authority off him was Troy O'Leary's
first-pitch single to center field in the fifth inning. That was
sandwiched around a pair of Trot Nixon softies _ a bloop single to
left with one out in the first and an infield hit behind second
base opening the ninth _ as Baldwin disposed of Boston in a mere 2
hours 22 minutes, notching 71 strikes and eight strikeouts among
his 102 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this visit to his 1999 burial ground wasn't
particularly traumatic for Baldwin, but it seems nothing is. He
strives for simplicity, both in execution and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another ballpark,'' he said. ``Last year was last
year. This year is this year. I don't think about stuff like that.
All I think about is going out and throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   His impact was more profound than his assessment. So dominant
was Baldwin that he confounded even his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was him throw his fastball and curveball equally
well,'' said first baseman Paul Konerko, whose sixth-inning single
scored the only run Baldwin needed. ``It seemed that when they were
thinking fastball, he'd throw a curveball. And when they were
thinking curveball, he'd throw a fastball. It's almost like he knew
what they were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   He sure fooled Konerko, because Baldwin doesn't make things so
complicated. Perhaps that's one reason that while the venue may
have been unlikely, his success wasn't. At 28, the 6-foot-3-inch,
210-pound North Carolina native has blossomed into one of the elite
pitchers in the American League. His 6-0 record is tied for the
league's best, and his 2.34 ERA is among the league's lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox can dolefully attest that he is a revelation,
because while Baldwin has been a consistent double-figure winner
throughout his career, he's never exceeded 13 victories. But while
going an indifferent 12-13 last season, he provided hints of
excellence by winning eight of his last 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain the transformation? Simple, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I don't think I was attacking the hitters the way I am
this year,'' said Baldwin. ``I'm more aggressive this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he now ranks as the bona fide stopper on manager
Jerry Manuel's staff, a status he reinforced tuesday night with
Chicago on a 1-7 skid.
</P>
<P>
   ``JB has been a guy that's saved us a number of times this
year,'' said Manuel. ``Any time we've been on a little slide, he's
been the guy to stop it. You've got to be on a real good roll (to
do that).''
</P>
<P>
   The secret, Baldwin illustrated with his Fenway revival show, is
to roll with the punches. And forget the knockouts.

`THE BIG HURT' TOOK HIS LUMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Frank Thomas readily accepts the blame. The fault, he
ruefully acknowledges, was entirely his. It's not as if he wasn't
warned, repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, to be precise, while he was recklessly
establishing himself as a one-man Chicago White Sox pantheon
without regard for the consequences, Thomas had heard the
admonitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set lofty standards at a fairly young age,'' a chastened
Thomas recalled before a game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park.
``Guys told me it would be tough to match them later.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the cocksure folly of youth, Thomas ignored the sages.
He blithely continued along his path of destruction as baseball's
most protean slugger, compiling Cooperstown credentials while
becoming the only player in history to bat .300 and collect 100
walks, 100 runs, 100 RBIs, and 20 homers for seven consecutive
seasons (1991-97). In fact, only two players _ nonentities named
Lou Gehrig and Ted Williams _ ever hit this superfecta as many as
four years running. But Thomas refused to learn from history.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his doomsaying elders had cautioned, he paid royally for
that stratospheric excellence the past two years. Performances that
most mortals would have killed for _ 35 homers and 125 RBIs in
1998, a .305 average last season _ were considered resounding duds
relative to vintage Thomas. For the first time, soft spots were
exposed _ a .265 average in 1998, a mere 15 homers and 77 RBIs last
season _ where previously there had been none. For just about
anyone else, they could have been overlooked. In the gilded context
created by Thomas, they were glaring.
</P>
<P>
   And they merely led the charge of indignities that besieged
Thomas. He endured the ugly dissolution of his marriage, which had
been unraveling for several years. His volatile relationship with
manager Jerry Manuel, who took over in 1998, was pure tabloid
fodder. He was virtually the lone survivor amid a roster demolition
that left him to compensate for the mistakes of the raw kids who
surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stuck out like a sore thumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was as fickle as a diva in his indecision about whether to
continue playing first base, his position since he came out of
Auburn University as a 6-foot-5-inch, 270-pound power prototype, or
take cover as the designated hitter. And he was hounded by injuries
_ a bone spur in his right ankle, a corn on his small right toe _
that made a shambles of his classic swing and left him pitifully
vulnerable to the inside stuff that exploitative pitchers gleefully
heaped upon him.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, Thomas discovered, there were infidels in the
cathedral. His initial exposure to boos from his former idolators
at Comiskey Park hurt the Big Hurt a lot more than his foot did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a humbling experience,'' said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He can view his desolation from a dispassionate distance now.
Retrospect has been cushioned by renewed success. Thomas again is
wreaking havoc instead of being wracked by it. He is batting .364
with 6 homers and 25 RBIs, numbers more representative of his
eminence. Perhaps an even greater indication was his hauteur, the
prerogative of virtuosos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with my start,'' he sniffed, ``but it could be a
little better. I feel I should have more homers and doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   He will soon. Manuel and third-year hitting coach Von Joshua are
positive of that. They realize Thomas has been a terror despite
being plagued by a balky hamstring and a sprained right ankle
suffered during the final exhibition of the spring. And they are
giddy in their anticipation because they believe that for the first
time, they are seeing the real Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   From a clinical perspective, Joshua has observed the return of
Thomas's nonpareil swing: ``I see a lot more patience at the plate.
He's back to taking his walks a lot more. He's not diving, not
chasing pitches like he was last year. Pitchers realize they can't
go inside on him anymore. He's not moving his head. He's quieted
his head down quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment has a more cosmic application because Thomas's
head indeed is in a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a different person this year,'' said Joshua. ``He's much
happier, much chirpier. He seems to be more focused on his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel believes that resolve was forged in adversity:
``Unfortunately, I think the negative exposure he received
strengthened him to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Joshua, ``He was locked and loaded from day one. I could
see what made Frank great.''
</P>
<P>
   Attitude, for one thing. Manuel _ who like Thomas dismisses
reports of a rift between player and manager as a media concoction
despite documentation to the contrary _ was heartened when his
reluctant superstar came to him during camp and volunteered to play
first base, which was what Manuel had been trying to sell him all
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wanted to get back on the field, back to being that
Hall of Fame presence,'' said the manager. ``His focus was much
different. He had a completely different mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas agreees with the psychoanalyses to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``this will be a breakout season to show
I can still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he reminds us, let's not get carried away by
this renaissance. Thomas never stopped doing it; he just stopped
doing it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say I'm back,'' he pointed out, ``because I've
never really gone anywhere.''

   Mention Salem and religion in the same sentence, and most people
immediately think witchcraft. But the Massachusetts community also
has a strong and little-known connection to Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Smith, the American prophet whose writings inspired the
founding of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, once
predicted that gold would be found in Salem. He visited Salem as a
young boy and again after founding his church, and numerous Salem
residents followed the church west in the mid-19th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Smith even visited the local museum, the Peabody Essex, signing
the visitors' register in 1836. Now the connections between Smith
and Salem, along with some rare artifacts from the museum's
Phillips Library and the church's Utah headquarters, are the
subject of an exhibition at the Peabody Essex Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit and a series of events in Salem, along with the
expected opening of a Mormon temple in Belmont, Mass. this year,
are expected to draw thousands of Mormons to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that the Mormon church was going to be building a
temple in the metropolitan Boston area, and we realized that we had
some very critically important pieces of the Mormon past,'' said
William T. La Moy, cocurator of the exhibit. ``We think we have an
interesting representation of how the church evolved and moved
west.''
</P>
<P>
   Mormon officials, who loaned several objects to the exhibit, are
delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our members did not know how rich Salem was in church
history,'' said Sue Schmidt, regional public affairs director for
the Mormons. ``People had no idea Joseph Smith had been to Salem,
or that some of the early members at Salem contributed greatly to
the success of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was born in 1805 in Sharon, Vt., to a family that had
lived for generations in Topsfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1813, after doctors had bored holes into his leg bone in an
effort to combat typhoid fever, Smith's mother sent her 8-year-old
son to Salem in the hopes that the sea breeze would speed his
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1836, after forming a church that he said restored an
ancient form of Christianity, Smith returned to Salem to explore
the possibility of establishing a base there.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had prophesied that gold would be found in Salem, and his
followers later concluded that the prophesy was metaphorical,
referring to the wealth of people heading from Salem to the West. A
Salem Mormon named Nathaniel H. Felt, who at one point provided
housing to Smith's successor, Brigham Young, ultimately led about
100 Salem residents west.
</P>
<P>
   Mormonism was controversial in Massachusetts, but not nearly as
controversial as in the Midwest, where Mormons were persecuted and
Smith was murdered in Illinois in 1844. Among the exhibits are
early chronicles of the Mormon stay in Salem from a newspaper
called the Essex Gazette, a pro-Mormon broadside and an anti-Mormon
tract from Salem illustrating that the church was the subject of
debate, and 19th Century engravings showing the Mormons travelling
west in handcarts and wagons.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, ``From New England to the Great Salt Lake,''
features a number of rare items from the Peabody Essex collection,
including a letter from Smith detailing church persecution in
Missouri, rare first and fourth editions of the Book of Mormon, and
original guidebooks used by Mormons traveling west in the early
19th Century. The church has provided the museum with sculptures,
paintings, etchings, photographs, and lithographs from its own
collection in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also includes a genealogy work room where visitors
can explore their family trees. The Mormon church emphasizes
genealogy because of its belief that the dead can be baptized and
thereby achieve salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit runs through Aug. 27 at museum ($10 admission for
adults. Information: 800-745-4054, www.pem.org).
</P>
<P>
   A variety of events are taking place in conjunction with the
exhibit, including concerts, walking tours, and lectures
(Information: 877-SALEM-MA, www.salem.org).

<P>
   Sacrament of the Sick
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since early in the second century, if not before, Christians
have attempted to replicate the healing power of Jesus with rituals
in which priests lay hands on, anoint, and pray over the sick.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual was known as unction, meaning anointing. By the early
middle ages, it had become extreme unction because it was performed
as part of the last rites for dying individuals, and its purpose
had shifted from physical healing to a healing of ``the sickness of
soul that might keep you from everlasting life,'' according to the
Rev. Richard N. Fragomeni, a professor of liturgy and preaching at
Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own grandmother didn't want a priest to come when she was
sick, because that would be seen as a sign that she was dying,''
Fragomeni said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic bishops gathering at the Second Vatican Council of the
mid-1960s decided to restore the rite to its ancient purpose,
replacing the rite of extreme unction with what is now termed the
sacrament of the sick.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual, which still includes prayer, anointing with oil, and
laying on of hands, is now performed by priests for anyone in
physical or mental pain, whether chronic or acute, and not just for
those on their deathbed.

WILL SUBURBAN MOMS BE THERE IN NOVEMBER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; should be clear that in the most violent nation in the
wealthy world, I am happy that a Million Mom March exists at all.
The mom of our two boys is going. Her mom is going. It is not every
Mother's Day that mothers go to Washington to attempt to change the
course of human hist, er, herstory.
</P>
<P>
   It is exciting. Underneath the surface, it is also an
excruciating political and racial moment. Sunday's Million Mom
March certainly will be a momentous photo op if enough black and
brown mothers of bullet-riddled inner cities lock arms with white
mothers of suburban privilege. There is undeniable power in seeing
a rainbow of women who, like my wife and mother-in-law, would not
join the National Rifle Association if you held a . . . I guess
this is not the right moment for that cliche.
</P>
<P>
   That is power for a moment. The question is whether there is
enough power for a movement. This is where the Million Mom March
becomes a racial question. The legacy of the rally utterly depends
on whether white mothers return home to muzzle the guns of America
where it counts, in the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Mom March plays on the notion that women, spared the
horrors of testosterone, can nurture us away from Columbine, from
deaths like 6-year-old Kayla Rolland and garden variety gunshots in
domestic disputes and drug deals. On the gun issue alone, that
would seem to be the case. A recent Pew poll found that 73 percent
of women make controlling gun ownership a higher priority than gun
owners' rights, compared to 59 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   If white women were voting solely for the president most likely
to take gun control seriously, the November election would be a
done deal. Republican candidate George W. Bush supports gun
ownership far more shamelessly than Democrat Al Gore. While Gore
has made modest restrictions part of his stump speech, Bush, the
Texas governor, signed into law the right to carry concealed
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So far, guns have not affected Bush's poll numbers with women. A
poll by Emily's List, a women's Democratic fund-raising group,
found Gore to be only 6 percentage points ahead of Bush among
women. A poll by the political newspaper Hotline found Bush to be
four percentage points ahead of Gore among women.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Bush to have
an overall lead over Gore, 46 percent to 41 percent. The Journal's
poll found Bush to lead Gore by 15 percentage points overall in the
suburbs and by 10 percentage points among white women. Any overall
leads Gore has in any polls among women are due to his guaranteed
support among African-American women, who have been sick of guns
for a long time and would not vote for Bush if you held a _ OK, OK,
I quit.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility of white women voters was seen in the 1992
presidential election. Bill Clinton made far more obvious overtures
to women than Republican rival George Bush. Yet white women split,
41 percent to 41 percent, for Clinton and Bush. ``A majority of
white women supported neither the Democratic Party nor President
Clinton in the 1990s,'' Anna Greenberg of Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government has said.
</P>
<P>
   A huge example of white women leaders marching one way and white
women voters fleeing in the opposite direction has been affirmative
action. When affirmative action went before the voters in
California and Washington state, groups such as the National
Organization for Women, urged women to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   White women have benefited from affirmative action more than
people of color. But opponents of affirmative action successfully
cast the issue only in terms of black people getting unfair
advantages. In both states, white women decisively voted to kill
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Mom March was organized mainly by white
suburbanites. They should get credit for recognizing how late they
came to the issue after a violent 1980s and early 1990s in
low-income neighborhoods of color. The creator of the Million Mom
March, Donna Dees-Thomases is honest enough to say that she did not
care deeply about gun violence until the victims ``looked like my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But coming late to an issue means there is that much more work
to do with white women back home. Bush may be bad on guns, but so
far he is winning over many white suburban women with his rhetoric
on education. That could be a decisive factor in November since
Gore will likely lose the white male vote by as much as a 2-to-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no telling what the legacy of the Million Mom March
might be. The progun Bush is bridging the gender gap. Gore is for
some gun restrictions, but does not yet have enough white women in
the fold to overcome his deficit with white men.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore becomes president, there is a chance for some headway on
guns. If Bush gets in, you will not get him to sign a gun control
measure if you held a . . . sorry. The Million Mom March is a
moment. To muzzle guns requires a movement. The movement has to
march to the ballot box. November will begin to tell us if a
million moms can change the course of American herstory, or if guns
will remain as American as mom and apple pie.

 BOSTON: ... not working.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, the notion of work might seem considerably more
attractive when you own the company and have the power and perks
that go with being in charge. But not everyone who has plenty of
money to retire sits in the corner office. Robert Gamble, 40, and
his wife, Martha Miller, 41, are both nurse practitioners even
though, when he turned 18, Gamble was startled to discover that he
had just come into $2 million in family wealth. The money grew over
the years, and despite the couple's best attempts to give it all
away to a variety of social causes (``The trust officers and my
family thought we were out of our minds,'' Gamble muses), some of
the money still remains. In his adult life, Gamble has been a
carpenter, a construction laborer, and a human rights worker in El
Salvador, among other things. Today the couple, who have three
children, work for the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program
treating people with AIDS, severe alcohol abuse, pneumonia, and
other problems of street life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of wanting to work is the Protestant work ethic, I
guess,'' says Gamble. ``But working is also part of what links you
to other people. It's a way of being connected. It's important for
me to be involved with something worthwhile, but I also enjoy
interacting with people _ personally, philosophically, and
spiritually _ who are on the fringes. It's important for me to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   June Tatelman would say much the same thing. Neither Tatelman
nor her husband would seem to have to work, given that Eliot
Tatelman is the Eliot of Barry and Eliot, the ubiquitous brothers
of Jordan's Furniture and the chain's quirky TV ads. Last year the
duo sold the local four-store family business, which they joined 27
years ago when it had one showroom and five employees, for an
undisclosed sum reported to be at least $250 million. The Tatelman
brothers continue to run the company, with Eliot admitting that ``I
still stick my nose into everything.'' But June Tatelman, 52, works
despite the family's financial success, too. And she does not
oversee a company that now employs 1,300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she rises at 6 a.m. each weekday to get ready for her
job as a teacher at a Middle School in Sudbury. It is there that
she teaches wellness classes _ on sexuality, decision making,
conflict resolution, and the like _ to seventh- and eighth-graders.
Like Gamble, she talks about the lure of making attachments through
her work, of connecting closely with a group of people she would
probably never encounter otherwise. ``I get attached to new kids
every year,'' she says. ``Sure, some days they drive me out of my
mind. But we talk about subjects'' that are hard ``for kids to talk
about. When they're talking to me like that, and they're listening,
I think I get more from them than they get from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So retirement is meaningless,'' she says. ``It's like retiring
from life.''
</P>
<P>
   For some well-heeled people who continue to work, staying on the
job has given them both the wherewithal and the clout to do the
right thing. Tatelman and her husband operate a weeklong summer
camp for children infected and affected by AIDS, for example. Singh
has started a foundation to fund a grade school in India that he
attended as a child. And Novack has set up a family foundation that
focuses on disadvantaged youths. Says Connors, who has been a
contributor to and fund-raiser for a number of local causes:
``Visibility and power _ or maybe the illusion of power _ can be
used for good. I can raise a lot more money as chairman and CEO of
Hill Holliday than as the former chairman and CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors, who started his ad agency with $1,500 ($1,000 of it
borrowed) 32 years ago, can look about 500 feet down and two blocks
north from his present office and pick out his former quarters. He
says the value of the approximately $115 million in stock he
received when he sold the company to Interpublic Group of Companies
has virtually doubled. ``But retire?'' he asks. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ever been promoted,'' Connors adds, grinning. ``I've
got the same title I had in 1968. Picasso supposedly dropped his
brush and died. Charles Schulz, too. This is what I do. I work.
It's not a four-letter word.''

``Every morning I get up and look through the Forbes list of the
richest people in America. If my name isn't on it, I go to work.'' 
_ Sign posted at Maynard, Mass. headquarters of monster.com,
world's largest career Web site. 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ And even if their names were on it, they would probably
go to work. Susan Bailis, who four years ago reaped the financial
benefits of selling Massachusetts' largest provider of elder care,
certainly would. So would Robert Gamble, who is a $25-an-hour nurse
practitioner despite inheriting a fortune that wended its way down
from the 19th-century founder of Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. And so would
Jeff Taylor, 39, who is monster.com's CEO/founder and puts his net
worth at somewhere over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   You might think, with a firecracker 1990s economy that minted
each new multimillionaire faster than you could shout ``Call my
broker!'' that the notion of retirement would be as hot as the next
IPO. You might think that all those buyout beneficiaries,
fat-pocket heirs, and dot-com cowboys (despite the recent stock
market volatility) would have been eyeballing the Palm Beach real
estate ads, working full time on their golf games, and generally
contemplating a life wherein their most difficult chore would be
squeezing the tomatoes at the local Publix supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   You might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bailis. Once a $7,600-a-year-social worker, the
54-year-old entrepreneur found herself in 1996 with ``more money
than I'd ever seen.'' She and her partner, Alan Solomont, had just
sold ADS Group for $100 million, and although she will not reveal
her share of the proceeds, Bailis says she could have retired more
than comfortably. Instead, she and Solomont eventually formed a
small company that operates a number of elder care ventures. ``I
never, even for a moment, considered not working,'' Bailis says
firmly. (There is another reason, besides money, that she might be
expected to do something else with her time: She has Stage IV
metastatic breast cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Work provides a structure to my life,'' Bailis explains as she
sits in an upholstered wing chair in her large, bright office hard
by the Massachusetts Turnpike. ``I need an office to come to, a
place that's a station for me, a place where work gets parceled out
and letters get written. And work gives me self-esteem because it's
doing something that society puts a value on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work, for me, is one of the basic nutrients of life. I don't
take vitamins. I take work.''
</P>
<P>
   For others who have clearly acquired the means to retire, work
is a prescription that is taken for an assortment of reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --Taylor, a former disc jockey who created monster.com based on
a dream he had at 4 o'clock in the morning and whose goal is to be
US secretary of labor, talks about the ego rush he gets from mixing
his ``personal brand'' with his company's brand.
</P>
<P>
   --Jack Connors, 57, who sold his advertising firm of Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos for a reported $115 million two years
ago, says he has stayed in his corner office 39 floors above Boston
because he feels he is ``one of an increasing number of people who
don't want to stop growing.''
</P>
<P>
   --Jerry Greenberg, 34, a former Harvard University wrestler who
founded Sapient Corp., a successful Cambridge, Mass. company that
facilitates Internet commerce, looks at work partly as a kind of
competition and declares that ``the absence of stress would make it
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   --Irma Mann, 65, who sold Irma Mann Strategic Marketing 17
months ago, has remained with the company and will begin teaching
at Boston University in September because, she said, ``I'm not into
rocking chairs, and I want to be in the mix of the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, work is for many people simply a fire that the
acquisition of riches cannot extinguish. In the muted downtown
Boston offices of Loring, Wolcott &AMP; Coolidge, where $5.6 billion in
individual and family wealth is managed, senior trustee Lawrence
Coolidge _ whose own eventually prosperous Yankee family arrived on
Boston's shores in 1630 _ contends that most of his clients keep
their noses to the grindstone even though they have more than
enough financial resources to do otherwise. ``Too much of nothing
makes a fellow mean,'' announces the bow-tied, Coolidge, 64,
quoting Bob Dylan. Then he adds a lyric of his own: ``It's not a
very satisfying life to be a sybarite.''
</P>
<P>
   For some folks, then, work is a kind of moral imperative. J.
Stuart Moore, who founded Sapient with Greenberg in a basement
nearly a decade ago in no small part through the liberal use of 13
personal credit cards, can today tabulate his stake in the publicly
owned company at more than $1 billion. When Moore, 38, talks about
work, he echoes the clerical zeal of money manager Coolidge: ``A
life of leisure isn't a meaningful life,'' he says. ``It isn't a
satisfying life. I know I couldn't live that way.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Moore takes his five children bike riding, power boating,
and skiing on the weekend. He says he consciously tries to
``engineer'' a life that combines family with work. But he also
speaks of work in almost spiritual tones, contending that ``you
have an obligation to deploy your capabilities, and if you don't do
that you'll end up in a bad place.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Charles River, in a comfortable second-floor office
overlooking the Boston Public Garden, Kenneth Novack views his work
similarly, as a kind of crusade. The 58-year-old attorney, who is
the vice chairman of America Online Inc. and holds about $300
million in unexercised stock options (``I've also got substantial
assets outside the company,'' he says), is a true believer in AOL
chairman Steve Case and the firm's stated goal of making online
connectivity as ubiquitous as the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Stop working? At 58? Not while ``we're all pointing at the same
star,'' Novack replies eagerly. ``We have other people in the
company worth over $100 million, too,'' he adds. ``Why do we work?
Because we really believe we have that mission. Certainly, we don't
have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   For many dot-com types in particular, work means creating an
environment where they do not mind spending a lot of their time.
Consider Jeet Singh, 36, who cofounded Art Technology Group, now a
publicly owned e-commerce software developer, with his partner
Joseph Chung in an apartment nine years ago. Today Singh, who is
given to wearing jeans and cowboy boots around the office, likes to
point to the wide open spaces of Art Technology's Cambridge
headquarters, where cubicles are absent and there are amenities
such as a pool table and on-site massages. ``When we started, Joe
and I talked about the environment we wanted,'' Singh says. ``We
talked a lot about what the work lifestyle was going to be. We
asked ourselves, `Can you build a company where, if it succeeds,
you'd want to hang around?' So we set out to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh and Chung began Art Technology with $5,000. Each now owns
about $416 million worth of stock in the company. ``We thought that
if we made $10 million in our lifetime that we'd be done, then we
wouldn't have to work any more,'' says Singh, who has not moved out
of his South End home since striking it rich but has added an
airplane to his personal assets and is shopping for a home on St.
Bart's. ``Now it's very difficult to imagine myself not working.''

VIRUS MAY BE BASED ON UNIVERSITY THESIS PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Officials investigating a malicious
program that disrupted computer systems around the world said
Wednesday that they were looking for a young computer student who
recently wrote a thesis proposal with elements that were similar to
a virus that has disabled e-mail systems around the world in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who appears to have gone into hiding, is Onel de
Guzman, 23, who lived in the same apartment in Manila as a man and
woman who were first named on Monday as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   When de Guzman presented his proposal in February, a thesis
reviewer at his computer college noted on it: ``This is illegal''
and ``We do not produce burglars.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the college, AMA Computer College, said a second
student, Michael Buen, had written a software program that might
have been combined with de Guzman's work to create the virus. The
officials said he, too, had gone into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The general counsel for the college said subpoenas were being
issued by the National Bureau of Investigation for both students,
although investigators have not formally named them as suspects.
The bureau is continuing to investigate the man and woman who were
identified on Monday, Reomel Ramones and Irene de Guzman, who is
Onel de Guzman's older sister.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones and Irene de Guzman were initially named as suspects
when investigators traced the virus to a computer in their
apartment, but when authorities raided the apartment on Monday the
computer had been removed. Ramones was detained, but Irene de
Guzman disappeared after promising to surrender to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Secretary Artemio Tuquero said Wednesday that Ramones,
who was held overnight Monday at the National Bureau of
Investigation and who will face charges on May 19, may have been a
``fall guy'' but that it was too soon to drop charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Abad, executive vice president of the college, said of
Onel de Guzman: ``We are not saying he is a suspect. If ever we
found something about the thesis, it could only be a circumstantial
lead. We do not know whether he did develop this as a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was his impression that if the two students were
involved in creating the virus their intention was to steal and use
passwords, not to spread destruction through the world's computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news reports, both students were members of
an underground campus group called GRAMMERSoft, which did
programming work for hire and also wrote and sold thesis projects
to other students. But college officials said they could not
confirm that the two were members.
</P>
<P>
   Abad said he had asked teachers what they recalled about Onel de
Guzman. ``He's the quiet type,'' Abad said. ``He's an average
student, although in some subjects he is getting very high grades.
In our grading system, 1 is the highest and 5 is failing. In one
subject, in Assembly Language, he got a 1. It's a pretty hard
subject, and he got a flat 1 on it. And on other computer subjects
he got a 1.5, a 1.25.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Pagulayan, the general counsel of the college, said the
names of the two students were on a list given to investigators in
the Philippines by the FBI, which had found 10 coded names embedded
in the virus program.
</P>
<P>
   He said the name of Onel de Guzman immediately rang a bell at
the school because, although many thesis proposals are rejected,
his was turned down because ``it was contrary to law, dealing with
hacking, dealing with a virus. That is not something that happens
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagulayan said, ``The thesis proposal, though not illegal per
se, could be used as part of the structure of the current virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Abad said Buen's thesis, which was accepted and which led to his
graduation from the school last Friday, contained information that
could be used to create multiple copies of computer files.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you merge both programs you can come up with this virus,''
said Karim Bangcola, senior vice president of the college.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Onel de Guzman's proposal, which was titled ``E-mail Password
Sender Trojan,'' was never developed into a full-fledged thesis,
and he did not graduate as scheduled last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, which was obtained by The Associated Press, he
wrote that his software ``will be helpful to a lot of people,
especially Internet users, to get Windows passwords such as
Internet accounts to spend more time on the Internet without
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote: ``We spend a lot of money to pay for accounts for
only using a couple of hours. So this program is the main solution.
Use it to steal and retrieve Internet accounts of the victim's
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the ``I love you'' virus does, in addition to
disabling computer systems around the world in one of the
fastest-spreading acts of computer vandalism to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thesis proposal was rejected because it carried a feature
that could enable the software to steal passwords,'' Abad said.
``And there's a recipient and it will steal the recipient's
password and all the other names in the recipient's address book.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, all the names in that address book will be
sent new e-mails automatically, and exponentially again you will
get the e-mails and Internet accounts of these people,'' he said.
``We saw that to be very illegal and very immoral, and so we
disapproved the thesis proposal. It never got developed within
AMA.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a subcommittee of the House of Representatives
held hearings Wednesday on how the government can protect its
computers from mass-mailed computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   The technology subcommittee of the House Science Committee heard
testimony from four experts who warned that there was little that
could be done to prevent the kind of computer viruses that wreaked
havoc on the Internet last week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative and audit arm
of Congress, said the U.S. government was poorly organized to
respond.  &QL;

FINDING A STORY OF REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps this is a good time to climb on a soap box.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc., on the downside of its wildest-ever six-month stock
gyration, has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since a January
peak.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public stock offerings of CMGI portfolio companies,
including portal offering AltaVista Co., were pulled when the
market came tumbling down. The prices of other public companies
that count CMGI as a big shareholder have suffered shocking
corrections.
</P>
<P>
   With that backdrop, CMGI will take its turn thursday with dozens
of other technolgoy companies presenting their stories to investors
this week at the 28th Annual Chase Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Technology
Conference in San Francisco, certainly one of the two or three most
important tech investment forums of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't anything special about an Internet company that rode
a hot stock toward the end of 1999 into the first months of this
year, only to get shelled soon thereafter. But CMGI shares were
driven to extremes, soaring higher and crashing harder than most
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its movements are amplified because a lot of the valuation in
the stock reflects the potential for the initial public offerings
of its subsidiaries and venture funds,'' said analyst Phil Leigh of
Raymond James.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Internet stocks are moving up, the environment for IPOs
is much more favorable. When they move down, the environment
becomes much less favorable,'' he said. Other Internet business
development companies, like Internet Capital Group, took similar
hard falls.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the moment: Can investment conference exposure
help a stock like CMGI right now, or does it remain at the mercy of
an overpowering investment tide? And what story would the Andover,
Mass. company need to tell to make a difference?
</P>
<P>
   Telling the story and getting others to repeat it is an
important process. Consider what was happening in mid-November,
just as CMGI shares were beginning to move higher.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, a Monday on which CMGI shares closed at a
split-adjusted $50.625, Internet investment bank Wit Capital
Research initiated coverage of the company with a buy
recommendation. The next day, CMGI chief David Wetherell presented
the company story to investors at the Bloomberg Internet conference
in San Francisco. The following day, Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. initiated
coverage of CMGI with a buy recommendation, and a Prudential
Securities analyst raised his price forecast for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, CMGI shares had appreciated by about 25
percent and would continue to move smartly higher until
mid-December, when infuential Internet analyst Henry Blodget of
Merrill Lynch initiated coverage of CMGI. That day, CMGI shares
surged 21 percent to a split-adjusted $135.125.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet stocks were rising sharply, CMGI had roared ahead
by 170 percent in a period of about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   True, the CMGI IPO-driven performance was adding fuel to the
market's Internet mania at the time. But how did CMGI's biggest IPO
of all, the offering of AltaVista first announced in December, fit
into the picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``The (CMGI) story was being promoted, there's no question about
it,'' said analyst Ullas Naik of First Albany Corp. ``But in the
background, CMGI is telling a lot of these large brokerages that if
you want to compete for the AltaVista IPO, you have to cover
CMGI.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of the companies CMGI had helped take public were
generating mind-boggling returns for their investors. Companies
with less than $10 million in quarterly revenue were reaching
valuations in the range of $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a time when some investors came to the
conclusion that any CMGI company was dipped in magic waters,'' said
Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   That was powerful stuff, considering CMGI had dozens more in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Internet bubble burst, it hurt perhaps worst of all
for many of those same public CMGI portfolio companies. Navisite
Inc. has plunged 75 percent from its March high. Ventro Corp.
(formerly called Chemdex) has sunk 89 percent from a February peak,
and Engage Inc. is down 77 percent from a March high. Critical Path
Inc. has lost nearly two-thirds of its value from its high this
year and Mothernature.com is down nearly 80 percent in 2000 so far.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long fall, CMGI stock analysts remain almost
universally bullish on the company. Leigh, Naik, and others
describe CMGI as a superior Internet investment: diversified,
backed by plenty of money, and matched with high-quality partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy CMGI now and put it away for five or 10 years,
you're going to do extremely well,'' said Naik.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Like every other public Internet company, it must
demonstrate the ability to produce money makers. That means
portfolio companies may stay private longer to mature before they
hit the public market.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so fast a track, but better news for everyone in the
long run. It might even be the story for the soap box.

SOME SAY ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT MATTER ARE FEW, FLAWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't check your stocks every day, most financial
advisers say. Rebalance your portfolio once a year, or every
quarter at most. Ignore the daily swings in the market.
</P>
<P>
   That can be hard to do when newspapers and financial news
broadcasters offer a river of stock market data. And increasingly,
our round-the-clock media also offer a flood of economic numbers.
Almost every day brings a new statistic on the health of the
economy, along with analysts willing to say what it means for the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But if you shouldn't check your portfolio every day, why should
you constantly take the temperature of the economy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these numbers are just clutter in my head,'' said
Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pittsburgh and leader of a Federal Reserve-watching panel called
the Shadow Open Market Committee. ``They mostly tell me what's
already happened, not what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The clutter comes not only from the sheer number of economic
indicators, but because most are revised several times as more
information becomes available. A news story on gross domestic
product may be reporting the second or even third iteration of a
number that was announced a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a single indicator may contain conflicting messages.
Last month, for example, the government reported that housing
construction took its biggest tumble in six years. That's good,
economists said; it suggests that economic growth is moderating,
and the Fed might not raise interest rates much more.
</P>
<P>
   But the same report said a key part of the construction sector _
single-family homes _ was actually growing faster than before.
That's bad; the economic boom seems unbridled, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the government announced that gross domestic product
was lower than expected for the most recent quarter. (That's good;
growth is slowing.) But the same report said that consumer spending
grew by its fastest pace in 17 years. (Never mind; fast growth lies
ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, a person can be reasonably well-informed while
bypassing most economic statistics. The trade balance,
durable-goods orders, the index of leading economic indicators _
all these are often reported and easily ignored, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   For the average investor, there are two or three economic
reports worth following: employment, gross domestic product, and
the consumer price index. ``Those are the headline numbers _ not
only to stay educated, but because the Fed looks at the same
things,'' said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at FleetBoston
Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   And a main reason for studying economic data is to keep abreast
of the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's job is to keep inflation low. If the economy is
growing quickly and seems likely to spark inflation, the Fed
probably will raise interest rates to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But higher rates tend to hurt the stock market. When credit is
expensive, consumers cut back on their spending, and businesses
have to pay more for their own borrowing. The result is lower
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, investors may want to guess the direction of
interest rates to help determine the fair price for a stock.
</P>
<P>
   Employment, gross domestic product, and the consumer price index
are broad measures of economic growth and inflation. Some of the
numbers _ and the numbers behind the numbers _ give clues to the
future of the economy. Others show only what has occurred already.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly employment report, for example, includes the
unemployment rate, which is a lagging indicator of economic
activity. It tends to rise only after the economic growth has
peaked and already is starting to slow.
</P>
<P>
   But the same report gives data on hourly earnings, which is
considered a leading indicator of inflation. When companies have to
pay workers more, they eventually may raise the prices of their
products.
</P>
<P>
   The employment report is the result of two government surveys:
one of households and one of businesses. In the first, the
government asks people to say whether they are employed and, if
not, whether they are looking for work. This not only shows how
many Americans are working but how many are potential workers who
happen to be out of a job just now. That information is important:
The economy cannot grow very much unless it can draw on more
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of businesses is considered more accurate. ``The
sample is more reliable and actually shows what people are doing,
as opposed to what they want to do or say they are doing,'' said
Ayers. This survey shows how many people are on payrolls, giving a
second snapshot of the number of working Americans and a sense of
how robust economic activity is. The business survey also produces
information about hourly earnings, hours worked, and other aspects
of working life.
</P>
<P>
   The king of all economic statistics is gross domestic product _
or GDP. But it is produced quarterly, whereas the unemployment
report comes out monthly.
</P>
<P>
   GDP is considered the broadest measure of economic activity, a
single number that considers everything from consumers at shopping
malls to government spending on tanks and roads, business
investment in computers and factories, and international trade. It
is expressed as a dollar amount representing the total value of
goods and services produced in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But because so many factors go into the GDP, it can be useful to
read each quarter's report and consider the numbers behind the
headline number.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of ways to get to a particular GDP total,''
said Larry Horwitz, senior economist with Primark Decision
Economics in Boston. ``You can have lots of defense spending and
just a few cars sold, or lots of cars and just a few guns. Did we
export a tremendous amount and yet have a fairly weak domestic
economy, or is it the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things give you the same GDP number, but the
implications for the future are quite different.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor colors the GDP number: Not all of its components
are considered equally reliable. Business inventories, for example,
are part of the GDP and can indicate whether a recession is on the
way. When companies make a lot of things that remain on store
shelves, it suggests that consumers have stopped buying and that
factories will have to slow production.
</P>
<P>
   However, each quarter's earliest GDP number is based on an
incomplete survey of inventories at businesses, said Roger Brinner,
chief economist at Parthenon Group, a Boston consulting and
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   And inventory is hard to measure. ``It's a relatively small
number for any one business establishment, and you're adding up a
ton of things _ inventories held by manufacturers, retailers,
wholesalers,'' said Horwitz. ``It's hard to capture.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the GDP may contain unreliable numbers about
international trade. The government keeps tabs on imports, because
it taxes so many of them. But exports are harder to track. The
government only gets a solid sense of exports over time, after
checking with trading partners, several economists said.
</P>
<P>
   There is even more debate about the reliability of the consumer
price index, or CPI, one of several government measures of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The CPI measures prices at the consumer level, as opposed to the
prices that manufacturers and other businesses pay for goods.
Responding to critics, the government recently adjusted the CPI to
take better account of new technologies, such as cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer groups also complain that the CPI does not
capture enough of the rising cost of drugs, health insurance, and
property taxes. And some economists say the index does a poor job
of considering that the quality of products also improves over
time, that cars and computers have become better. If prices are
rising, it is important to know that consumers also are getting
more for their money.
</P>
<P>
   Economists add two other caveats when considering economic data.
First, remember that the numbers for one quarter are often
``annualized,'' or amplified as if they represent a year's worth of
activity. This is done to make comparisons among numbers easier.
But it also means that a small change in one quarter can leave the
false impression that it is really a big change.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Brinner, the government may revise a quarter's
GDP figure by a meager 0.1 percent. When annualized, the change
becomes a more significant 0.4 percent, ``and the markets get all
excited,'' Brinner said. But at heart, the government is only
making a small change in its view of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The second caveat is that the government is always revising its
numbers, which can yield big changes in our view of the past.
</P>
<P>
   When President Richard M. Nixon imposed wage and price controls
in 1971, the available numbers showed that inflation was
escalating. ``But the data have been revised so that it doesn't
look now like there was much inflation,'' said Murray Weidenbaum,
who led the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the
early Reagan administration. ``The current version of the data says
they shouldn't have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   When inventory data were revised after the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74, they showed that the nation had been awash in unsold
products. ``It totally changed the view of the world for policy
makers,'' said Horwitz. ``The economy was much sicker than people
thought'' because of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Labor Department revised several decades'
worth of productivity data and found a sharper rise during the
1990s than previously thought. For some analysts, the new numbers
were proof that the Internet and computer technology are truly
making businesses and workers more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every number gets revised many times. Don't hang onto any one
number,'' warned Weidenbaum. ``The past is as uncertain as the
future.''

TECH-SECTOR DOWNTURN PUSHES CMGI INTO LAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. has been one of the nation's highest-flying Internet
investment companies, but lately it has resorted to a distinctly
old economy tactic: layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies controlled by CMGI have eliminated 72 jobs in
recent weeks as the parent company presses its divisions to control
costs amid a general downturn in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Internet search firm AltaVista Co., majority-owned
by CMGI, has cut about 60 jobs since last fall and is considering
more cuts, following last month's postponement of its initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Internet stocks, CMGI's shares have fallen sharply.
They closed at $56.625 Tuesday, down 61 percent since early March.
While the layoffs have affected just a small fraction of CMGI's
5,000 employees, they reflect a shift in focus away from pure
growth to business fundamentals _ a shift also playing out in other
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have sent out a loud and clear signal: `Show us that
you're going to move to profitability,' '' said CMGI spokesman Bill
White. Once, he said, CMGI was concerned its units build their user
base and market share; now, he said, ``We think every single (CMGI)
company should be looking at both revenue and expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI is best known for the minority stakes it holds in Internet
companies such as Lycos Inc. CMGI also holds majority positions in
16 operating companies, including AltaVista, CMGI Solutions, and
MyWay.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI hadn't announced the recent job cuts, but Tuesday the
company confirmed about 45 jobs are being eliminated from its CMGI
Solutions Web site development unit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the jobs will be shed from among the roughly 150
employees the company has at offices in Andover, Mass. and in
Washington, D.C. The positions are being eliminated as CMGI
combines the unit with Tallan Inc. of Glastonbury, Conn., in which
it purchased a majority stake for about $920 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, CMGI also confirmed its MyWay.com unit would lay off
27 employees as it changes its strategy to focus on selling
services to larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   The 60 jobs eliminated at AltaVista, based in Palo Alto, Calif.,
were first reported by The Industry Standard magazine, and mainly
relate to a shift at AltaVista's Shopping.com unit from a consumer
goods site to a shopping directory service.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista spokesman David Emanuel said the company added other
jobs in recent months that offset the cuts. He and CMGI's White
said the parent company also has tried to find jobs at its other
units for most employees whose positions were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But more layoffs could be coming. ``We're studying further cuts
as we respond to market conditions,'' Emanuel said. AltaVista has
about 800 employees, including about 80 in Andover, where its
Raging Bull investor chat service is based.
</P>
<P>
   Adams Harkness analyst Steven Frankel said the cuts show CMGI is
paying heed to new market dynamics. ``Nowhere is it etched in stone
that the Internet was a pathway to riches for everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But AltaVista should be careful its layoffs don't undercut its
progress toward an initial public offering, he said.

PERSONAL NEGOTIATING SUCCES TAKES PREPARATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mimi Donaldson has not forgotten the first time she walked into
a manager's office and requested a raise. It was during a period of
uncertainty. Rumors about a possible wage freeze had been
circulating among employees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Donaldson persevered. She got a pay raise, and she improved
her standing on the job. Donaldson's secret? She arrived at the
table prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to other trainers at the company, and I called people
at competing firms and found out what the going pay rate was for
someone with my experience in the training field,'' recalled
Donaldson, a speaker at a Simmons Graduate School of Management
Women's Leadership Conference in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with her boss, Donaldson requested 15 minutes of
uninterrupted time. She wanted to make sure she would have his full
attention. She entered the room with the minimum and maximum
amounts she would accept firmly etched in her mind. Even more
important, she knew her options: Because there were many training
firms in northern California at the time, Donaldson knew she could
quit outright and quickly find another position that paid as much
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Donaldson's experience is not unusual. At some point in our
lives, most of us will have to confront our need for a raise, a
more flexible schedule, a change in duties, or some other workplace
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even when working out conflicts with colleagues, supervisors,
team members, or relatives, our negotiating skills will come into
play. How we handle these matters can affect our jobs and our
personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating is not just a skill that you take out once in a
while when you have to make a deal. It's a way to get what you want
out of life, and it requires a master plan,'' writes Donaldson,
coauthor of the book ``Negotiating for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every negotiating session ends as well as Donaldson's.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Kolb, a professor at the Simmons Graduate School of
Management who specializes in negotiating and conflict resolution,
said women frequently encounter pitfalls in their quest for
leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, they are told they must take stretch assignments that
will give them more responsibilities and a chance to be seen,''
Kolb said. ``But if they do not negotiate the conditions, they will
not be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb said terms should be negotiated before the employee accepts
the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, the assignment may come on top of an assignment
the woman already has. In this case, the conditions or terms she
negotiates may include the time needed to complete the job, the
support staff required, or whether she will be relieved of some of
her other duties so that she can concentrate fully on her new
assignment. . . She knows she will be looked at critically. If she
fails, she may never get another chance to prove herself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb advises that when attempting to sell an idea to a team of
people, including top executives, the employee should ``seed'' the
meeting ahead of time. ``Make sure you have people on your side
before you go in,'' she said. ``If you are negotiating something
with high stakes, get your ducks lined up. Why? Because it is often
difficult for women to get their ideas across, especially in an
environment where the loudest person, the most aggressive person,
is likely to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Lukey, a senior partner at the Boston law firm Hale &AMP; Dorr
and president-elect of the Boston Bar Association, said the ability
to seem confident _ even when you're not _ can help you get what
you want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you are negotiating for yourself, your client, or your
product, you should do it with absolute confidence,'' said Lukey.
``Your body language, the tone of voice you use, your facial
expressions indicate whether you are in control of yourself and the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Grassia, 44, was fresh out of college when he negotiated
a starting salary that came close to meeting his expectations. The
position was with TWA's reservations office in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had friends in the airline industry,'' Grassia recalled.
``They gave me an idea of what their salary was, and, based on
their job titles and education levels, I asked for $30,000. This
was in 1980. We negotiated from the salary initially offered, which
was $26,000, and came to an agreement at $28,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassia, who had sales, data entry, and computer experience,
used his skills as leverage. ``My approach was, `If you don't ask
for what you want, you won't receive it,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, using leverage to gain an immediate advantage,
particularly when negotiating disputes, can lead to problems later
on, said management lawyer Jonathan Bell of Greenberg Traurig LLP
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adversarial approach or leverage-based approach has great
risks,'' he said. ``It can come back to haunt you later on. It's no
fun working in a place where each side is having trouble
accommodating the other's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, who gives advice on the do's and don'ts of
negotiating, said her first negotiating experience taught her a
little about the importance of understanding the other person's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that when she and her boss met to discuss her
request for a raise, he told her outright that company spending was
down. Donaldson knew the firm had financial concerns. Rather than
fight, she said, ``I listened and empathized.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she presented written evidence of her own unit's success.
While other divisions were simply holding the line, her division
was profitable. She presented her sales figures as well as the
responses she'd received from clients. ``I tooted my horn, and I
did it loudly,'' said Donaldson. ``I also made it very easy for him
to justify my request for a raise to his own boss. At the same
time, I tried to understand and empathize with his position.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than demand an answer right away, Donaldson pushed what
she described as ``the pause button,'' a request for time out that
let her boss mull over her request, talk to his own superiors, and
get back to her in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By giving him the tools he needed to press her case, she made
him a teammate rather than an adversary. More important, Donaldson
used a subtle form of leverage that made it clear from the outset
that she and her boss had mutual interests: If her unit did well
and her numbers were high, he would benefit, too.
</P>
<P>
   By making sure the talks did not turn into a confrontation,
Donaldson succeeded in getting that raise, and her boss became an
ally.

IN LIFE, AS ON TV, MENTAL HEALTH FAILS TO RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question is: How can network television support three
semirealistic shows about the traumas and occasional epiphanies of
big-city hospitals _ ``ER,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' and ``City of
Angels'' _ but not sustain more than two episodes of a
semirealistic drama set in an urban mental hospital?
</P>
<P>
   There has been no shortage of reasons advanced for the failure
of the critically acclaimed ABC teledrama ``Wonderland.'' The first
episode was so violent that it scared away many viewers lured to
the show by good reviews. Talk about madness _ just as a deranged
shooter starts spraying Times Square with bullet fire, an announcer
intoned: `` `Wonderland' on ABC! Brought to you by the Saturn
L-Series Performance Sedan!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' fans argue that the show was set up to fail,
competing against NBC's popular ``ER'' on Thursday nights. Or is
the explanation simpler than that? Perhaps ``Wonderland'' hit a
little too close to home?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Time magazine writer Otto Friedrich began
his book ``Going Crazy'' by describing the morning he forgot how to
cross the street. For about 10 seconds, he stood in the middle of
Broadway traffic, completely disoriented. How could he get to work?
How could he live? I've had a similar experience, temporarily
forgetting how to walk down the stairs. That's a slender little
thread connecting us to the material world. ``He who has never
felt, momentarily, what madness is,'' Herman Melville wrote, ``has
but a mouthful of brains.''
</P>
<P>
   It is said that about half the American population will have a
brush with mental illness during their lifetime. Perhaps. Although
there has never been a good time to be mentally ill in America _ or
anywhere else, for that matter _ this may be one of the worst.
Partly hidden from view by the medical health care crisis, mental
health care is suffering, too; the delivery system has never been
more wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist hoping to educate me in his field gave me Tanya
Lurhmann's new book, ``Of Two Minds.'' It is an extraordinarily
ambitious work. Lurhmann, a University of California
anthropologist, conducted 10 years of field work among
psychiatrists in training, some of them at McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass. The title's ``two minds'' refer to the profession's
split allegiance between ``talk therapy'' and pharmaceutical pill
therapy. In the war between talk and pills, Lurhmann has no doubt
that the prescription pen is mightier than the word:
``Psychopharmacology is the great, silent dominatrix of
contemporary psychiatry,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   What feeds the psychopharmacology engine? According to Luhrmann,
it is managed care providers' unwillingness to pay for hospital
evaluations of mental illness. ``The less time a patient spends in
the hospital,'' she writes, ``the more the doctors feel forced to
medicate ambiguous symptoms.'' A Harvard Medical School study to be
released this week reveals that patients are three times more
likely to receive treatment for depression, anxiety, and panic
disorders from their primary care doctor than from a specialized
therapist. Not surprisingly, the study concluded that most of the
treatment was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   And if a disturbed patient needs to be hospitalized, they won't
be staying long. Nowadays, most HMOs will pay for a five-day
diagnostic admission. As recently as 1993, a 13-day admission was
standard. That's a 60 percent decline in less than a decade. And
it's not as if people are getting more sane, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Just last week there was some unusual good news on the mental
health front. Massachusetts became the 30th state to enact a mental
health parity law, which forces insurers to provide benefits for
psychological treatment comparable to those for physical illnesses.
The bill isn't perfect; that five-day admission period won't be
lengthened, and patients may lose some confidentiality protections
they've enjoyed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill does represent an improvement. Severe mental
illness is to be treated on a par with other ailments. And the
``worried well'' _ a category that could include the late Otto
Friedrich, or me _ will have expanded access to therapists. The
mental health glass looks half-full, for once; maybe the level is
rising.

WASHINGTON SUFFERS FROM `WEST WING' ENVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days in Washington, it's hard to tell ``The West Wing''
from The White House without a scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members of NBC's hit drama about the inner workings of
President Josiah Bartlet's (Martin Sheen) administration were the
main attraction at the recent White House Correspondents'
Association Dinner. Early this month, the actors were in Washington
filming the secret season-ending blockbuster episode that will air
next week. And USA Today political columnist Walter Shapiro was
recently dining with a cabinet member when show's 9 p.m. Wednesday
air time approached. ``Oh my God,'' Shapiro recalls the official
exclaiming. ``I've got to tape `The West Wing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So pervasive is this art-imitating-life phenomenon that at the
correspondents' dinner, President Clinton jokingly noted that
``West Wing'' 's ``first season got a lot better ratings than mine
did.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be more to that than just Beltway party patter. ``The
West Wing'' is certainly a solid ratings success, ranking 27th
among prime time shows. Brill's Content magazine published a cover
story saying the program ``beats the Washington press corps to the
real story'' of White House politics. Even more impressive is ``The
West Wing'' 's popularity at a time when people seem to feel
cynical about politics, detached from Washington, and worn down by
``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   In a March issue of the Weekly Standard magazine, contributing
editor John Podhoretz concluded that ``West Wing'' creator Aaron
Sorkin took ``the story of the Clinton White House and eliminated
what he sees as its most troubling aspect'' _ Bill Clinton. (Like
Clinton, Bartlet is a liberal/centrist with an eager young staff,
but unlike the president, he projects a flinty morality and
rock-solid rectitude.)
</P>
<P>
   Others see the show tapping into a subconscious public desire
for a reconnection not only with government, but with politicians
they can admire, perhaps inviting comparisons to the resonance of
John McCain's straight shooter campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so cynical, so disaffected,'' says TV Guide
senior editor J. Max Robins. ``Here, we see the human side, the
music comes up, and the light hits the president, and he does the
right thing. I think there is a part of us that wants to think
government can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, founder of Syracuse University's Center for the
Study of Popular Television, sees ``West Wing,'' along with the
wildly popular ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' and the
Oscar-winning film ``Forrest Gump'' as part of a burgeoning
anti-irony and anti-cynicism backlash in popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I'm watching `The West Wing' and I think
I'm watching `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' '' says Thompson. ``As
funny as the big irony movement (pioneered by smirking entertainers
like David Letterman and Steve Martin) was, there was a sense of
its total emptiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, he adds, is that the show puncturing public
cynicism against big government is none other than a ``government
show.''
</P>
<P>
   It's even more surprising given TV's poor track record of
politics in prime time. Citing such duds as the short-lived
``Senator'' segment of NBC's old series, ``The Bold Ones,'' and
Fox's ill-fated ``Mr. President'' starring George C. Scott,
television historian Alex McNeil says, ``these shows have been
monumentally unpopular. The traditional wisdom is that people
aren't interested in politics for entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean everyone is entranced with ``The West Wing.''
Conservatives have accurately identified the show _ which is
pro-gun control, gung-ho on campaign finance reform and disdainful
of the religious right _ as resolutely liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing'' consultants also include Democratic luminaries
like former Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers, former Jimmy
Carter pollster Patrick Caddell, and Lawrence O'Donnell, an ex-aide
to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Critiquing an episode in which
Bartlet gave his state of the union address, the conservative Media
Research Center said he delivered a speech ``every liberal dreams
the real president would provide: The `era of big government is
over' is itself over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show seems to surmount ideological pitfalls. ``You
see them (the characters) making deals, you see them compromising.
You see them as flawed human beings,'' says Robins. ``That's what
kind of makes the show work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the liberal good guys,'' acknowledges Thompson. But
``in a good drama, the characters will blow away the partisan
identification every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro has a simple explanation for why ``The West Wing'' is
must-see-TV in the Beltway. ``At a point when everything tells
Washington it's not relevant . . . here is Hollywood saying you are
relevant. Of course Washington loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why it's playing well in Peoria, Newsweek senior editor
Jonathan Alter thinks the credit goes to Sorkin's unusual ability
to make even the minutia of government entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorkin has managed to deal with substantive issues _ like the
census _ in prime time when most cable networks wouldn't even deal
with them at midnight,'' he adds. ``He managed to figure out how to
create drama around complex and sometimes dull issues . . . it
helps to make serving in government sexy again. And that's a huge
contribution.''

<P>
   Askia Toure is on a roll. He is talking about the murder of
Malcolm X and how, in the aftermath, he helped calm explosive
emotions between members of the Organization of Afro-American Unity
and the Nation of Islam. Then he jumps to the subject of drugs and
how they've annihilated modern-day black and Latino communities.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he stops mid-sentence and starts shaking his round,
dimpled face with a rueful chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, you got me going,'' says Toure (Tour-RAY), 61, who lives
in Boston. ``I'm supposed to be talking about literature and my
philosophical book on Pharaohs.''
</P>
<P>
   The work in question is ``Dawnsong! The Epic Memory of Askia
Toure,'' a book of poetry released in March. Toure calls the work,
which eulogizes such jazz greats as Sun Ra and John Coltrane as
often as it teaches about ancient African civilization, an attempt
to ``restore our imagery, our archetypes, and our history'' in a
country where Africa's story is often ignored. It's the author's
fifth book and first published work since his ``From the Pyramids
to the Projects: Poems of Genocide and Resistance,'' which won an
American Book Award in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Toure's eventful life as a radical could easily push his writing
to the background. During stints in Philadelphia, San Francisco,
Atlanta, and New York, he has interacted with a list of historic
figures that reads like a who's who in art, letters, and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he honed his intellect under the guidance of writer
Langston Hughes, educator John Henrik Clarke, and visual artist
Jacob Lawrence. Along with friends like poets Amiri Baraka, Sonia
Sanchez, and Ishmael Reed, Toure was an important member of the
Black Arts Movement of the late 1960s. He helped develop the
movement's ideology, which was based on linking art with political
activism, an idea that continues to guide how Toure leads his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume I'm a militant activist,'' says Toure, who
hasn't achieved the literary popularity of Sanchez, Baraka, or Reed
in part because of his grass-roots work. ``They think it's the only
thing I'm capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have followed Toure's career know him as a writer
who's capable of much more. Julius Thompson, director of black
studies at the University of Missouri-Columbia, calls Toure ``one
of the major voices'' out of that period. Adds Thompson, who has
written a book on the Black Arts Movement, ``he's also a
fascinating interpreter of poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Or let Baraka, who's known Toure since 1961, explain it in
vintage 1960s radical-speak: ``What Askia is doing is still
teaching a kind of anti-imperialist essence. . . . He's done a lot
of focusing on Egypt and ancient kinds of black civilizations. But
at the same time he offers a contemporary attack on what's still
oppressing most of the people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Toure moved to Boston in 1997 specifically to focus on his
writing. He says he has about five manuscripts in various stages of
completion, which he works on when he's not speaking at public
engagements or mentoring local poets.
</P>
<P>
   But at this moment, Toure chuckles, using the Yoruba word for
father, ``Baba got to do a little work for himself.''

<P>
   Toure relaxes into a sofa at the home of his agent, his compact
body clad in a multihued African-style tunic worn over conservative
black pants. His short dark Afro, long sideburns, and goatee are
fighting a losing battle against silver-gray hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Some things about Toure simply shout 1960s radical. The way, for
instance, he calls his cronies from that era ``comrades.'' But he
moves easily between mainstream and Afrocentric cultures, littering
his conversation with references to Clarke, Senegalese scholar
Cheikh Anta Diop, and poet Percy Shelley. His literary influences
include not only such African-American greats as Hughes, Gwendolyn
Brooks, and Margaret Walker, but Pablo Neruda and William Butler
Yeats.
</P>
<P>
   Why Yeats? Because he used poetry and plays to awaken the
national consciousness of the Irish suffering under British rule,
Toure explains. ``I automatically identified with that.'' After
all, it's the effect Toure wants to have on African-Americans
fighting for equal rights when they read his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel that African people are inferior,'' says
Toure. ``They probably don't say this to our face. And what's that
based on? `Well, you don't have any (African) history. It's not in
the books.' That's why our task is to restore our archetype.''
</P>
<P>
   It's at these moments, when Toure starts talking about racial
inequality, that his passion becomes palpable. He leans forward,
his arms gesticulate, his voice rises to an attention-grabbing
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Toure's politicization began at the dinner table of his Dayton,
Ohio, home at a time when he was known as Rolland Snellings. He'd
hear his Hampton University-educated parents talking about the work
of Dr. Martin Luther King. During trips to the South, he witnessed
his parents' anger when they were forced to get food from the back
door of restaurants and eat in the car because of Jim Crow laws.
</P>

   ``During those days the racial situation throughout the country
was really almost unbearable,'' says Toure's father, Clifford
Snellings, 85, who still lives with his wife, Nannie, in Dayton.
``That was our pet gripe. It, maybe, inspired (Toure) to go out and
do what he could.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Toure was in New York studying painting at the
Art Students League that he got pulled into the vortex of poetry
and activism. By the late 1960s, through the Black Arts Movement,
he too was using poetry and plays to develop the political
consciousness of working-class African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Toure first met Baraka in 1961 at the Metropolitan Opera House,
where both were protesting after the murder of Patrice Lumumba, the
Republic of Congo prime minister. The death of four girls in
Birmingham, Ala., in a church bombing in 1963, which Toure still
speaks of in a whisper, further spurred him to join the civil
rights struggle. (He was also active in the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee during the 1960s.)
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Toure was introduced to a group of poets
that included Ishmael Reed, Tom Dent, and Calvin Hernton. Toure had
become what he calls a ``closet scribbler'' while still a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been writing stuff and just,'' he says, mimicking stuffing
paper into a drawer, ``putting it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Toure finally decided to read his scribblings to his new
friends. He expected to get ``smashed,'' he says. Instead, they
encouraged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visual arts didn't have a chance after that,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   One element of Toure's work that influenced Baraka was his
presentation. ``Askia always had a songlike quality to the way he
read,'' Baraka explains, ``almost like you would expect of (a)
troubadour.'' That was the effect of the years Toure spent singing
doo-wop before moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the old dudes,'' Toure recalls joyously, launching
into an impromptu ``doo, doo, doo, de, doo'' example. ``All the
sisters would be hollering and screaming.''

</P>
<P>
   During a recent poetry event for Building Bridges, a
collaborative of Boston organizations working with young black men,
Toure gave an impassioned reading of ``From the Pyramids.''
Projecting his voice from one side of a room and then the other, he
pivoted back and forth to make a connection with the hundred people
packed into the space. His singsong delivery recalled the
inflections of a Baptist minister.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of events that fill his days now, nothing
like the radicalized world he once blossomed in. The political
change is evident even in his personal life. Toure, who is
divorced, has one son who is studying filmmaking under the
Ethiopian director Haile Gerima, best known for his 1993 film
``Sankofa.'' Another son is a Wall Street stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people have changed a lot, though it looks like we're
waking up again,'' notes Toure, giving as an example the poetry
revival he feels is occurring in Boston. Then he adds, with a touch
of distaste, ``Since Reagan and Bush we've gotten very
conservative. Not all black people, but certainly the so-called top
drawer of black people: professionals and middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Toure, meanwhile, still ardently tries to make the groggy become
fully awake. Earlier this year, he spoke to a group of students at
Wellesley College. For a poetry reading he's planning for Mother's
Day in Central Square, Cambridge, a multicultural mix of writers
will read 41 poems, representing the total number of bullets shot
by the New York police officers who killed African immigrant Amadou
Diallo last year.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Hughes, Lawrence, and Clarke did for him, Toure
mentors young local poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just very respectful of our generation,'' says Kanasha
Herbert, a Northeastern University senior, who named her infant son
Palenque after a Toure poem. It's a vivid contrast to other
literary types who ``talk a lot of trash,'' Herbert continues.
``He's always talking about how important our generation is and he
sees better and bigger things for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also there to help them interpret the meaning of such
political events as the Million Man March and the Rodney King riots
and link them to other things happening in the diaspora, such as
the current golden age of black intellectualism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `This is what a movement is,' '' Herbert recalls. ``
`You don't have to wait for someone to tell you that.' ''

WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF NEWSPAPERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; What you have here in your mitts, ladies, gentleman, and
children of all reading ages, is a manufactured product, an
information packet that began life variously as a pine tree, a
soybean, a freshet of water on some pristine Canadian forest floor,
and, not least we hope, a gleam in the eye of someone with access
to a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   That's it: today's newspaper. What you see is what you got in
your lap, your breakfast table, or, if you're Web-surfing, your
screen. The paper is a thing, not a flow of bits and bytes and
pixels and pixies. No virus here. Just the information: news,
views, lists, advertisements, temperature charts for the world,
highs-and-lows for not only Moscow and Sydney but for any stock or
bond or mutual fund that could possibly be of the remotest interest
to anyone with two quarters. We're talking Ye Olde Economy here;
the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   It hit 94 in Bangkok Monday, but got as low as 44 in Buenos
Aires. Those are just two of the tidbits you may have missed in the
daily book-equivalent which is your 365-days-a-year newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   What prompts this re-telling of the daily newspaper saga is the
appearance Monday of a 16-page advertising supplement in The New
York Times: ``Newspapers: Anchor of the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   Since dragging your anchor is the greatest fear of any sailor
becalmed on a lee shore, I paid special attention to the combined
effort of the newspaper industry to reassert relevance in the new
economy, which to many newspaper proprietors is the Yeee-economy,
or the Yikes-look-out-below economy.
</P>
<P>
   The headline on the lead article troubled me naught: ``No
Republic Can Flourish Without Newspapers.'' I buy that. Hey, I sell
that. I know something most people don't; that there has never been
a famine in a country with anything resembling a free press. No,
you can't eat this newspaper. But newspapers, and the popular
outrage they can kindle, have kept a lot of people eating in a lot
of places with precarious food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But who do the newspaper publishers elect to write their
most-important argument? Who's the lead-off batter? Walter
Cronkite! Now, I yield to no one in my conviction that Uncle Walter
is a revered newsman who is properly revered. But does it not
strike you as slightly odd that the newspaper industry chooses a
retired TV anchorman to tout the benefits of the newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   ``A Glorious Medium,'' echoes the chairman of the Newspaper
Association, which boasts 2,000 member papers. ``Newspapers Capture
the Future,'' argues John Sturm, NAA president. Alas, Mr. Sturm,
there is a ``drang'' behind every ``sturm.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's that pesky Internet that is causing our various owners
to drang their anchors. A few weeks ago before my turn at the
microphone at the annual clambake of the New England Newspaper
Association, the CEO of a newspaper chain spoke about the potential
of newspapers in the computer age. First question from the floor at
his conclusion was: ``If the newspaper business is such a good
business, how come you're selling all of your newspapers?''
</P>
<P>
   Duh! Well, the fellow said, he was just following the family's
orders; in five years 80 percent of the chain's revenue would be
from electronic sources, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of that in perusing the annual report of The New York
Times Co., which owns the chair I'm in, the keyboard I pound, and a
lot of other media stuff. The Times just bought the Worcester
Telegram to go with the Globe, acquired in 1993, but the Times is
selling off some smaller papers among the 21 others it owns.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is also planning to issue tracking stock, which
essentially peels off from the current shareholders the interactive
dot-com end of the business. Even though newspapers are the one
mass medium functioning profitably at the end of the century that
were around in 1900, the landscape is littered with gloom and doom.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Causey typed up his last Federal Diary column Monday
for the Washington Post, it was 11,287th after 36 years, in which
he chronicled the ins and outs of the federal work force for the
350,000 federal payrollers and their dependents who throng the
nation's capital. Where's Mike going? To a dot-com, natch.
</P>
<P>
   Notice a trend here? ``Sell on your strength and stop
highlighting your negatives,'' barks Lauren Rich Fine, a Merrill
Lynch executive who follows media. ``Newspapers will likely find
themselves partnering with historic competitors such as radio, TV
and magazines to create fully robust sites that are `the brand' in
a local community.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this particular columnist _ er, ``content provider,'' in
the new economy lingo _ always tries to catch up to what already
happened, I paid heed to last week's speech by Times publisher
Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. at the International Press Institute
convention. He is ``agnostic'' on how best to deliver the goods,
i.e., the stuff we read and look at, whether via ink on dead pine
trees inside of trucks burning oceans of diesel fuel, or via some
cable, modem, or wireless gizmo.
</P>
<P>
   So hook me up to those jumper cables: I'm content to be a
content provider. Just don't make me swallow the whole firehose off
the Internet. I'll settle for a soda straw, a small one.

LUCKY FOR GORE; FUND-RAISING SCANDAL ISN'T GRIPPING VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ground has cooled, passions have abated, and most people
have forgotten what the fuss was all about. This case of electoral
amnesia suggests how lucky one guy, Al Gore, can be. The place was
Milwaukee, on the campus of Marquette University. The date was
March 27 and the subject was, the vice president said, ``changing
today's system of special-interest campaign financing.''
</P>
<P>
   When most people confront embarrassment, they find it best to do
so directly. A politician often dithers and the apology arrives
amid a chorus of cacophonous bells and hideous whistles. ``I know I
may be an imperfect messenger for this cause,'' Gore said,
admitting that ``Democrats, along with Republicans, engaged in
fund-raising that pushed the system to the breaking point and
fueled further cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   The zenith of that zeal unfolded at Hacienda Heights, Calif., in
1996, when Gore attended a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple. Ever
since, he has escalated his embarrassment into an issue bigger than
most voters think it is.
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries, Gore's opponent, Bill Bradley, emphasized it,
but did not prevail. In the GOP, Senator John McCain of Arizona
made ``reform'' his centerpiece, but the totem toppled. His
campaign's influence on Governor George W. Bush was limited to Bush
agreeing to a ban on business and labor flooding parties in ``soft
money.'' Otherwise, Bush says, ``I want to increase citizen
participation'' by raising contribution levels to adjust to
inflation and by posting his campaign donors on the Internet, which
his campaign already does.
</P>
<P>
   This minimalist approach may be, from a purely political
viewpoint, just fine with most voters. Despite thunderous
denunications of the status quo from many editorial pages, most
folks have adopted an American axiom: If it ain't broke, don't fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find any legislative, congressional, gubernatorial,
or presidential contest in which campaign funding was a decisive
issue. When McCain portrayed an ``iron triangle'' of special
interests arrayed against the common good, most voters asked
whether this triangle had produced double-digit unemployment,
ignited the flames of inflation, or otherwise wrecked the economy.
No? Then why monkey with the machinery?
</P>
<P>
   Gore's response is the opposite. ``I will use the full reach of
the bully pulpit to press the case for McCain-Feingold,'' he said
in the presence of Senator Russ Feingold in Milwaukee, where he
also unveiled his ``nonpartisan Democracy Endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a minimalist approach, this endowment ``will raise more
than $7 billion over seven years, and then, with the interest and
the returns on investment, finance Senate and House general
election campaigns _ with no other contributions allowed to
candidates who accept the funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would run this endowment? With every politician compromised
and corrupted by the ``iron triangle,'' where will such trustworthy
eminentos be found, outside of a Buddhist temple? This notion, for
Gore's sake already mercifully forgotten, is luckily a distant
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gore and Bush will debate this issue in October, maybe
not. In the meantime, the vice president can not, alas, led by
example, as he confessed in Milwaukee. He must raise more money
because he can not bear seeing ``adovcates for the public interest
unilaterally disarmed . . . That was the choice I felt I faced in
1996 _ and it was a battle to defend Medicare from deep cuts; to
preserve our national commitment to education.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose Marquette, perhaps because its Jesuit tradition
emphasizes logic. Since his syllogisms seemed lame, Gore might
better have chosen an Augustinian school. St. Augustine traveled
through some sketchy territory en route to sainthood. He wrote in
his ``Confessions'' that in his rambunctious youth, he sometimes
prayed ``for chastity and continence, but not yet, O Lord, not
yet.''

&HT;     FIGHT OVER SAN FRANCISCO NEWSPAPERS CONTINUES IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The fight over the future of San Francisco's
daily newspapers continued in court this week as attorneys for
local publisher Ted Fang, who is attempting to buy the San
Francisco Examiner, tried to shoot holes in the testimony of
consultants for Clint Reilly, who has filed an antitrust lawsuit to
block the Hearst Corp.'s sale of the Examiner and purchase of the
San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a consultant to Reilly, who failed in his bid to buy
the Examiner, admitted to making multimillion-dollar math errors
concerning the cost of running that newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Reilly's attorney Joseph M. Alioto said he would
not call his client to the stand. Reilly had been expected to be a
star witness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hearst said it expected to announce Wednesday that
a former judge had agreed to lead an inquiry into whether Examiner
publisher Timothy O. White had violated journalistic ethics in
offering Mayor Willie Brown favorable treatment in The Examiner's
editorial pages in exchange for Brown's support of Hearst's plan to
buy the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unequivocally, any practices that compromise editorial
independence or integrity will not be tolerated in the newsrooms of
any of our newspapers,'' said George B. Irish, president of
Hearst's newspaper division, in a letter to Chronicle employees
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony Tuesday centered on several newspaper industry
consultants to Reilly who asserted that the Fang family would be
unable to publish The Examiner as a viable competitor to a Hearst
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   J. Scott Schmidt, a former president of Thomson Newspapers West,
which owned several daily and weekly papers in California,
testified Hearst's subsidy was not enough to support a ``worthy
competitor'' to The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said it would take a subsidy of at least $50 million a
year for three to five years. And, he testified, the Fangs would
have to boost The Examiner's current daily circulation of 108,968
to about 300,000 to attract enough advertising to finance a
competitive paper. The Chronicle's circulation is 465,535.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said a competitive metropolitan newspaper had full
coverage of sports, arts, business and local, national and
international news.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Christopher Hockett, an attorney for
the Fangs, Schmidt acknowledged that he had no information about
the Fangs' plans for publishing The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   And he admitted making math errors that resulted in his
over-estimating some annual costs of publishing The Examiner by $28
million, though he said he stood by his overall conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ingram, a former senior vice president of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which handles joint business operations
for The Examiner and the Chronicle, also testified as a consultant
to Reilly that the Fangs would not be able to publish a true
competitor to the Chronicle with the Hearst subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs lack the necessary presses, which are costly and
unavailable for rent in San Francisco, Ingram said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hockett's questioning, Ingram said he, too, had no idea of
the Fangs' plans, and had not checked local press availability
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram noted that he sent a Feb. 13 e-mail saying Reilly, on
learning Hearst might offer a subsidy to a buyer of The Examiner,
was ``happy as the fox in the hen house.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockett asked Ingram, ``And why are foxes happy when they get
inside hen houses, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about foxes,'' Ingram replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because they're about to do something good for the
public, is it, sir?'' Hockett.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker, who is hearing the case,
declared the question argumentative, and Hockett withdrew it.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said later that Reilly had been happy because he thought
Hearst was beginning to negotiate with him in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was an unsuccessful bidder for The Examiner. Court
documents indicate he offered March 7 to buy The Examiner, but
sought a $200 million subsidy from Hearst over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Irish may be called to testify as early as Wednesday about what
he knew of White's talks with Brown, Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   Irish is temporarily replacing White, whom Hearst suspended
indefinitely with pay.
</P>
<P>
   White sent Irish two e-mails about conversations he'd had with
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 30, 1999, White said he and Examiner Executive Editor
Phil Bronstein had had lunch with Brown that day, and, ``I asked
Willie how I was going to justify to my superiors in New York
wanting to support him and cooperate with him when he was seeming
to go out of his way to make our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was opposing Hearst's initial plan to buy the Chronicle
and close The Examiner if no buyer for it could be found.
</P>
<P>
   In court on May 1, Alioto asked White, ``Is it not correct that
you were in fact intending to convey to Mayor Brown that his
support for Hearst's proposed acquisition of the Chronicle would
result in more favorable treatment for him in The Examiner?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' White replied, adding, ``That wouldn't affect the
journalism side. It would affect the editorial side.''
</P>
<P>
   White later said he was tired and confused by Alioto's
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto then introduced part of a December deposition transcript
in which White gave similar testimony to the U.S. Department of
Justice, which was reviewing Hearst's proposed purchase of the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Friday that Irish's testimony ``may clear the air,
or it may substantiate the suggestions which Mr. Alioto's
examination of Mr. White brought forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish, Walker said, ``can explain what he understood some of
these communications to be and explain the actions that he took or
the actions that he did not take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that it's irrelevant, but I must also say
I'm not sure what the relevance is.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Bennack, Hearst's president, was also expected to testify
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Irish also said he expected to announce Wednesday that a former
judge had agreed to lead a review of whether suspended publisher
White had violated journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Irish responded Tuesday to a letter responding to 80 Chronicle
staff members who called on Hearst to fully investigate the matter
while being fair to White, who they said they valued for his
decency and judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Irish's letter said the jurist, who was not named, would make a
full and impartial review of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Shriver, a Hearst spokeswoman, has said Irish and other
Hearst executives were not aware of White's offer to Brown.
Bronstein has said ``there were no negotiations of press coverage
of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends Hearst's proposed purchase of the Chronicle will
result in an illegal monopoly in which Hearst owns the only major
metropolitan daily newspaper in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly claims Hearst's plan to sell The Examiner to the Fangs,
and to give them a subsidy of up to $66 million over three years,
is a sham meant to facilitate Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle.
He contends the subsidy is insufficient to run a viable competitor
to Hearst's Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst disputes Reilly's contentions. Gary Halling, a Hearst
lawyer, has said The Examiner could not survive in its current form
outside its profit-sharing agreement with the larger Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   He has argued that The Examiner is a failing enterprise, and
that as a result Hearst may legally shut it or sell it and buy The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   No law requires Hearst to give any buyer of The Examiner a
subsidy, Halling says.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is giving the Fangs a subsidy to satisfy local
politicians, including Brown, who said they wanted San Francisco to
have at least two daily newspapers, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs deny their deal with Hearst is a sham. They have said
their Examiner would compete with Hearst's Chronicle for readers
and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, The Examiner and the Chronicle have had a joint
operating agreement to share combined revenue and costs of
printing, advertising and circulation. They split the remainder,
with each paying the costs of its independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was set to expire in 2005, but Chronicle
Publishing Co. decided to sell the Chronicle to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   The trial on Reilly's suit is the nation's first to consider
whether early termination of a joint operating agreement violates
the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act, which permits the agreements
as exemptions to antitrust laws. The act was meant to keep alive
newspapers that might otherwise fail, so communities could benefit
from multiple editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto says Hearst's plans violate the act. Halling says it does
not apply to terminations of the agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly says he has legal standing to sue as a subscriber who
would be affected by Hearst's alleged monopoly ownership of the
Chronicle, and as a private attorney to protect the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said after court that he had decided not to call Reilly
as a witness because Hearst had agreed Reilly was a subscriber. But
he noted Hearst had not agreed Reilly had standing to sue, an issue
up to Walker. Hearst or the Fangs could call Reilly to testify,
Alioto said.

MOTHER-IN-LAW JOKES JUST A PART OF AMERICAN CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to a beer commercial (my source of information for
just about everything), Americans do not know much about Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Our neighbors to the north (or is it the south?) think we think
most Canadians are lumberjacks or fur traders who live in igloos,
eat blubber and use a dog sled to drive back and forth to work at
the hockey-stick factory.
</P>
<P>
   In a Molson beer commercial, a character dubbed ``Joe Canadian''
has become something of a national folk hero by disputing these
stereotypes and standing up for Canadian patriotism, such as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in peacekeeping, not policing,'' says Joe, his voice
rising, ``diversity, not assimilation; and that the beaver is a
proud and noble animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe is now shouting: ``Canada is the second-largest land mass,
the first nation of hockey and the best part of North America!''
</P>
<P>
   I am glad to see that Canada is developing a sense of national
pride and I will not quibble over the fact that, as patriotic
slogans go, ``The beaver is a proud and noble animal'' is hardly in
the same class as ``Remember the Alamo!'' ``Make love, not war'' or
even ``Nixon's the one!''
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that we Americans do not know as much about
Canadians as we should, up to and including the fact that they love
their mothers-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of 600 Canadians by Hallmark Canada and
Chatelaine magazine, 90 percent of respondents said they love their
mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those urban legends that everyone hates their
mother-in-law,'' Garth Jay, vice president of the greeting-card
company told Reuters. ``It's nice to finally have the statistics to
debunk the old myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps loving one's mother-in-law is part of the
``peacekeeping, not policing; diversity not assimilation'' thing
that Joe Canadian prattles about in his beer commercial, but I
seriously doubt that it is something that will improve
Canadian-American relations to the point that we consider replacing
the eagle with the beaver as our national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Tasteless mother-in-law jokes are an integral part of our
culture, much like blubber and igloos are to the Canadian culture.
We may be willing to concede that Canada is the second largest
landmass, but we'll never give in on the mother-in-law thing, no
matter how much the greeting-card companies would wish it to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the definition of mixed emotions?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing your mother-in-law driving over a cliff in your new
car.''
</P>
<P>
   If we bow to Canadian pressure and stop repeating tasteless,
stereotypical mother-in-law jokes it is just a matter of time
before we also have to stop repeating tasteless and stereotypical
blonde jokes, Polish jokes and jokes involving a priest, a minister
and a rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother-in-law was bitten by a dog yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is she now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fine, but the dog died.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that you hear fewer mother-in-law jokes now than you
once did has nothing to do with political correctness or the fact
that the jokes were not all that funny in the first place. It is
nothing less than a Canadian conspiracy, the ultimate goal of which
is to replace our president with a prime minister and assimilate
our beavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are some of the anagrams you can make out of the words
`mother-in-law?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``A molten whir, thermal wino, minaret howl, alert him now,
alter him now, nail the worm, am Hitler now, woman Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is every year, Mother-In-Law Day this year will be
celebrated the week before Halloween.

 &HT;     SELLER CHANGES HIS STORY ABOUT Ebay ARTWORK  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The seller of an abstract painting on online
auction site eBay _ which set off a bidding war by art lovers who
speculated it was a lost masterpiece by late San Francisco area
painter Richard Diebenkorn _ admitted to concocting some details
about how he came to discover the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Walton, a Sacramento lawyer who put the piece up for bid
on eBay, also said Tuesday he would put the $135,805 sale of the
painting on hold until an independent expert confirms that the
piece is an original work by Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   If the work is authentic, the sale of the painting to a Dutch
art collector will proceed, Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations came a day after the sale made headlines when
the painting, an abstract orange and green landscape, set off a
frenzy of bidding by art lovers around the world. The painting was
offered on eBay at an initial bid of 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The high bidder, Robert Keereweer of Nieuwkoop, Netherlands,
never saw the painting in person, but was convinced it was a
Diebenkorn after seeing a photo of the piece online showing the
signature, ``RD `52'' - possibly referring to the artist's initials
and the year 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, who offered the painting under the eBay username
``golfpoorly,'' never claimed the piece was by Diebenkorn or by any
other known artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got this big abstract art painting at a garage sale in
Berkeley back in my bachelor days,'' he wrote in his description of
the painting. ``Then I got married, and my wife has never let me
keep it in the house. She says it looks like it was done by a
nutcase.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Walton admitted that he had made up parts of
that story.
</P>
<P>
   In his description, Walton wrote that the painting has a hole in
it caused by a child's Big Wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But Walton revealed in a late Tuesday interview with the
Sacramento Bee that he had made up the story about his wife and
child, and actually has neither. But he insisted the painting was
not invented. He would not allow the press to see it, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going nuts. I feel like this is getting out of control and
everyone is blowing it out of proportion,'' he said. ``I'm dreading
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton also told the Bee that contrary to his earlier plan to
turn the painting over to Keereweer soon, he would have it
appraised before completing the sale. If it didn't turn out to be a
Diebenkorn, the sale would not go through, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keereweer, an art lover and software executive who lives about
12 miles south of Amsterdam, said the hole could be fixed easily
and estimated that when fixed, it would be worth about $500,000 to
$1 million. He was not sure if he would sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Keereweer, who placed the highest bid on the painting Monday,
said he has mentally prepared himself for the possibility that the
piece is not an original.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' he said. ``It's part of taking the risk. If
you buy a share of a company, you don't know how it will perform.
The biggest risk is doing it and trying to explain it to my wife.
She thinks I'm nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Keereweer, the managing director of Softwarehuis, a company he
sold 10 months ago, said he sold some shares of the company to
afford the painting.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has experience collecting art, but ran out of time
for the hobby a few years ago when his first child was born.
Someone told him about eBay about two months ago, and since then he
has bought other works of art, including a $3,850 Franz Kline oil
painting and a $1,700 Rodchenko mixed-media piece.
</P>
<P>
   Keereweer studied art history for five years in college and said
he felt fairly confident that the painting was an original.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical way of his painting; it's a typical subject;
the colors were right,'' he said. ``We'll find out in a few days
whether this is the laughable thing of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Diebenkorn, who died in 1993, was one of America's greatest 20th
century artists. He was born in Portland in 1922, but settled in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   He is associated with the rise of Abstract Expressionism in the
1940s and 1950s. He painted abstract and representational images,
and is best known for his ``Ocean Park cycle,'' a series of
paintings he produced in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   His 1959 painting, ``Horizon: Ocean Park,'' sold at Sotheby's in
1998 for $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Diebenkorn's daughter, Gretchen Grant of Berkeley, said she had
no idea if the piece was a work by her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a very private person and he painted in his
studio alone,'' Grant said. ``Although my mother saw most of his
work and I saw a great deal of it, we certainly didn't see all of
it. Some things were sold many, many years ago, in the 1950s, and
have never been seen since. Things pop up now and again at auction
that we knew about, but had never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant is cataloging all her father's work and said she is nearly
done but is missing information on a few works that she knows were
painted and sold, but does not know where they are now.
</P>
<P>
   This is not one of them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't match anything we have records for that we're
missing,'' Grant said.
</P>

sort of piece here -- either in story or grafic form -- that relies

A CONTROVERSIAL BRITISH SERIES SEDUCES SHOWTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One year ago, the fast-moving, darkly funny series
``Queer as Folk'' scorched the British television landscape. The
show, about a group of gay men in Manchester, was marked by so much
graphic language and explicit sex _ some of it with a 15-year-old
boy _ that just about everyone seemed outraged. At least at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely torn apart by the right-wing press, by the
left-wing press, by gay people, by straight people,'' said Russell
T. Davies, the cheerful, 37-year-old Welsh-born writer who created
the series for Britain's Channel 4. He laughed. ``There was nothing
like that show on British television,'' he said. ``Now I'm eager to
see what you Americans do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to wait too long.
</P>
<P>
   After five months of negotiations, the Showtime cable network
has picked up ``Queer as Folk'' and plans to turn it into a
22-episode series set in a blue-collar Eastern city, probably
Pittsburgh. Executives at Showtime, who vied with HBO for the
series and are plainly seeking to be more competitive with that
highly successful cable network, said that ``Queer as Folk'' would
be as explicit in the United States as it was in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this show was unique,'' said Jerry Offsay,
Showtime's president of programming. ``I had never seen characters
like these on television. The characters were unapologetic, they
lived their lives the way they wanted to. There were great twists
and turns and reverses in the storytelling. This show will be as
edgy as any television series has ever been in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The American version, which is now being written and is set to
be broadcast later in the year, will mirror the British show _ with
one significant difference. The firestorm that rocked Britain after
the first episode of ``Queer as Folk'' was set off in large part by
the affair the 29-year-old lead character, Stuart, has with Nathan,
who is 15. An advertising man consumed with the hunt for sex,
Stuart has a best friend, Vince, who has been entranced with him
for years. But the icily seductive Stuart cares only about having
sex as often as he can with as many men as he can.
</P>
<P>
   In the American version, the youth will be nearly 18. ``The boy
is on the cusp of being the legal age,'' said Tony Jonas, one of
the executive producers of the series and a former president of
Warner Brothers Television. ``The idea is, kids who are seniors in
high school are being sexual. We can't deny that. It's the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas had been trying to sell Offsay another show when the
Showtime executive asked him to be one of the producers of ``Queer
as Folk.'' ``When I first saw the material,'' said Jonas, ``there
was a sense of shock. But once you got past the shock, this was
solid, intelligent and caustically funny material.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Jonas as executive producers of the series are Rob Cowen
and Daniel Lipman, who are also writing the first episodes. Cowen
and Lipman created the NBC series ``Sisters'' and won an Emmy for
their 1985 drama, ``An Early Frost,'' one of the first television
films about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen said: ``There are a lot of gay characters in commercial
television and films now, but not a show like this. There's never
been anything like this. It's an odd mix of very graphic material
that's also witty and charming.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Showtime had placed no restraints on the writing team.
``We will not be accused of watering down the series,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipman said the producers and Showtime wanted to avoid setting
the series in a heavily gay neighborhood like New York's Chelsea,
Los Angeles' West Hollywood or San Francisco's Castro district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it in a place where you couldn't say, `It's those
people out there,''' Lipman said. ``These characters don't work in
entertainment or fashion. They're average people in an average
town.''
</P>
<P>
   The British series was set not in London but in Manchester,
where Davies lives. ``I didn't want to write something with a
message,'' said Davies, who has spent most of his career writing
dramas and soap operas for British television. ``Because I'm gay, I
was always putting in gay characters in my plays. In this case, I
wanted to entertain and captivate an audience. All right, they're
gay. Let's get on with the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the British show in some ways followed his
formula. The initial wave of shock had disappeared by the time the
eight hourlong episodes of ``Queer as Folk'' had completed their
run in 1999. (They were followed by a two-hour show this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Initially, gay groups objected to what they saw as the show's
sensationalism, fearing that its affluent, promiscuous and
thoroughly vapid characters would feed into gay stereotypes.
Critics, especially in conservative newspapers, denounced the
characters' freewheeling sexuality and were shocked by the underage
sex. But like most of the characters in the British series, Nathan
_ who wants a real relationship and not a one-night stand _ turned
into a more complex and stronger figure as each episode unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's surprising to me is that the criticism didn't just calm
down, it actually reversed itself,'' Davies said. ``A reviewer in
The Daily Mail, who hated it at first, said later that she felt it
was the most important piece of television in years.''
</P>
<P>
   No actors have been cast for the American series. But several
writers who have written gay-themed plays, films or television
dramas have joined the show: Richard Kramer (``Tales of the
City''), Jonathan Tolins (``Twilight of the Golds'') and Jason
Schafer (``Trick'').
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, making a risky show like ``Queer as Folk'' has no
downside for Showtime. The network, with 22.3 million subscribers,
has for years struggled in the shadow of HBO, which has 35.7
million. ``Queer as Folk'' will, if nothing else, attract
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Offsay said Showtime's pledge to turn ``Queer as Folk'' into a
long-running series was a decisive factor in the decision by
Channel 4 and Davies to sell the rights to the cable network. ``Our
willingness to go straight to a 22-episode series probably
prevailed in the end,'' Offsay said. At the same time, the network
promised to stick as close to the British series as possible,
especially in matters of candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run R-rated movies as a staple of our service,'' Offsay
said. ``The content can be edgy. We don't develop cop shows, or
lawyer shows, or doctor shows. People get them free on every
network. We're always looking for something better _ and different
_ than what the networks are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that because there will be so many more episodes of
the American series, the writers will be able to turn some of the
British version's lesser characters into prominent figures. This
will include a lesbian couple who have just had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Davies said he had initially been nervous about
the American version. ``I was worried that it might become
blander,'' he said. But after reading a draft of the opening
two-hour episode, Davies said he believed his fears were
unwarranted. ``I picked it up with trepidation,'' he said. ``But
I'm really pleased. They were remarkably faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good stories never die, and this is a good story,'' he added.
``So we're telling the story in different ways and in different
settings, reinventing the story. And that's what you should do.''
He laughed. ``I can't wait to see it.'' &QL;

WILLIAM EDMONDSON, A MASTER SCULPTOR, NO LONGER A SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Fla., Ga., N.Y.) (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 By TESSA DE CARLO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Edmondson of Nashville had his first one-man
show in New York in 1937, when a dozen of his elegantly spare
limestone sculptures went on view at the Museum of Modern Art.
Despite the venue, the New York art world seems to have regarded
Edmondson less as a modern artist than a folkloric primitive _
according to the blithely condescending press reports of the time,
an ``innocent Negro'' (Newsweek) whose ``guileless use of plastic
symbol language'' (New York Times) revealed the ``imaginativeness
of true naivete'' (New Yorker).
</P>
<P>
   On May 20 the Museum of American Folk Art opens the first major
New York retrospective of Edmondson's work since the 1937 show.
Despite the venue, Edmondson this time around is being presented
not as a simple folk carver but as an outstanding 20th-century
artist prominent in both the pantheon of self-taught art and the
history of American modernism.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed over the last 63 years is not only the nation's
racial politics but the perceived value of art created by people
like William Edmondson, a man with no formal education whose life
and artistic practice unfolded far outside the narrow precincts of
the fine-art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmondson's work is gorgeous in its simplicity and striking in
its sophistication,'' said Brooke Anderson, director of the Folk
Art's Contemporary Center, its new department for modern
self-taught art. . ``He was very rooted in the South and in the
African-American community and very much a man of his time, but his
work also transcends those things. That's part of its greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of William Edmondson,'' which will be on view through
Aug. 27 in New York before traveling to Rochester, Atlanta and
Orlando, Fla., aims to bring the artist to a wider audience.
``After the 1937 show, Edmondson's life didn't change; he got
hardly any recognition,'' said Rusty Freeman, associate curator at
Nashville's Cheekwood Museum of Art, which organized the current
exhibition. Today the artist is highly regarded by art insiders
familiar with his work, ``but he needs to be exposed to the
mainstream,'' Freeman said. ``He's been an art-world secret for too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   The ups and downs of Edmondson's public career are a reminder
that the current popularity of what's variously called vernacular,
outsider or self-taught art reprises the craze for ``naive''
artists that swept the American art world in the 1930s. Back then
modern art was widely attacked as the alien spawn of European
decadence. Modernism's proponents, who found inspiration in
everything from African masks to the daily newspaper, turned their
omnivorous gaze on folk art and the idiosyncratic work of untrained
artists, and found proof that modern art's radical visual ideas had
deep American roots.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first museum exhibitions of American folk art was
organized at the Museum of Modern Art in 1932, drawing from the
collection of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, also a prominent modern-art
collector. At the same time, John Kane, Morris Hirschfield and Anna
(Grandma) Moses were among the scores of ``modern primitives''
welcomed into the Modern and important New York galleries.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this era that Edmondson came to the attention of
the art world, an intersection that was otherwise unlikely in the
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Born just outside Nashville in 1874, the son of freed slaves,
barely able to read or write, Edmondson worked as a railroad
laborer, then as a hospital janitor. In 1931 he left or lost his
hospital job, but shortly thereafter he found a new, divinely
inspired career. According to Edmondson, God appeared at the head
of his bed and announced he had come to confer the gift of cutting
stone. Edmondson obediently made himself a crude hammer and chisel,
and soon God appeared again with models of tombstones for Edmondson
to copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight he
hung a tombstone out for me to make,'' Edmondson later recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The novice stonecutter put up a sign reading ``Tomb-stones for
Sale'' and went to work. His raw materials were limestone blocks
from demolished buildings and curbing torn out when the city
replaced stone with concrete.
</P>
<P>
   He sold only a few tombstones to his neighbors, but the love of
carving for its own sake drove him on. As he grew more adept he
began carving animals, angels, nurses and preachers. ``First he
told me to make tombstones, then he told me to cut the figures,''
Edmondson reportedly said. ``He give me them two things.''
</P>
<P>
   Judged by the standards of ordinary funerary monuments,
Edmondson's handiwork might look unskilled and crude. But to
sophisticated eyes the sculptures' pared-down forms, subtly varied
textures and enigmatic presence evoked the work of such modernist
masters as Constantin Brancusi and Elie Nadelman, while at the same
time looking like nothing except themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Word about this phenomenon spread through the local white art
community and from there to New York, and in 1936 Louise
Dahl-Wolfe, a rising fashion photographer, went to Edmondson's
house and took a series of photographs of the artist and his
sculpture-filled backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Several of her photographs are on display in the current show,
along with later ones of the sculptor and his environment by Edward
Weston and Consuelo Kanaga. The formal beauty of these images,
particularly Weston's Cubist-inspired close-ups of the sculptures'
stark shapes and shadows, shows the chord the unschooled Nashville
carver struck in his high-modernist fellow artists.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl-Wolfe showed her photographs to the Museum of Modern Art's
director, Alfred Barr, and the next year Edmondson became the first
black American to receive a one-man show at the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   The show received enthusiastic reviews, but none of Edmondson's
work went into the Modern's collection. Articles about Edmondson
appeared in Time, Life and Newsweek as well as the art magazines,
but most of them focused on his illiteracy and religious visions
rather than the quality of his work.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker's prediction that ``after the show closes,
Edmondson will soon be forgotten'' came true, at least within the
New York art scene.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson continued carving until age and disability forced him
to stop in 1950. But the triumph of Abstract Expressionism made
``naive'' art seem as out of style as hoop skirts, and after 1937
Edmondson had only one more show in his lifetime, at a local black
university. He died of a heart attack in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of collectors continued to value Edmondson's work,
however, and over the years his pieces made their way into
Cheekwood and other museums.
</P>
<P>
   When the overheated, increasingly academic art scene of the
1980s fueled widespread new interest in folk and self-taught art as
more ``authentic'' and affordable alternatives, Edmondson once
again became a star. The current show is the latest evidence that,
at least within the vernacular art world, he has achieved the
status of old master.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Could fashions shift again and send Edmondson's work back into
obscurity?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable,'' says Frank Maresca, a New York gallery
owner who specializes in self-taught art. He points out that the
most important Edmondson sculptures now command prices approaching
half a million dollars, adding, ``You might as well say the art
world is going to forget about Warhol.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, in the last 20 years self-taught art has
developed its own institutional infrastructure. ``Should this
category exist? I have no idea,'' Anderson says. ``But it does
exist, and there's a whole community of museums, dealers,
collectors, curators and scholars devoted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The field is still struggling to define itself, however, and
there's little agreement on what it should be called or how the
material should be handled.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of context. Those who work with self-taught art
are often criticized for presenting artists like Edmondson as
isolated creators operating outside society, implying that the
source of their art is deep eccentricity if not outright insanity.
By contrast, the catalog for ``The Art of William Edmondson''
describes an artist who was very much a part of the world around
him, with essays tracing the folkloric and topical references in
Edmondson's work and the ways his heavenly visions are rooted in
African-American spiritual traditions.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cheekwood exhibition emphasized the content of
Edmondson's work, grouping the sculptures by subject (angels,
animals and so on), the New York version of the show takes an
artier approach, accentuating Edmondson's stark modernity with a
gray-on-gray display that echoes the look of Weston and
Dahl-Wolfe's black-and-white photographs. In addition, the New York
museum has added 6 pieces to the 40 in the original traveling show,
including 2 _ a striking abstract angel and a geometric ``critter''
_ that some believe may be unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   Maresca, who designed the Folk Art's installation, indignantly
dismisses that idea. ``One aspect of Edmondson's work relates to a
minimalist aesthetic'' more familiar to the contemporary art world
than to folk art, he says. ``To say Edmondson didn't finish them
suggests he wasn't capable of exploring that aesthetic. And he was
one sophisticated guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger question remains whether slotting artists like
Edmondson into the vernacular category makes them more visible but
harder to see truly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time people stopped making these little boxes for things,
either to defend them or to dismiss them,'' says Robert Storr, the
Museum of Modern Art's senior curator of painting and sculpture and
an Edmondson aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Edmondson were just appealingly odd, he would fit in that
little box and stay there. But his work is more lovely and enduring
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Anderson makes no apologies for showing Edmondson
at a folk art museum. ``I don't see that it's problematic for there
to be a place in New York City where audiences can explore
Edmondson's work as nonacademic art,'' she says. ``In no way does
that exclude any other institutions from exploring the work in
their own way, whether it's the Studio Museum in Harlem or the
Museum of Modern Art.''

   There are some places you agree to go to just for the sake of
getting out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us know this as the anywhere-but-here syndrome, which is
why you some nights find yourself consenting to a movie like, say,
``Three Kings,'' or stretching a stop for frozen yogurt into a
dining-out experience.
</P>
<P>
   That is kind of how I approached going to the Giants' new Pac
Bell ball park. I am not a sports fan nor given to wearing orange
and black or speaking in ``play ball'' metaphors. But it was a
Friday night and we were out on the town, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Then I made an amazing discovery. I could become a ball park
fan. Right off, as we passed a chorus line of palm trees and hiked
a ramp as steep as Lombard Street to our seats, I gushed to my
husband, ``This is the best ball park I've ever been in.'' He
rightfully asked how many ball parks there have been in my life.
</P>
<P>
   I once went to Candlestick for the tailgate party and my dad
took me to Yankee Stadium when I was 8. But I have relatives who
rhapsodize over Fenway Park and friends who grew up with Wrigley
Field and Tiger Stadium and I kind of like the Americana notion of
people bonding with a ball park.
</P>
<P>
   By now every San Francisco Bay Area and out-of-town hard core
fan and sports writer has weighed in on the merits of the splashy
new park, but I offer a companion's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   First, the view: If you go to a ball park to look out and around
and only occasionally down on the ground, you will be thrilled at
all you can see. It's tight and close enough you could probably
make out your friend across the way if you knew what section he was
in. But the view is the best, a panorama usually only available to
those in high places and frequenters of penthouse restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   You can see cargo ships, ferry lights, boat lights, bridge
lights. There's Oakland and Mount Diablo and wind surfers. I
noticed another companion sitting nearby was so mesmerized she put
her book down.
</P>
<P>
   The weather: The famous fog came in, blowing across like smoke,
but it didn't leave its wet hand print. It just kept on going and
there was no wind. The guy two seats over from us could actually
spit straight down at his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Dress requirements: The coziest person I saw was a little girl
wrapped in a blanket and sitting in her father's lap. If you're too
big for that you can prepare for the cooling night by packing a few
accessories. The mother and child sitting next to me pulled gloves,
hats and scarves from their backpack. The woman offered me her
gloves when she went for a beer, but I would have preferred her
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort level: The seats are almost as friendly on your back as
an office ergonomics chair and they're backed up tight into the
next row so you can stash your purse safely underneath. The drink
holders are a nice touch.
</P>
<P>
   Food: Expensive, of course. The basic hot dog is a few big bites
worth and the bun is timid but with enough onions and sauerkraut,
it's an adequate meal, although next time I'm searching out the
Vietnamese chicken salad. Still, it's a relatively cheap way to eat
al fresco in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Bathrooms: On the top row they open to the stars, which is
almost like camping. There was no waiting for the Ladies Room,
which was probably a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   People-watching: Second to airports, ball parks are voyeuristic
pleasure houses. Most people are paying attention to the game, so
are unaware that the person behind and to their left is staring,
making note of who's holding hands, deciding if the red leather is
real leather. Eavesdropping is effortless. Two guys in front of us
started talking about the female announcer and I was prepared to
lean in and defend her but it turned out they're admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Cordiality: Ball parks are good places for people to interface,
particularly after talking to a computer all day. Strangers seem to
make small talk at a ball game, like they've all been invited to
the same party and are best friends of the host. Of course it's
mostly about baseball, but it's sociable. The woman next to me
returned to her seat to see that one of our guys was at first base.
``How did he get there?'' she asked. I thought that must have been
obvious. How many ways can there be? But I said, ``I didn't notice.
I was looking at the planes landing in Oakland.'' I pulled on my
husband's sleeve. He said, ``base hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowd: It's good to be with thousands of people who are
basically happy to be where they are, put their hands over their
hearts for the national anthem and are patient enough to sit for
three hours while the players take their sweet time throwing the
ball around.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood: South Beach is posh but accessible, with
restaurants with good wine lists, where half the clientele is
dressed for dinner and the other half is covered with peanut dust
and wearing sport shoes. Now that's a night out, even though the
Giants lost.

A CONTROVERSIAL BRITISH SERIES SEDUCES SHOWTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One year ago, the fast-moving, darkly funny series
``Queer as Folk'' scorched the British television landscape. The
show, about a group of gay men in Manchester, was marked by so much
graphic language and explicit sex _ some of it with a 15-year-old
boy _ that just about everyone seemed outraged. At least at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely torn apart by the right-wing press, by the
left-wing press, by gay people, by straight people,'' said Russell
T. Davies, the cheerful, 37-year-old Welsh-born writer who created
the series for Britain's Channel 4. He laughed. ``There was nothing
like that show on British television,'' he said. ``Now I'm eager to
see what you Americans do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to wait too long.
</P>
<P>
   After five months of negotiations, the Showtime cable network
has picked up ``Queer as Folk'' and plans to turn it into a
22-episode series set in a blue-collar Eastern city, probably
Pittsburgh. Executives at Showtime, who vied with HBO for the
series and are plainly seeking to be more competitive with that
highly successful cable network, said that ``Queer as Folk'' would
be as explicit in the United States as it was in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this show was unique,'' said Jerry Offsay,
Showtime's president of programming. ``I had never seen characters
like these on television. The characters were unapologetic, they
lived their lives the way they wanted to. There were great twists
and turns and reverses in the storytelling. This show will be as
edgy as any television series has ever been in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The American version, which is now being written and is set to
be broadcast later in the year, will mirror the British show _ with
one significant difference. The firestorm that rocked Britain after
the first episode of ``Queer as Folk'' was set off in large part by
the affair the 29-year-old lead character, Stuart, has with Nathan,
who is 15. An advertising man consumed with the hunt for sex,
Stuart has a best friend, Vince, who has been entranced with him
for years. But the icily seductive Stuart cares only about having
sex as often as he can with as many men as he can.
</P>
<P>
   In the American version, the youth will be nearly 18. ``The boy
is on the cusp of being the legal age,'' said Tony Jonas, one of
the executive producers of the series and a former president of
Warner Brothers Television. ``The idea is, kids who are seniors in
high school are being sexual. We can't deny that. It's the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas had been trying to sell Offsay another show when the
Showtime executive asked him to be one of the producers of ``Queer
as Folk.'' ``When I first saw the material,'' said Jonas, ``there
was a sense of shock. But once you got past the shock, this was
solid, intelligent and caustically funny material.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Jonas as executive producers of the series are Rob Cowen
and Daniel Lipman, who are also writing the first episodes. Cowen
and Lipman created the NBC series ``Sisters'' and won an Emmy for
their 1985 drama, ``An Early Frost,'' one of the first television
films about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen said: ``There are a lot of gay characters in commercial
television and films now, but not a show like this. There's never
been anything like this. It's an odd mix of very graphic material
that's also witty and charming.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Showtime had placed no restraints on the writing team.
``We will not be accused of watering down the series,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipman said the producers and Showtime wanted to avoid setting
the series in a heavily gay neighborhood like New York's Chelsea,
Los Angeles' West Hollywood or San Francisco's Castro district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it in a place where you couldn't say, `It's those
people out there,''' Lipman said. ``These characters don't work in
entertainment or fashion. They're average people in an average
town.''
</P>
<P>
   The British series was set not in London but in Manchester,
where Davies lives. ``I didn't want to write something with a
message,'' said Davies, who has spent most of his career writing
dramas and soap operas for British television. ``Because I'm gay, I
was always putting in gay characters in my plays. In this case, I
wanted to entertain and captivate an audience. All right, they're
gay. Let's get on with the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the British show in some ways followed his
formula. The initial wave of shock had disappeared by the time the
eight hourlong episodes of ``Queer as Folk'' had completed their
run in 1999. (They were followed by a two-hour show this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Initially, gay groups objected to what they saw as the show's
sensationalism, fearing that its affluent, promiscuous and
thoroughly vapid characters would feed into gay stereotypes.
Critics, especially in conservative newspapers, denounced the
characters' freewheeling sexuality and were shocked by the underage
sex. But like most of the characters in the British series, Nathan
_ who wants a real relationship and not a one-night stand _ turned
into a more complex and stronger figure as each episode unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's surprising to me is that the criticism didn't just calm
down, it actually reversed itself,'' Davies said. ``A reviewer in
The Daily Mail, who hated it at first, said later that she felt it
was the most important piece of television in years.''
</P>
<P>
   No actors have been cast for the American series. But several
writers who have written gay-themed plays, films or television
dramas have joined the show: Richard Kramer (``Tales of the
City''), Jonathan Tolins (``Twilight of the Golds'') and Jason
Schafer (``Trick'').
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, making a risky show like ``Queer as Folk'' has no
downside for Showtime. The network, with 22.3 million subscribers,
has for years struggled in the shadow of HBO, which has 35.7
million. ``Queer as Folk'' will, if nothing else, attract
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Offsay said Showtime's pledge to turn ``Queer as Folk'' into a
long-running series was a decisive factor in the decision by
Channel 4 and Davies to sell the rights to the cable network. ``Our
willingness to go straight to a 22-episode series probably
prevailed in the end,'' Offsay said. At the same time, the network
promised to stick as close to the British series as possible,
especially in matters of candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run R-rated movies as a staple of our service,'' Offsay
said. ``The content can be edgy. We don't develop cop shows, or
lawyer shows, or doctor shows. People get them free on every
network. We're always looking for something better _ and different
_ than what the networks are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that because there will be so many more episodes of
the American series, the writers will be able to turn some of the
British version's lesser characters into prominent figures. This
will include a lesbian couple who have just had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Davies said he had initially been nervous about
the American version. ``I was worried that it might become
blander,'' he said. But after reading a draft of the opening
two-hour episode, Davies said he believed his fears were
unwarranted. ``I picked it up with trepidation,'' he said. ``But
I'm really pleased. They were remarkably faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good stories never die, and this is a good story,'' he added.
``So we're telling the story in different ways and in different
settings, reinventing the story. And that's what you should do.''
He laughed. ``I can't wait to see it.'' &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The illusion _ or is it delusion? _ of historical re-creation
onstage is being addressed with a number of wise words and deeds.
In Rameau's ``Platee'' at the New York City Opera and Carlo Gozzi's
``Green Bird'' at the Cort Theater, 18th-century theater enters
into heavy negotiation with the present.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Jonathan Miller, the English director, writing in
The New York Review of Books and explaining, among other things,
why Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' is perhaps happier in the
land of Proust than in some medieval ur-German forest of misty
place and date. The Metropolitan Opera, meanwhile, has labored on
with its 13-year-old production of Wagner's ``Ring,'' splendidly
sung and played, and couched, to the consternation of many, in a
misty photo-realism all its own.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller rightly points out, music survives history more easily
than stagecraft does. Theater, dealing with people's lives,
catalogs the events around them, the streets they walk on, the
clothes on their backs and the furniture they sit on. Even when we
reconstruct the facts and the artifacts, the chemistry that binds
all these things together is lost. Shelf life has expired; the
ingredients have become inert.
</P>
<P>
   Music is more primal, more specific than the day to day. Music
is not about what happens to people but about their states of mind
and heart when it is happening. Morals change. Standards of conduct
change. Characters ride horses or drive trucks. But I suspect that
the visceral rushes of pain and pleasure stay pretty much the same,
as constituent parts of an emotional DNA that survives in a
straight line from Adam and Eve to Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   First ``Platee,'' elegantly staged and clothed by the Mark
Morris Dance Group and Isaac Mizrahi, and then ``The Green Bird,''
marvelously reimagined by Julie Taymor, have an advantage over
social melodrama (``La Boheme'') or political activism (``The
Marriage of Figaro''). Rameau's gods and goddesses and Gozzi's
stylized physical comedians and magic tricks occupy made-up worlds
where realism is in the eyes of beholders, be they Baroque or
space-age. Because everything is imaginary, the room to maneuver
widens.
</P>
<P>
   If Taymor's Truffaldino and Smeraldina had lived in Gozzi's
Rome, I suspect they would have been very like the Brooklyn sausage
vendors she has made of them. Comedy is by nature topical. The
topics change in 250 years, so the comedy must, too. One of the
minor tragedies for opera today is Mozart's ``Abduction From the
Seraglio,'' which is filled with glorious music and lamed by period
humor that seems inextricable from the plot and simply isn't funny
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The principles of exaggeration and absurdity endure, but comedy
must be made exaggerated and absurd for a whole new set of people.
The Marx Brothers are our commedia dell'arte. The accents change,
and the wisecrack is introduced. The racetrack, the ocean liner and
the college campus become the streets of Rome or the Italian
countryside. But exchanging one set of props for another is not as
easy as it sounds. Required is not the literal equation but an
instinctive knack, a sense of taste and judgment that an enterprise
has or hasn't. We can be thankful that Taymor has it all the time,
and Morris and Mizrahi almost always.
</P>
<P>
   What helps both Rameau and Gozzi toward 21st-century success are
the blurrings between old and new. The Shakespearean diction of
Taymor's King (Derek Smith) tunes into and out of neurotic Upper
East Side New Yorkese. The pear-shaped vowels of Brighella (Reg E.
Cathey) lapse happily into Jamaican street slang. Morris' dancers
whirl balletically one moment and take the disco floor the next. In
both events, old and new are thrown into the same pot and made to
swim together. It is an excellent idea, this sweet-and-sour mix;
the recipe sounds easy, too, but the doing is again dependent on
the taste and judgment of whoever is doing the throwing.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacle to most updates of old stage pieces is the simile,
or if you like, the metaphor. The 18th century is reborn in
21st-century form, and you are invited to see how the details match
up. But three is a crowd. Simile descends on words and music like a
mother-in-law on a newlywed's household. That Susanna's servant
quarters are like a maid's room in Trump Tower or that Wotan and
company are Ruhr Valley industrialists makes interesting
sociological fodder, but it gets in the way.
</P>
<P>
   A retailer has been interposed between theatrical message and
audience reception. To pass from one to the other now requires a
translation. The listener must stop and think, ``This really means
that.'' In ``Figaro,'' Mozart wants Susanna to go straight to your
heart. The update insists first that you get the joke it is making.
Make the metaphor as cunning as you will _ line up 18th with 21st
century precisely _ and still the added transaction deflects the
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pelleas'' has an easier time, but for another reason. The
opera's methodology is imprecision itself, leaving the facts to
fade and the heart and mind behind the facts to take precedence.
Maeterlinck's characters wander like sleepwalkers. They (and often
the audience) have only vague ideas of where they have come from or
what their destination will be. If the Met ``Ring'' sees ancient
castles and murky forests through Wagner's 19th-century eyes,
Miller's production hears in Debussy's music the exquisite
melancholy and discreet repression of the composer's own France.
Both ways lay claim to authenticity.

THE BRITISH ACTORS ARE COMING IN PACKS

 (Attn: Britain)  (For release Sunday, May 14) (Editors: See also
PENRY-JONES-THEATER) 
 By MATT WOLF  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For a while they came in pairs, as if progressing
toward some unseen thespian ark: Daniel Day-Lewis and Kenneth
Branagh, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth, Ralph Fiennes and Hugh Grant,
Joseph Fiennes and Jude Law. Every couple of years, Britain offered
up another incipient movie star or two, and an Anglophilic American
public responded enthusiastically. Often starting as ensemble
players at London's fringe and state-financed theaters, they would
emerge out of that egalitarian climate, with its deliberately
alphabetical billing, and go on to leave movie audiences weak at
the knees _ and asking one question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know who the latest one is,'' said James
Frain, the 32-year-old Englishman who plays Natalie Portman's
American boyfriend in the new film ``Where the Heart Is.''
Referring to the current appetite abroad for his own countrymen,
Frain added, somewhat wryly, ``Hollywood is a very impatient
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once international stardom was the preserve of a lucky few
_ Olivier or Burton, Finney or Hopkins or O'Toole _ these days
everyone wants in on the act. The result is a new generation of
Britboys, many of them still sufficiently unknown that you might
spot them on the London subway. But you'd better look fast before
they enter the land of the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between this latest crop and previous ones lies
not in quality but in numbers: instead of pairs, think clusters;
no, better yet, packs. Britpacks. However invidious it may be to
name names, it's hard to resist the temptation. Dominic West, Jason
Isaacs, Dougray Scott, Ioan Gruffudd, Daniel Craig and Kevin McKidd
as well as Frain. To which one could just as easily add Rupert
Penry-Jones, Ben Chaplin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ed Stoppard, James
Purefoy and Paul Bettany. Not to mention Christian Bale, although
his revelatory performance in ``American Psycho'' sets him apart.
For the moment, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good actors over here,'' said Jason Isaacs,
a relative unknown whose glistening eyes could become identifiable
catalysts for fear once ``The Patriot,'' in which he stars, opens
on June 30. The film is a Hollywood period epic set during the
Revolutionary War in which Isaacs plays a British colonel who
becomes the relentless nemesis of Mel Gibson's American rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from a 40-minute teaser for the movie, one gets the
impression that screen evil may not have reached quite such
well-spoken proportions since Ralph Fiennes delivered his
career-making performance in the 1993 film ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever seen anybody as evil as I am,'' said
Isaacs, who in conversation couldn't be warmer or more open. (About
everything, that is, except his age. ``I'm as old as you need me to
be,'' he told a reporter, admitting only to being ``in my 30s.'')
``I kill everything in my path,'' he added. ``I think I cross every
boundary known to man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now on location filming yet another American movie, ``Sweet
November,'' directed by Pat O'Connor and starring Keanu Reeves and
Charlize Theron, Isaacs seems to have crossed that most important
boundary: a role to lift a good company player, of which Britain
boasts literally hundreds, into the next echelon of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Isaacs headed out to the San Francisco set
of ``Sweet November'' earlier this month immediately after
completing a run in a London play. In Gary Mitchell's ``Force of
Change,'' at the Royal Court's Jerwood Theater Upstairs, Isaacs
earned warm reviews _ and $400 a week _ for adopting a Belfast
accent to play a member of that city's Royal Ulster Constabulary.
Seventy-two people saw the show at each sold-out performance,
resulting in a smaller audience throughout the run than might see
one day's screenings of ``The Patriot'' at the average multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Joseph Fiennes went from his own Royal Court play,
``Real Classy Affair,'' by Nick Grosso (the fellow Britboy Nick
Moran, from ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' appeared with
him), to film renown in 1998 courtesy of ``Shakespeare in Love.''
``For a lot of British actors, the theater is home,'' Fiennes said.
``It's what they did before you knew them, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   Frain, for instance, completed his own Royal Court play,
Christopher Shinn's ``Other People,'' earlier this year before
heading back to Los Angeles, his second home of late. But despite
appearing in ``Reindeer Games,'' ``Titus'' and ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' he still manages to avoid many of the annoyances that
accompany celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get recognized, which is fantastic,'' said Frain, who
will next be seen in the Istvan Szabo film ``Sunshine'' with Ralph
Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Dominic West, 30, currently on view as Sandra
Bullock's charming if dangerous boyfriend in ``28 Days.'' (The role
perpetuates the image of the Briton as lethal seducer fondly
remembered from, among others, Jeremy Northam in the 1995 Bullock
film ``The Web.'') But keen London theatergoers in 1997 could have
seen West in a variety of roles at the Old Vic Theater as part of
the director Peter Hall's repertory season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People regenerate or rejuvenate themselves in theater,'' said
Ismail Merchant, the producer who over the years has given early
employment to British actors like Hugh Grant, James Wilby and
Rupert Graves _ all alumni of the Merchant-Ivory movie ``Maurice''
in 1987 _ as well as Ben Chaplin and James Purefoy, both of whom
appeared in the 1995 ``Feast of July.'' ``Theater gives these
actors a boost,'' said Merchant, whose latest film, ``The Golden
Bowl,'' stars Northam, part of a previous crop of British talent,,
``and then Hollywood is eager to devour them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McKidd, 26, first came to attention in ``Small Faces'' and
``Trainspotting,'' both set in his native Scotland, and appeared
last year in the American director Rose Troche's ``Bedrooms and
Hallways,'' playing a bisexual Londoner. In an interview, McKidd,
who made his American stage debut last year at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music in the Racine play ``Britannicus,'' agreed with Merchant:
``You have to go back to the theater just to check in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the theater, he added, you can get feedback: ``You want to
feel what the audience is feeling. If you don't, you start to lose
a bit of the skill.''
</P>
<P>
   McKidd's most recent stage appearance, last fall, was in a
London revival of `` 'Tis Pity She's a Whore,'' the bloodthirsty
Jacobean drama by John Ford. Leading that production was Jude Law,
just before his role in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' brought him an
Oscar nomination and a British Academy Award, raising his movie fee
to what is said to be the $5 million level.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Brits just better? They're certainly better schooled
in the craft, which in turn opens up broader career possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they're so used,'' said the director Mary Harron,
who put Bale, 26, a Welshman, at the murderous center of ``American
Psycho.'' ``These guys are really character actors, whether they're
good-looking or not. I don't think you would ever go see a
Christian Bale performance the way you would, say, a Ben Affleck
performance.''

LONDON: Affleck performance.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She elaborated on the point: ``I like Ben Affleck, but I
wouldn't cast him in anything that involved total transformation.
American acting is very, very personality-based.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where training comes in, even if Bale is one of the few
to have learned the acting trade on the job, not at a drama
academy. (He was barely a teen-ager when he played the well-bred
English boy interned in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Steven
Spielberg's 1987 film, ``Empire of the Sun.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often,'' said Ellis Jones, vice principal of the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art, the prestigious London drama school,
``right from the first audition, you think, `OK, fine; all we've
got to do is get the actor to speak properly and point him at the
casting director.' There are a lot of very strong young males
coming through at the moment. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Jones cites Geoffrey Streatfeild (pronounced
STRET-field), a name that is admittedly hard to forget.
Streatfeild, 25, was plucked from the academy's three-year program
early to start filming a television movie, ``Sword of Honor,''
based on the Evelyn Waugh trilogy, for Channel 4. The film's
producer, Gillian McNeill, spotted Streatfeild in a student
production of the 18th-century British comedy ``The School for
Scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spoiled a little bit in the U.K.,'' said McNeill, whose
television film stars Daniel Craig, yet another Britboy several
years older than Streatfeild. ( Craig played Derek Jacobi's young
lover in the recent film ``Love Is the Devil,'' about Francis
Bacon.) ``There's such a lot of good talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with that talent, fortuitously, comes an ever-expanding
film market, with the result that the two feed off each other.
``It's a result of the widening global marketplace,'' said Debra
Zane, an independent casting director in Los Angeles, whose resume
includes casting a then barely known Ben Chaplin opposite Uma
Thurman in ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs'' in 1996. (More
recently, she worked on ``American Beauty'' and ``Galaxy Quest,''
while Chaplin went on to ``The Thin Red Line,'' among other films.)
</P>
<P>
   Americans remain fascinated with all things British, which can
translate to mean classy and even exotic. ``Producers certainly are
intrigued by English talent,'' said Zane, ``and they always want to
find that fresh face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're slowly developing a worldwide appeal now,'' said
Gruffudd, 26, the Welshman who has progressed from rescuing Kate
Winslet in ``Titanic'' to supporting Glenn Close in the forthcoming
Disney film ``102 Dalmatians.'' (As it happens, Gruffudd's
flatmate, his fellow Welshman Matthew Rhys, is now playing Benjamin
Braddock to Kathleen Turner's Robinson in a West End version of
``The Graduate.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you turn, there's another British actor,'' said
Isaacs of ``The Patriot.'' ``There are loads of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest any performer lose heart amid the apparent onslaught,
Isaacs offers words of solace. ``Just when somebody thinks they've
been left behind because all their peers have made it,'' he said,
``that's when that one makes it.'' &QL;

&HT;     TEENAGERS DISCOVER FAME ISN'T SO BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATTHEW YI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ High school reporters Megan Greenwell and
Iliana Montauk are finding the price of fame isn't as bad as they
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been highly sought by newspapers and magazines for
interviews since The San Francisco Examiner published a story about
how the students first reported part of a bizarre tale that led to
the federal indictment of a prominent East Bay landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the girls and their parents are in exclusive negotiations
with a Southern California movie production company that's offering
$50,000 for the rights to the story.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers' article stems from the carbon monoxide poisoning
death of an Indian girl who was found unconscious along with her
younger sister in their downtown Berkeley apartment last November.
</P>
<P>
   While most San Francisco area media outlets reported the
incident as a tragic death of a recent immigrant, Greenwell, 16,
and Montauk, 17, wrote a piece questioning why the victims had
never been enrolled at Berkeley High School and including
allegations of possible indentured servitude.
</P>
<P>
   The article appeared in the Dec. 10 issue of the students'
bi-weekly high school newspaper, the Jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The story went unnoticed until The Examiner reported the arrest
of Lakireddy Bali Reddy, 62, in January and followed up with a
story about the Berkeley High article.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Reddy's arrest, authorities alleged that the real
estate tycoon had illegally brought immigrants into the United
States from his home village of Velvadam in south India.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers charge that Reddy also smuggled the two carbon
monoxide poisoning victims and their roommate into the United
States so he could have sex with them.
</P>
<P>
   The fantastic case has forever changed the lives of those
involved, starting with Reddy, who owns more than 1,100 apartments
in the East Bay, and the budding journalists Greenwell and Montauk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, a part of me is like, `This is cool, I'm going to
be in a movie,''' Greenwell said. ``But more realistically, I think
it's a real good idea, because what everybody has said is that they
want an inspiring movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've been talking about is that usually teens get
(media attention) because they commit crimes. So, I think if (our
movie) can show teenagers in a positive way, it'll be really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Montauk added that another motivation to make this movie was to
get the message out about the plight of recent immigrants who came
to the United States with hopes of bettering their lives, but often
ended up victims of unfair labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   In the case against Reddy, the businessman also is accused of
giving little or no pay to employees at his Berkeley realty office
and Indian restaurant, Pasand Madras Cuisine, often only offering
food and board in exchange for their service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to the (movie production) people who have come
up, about specific concerns, which are the issues of indentured
servitude and poverty, and whether they will be explained
in-depth,'' Montauk said.
</P>
<P>
   A part of this conviction stems from the girls' earlier dealings
with reporters who wanted a piece of their story.
</P>
<P>
   They received calls from magazines like People, Glamour, YM and
even the infamous tabloid the National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in the first week of the story ... `sex slaves'
(and) the `multimillionaire' were the key phrases repeated over and
over. When we got into it, it was `cute little girls discover sex
slave ring (run by) a multimillionaire,''' Greenwell said. ``We
were kind of going like, `That's not how it happened.' First of
all, we didn't write anything about sex slaves. Nobody seems to get
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reddy's sex allegations had come to light only when he was
arrested in January.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been upsides to the attention as well, including
numerous calls about movie deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point we realized that we had to actually get together
and talk about this,'' said Iliana's father, Lance Montauk. ``We
discussed basically whether our lives will be ruined by
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   After a breakfast meeting between the two families and the
Jacket's advisor, Rick Ayers, everyone gave the green light to
pursue a movie deal.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, representatives of three separate production
companies flew up to meet with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Montauk, who is brokering the deal, said three companies _
Studio City-based Longbow Productions in Los Angeles County,
Burbank-based Green and Epstein, and DeeGee Productions, which has
offices in Los Angeles and Chicago _ had offered money.
</P>
<P>
   The families have decided to exclusively negotiate with Longbow
and will most likely get $50,000 if the deal goes through, Lance
Montauk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are (the girls) taking advantage of the situation? Sure,
they're taking advantage of it,'' said Megan's father, Jim
Greenwell. ``But they're also talking about some sort of mechanism
to help the family of the girl who died.''
</P>
<P>
   The details haven't been worked out, but the students say
they're considering splitting the money into thirds. Greenwell and
Montauk would each keep a third, with the remainder going to the
surviving carbon monoxide victim and her family in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we felt was that we can buy our way out of the moral
dilemma and help (the victims) out with finances,'' Lance Montauk
said, explaining that the families at first were uncomfortable
about making money from the plight of the Indian victims.

 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When my wife gave birth to our sixth child, I was as truly happy
as any man could be. As an American Jew, I had always felt that I
should have at least six children _ one for each 1 million of the 6
million Jews who were killed during World War II.
 &HT;    Even though I was as pleased as any father could be, I learned
that some of our friends felt differently. They claimed that a
large family deprived children of love and education. Somehow, I
felt they had missed the boat.
 &HT;    Sure, bringing children into the world is a great
responsibility, but then responsible people have all the more
reason to have children.
 &HT;    There are those who base their decision to limit the size of
their family on thoughtful research, but questionable judgment.
They anticipate having a family with apprehension, as though a
child were a liability. But, in fact, each child is an asset.
 &HT;    It is well-documented that Jews educate their children at an
early age. Children are introduced to prayer as soon as they can
talk. Reading and writing are considered a basic necessity that
must be provided to each child. It is for that reason Jews have
been called, ``the children of the book.''
 &HT;    If anything, though, we ought to be concerned with the education
of all children and increasing the quality of their family
dynamics.
 &HT;    I recently experienced a strange situation. With Mother's Day a
few weeks off, I was feeling very grateful to my wife for giving me
a loving home and six children. I know how hard she works to
provide the family atmosphere we enjoy.
 &HT;    To show my affection and appreciation I decided to give her some
perfume.
 &HT;    I found myself in a department store overwhelmed by the various
perfume displays. A pleasant sales clerk asked me if I needed some
help. After explaining that the perfume was a gift for my wife, she
asked what I had done to necessitate the gift.
 &HT;    I was so taken aback that I laughed. It seems that people only
buy perfume when they have done something improper.
 &HT;    ``Look,'' I said, ``I love my wife and just want to buy her a
gift, no more, no less. She has given me six great children.''
 &HT;    The sales clerk related our conversation to her co-workers, who
told me that I was quite a fellow. Embarrassed, I wondered what was
so incredible about this simple act?
 &HT;    It must reflect the fact that we have lost the value system of
the family structure. There was a time when some unmarried men and
women wanted a sexual encounter without the consequence of
children: love and intimacy with neither marriage nor children.
Now, some women want children without love or marriage.
 &HT;    Maybe it should have been no surprise that I looked like ``such
a guy'' for wanting to buy my wife a gift even though there was no
special reason.
 &HT;    So this year on Mother's Day, I will enjoy the blessings of my
loving wife and my wonderful children, my assets. I hope my old
friends will experience even a fraction of that joy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Guests from Oklahoma, help me.
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand some foods.
</P>
<P>
   Say, Oklahoma barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The beef is sliced thin, as in Kansas City. The sauce is thick,
as in parts of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There's a ``hot'' barbecue sauce, as in the South.
</P>
<P>
   There's pork. It's also sliced thin, so it's almost exactly like
the beef. There's no sweet pork sauce or rib sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Sausage? It's hit-and-miss _ nowhere near as good as the
masterful homemade sausage of Central Texas, but better than the
wretched links served in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And what's up with all the curly fries?
</P>
<P>
   The best barbecue I've found in Oklahoma is still the pork rib
dinner at Unka Pete's BBQ in Caddo, just past Lake Texoma two hours
north of Fort Worth and Arlington. That's because owner Robert
``Unka Pete'' Jones' thick ribs are closer to familiar Texas
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I dined at two legendary Sooner State barbecue restaurants one
recent weekend. One was a winner. The other left me wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Van's Pig Stand in Shawnee and Norman, Okla., was the winner
last weekend. Van's celebrates 70 years June 5, so it's Oklahoma's
oldest barbecue restaurant still in the founding family. (Texas'
oldest opened in 1927: Riscky's BBQ in Fort Worth.)
</P>
<P>
   Van's serves smoky beef, mild pork, exceptional sausage and hot
links. The dining room is lined with hilarious old pictures,
including 70 years' worth of cheerleaders for the Shawnee High
School Wolves.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Oklahoma City, Jake's Ribs in Chickasha
draws much larger crowds and serves much larger portions _ but not
better food.
</P>
<P>
   Jake's is definitely a bargain. One side order of curly fries
filled a large platter _ and stacked 4 inches deep. The combination
barbecue platter could easily have fed three people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pork ribs were very ordinary by Texas standards, the
thin-sliced meats lacked much flavor, and the sausage tasted as if
it had only paused briefly in the hickory pit.

SIERRA RELEASES TWO NEW HOYLE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crossword puzzles, like solitaire games, are one of the
real-life things that easily make the transition to computer
screens. It's easier to backspace over a mistake on a computer than
it is to erase on paper _ and sometimes, the computer will give you
help with a word.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle Crosswords from Sierra Attractions (Windows, Macintosh;
about $20) has 500 crossword puzzles. They can be worked on the
computer screen, or printed out for completing later (or working
both on and off the computer).
</P>
<P>
   There are five levels of difficulty for the puzzles. And plenty
of help is available if needed. The computer will provide hints for
harder words. Also available: Webster's New World College
Dictionary, Fourth Edition. Using it, players can search for words
or for definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Crosswords can be used by one player, or two can play using the
same computer. Players may also play over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   An option allows users to install the game completely on the
hard drive so there's no need to find the disk when running the
game. That's also a nice feature for laptop users.
</P>
<P>
   Backgrounds and music for the puzzles can also be customized.
</P>
<P>
   The CD is one of two new introductions in the Hoyle series. The
other offers variations on two classic games: Hoyle Solitaire and
Mahjong Tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The disk (Windows, Macintosh; about $20) has 50 solitaire games
including: Forty Thieves, Spider, Klondike and Pyramid. It also has
new, video-arcade solitaire games (Fast 21 and Three Towers).
Players of past Hoyle card games will find larger cards with bigger
numbers in this release.
</P>
<P>
   The CD also has classic mahjong tiles. They're used in the game
where players try to find matching tiles in order to remove them
from a layout and win the game. There are more than 60 layouts on
the CD.
</P>
<P>
   New to this version: Memory Tiles and Gravity Tiles. The first
game lets players try to find matching pairs in the least amount of
time; the second has tiles stacked in columns for players to
remove.
</P>
<P>
   Players can compete with friends, play over the Internet, and
make their own layouts.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the company's Web site: www.sierra.com/
attractions.

 &HT;    LONDON'S NEW TATE MODERN SET TO OPEN
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<P>
   LONDON _ A 50-year-old power station on the banks of the River
Thames will be reborn Thursday as the Tate Modern, the world's
largest museum devoted to 20th Century art.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled the ``Cathedral of Cool'' by London newspapers, the new
gallery will display more than 600 works in the cavernous red brick
building across the river from St. Paul's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The vast post-war structure was designed by famed British
architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who also designed London's
familiar red telephone boxes. The old plant has been revived in a
US$205 million reconstruction designed by Swiss architects Jacques
Herzog and Pierre de Meuron.
</P>
<P>
   The designers retained the shell of the power station with its
towering central chimney. It dwarfs its neighbor, the reconstructed
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be opened officially by Queen Elizabeth Thursday
with a celebrity-packed party to follow in the evening. The guest
list includes such art denizens as Madonna, Cher, Mick Jagger and
Jerry Hall. Black market tickets to the party are going for 1,000
pounds (about US$1,600).
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, the Tate Modern opens for free on Friday and
thereafter, as public art museums in Britain generally do not
charge for admission.
</P>
<P>
   The old Tate, about a quarter the size of the new museum _ which
used to house the nation's largest modern collection _ has been
reshaped into a gallery of British art.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking innovative ways to display the eclectic collection, the
Tate Modern's curators have organized the artwork into four
categories: Landscape/Matter/Environment; Nude/Action/Body; Still
Life/Object/Real Life; and History/Memory/Society. All the great
names of the 20th century from Picasso to Matisse to Pollock to
Mondrian, are present.
</P>
<P>
   The size and scope of the museum and its arrival in a city as
culturally important as London have forced comparisons with the
other important 20th century art museums, the Pompidou in Paris and
Museum of Modern Art in New York _ both of which are much smaller
than the Tate Modern.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the reviews have been mixed, but the critics have found
consensus in their expressions of awe at the size of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, the size of it,'' wrote Tom Lubbock for the The
Independent. ``Whatever the Tate Modern may be, it's more than just
a gallery. It is an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times wrote with some distaste
that he wasn't sure that bigger meant better. ``The Tate is in part
a temple to vanity, the vanity of a culture that equates spectacle
with substance, with half the building devoted to a vast
entranceway, the museum's deeply gloomy signature space _ and with
an installation that is occasionally eccentric to the point of
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors unencumbered by a critic's erudition, may find the
place an entertaining stew of visual and sensory experiences. The
vast turbine hall, which is 600 feet long and 12 stories high, is
fitted with massive sculptures, including a giant steel spider.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries are simple and functional and offer surprises at
many turns. One moment you are plunged into a blacked-out video
installation, the next you find yourself taking in a view of the
river and city during one of the occasional gaps between galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Enter another room and see Monet's elegant water lilies
competing for your attention with a splattered drawing by Richard
Long. In one room, there's a portrait of a glass of water that
imagines itself to be an oak tree alongside a painting of a glass
on a table and a drawing of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Searle of The Guardian also was troubled a bit by the
sometimes odd arrangement of works, but not enough to dampen his
enthusiasm for the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The display, flawed and problematic as it is, reminds us that
modern art is still an experiment rather than a linear progression
of indisputable masterpieces,'' he wrote. ``This is great.''

 &HT;    LONDON'S NEW TATE MODERN SET TO OPEN

<P>
   LONDON _ A 50-year-old power station on the banks of the River
Thames will be reborn Thursday as the Tate Modern, the world's
largest museum devoted to 20th Century art.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled the ``Cathedral of Cool'' by London newspapers, the new
gallery will display more than 600 works in the cavernous red brick
building across the river from St. Paul's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The vast post-war structure was designed by famed British
architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who also designed London's
familiar red telephone boxes. The old plant has been revived in a
US$205 million reconstruction designed by Swiss architects Jacques
Herzog and Pierre de Meuron.
</P>
<P>
   The designers retained the shell of the power station with its
towering central chimney. It dwarfs its neighbor, the reconstructed
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be opened officially by Queen Elizabeth Thursday
with a celebrity-packed party to follow in the evening. The guest
list includes such art denizens as Madonna, Cher, Mick Jagger and
Jerry Hall. Black market tickets to the party are going for 1,000
pounds (about US$1,600).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever it is humanly possible, Hank Citron, a retired history
professor, checks his stocks.
</P>
<P>
   During trading hours in the ``war room,'' as he calls his
second-floor study in suburban Englewood, N.J., where his computer
is always online to Morgan Stanley and his television is always
tuned to CNBC, he checks his stocks every 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When stock-checking conditions are more challenging, Citron, 63,
improvises. At his dentist's office last week, he spied a secretary
heading to lunch and jumped behind her desk. Commandeering her Web
browser, he punched in his password and found out precisely how
much his portfolio was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Citron's finest moment in obsessive stock monitoring took place
in March while he and his wife, Rebecca, were on vacation in
Israel. Using the Internet, he had prepared for the trip by
locating every cybercafe in every town along the route he planned
to travel.
</P>
<P>
   When his shares in a biotech called Oxigene surged, Citron was
ready. He popped into Billy's cybercafe in Netanya and pulled the
trigger. He sold all 500 of his shares for a 107 percent profit on
a $6,000 investment. The stock plunged a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   As Bob Dylan might sing it, if he were addicted to CNBC and
checked his stocks every 10 minutes, the golden years they are
a-changin'.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Citron is part of what investment managers and online
analysts say is a growing compulsion by many older investors to
follow the daily _ even the minute-to-minute _ fluctuations of the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   With plenty of time to worry about how their money is doing and
with less time in their lives to recover from major investment
mistakes, older investors are becoming increasingly agitated as
market volatility insinuates itself into their daily lives, several
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most investors 55 and older remain significantly
more averse to risk than younger investors, analysts say that many
older investors are tantalized to the point of torment by endless
information about the possibility of outsize profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are possessed by this market,'' said Gary
Schatsky, a financial adviser and lawyer in New York who is
chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial
Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a number of financial advisers who deal with jittery
older investors, Schatsky attributed the rising tide of restiveness
to huge high-tech gains in the last two years, the market's sharp
decline this spring, ubiquitous stock coverage on television and
shameless crowing among retirees about their clever stock picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest topics among retired people in recent years
is how well you did in the market,'' Schatsky said. ``The peer
pressure is extraordinary. When they have friends they have known
for 30 years who are making money like it is going out of style,
they figure, I can do this, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatter among retirees about whopping profits disturbs no one
more than Citron's wife, Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``When every little old lady is passing out stock tips is when I
get nervous,'' said Citron, a retired Union Carbide executive.
</P>
<P>
   On a foray into her husband's ``war room,'' as he pedaled a
stationary bike, watched CNBC and chatted happily to a broker about
an initial public offering, Rebecca Citron was at pains to point
out that she makes sure that about three-quarters of her and her
husband's retirement money ``is being professionally managed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What upsets me is that I feel you have to know something about
the company you buy,'' Rebecca Citron said. ``But that is not the
culture of the market these days. The culture of this market is
like the culture of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband readily acknowledges that he does not understand
much about the high-tech companies that dominate his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very thin veneer of knowledge,'' said Citron, who has
a doctorate in history from New York University and retired last
year after 31 years of teaching history at the County College of
Morris in Morris County, N.J. ``The last chip I understood was a
poker chip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citrons, who travel often, are planning another trip. Citron
booked it on the Internet. They plan to take a cruise off the coast
of Greenland and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't check your stocks when we are up there,'' Rebecca
Citron told her husband when he mentioned the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't,'' she said. ``There are no phone lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shocker,'' her husband groaned.
</P>
<P>
   Investors 55 and older spend roughly the same amount of time
online (about 10 hours a week) as younger people, according to
Forrester Research, an online consumer research company in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, you weren't able to see what your money was doing
all day long,'' said Kenneth Clemmer, an analyst at Forrester.
``Now that you've got the Web, you can watch your net worth
fluctuate in real time. Maybe this causes folks to get more edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgy elders, though, are not rushing to trade online. Citron,
who says he trades five times a week when the market is rising, is
a bit of a pioneer for his age. As of January, just 15 percent of
online traders were 55 or older, according to a Forrester survey.
</P>
<P>
   Most older investors, despite being agitated by wall-to-wall
news coverage of the market, remain tentative when it comes to
trading. They are more diversified in their stock holdings and more
likely to hold cash than younger investors, according to an
investor profile study conducted last year by Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much the trading that is causing the nervousness,
it's the information,'' Clemmer said. ``Older investors use the
Internet to study their investments and to fret.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Altfest, a financial planner in Manhattan, was flooded
last year by calls from fretful older investors. Until the phone
started ringing, she had been convinced that the Internet would
never be a factor in the financial lives of her older clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really wrong about this,'' Altfest said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Bauman, 56, an artist whose paintings are often exhibited
at the Vered Galley in East Hampton, N.Y., turns on CNBC when the
markets open and watches it until well after the trading day ends.
</P>
<P>
   While monitoring the television, she pores through The Wall
Street Journal, The Financial Times, The New York Times and The
International Herald Tribune. On her bedside table, where she used
to keep Marcel Proust's ``Remembrance of Things Past,'' there is
now a stack of financial magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman's stock market mania is something she had never thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not interested in money,'' said Bauman, who lives in
Southold, on the North Fork of Long Island. ``When I sold a
painting, I used to give the money to my mother. She would put it
into something, a mutual fund, I guess, and when I needed my money,
she would give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in February, after her boyfriend came into a sizable
inheritance, they began plotting how to get in on the phenomenal
returns that they had been hearing about in high technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said don't overweight in tech,'' she recalled. ``But
we were pretty stubborn. We put it all in tech.''
</P>
<P>
   They invested nearly all their money in technology-heavy mutual
funds in March and watched in April while those funds, as Bauman
put it, ``got totally hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the minus column now,'' she said, laughing. ``I
guess I am laughing because of my artistic nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the losses, which she expects to be temporary, Bauman
insisted that she enjoys playing the stock market as much as she
enjoys painting, if not more.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is like a living work of art,'' she said. ``It has
all the forces of nature: expansion, contraction, rising, falling,
conflict and concordance. It's just so alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Altfest, 89, is a buy-and-hold kind of guy. That does not
mean he does not worry.
</P>
<P>
   To inform his worry, he sits in a leather recliner and watches
CNBC for about seven hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has given everything else up,'' said his wife, Ruth.
``That's all he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he retired, Altfest, whose daughter-in-law is the
Manhattan financial consultant, ran a wholesale meat company in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, when I was working, I didn't watch the stock
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He retired 22 years ago and moved to Plantation, Fla., where he
played golf nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, when I was playing golf, I didn't have time for the
stock market,'' he said.

UNILEVER EARNINGS JUMP 12 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Unilever (UL:NYSE ADR), the British-Dutch consumer goods giant,
reported a 12 percent jump in its first-quarter earnings Wednesday
as the company's restructuring efforts helped to lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, whose products include Lipton teas and Dove skin-care
products, said its net profit, excluding exceptional items, rose to
716 million euros ($659 million), or 0.71 euro a share, from 640
million euros, or 0.57 euro a share, in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose a modest 1 percent, to 9.69 billion euros from 9.64
billion euros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy of focusing resources on leading brands is on
track,'' Unilever Chairman Niall FitzGerald said in a statement.
``We are managing the migration to a faster-growth portfolio
without endangering our profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever is currently in the process of divesting its
nonstrategic holdings while acquiring companies seen as capable of
contributing to long-term growth. Unilever recently agreed to
acquire SlimFast Foods and Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade (BJICA:NASDAQ)
for a total of about $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Unilever's 400 leading brands grew over 3 percent in
the quarter even as sales in Europe, the company's largest region,
slipped 3 percent. Operating profit, however, rose 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose by 3 percent in North America, the company's second
biggest region, and by 9 percent in the Asia and Pacific region.
Operating profits were up 17 percent in North America and 41
percent in the Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever's ADRs were up 7/8, or 4 percent, to 25 3/8 in early
trading Wednesday.

U.N. PEACEKEEPERS PREPARE FOR CLASHES WITH REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With its political options running out, the
U.N. mission in Sierra Leone deployed its peacekeepers Wednesday in
anticipation of a clash with rebel fighters advancing toward the
capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what we have to do to defend ourselves and the
government,'' the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said Wednesday.
``We hope it won't come to a pitched battle, but we are preparing
for one.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peacekeepers had been pulled back around Freetown
and were digging in at the entrances to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   With the West African country sliding back into war, Eckhard
also said the United Nations would no longer report the movements
of its troops or clashes with the rebels, who are already engaged
against government forces.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of refugees streamed toward Freetown, fleeing the
fresh fighting between the government and the rebels, some
representatives of U.N. aid agencies set out from the capital to
determine the size of the influx of refugees and how much food and
water would be needed to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters, officials met with diplomats from Jordan,
India and Bangladesh who have agreed to speed up the delivery of
new infantry battalions committed to the peacekeeping mission. The
United States, Russia, Canada and the Netherlands have also offered
to provide air transportation for the reinforcements into Sierra
Leone. The arrival of the new troops would increase the mission's
military strength to 11,700 soldiers from the current 8,936. But
U.N. officials said the airlifts would not begin for at least
another 10 days because it was unclear how much equipment the
reinforcements would bring.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard pointed out that the lightly armed peacekeepers now in
Sierra Leone were not configured or equipped for conventional
combat, a role that they were nonetheless preparing to assume.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council met Wednesday in a closed session, and
Sierra Leone was on its agenda. But the council adjourned without
any comment on the deteriorating situation there.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the peacekeeping mission approaching the brink of collapse,
U.N. officials admitted that they still knew little or nothing
about the whereabouts and condition of the more than 500
peacekeeping troops who have been seized and disarmed by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   One captured detachment of 200 Zambian soldiers was reported to
have been moved to Koidu, a rebel stronghold in eastern Sierra
Leone. There was still no word on the fate of a second group of 200
Zambians who were also reported to have been detained. Attempts to
deliver food and other supplies to the captured peacekeepers have
largely failed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials confirmed Wednesday that 13 armored personnel
carriers seized a week ago from the Zambians had been painted black
and were apparently being used by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front, as the rebels call themselves,
has made no demands for the return of the captured peacekeepers,
leading U.N. officials to describe them as detainees rather than
hostages. The rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, initially denied holding
the peacekeepers, and his disappearance on Monday has left the
United Nations with no way to negotiate for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations had been counting on a meeting of nine
regional African leaders on Tuesday in the Nigerian capital of
Abuja to help advance a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the nine leaders condemned the Revolutionary
United Front for taking U.N. peacekeepers hostage and called for
their immediate and unconditional release. They also warned that
the amnesty against prosecution granted to Sankoh and other leaders
when they signed the peace treaty last July could be revoked and
that the rebels could be tried for war crimes. The rebels gained
notoriety during the eight-year civil war for mutilating civilians
and lopping off hands, arms and feet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The regional leaders also promised to use ``all means at their
disposal, including the military option'' to prevent the rebels
from taking over Sierra Leone. But they stopped short of offering
immediate help to the beleaguered U.N. troops, saying that their
defense ministers and chiefs of staff would meet next Wednesday to
consider ``the practical modalities'' of reviving the West African
intervention force that had battled the rebels earlier, opening the
way to the peace treaty signed last year between the government and
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan considered the Abuja
communique ``useful and positive,'' Eckhard said, but added that
U.N. officials would have no comment on its details until they had
studied it further.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chaos, U.N. officials refused to admit that the
peacekeeping mission to Sierra Leone had failed. ``For as long as
it's possible, we're going to hang in there and try to revive this
peace process,'' Eckhard said.

BEER'S CLAIM TO FAME IS A WEAK ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Famosa is a beer that easily could be mistaken for something
made in Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, but it (the beer) is
produced in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   In Central America it is known as Gallo, and the label includes
an image of what looks like a chicken, but it (the bird) is
supposed to be a quetzal, the national bird of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo is the bestselling beer in Guatemala, or so says
Cerveceria Centro Americanea, the Guatemala City brewer. But when
it came time to export, the brewery found that a well-known
California winery already had dibs on Gallo, so the bottles
exported to the United States carry the label Famosa, or
``famous.'' It still has the bird picture.
</P>
<P>
   Now this beer may be famous in Guatemala, but Famosa or Gallo is
a highly ordinary beer. It is very drinkable, with a hoppiness
reminiscent of Budweiser, but it is undistinguished.
</P>
<P>
   It has a good color and head and a pleasing aroma. I found the
finish a tad metallic, but the same is true of Budweiser, which
tastes very similar. So why bother? Just get a Bud; it's cheaper
and easier to find. Close your eyes and pretend it's Famosa.
</P>
<P>
   If you must, Famosa is found in bars, restaurants and stores in
cities with significant Hispanic populations, in south Florida and
from Texas to California. The company says it's also available in
Oregon, Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Famosa's sister and brother exports include: Dorada Draft (How
can it be draft if it comes in cans and bottles?); Moza, a dark
bock beer; and Monte Carlo Beer, which the company says ``appeals
to the more mature palate with more income.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I've never encounted a palate, mature or immature, that
had any income.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER INCREASES BID FOR CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, prices in last two grafs do not reflect the market close)  
 By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Paper (IP:NYSE) increased its bid, now valued at
$9.5 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt, for rival paper
manufacturer Champion International (CHA:NYSE) on Wednesday, a bid
that Champion has declared ``superior'' to UPM-Kymmene's (UPM:NYSE
ADR) earlier $9.1 billion proposed cash and debt acquisition of
Champion, an increase of 3 percent over the bid agreed upon three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   UPM-Kymmene responded by saying it will ``consider'' the new
situation, noting that it has until Friday at 5:00 p.m. EDT to
submit another proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The new offer from International Paper, the world's largest
producer of paper, values Champion at $75 a share, $50 in cash and
$25 in stock, a 13.1 percent premium to Champion's closing price
Tuesday of 66 5/16. A merger with Champion would give International
Paper a larger share of the growing market for magazine paper and a
stronger foothold in the quickly consolidating paper industry.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper unexpectedly bid $6.2 billion in cash and
stock for Champion at the end of April, in an attempt to thwart
Champion's union with UPM-Kymmene of Finland. UPM-Kymmene's stock
had fallen sharply since the deal was agreed upon in February,
making it less enticing for Champion investors.
</P>
<P>
   If Champion, based in Stamford, Conn., accepts the proposal,
International Paper will make a $75-a-share cash tender offer for
two-thirds of the outstanding Champion shares. Following a merger,
each remaining Champion share will be converted into International
Paper stock with a market value of $75.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Champion shares are trading below $34.50 a share at
the time of the merger, each remaining Champion share would be
converted into 2.17391 International Paper shares.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper expects a merger to result in $425 million
in annual cost savings. The Purchase, N.Y.-based company also said
that a merger should add to its earnings in the first full year
after completion of the deal and over the life of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Back in February, UPM-Kymmene, Europe's second-largest paper
maker, said it would exchange 1.99 of its ordinary shares for each
outstanding share of Champion common stock. At the time, the
exchange ratio represented a premium to Champion shareholders of
about 30 percent over the average ratio of the two stocks during
the past month. The deal then was valued at $8.7 billion in stock
and debt, but is now valued at only $7.9 billion since
UPM-Kymmene's stock has fallen and the euro has lost so much value
against the dollar. The deal represented the industry's first
substantial cross-Atlantic merger.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of International Paper were down 1 1/8, or 3 percent, to
36 1/8 in midday Wednesday trading, while UPM-Kymmene's American
depositary receipts were up 1, or 4 percent, to 29 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Champion were up 5 7/8, or 9 percent, to 72 3/16 in
midday Wednesday trading.

NOW MCCAIN AND BUSH CAN GO ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They looked comfortable together _ about as comfortable as
Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson after the ear-biting incident.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately _ or unfortunately, depending on your point of view
_ George W. Bush and John McCain didn't have to square off in a
boxing ring to settle their differences. In their meeting Tuesday
at a Pittsburgh hotel, in fact, the former rivals for the
Republican presidential nomination evidently avoided fisticuffs and
even name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was followed by a televised display of congeniality
that was every bit as convincing as McCain's insistence that he
holds no ``rancor'' against Bush as a result of the candidates'
no-holds-barred primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   Right. And Monica Lewinsky holds no rancor against Linda Tripp
for taping their telephone conversations and giving the tapes to
Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that McCain is still ticked off about being
rejected by Republican voters from coast to coast _ and that it's
all he can do to speak Bush's name without snarling. Maybe McCain
will stop sulking in time to run for president again in eight years
_ when Bush is finishing up his second term in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that he holds no ``rancor.'' He conspicuously didn't
say that he holds no ``grudge.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is one of the great grudge-holders in big-time politics.
It would be astounding if he harbored no trace of bitterness toward
the man who derailed his Straight Talk Express.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's lingering anger is his problem, not Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee-to-be was no doubt pleased to bury the hatchet. So
much has been made of the smoldering Bush-McCain feud that it had
to be a relief to throw some water on it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's success or failure in the fall election, however, will
not be significantly affected by McCain's support _ any more than
it would have been affected by McCain's lack of support. Forget the
poll that imagines McCain pulling down 23 percent of the vote in a
Bush-Gore-McCain race. McCain isn't running, and even if he were,
he would never command that much support.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever support he might command is not transferable.
McCain backers _ like most voters _ will choose the candidate who
strikes them as best qualified to be commander in chief and best
equipped to deal with the issues and problems they care about.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's endorsement and two bucks would have bought Bush a
pari-mutuel ticket during his visit to the Kentucky Derby on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   It's always helpful when a vanquished opponent decides to come
over to the winning side _ even if he surrenders grudgingly and
with a scowl on his face.
</P>
<P>
   So it was good news when McCain, asked why he hadn't used the
word ``endorsement,'' responded: ``I endorse Gov. Bush, I endorse
Gov. Bush, I endorse Gov. Bush ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even better news was McCain's announcement that he had asked
Bush ``that I not be considered for vice president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   And the best news of all? That came in an exchange between Bush
and a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``Gov. Bush, Sen. McCain said that he didn't want to
be considered. Is that it? Is it over?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``I take him for his word.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now we can put an end to all this mindless chatter about a
Bush-McCain ticket. McCain would be a horrible choice as the
Republican candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, McCain has said time and time again that he
doesn't want to be vice president. For another: Can you imagine
these two guys going through the entire campaign wearing those
pained expressions that we saw during their Pittsburgh news
conference?
</P>
<P>
   Like the reporter said: That's it. It's over.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did his partisan duty by swallowing his pride _ for a
moment, at least _ and endorsing Bush. The media's beloved Sen.
Straight Talk now can get back to doing what he does best:
promoting himself and his ``reform agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush can get down to the task at hand: winning the election.

SABRI TAHIR, 76, CYPRIOT IN DURRELL BOOK, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Sabri Tahir, a colorful Turkish Cypriot
businessman who was renowned for his friendship with the novelist
Lawrence Durrell, was shot dead on Monday afternoon in Cyprus. He
was 76.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said a man shot Tahir several times in his office
at a hotel that he owned in Lefkosa, the main town in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a former bodyguard for Tahir reportedly surrendered to
the police and confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Tahir reportedly spent much of his life at the edge of the law,
and this was not his first encounter with violence.
</P>
<P>
   His only son was stabbed to death in 1981, and he survived a car
bomb attack in 1990, and in 1996 a rival shot him in the leg. He
had used a wheelchair since then.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, Tahir was one of the best-known figures in
northern Cyprus, a modern version of the pirates and other
scoundrels who have played important roles in the island's long
history.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he was mayor of his hometown, Girne, a picturesque
and historic port. Later, he became a hotel owner and tour agency
operator. He was said to have been in other businesses, as well,
not all of them legal.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bitter Lemons of Cyprus,'' Durrell described looking for a
real estate broker and being sent to ``Sabri the Turk'' in Girne,
then known as Kyrenia. The friend who gave him the advice warned
that Tahir was a rogue and ``spread his arms to try to indicate the
full extent of Sabri's roguery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabri Tahir's office in the Turkish quarter of Kyrenia bore a
sun-blistered legend describing him as a valuer and real estate
agent, but his activities had proliferated since the board was
painted, and he was clearly many things besides,'' Durrell wrote.
``The man himself was perhaps 40 years of age, sturdily built, and
with a fine head on his shoulders. He had the sleepy good looks _ a
rare smile with perfect teeth, thoughtful brown eyes _ which one
sees sometimes on Turkish travel posters. But what was truly
Turkish about him was the repose with which he confronted the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen Sabri loading logs, shouting at peasants, even
running down a street; but never has he conveyed the slightest
feeling of energy being expended. His actions and words had the
smoothness of inevitability; they flowed from him like honey from a
spoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obviously endowed with that wonderful Moslem quality
which is called kayf _ the contemplation which comes of silence and
ease. It is not meditation or reverie, which presupposes a
conscious mind relaxing; it is something deeper, a fathomless
repose of the will which does not even pose to itself the question:
`Am I happy or unhappy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tahir, who sometimes used the last name Girneli, meaning from
Girne, was born there on Oct. 27, 1923. Surviving are a sister and
a son-in-law. His daughter died last year.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bitter Lemons,'' Durrell devoted a chapter to Tahir's
mastery of the art of bargaining, as shown by how he negotiated to
buy a house that Durrell wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Tahir waited craftily for the right moment to approach the
owner, shed tears of disbelief when he heard the first asking price
and finally closed the deal by offering to pay in ``notes _ thick
notes, as thick as honeycomb, as thick as salami.''

PETER THOMPSON, 65, AN ACTOR AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Thompson, an actor on stage and in film who
later taught drama for more than 20 years, died on April 24 at New
York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 65 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from heart surgery, said Robert
Cosenza, his companion.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native with boyish good looks, Thompson studied
theater at the University of Oklahoma and later migrated to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   His most fruitful years onstage came in the early 1970s as a
member of the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn. In
three seasons there he played several major roles, including Cassio
in ``Othello,'' with Moses Gunn, which moved to Broadway; and
Bertram in ``All's Well That Ends Well.'' In 1971 he appeared in
O'Neill's ``Mourning Becomes Electra,'' opposite Sada Thompson and
Jane Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   By then Thompson had also begun to dabble in directing, staging
productions like ``Slow Dance on the Killing Ground'' and ``You
Can't Take It With You'' in Atlanta. In 1976 he received favorable
reviews for his direction of ``Lemon Sky,'' by Lanford Wilson, at
the Westside Theater in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   That same year he began teaching acting and scene study at
Michael Howard Studios in Manhattan, where he once trained.
Thompson also taught at the Circle in the Square acting program, in
affiliation with New York University.
</P>
<P>

`BESTSELLER' MAY NOT MEAN WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever been on the fence about a book, and you ultimately
decided to buy it because it had ``National Bestseller'' festooned
across the cover?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you're certainly not alone. As is the case with movies,
word-of-mouth opinion about a book has always carried more weight
for most people than critical reviews, and there's no greater gauge
of a book's mass appeal than the bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Or so you probably thought.
</P>
<P>
   It seems pretty simple to the average consumer: Stores report
book sales, and those books that rang up on the register most often
are the bestsellers. The problem is that bestseller lists don't do
it that way.
</P>
<P>
   From the prestigious New York Times list to the surging USAToday
ranking, in-store book sales are only one of many factors in the
makeup of prominent weekly bestseller lists. And how much of a
factor is known to only the secretive select few who compile them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not reveal our process, though I'll say we factor in
changing conditions in the (book) industry,'' says John Wright,
who's in charge of the list for the New York Times. ``But we
certainly do include actual sales, from about 4,000 bookstores and
wholesalers.''
</P>
<P>
   The complicated formula is used because, at least to publishers,
weekly ``book sales'' figures don't necessarily mean any books have
left the stores. Publishers usually sell their books at radically
discounted prices to wholesalers (also known as ``distributors''),
who resell the books to retailers from Borders to the local
mom-and-pop shop. But bookstores, having bought the books, can
subsequently return unsold copies to publishers for credit on
future book orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a concession bookstores won from publishers in the
early 1960s,'' says Larry Swindell, former books editor of the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram and the Philadelphia Inquirer and a founding
member of the National Book Critics Circle. ``Publishers had found
it increasingly difficult to persuade booksellers to stock titles
that represented high-risk sales.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also when traditional bestseller lists became tainted,
critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the general public think bestseller lists indicate
books sold over the counter in stores to consumers,'' says Michael
Hoynes, marketing director for Book Sense, a subdivision of the
American Booksellers Association. ``But that isn't the case. If,
say, a publisher reports that it sold 2,000 copies of a book to
Distributor X, and that sale of 2,000 is counted in a bestseller
list, in reality, six months later only 1,000 copies might actually
have been sold to consumers, and 1,000 copies will be returned to
the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a problem for weekly list compilers since the
returns system was instituted. Wright says The New York Times has a
``way of factoring in a percentage (of returns),'' though he
acknowledges it's ``not that big a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hoynes is not an objective observer himself. He was
hired by the booksellers association, which represents the
interests of the rapidly dwindling ranks of independently owned
(''nonchain'') bookstores, to develop a bestseller list that would
rival The New York Times and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want another way to indicate to consumers that independent
stores offer different advantages from the chain stores,'' Hoynes
says, citing chain stores' emphasis on big-name writers and major
launches at the expense of releases from smaller publishers and
lesser-known authors. ``Our list, with weekly information gathered
from more than 300 (independent) stores, reports from actual sales
to consumers. Nothing else is in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their inception (The New York Times list debuted in 1935),
bestseller lists have been presented as useful information for
consumers. But, of course, they are also powerful sales tools for
publishers and bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers could use bestseller status to sell more copies of
a book to stores,'' says Swindell, because the bestseller tag often
had a hypnotic effect on book consumers searching for a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, what we care about is what the consumers respond
to,'' says Stuart Applebaum, senior vice president of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the influence The New York Times wielded with its
list, USAToday debuted its own bestseller list in 1993, which
lumped hardcover and paperback titles in one all-encompassing
group. The Wall Street Journal followed in 1994. Both, like the
Times, used private formulas to tabulate rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Now major retailers like Barnes &AMP; Noble have gotten in on the
action, creating bestseller lists based on their own internal sales
figures _ and discounting books that are on their list. Internet
giant Amazon.com ranks about 1.2 million titles in order of its
sales and updates its Top 100 list hourly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no single list satisfies everyone. Christian book
publishers believe they face blatant discrimination, because most
lists either ignore or give little weight to sales from independent
Christian shops, which comprise about one-third of all operating
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is obvious,'' says Rolf Zettersten, publisher of
Nashville, Tennessee-based Thomas Nelson. ``I know we have books
that sell 100,000 copies (in Christian stores) and never show up on
The New York Times bestseller list.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, book club sales are excluded from all the major
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is currently no way of instantaneous tracking of all
sales, like I believe the record industry has with Billboard
(magazine),'' Wright says. ``The book industry is more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no two bestseller lists ever have the same books in
the same order. This is an advantage to publishers, because the
more bestseller lists there are, the better the odds that a book
will rank on at least one of them. And if a title gets on even the
last rung of one of the major lists _ The New York Times, USAToday,
Publishers Weekly, The Wall Street Journal _ publishers can market
it as a bestseller without noting that it perhaps ranked 15th on
one list for one week and never appeared on any others.
</P>
<P>
   Wright even concedes that the mighty New York Times benefits
from distribution and discussion of its bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prestige of it is good for the paper,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One might say the consumer is the only one who doesn't benefit
from the proliferation of bestseller lists, though that wouldn't
quite be true, either. To be sure, it's impossible to figure out
from the bestseller lists which books actually sold the best in any
given week, but book buyers do benefit in that most chain
bookstores offer substantial discounts on titles appearing on the
major lists.
</P>
<P>
   For many bibliophiles, 25 to 40 percent off is worth a little
confusion.

LEWIS ALLEN, 94, DIRECTOR WHOSE FILMS INCLUDED `THE UNINVITED' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC COPAGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lewis Allen, who directed ``The Uninvited,'' one of Hollywood's
favorite ghost stories, and who helped Frank Sinatra achieve one of
his best dramatic performances as a professional assassin in
``Suddenly,'' died on May 3 in a nursing home in Santa Monica,
Calif. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Allen directed more than 30 Broadway and London stage
productions before he turned to feature films with ``The
Uninvited,'' in 1944. Based on Dorothy Macardle's novel, the movie
starred Ray Milland, Ruth Hussey and Gail Russell. ``The
Uninvited'' continues to be celebrated by film buffs for Russell's
performance, the atmospherics and an evocative score that yielded
the standard ``Stella by Starlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later Allen directed ``Suddenly,'' which starred
Sinatra as one of a trio of gunmen trying to assassinate the
president of the United States. Bosley Crowther, film critic for
The New York Times, called Sinatra's performance ``a melodramatic
tour de force,'' and praised Allen ``for direction that makes both
excitement and sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen directed Milland again in ``The Imperfect Lady'' (1947),
``So Evil My Love'' (1948), and ``Sealed Verdict''(1948).
</P>
<P>
   He directed Alan Ladd in ``Chicago Deadline'' and ``Appointment
With Danger''(1951) and Burt Lancaster in the western ``Desert
Fury'' (1947). Edward G. Robinson was his star in ``A Bullet for
Joey'' (1955) and ``Illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   He directed Sean Connery and Lana Turner in ``Another Time,
Another Place''in 1958, but his film career was fading. His last
picture was a low-budget British production called ``Whirlpool'' in
1959.
</P>
<P>
   By then Allen had begun a busy career as a television director.
Among his credits were episodes of ``Bonanza,'' ``Perry Mason,''
``The Rifleman,'' ``Route 66,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``I Dream
of Jeannie,'' ``Cannon'' and ``Little House on the Prairie.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Lewis Allen was born in England in Oakergates,
Shropshire, the son of William Vincent Allen, a wool trader and
clothing manufacturer, and the former Sarah Matthews. After serving
four years in the British Merchant Service, he became an actor and
then a theatrical manager, first for Raymond Massey and then for
the Gilbert Miller Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's wife, Dorothy Skinner, a London literary agent, died in
1969. He is survived by his second wife, the former Trudy Colmar; a
son, Jon Lewis Allen of Dallas; three brothers, all living in
Britain; two grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We have an old lamp that originally belonged to my wife's
mother and has sentimental value. This lamp needs repair badly.
</P>
<P>
   The electric cord is frayed and should be replaced and the
switch no longer works properly. I'm not sure what else is wrong,
or even if the lamp can really be repaired so it will be safe to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think it is possible for a do-it-yourselfer to repair
such a lamp without having to call in an electrician?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are even moderately handy it should be no problem.
Most lamps have only a limited number of parts (as shown in the
illustration).
</P>
<P>
   When a lamp does not work it is either the lamp socket with its
built-in switch that needs replacing, or the electric cord and plug
that should be replaced. Your best bet is to replace all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the shade and its harp, then take the socket apart by
removing the upper brass shell and the cardboard insulation sleeve
under it.
</P>
<P>
   Disconnect the wires from the terminal screws and tie a length
of cord to the end of this wire before you pull the wire out from
the bottom. The cord can then be used to pull the new wire back up
through the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Pull out the wire and unscrew the brass socket base, then screw
the new socket base in place.
</P>
<P>
   Use the cord to pull the new wire back up from the bottom and
connect this to the terminals on the new socket's base.
</P>
<P>
   Reassemble all parts in reverse order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I painted the concrete stoop in front of my house about a
year ago and realize that it is now slippery when wet.
</P>
<P>
   What is the easiest way to get this deck paint off the concrete?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to use a heavy duty, semi-paste paint
remover.
</P>
<P>
   Brush on thick layers of this and allow to soak for about 15-20
minutes, then scrub off with a stiff brush dipped into a detergent
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid working in the sun if possible, and flush off with lots of
plain water.
</P>
<P>
   Protect plants and turf by covering with plastic and by hosing
off continuously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The chain link fence around our yard needs painting. I tried
using a large brush, but this takes forever.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying is impossible because my neighbor won't stand for it.
</P>
<P>
   What other suggestions can you offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The fastest and easiest method is to use a roller.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a long-nap roller cover with fibers at least 3/4'' long and
roll the paint on slowly with moderate pressure.
</P>
<P>
   To protect plants and grass, cover the ground with a plastic
drop cloth and slide this under the metal fence.
</P>
<P>
   The job will go faster with two people working, one following
behind the other to catch drips and runs, and to smooth out the
original application.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The old wood floor in our dining area is in reasonably good
condition but needs refinishing.
</P>
<P>
   There are quite a few spaces between the floor boards that I
once tried to fill with a ``wood dough'' but this dried up and
cracked out in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to fill these cracks permanently while still
maintaining the hardwood floor look?
</P>
<P>
   A: Short of cutting many narrow strips of matching wood for a
snug fit between the boards there is little you can do without
redoing the entire floor.
</P>
<P>
   The only other solution I can think of, if you want to retain
the appearance of a hardwood floor, is to recover the entire floor
with some type of wood parquet tiles, or with prefinished wood
flooring in strip form.
</P>

   A reader e-mailed looking for the recipe for the yellow
squash-zucchini-bacon casserole served at Luby's cafeterias. I
found that recipe in the cookbook the company published in 1996;
it's sold at the cafeterias.

   Dollie Hovland of Whitney, Texas, volunteered a recipe that is
making the rounds among her friends. The recipe was printed in her
electric co-operative paper and is getting rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, we had a request for the chewy chocolate cookies
that are sold in several area supermarkets. We found this recipe at
www.Allrecipes.com, a terrific source for recipes on the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   My neighbor Pam is one of those moms I idolize.
</P>
<P>
   She grows roses the size of basketballs and installs her own
wood floors, and her kids always seem to have their shoes on.
</P>
<P>
   So when she decided to let me in on one of her secrets, I
listened intently over the hum of her Suburban's engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opening in the co-op, do you want in?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' I said, not really knowing what I'd just agreed to but
sure that if Pam was involved, it would be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   That day, I became one of nine Grapevine and Southlake moms
united by their thriftiness and love of fresh food in a fruit and
vegetable co-op.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, I was pretty ignorant about the co-op thing. I
associated the term with the 1970s era ``back-to-the-Earth''
movement, picturing hordes of hippie moms in and around Berkeley,
Calif., stockpiling bulgur wheat and organic peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Our co-op operates on a smaller scale, but the principle is the
same, ``co-op''erating to help save time and money. For $20 a week
per member, you get two boxes of fresh produce to fuel your family.
</P>
<P>
   On days when the order came in, I could forgo McDonald's and
make a simple supper of fresh corn-on-the-cob, tomatoes in vinegar,
cantaloupe slices and strawberry shortcake.
</P>
<P>
   Each member takes a turn buying the produce, making the trip to
wholesalers located by the Dallas Farmers Market.
</P>
<P>
   When I joined, I got a schedule and assorted tips about which
wholesalers had a reputation for hiding rotten goods in the bottoms
of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   I also received a survey that noted which vegetables were
popular with members and which ones we were absolutely, positively
not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I didn't pay too much attention to the survey. On
my first buying trip, I bought cabbage. A no-no. Where I saw bowls
of fresh slaw, my fellow members saw only six heads that would
stink up their kitchens when boiled. I tried to make up for it by
handing out slaw recipes, but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I recognized that being in a co-op takes compromise
and creativity. Unless you are doing the shopping that week, you
are at the mercy of your fellow members and their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, members stick to the basics: green beans,
tomatoes, potatoes and corn. But occasionally things get a bit
exotic and you're forced to expand your culinary horizons.
</P>
<P>
   I learned this with squash. A native Southerner, I thought
yellow crookneck squash was the only variety. But my fellow co-op
members were mostly Yankees who bought me boxes full of
bizarre-looking acorn and spaghetti squash.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea how to prepare these strange squashes, but I
relied on my ``Fanny Farmer Cookbook'' and tips from fellow
members. I learned how to microwave and bake acorn squash into
tenderness and dump enough brown sugar on top that my kids don't
recognize it as a vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Being in a co-op also means dealing with mass quantities. For
example, one week, my co-op order included 40 cucumbers. I ran
through my recipes for cucumber soups and salads, then hit cucumber
overload.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was, I still has about 20 left. Rather than let them
rot, I brought them to work and handed them out to co-workers, who
started calling me ``the cucumber queen.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any organization, there are logistics to deal with. In
our co-op, each member pays upfront in cash, $20 for a full order,
before joining. Sometimes, if one order is too much for a family,
two moms split an order, each paying $10.
</P>
<P>
   Our co-op has six orders, or about $120. With that, we can
usually get three or four fruits and four or five vegetables.
That's more than enough to feed my very hungry family of five and
have plenty left over. During the holidays, I had enough oranges,
grapes and bananas to put together gift baskets for my sons'
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   When an order comes in, members bring their cash and hand it
over when picking up the produce. If you split an order with
someone, one of you pays the $20 for a full order, then splits up
the order for the other.
</P>
<P>
   We keep a notebook that lists all the produce items purchased
and who paid, an informal record system that's packaged in a
plastic envelope with a calculator.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unexpected benefits has been teaching my three sons
basic math. When we go shopping, they help me figure out how many
of the 72 oranges each member should receive. They learn to count
by helping me sort out the orders in our garage. Sometimes the
counting is skewed by my 2-year-old, who likes to take a bite out
of errant apples.
</P>
<P>
   Having an ample supply of fresh fruits and vegetables means I
don't have an easy excuse for ordering pizza every night. The co-op
has helped us get somewhere close to the recommended servings of
fruit and vegetables each day. It also forces me to plan ahead,
figuring out what meals I need to make days (as opposed to minutes)
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the best benefits is the bond I've forged with other
members. I feel I'm no longer flailing around in the rough seas of
suburban domesticity. I've united with superior modern-day
gatherers against junk food, microwave meals and overpriced produce
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Pam.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

<P>
   Can being in a co-op save you money? Here's a comparison between
the last co-op order and what similar goods would have cost at the
grocery store:

WORLD BANK GAUGES THE TOLL TRAVEL TAKES ON EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category ``t'')  
 By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My husband missed our son's high school graduation due to
business travel. None of us has ever forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of words were spoken at the World Bank's two-day symposium
Stress, the Business Traveler and Corporate Health in Washington
late last month. But those two declarative sentences, among the
many responses elicited by World Bank managers who surveyed
traveling staff members and their spouses, packed real wallop.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America, which often prides itself on the supposed
invincibility of the legions of men and women it dispatches around
the world, could learn a few things about employee health and
welfare from the World Bank. The last two years, the bank has
sponsored seminars intended to make employers think more
responsibly about the effect that ever-increasing travel has on
employees and on the people closest to them.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, an international organization based in
Washington, sends nearly 5,000 employees on international business
trips each year, for a total of more than 250,000 days away from
home. In 1997, the World Bank sponsored a detailed clinical study
that discovered that significantly higher rates of health insurance
claims were filed by employees who traveled compared with those who
did not. Even more remarkable, frequent travelers, who typically
regard themselves as tough and resilient, also account for far
higher-than-average claims for treatment of stress, anxiety,
depression and other psychological-adjustment disorders
attributable directly to the demands of being on the road.
</P>
<P>
   This year, prompted by that 1997 study, the bank convened health
professionals and managers from 50 corporate and government
organizations to discuss follow-up research that was commissioned
to examine more closely the psychological impact of frequent
business travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked our colleagues what's going on?'' said Bernhard
Liese, a senior health adviser and the former medical director of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The answer that came back, Liese said, was that adverse effects
from travel were ``mirrored in the family'' as well as in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 clinical study compared health insurance claims filed
by 4,700 World Bank managers and professional workers who had taken
international business trips with claims filed by 6,000 World Bank
employees who did not travel. Across the board, the survey showed a
strong correlation between frequency of travel and higher reports
of respiratory infections, gastrointestinal distress, skin
disorders and back pain _ all understandable, if somewhat
surprising, consequences of heavy travel to a wide variety of
places.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey's findings of far higher rates of treatment for
psychological disorders were especially startling, Liese said. That
is because only about a third of the World Bank's employees in
Washington are from North America. The rest come from countries
where there is far greater reluctance ``to seek treatment from a
psychologist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up survey on the risks of that psychological stress
was by the same team of clinical researchers, which reported: ``As
international business travel grows, increasing numbers of
travelers will be exposed to health risks, including widely varying
physical and psychological stressors.'' In the report, published in
the scientific journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine,
they added that ``business travel is a unique challenge to the
health of employees, which to date has not been studied
extensively.''
</P>
<P>
   High on the list of emotional stresses for heavy business
travelers is worry about personal and family lives, including
adjustment problems suffered by spouses and children of an employee
who is often away from home. Anxiety about the workload piling up
back at the office also ranked high on the stress list.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the researchers said, traveling employees are
disinclined to take time off to rest from a tiring business trip.
``Although most respondents think it is necessary, very few of them
reported that they actually take rest days after business travel,''
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some corporations and bosses pride themselves on
instilling a gung-ho workplace culture that presses worn-out
corporate travelers to hit the road on demand and show up at the
office bright and early on return, no matter where they flew in
from the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of all respondents reported that their managers
rarely or never formally grant'' a day off after a long trip,
reflecting a perceived lack of sanction for taking rest, especially
in office environments where employees who take time off are seen
as being vulnerable or less committed, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the symposium heard a lot of practical advice on
making life easier on traveling employees: train managers to be
aware that changing travel dates at the last minute can adversely
affect people's lives; be more flexible in allowing travelers to
make their own arrangements and to exercise more control over their
lives when they are on the road; compensate traveling employees for
their weekends; let them call home daily on the company's nickel.
</P>
<P>
   But the most resonant message came from Liese, who said more
attention must be paid to ``corporate responsibilities'' in
employee travel, an area that lies beyond the reach of any
governmental workplace or health-and-safety regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations should be accountable, Liese said, ``to their most
valuable resource _ their staff.''

 &HT;    VENTURE CAPITAL, CONSUMER DEMAND FUELING CHINA'S DOTCOM
EXPLOSION
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 14 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Eleven years ago, Steve Sun was a student
hunger-striker on Tiananmen Square being interviewed by CBS News's
Dan Rather on why China needed democracy. Today, with an American
MBA and three years of Wall Street experience, he is a dotcom chief
executive with a 14th-floor corner office in one of Beijing's
newest high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   He and two partners decided only late last year to get in on the
Internet action in China. They threw together a business plan in 10
days, raised more than enough capital in two weeks to start their
company and launched Sinobit.com less than two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the signing of the (World Trade Organization) agreement
between China and the United States that really expedited the
process,'' Sun said, referring to the sweeping trade accord signed
last November. ``We had a conference call that night and really
moved fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He is part of a trickle of students with a U.S. education
returning to China which, though not nearly significant enough to
reverse a decades-long brain drain, is certainly helping fuel the
explosive growth of the Internet in this country of 1.3 billion.
From nearly all facets _ users, entrepreneurs and investors _
interest in all things Web-related is huge and the pace of change
has been breakneck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Silicon Valley squared,'' said Jay Chang, an analyst
for Credit Suisse/First Boston in Hong Kong who specializes in the
Internet in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, government restrictions on content and certain
business operations may be hindering the Web's development, but
entrepreneurs see them as just a part of doing business. In fact,
dotcoms are being formed at the rate of two a day, according to the
state-run China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the government's blocking of certain foreign Web sites
keeping surfers away. The number of Internet users here has been
doubling every six months for the last two years, reaching 8.9
million at the end of last year, according to official Chinese
government figures. Although penetration is low, if triple-digit
growth keeps up, China could have the world's largest Internet
population in just five years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost more quickly than Web surfers can log on, Chinese
entrepreneurs have been giving them more places to click to _ from
sports and entertainment sites to on-line bookstores and
newspapers. Sinobit, which helps select start-ups find capital,
hoped to get 3,000 applications in its first year for its ``Dream
Lab,'' where potential investors can review business plans. In less
than two months, with very little advertising, they received more
than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding this expansion are venture capitalists, mostly from the
United States, but also from Hong Kong, Japan and within China
itself. Until just a of couple months ago, the sense was that they
were throwing money at just about anyone with an idea and an
impressive management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was happening all the time _ some Chinese kid with an MBA
and a slick business presentation getting loads of money,'' said
Mark Baldwin, chief executive of Zhaopin.com, a Beijing
head-hunting firm with a job listing site. ``(Venture capitalists)
love people who talk their language.''
</P>
<P>
   While overseas investors are now showing somewhat more restraint
toward new start-ups, analysts say they don't seem to have the
patience in China that they did with the U.S. market, where they
allow a few years to build an audience before worrying about
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas in the United States, you had that honeymoon
traffic-only stage for a couple years, in China, 1999 was all about
growing page-views. In 2000, they're starting to focus on
revenues,'' said Christopher Mumford, founder of YaoLan.com, the
leading baby-care Web site. ``I think in six to nine months, it's
going to be, 'OK, you have to show us a profit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having the U.S. experience to go by is both a blessing and a
curse, Chinese analysts and executives say.
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese dotcoms have emulated many of the American
business models, they worry that U.S. investors are blindly
applying they're own market conditions to China, which lags at
least a couple of years behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like feeding a baby with beef,'' said Joseph Chen, chief
executive of ChinaRen.com, a Web site geared towards young people.
``A baby needs milk.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intense competition is among the portals, which are
also the leading consumers of foreign capital and are all vying to
become the Yahoo of China. ChinaRen, a U.S.-funded company started
by Chen and two other under-30 Chinese students who all met at
Stanford University, is not unlike other start-ups in that it
spends 70 percent of its budget on marketing and public relations.
It has booked billboard space for the next year-and-a-half. In
fact, billboard space in Beijing is sold out for the next three
years, mostly to high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Because the industry is so young, the search for experienced
employees often leads to a rival's personnel list, which is a
highly-guarded commodity at many companies. Chen said one of his
project managers was offered a six-fold salary increase by a
competitor. He convinced the employee to stay with a promotion and
a 60-percent pay raise. ChinaRen programmers make as much as
US$3,000 a month _ a phenomenal salary in China, where the average
factory worker's monthly wage is less than US$150 and a
journalist's less than US$400.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from U.S. high-tech companies are also being poached
by China's dotcoms. Henry Huang, chairman of a high-tech P.R. firm
in Beijing whose clients include Microsoft, Dell and Intel,
estimates 70 percent of the Chinese managers and directors working
for the big-name American companies have jumped ship for a
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ChinaRen focuses on the under-25 set, allowing them to create
their own Web pages and post photos.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of these unprecedented new avenues for personal
expression, ChinaRen is ever mindful not to upset China's communist
government. With more than 20,000 new photos uploaded every day, 10
people are employed just to vet them. CEO Chen says they avoid
``pornography, politically sensitive stuff; no religious promotion.
It's strictly entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has conflicting motives, analysts say,
wanting to maintain control over the Internet while wanting to see
it develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to become a 21st-Century superpower,'' said Chang,
the Internet analyst. ``To do that, you have to use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal and regulatory framework is still playing catch-up.
While dotcoms wait for a comprehensive set of rules, they've had to
work with piecemeal restrictions on who can provide original news
content, how much foreign investment is allowed, and when and how a
Chinese company can go public abroad. Sina.com, the leading portal,
was forced to carve out its Chinese assets and operations before
listing on Nasdaq last month. And other Chinese dotcoms with IPO
dreams will have to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese Web sites may be politically tame, Internet
exhibitions _ which seem to take place every other week here in
Beijing _ can veer towards the wild side. At COMDEX last month,
attendees were treated to Western women in precariously fastened
halter tops, surrounded by a crowd five-deep, shaking and kicking
to the blasting music while girls in metallic miniskirts and roller
blades handed out brochures.
</P>
<P>
   At Internet World, the audience mobbed the seminar speakers _
mostly Internet executives and investment bankers _ like they were
rock stars. But instead of asking for an autograph, it was a
business card they were all after.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While Internet companies in China are careful to stay well
within political boundaries, most recognize the Web's potential to
transform Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you can say anything you want on the Web,'' said Lu
Benfu, an Internet researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, government think tank. ``This will open society even
more. Secondly, it will help Chinese people enter the world
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as Westerners talk about the free-wheeling Internet
fomenting political change, though, Chinese people, who've proven
adept at adapting to new technologies, don't see it as such a
revolutionary new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will change on its own path at its own speed, but with
determination from the top'' Chen said. ``No external force will
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1989 student demonstrations at Tiananmen Square are
``kind of remote now'' for Sinobit.com's Sun, he still hasn't
forgotten about the six students from his university killed in the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Internet for him foremost is a business venture,
``at least a side effect will be to promote democracy and freedom
in the world.''

   A lot of words were spoken at the World Bank's two-day symposium
Stress, the Business Traveler and Corporate Health in Washington
late last month. But those two declarative sentences, among the

   Corporate America, which often prides itself on the supposed

welfare from the World Bank. The last two years, the bank has
sponsored seminars intended to make employers think more
responsibly about the effect that ever-increasing travel has on
employees and on the people closest to them.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, an international organization based in
Washington, sends nearly 5,000 employees on international business
trips each year, for a total of more than 250,000 days away from
home. In 1997, the World Bank sponsored a detailed clinical study
that discovered that significantly higher rates of health insurance
claims were filed by employees who traveled compared with those who
did not. Even more remarkable, frequent travelers, who typically

</P>
<P>
   The 1997 clinical study compared health insurance claims filed
by 4,700 World Bank managers and professional workers who had taken
international business trips with claims filed by 6,000 World Bank
employees who did not travel. Across the board, the survey showed a
strong correlation between frequency of travel and higher reports
of respiratory infections, gastrointestinal distress, skin
disorders and back pain _ all understandable, if somewhat
surprising, consequences of heavy travel to a wide variety of
places.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey's findings of far higher rates of treatment for
psychological disorders were especially startling, Liese said. That
is because only about a third of the World Bank's employees in
Washington are from North America. The rest come from countries
where there is far greater reluctance ``to seek treatment from a
psychologist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up survey on the risks of that psychological stress
was by the same team of clinical researchers, which reported: ``As
international business travel grows, increasing numbers of
travelers will be exposed to health risks, including widely varying
physical and psychological stressors.'' In the report, published in
the scientific journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine,
they added that ``business travel is a unique challenge to the
health of employees, which to date has not been studied
extensively.''
</P>
<P>
   High on the list of emotional stresses for heavy business
travelers is worry about personal and family lives, including
adjustment problems suffered by spouses and children of an employee
who is often away from home. Anxiety about the workload piling up
back at the office also ranked high on the stress list.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the researchers said, traveling employees are
disinclined to take time off to rest from a tiring business trip.
``Although most respondents think it is necessary, very few of them
reported that they actually take rest days after business travel,''
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some corporations and bosses pride themselves on
instilling a gung-ho workplace culture that presses worn-out
corporate travelers to hit the road on demand and show up at the
office bright and early on return, no matter where they flew in
from the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of all respondents reported that their managers
rarely or never formally grant'' a day off after a long trip,
reflecting a perceived lack of sanction for taking rest, especially
in office environments where employees who take time off are seen
as being vulnerable or less committed, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the symposium heard a lot of practical advice on
making life easier on traveling employees: train managers to be
aware that changing travel dates at the last minute can adversely
affect people's lives; be more flexible in allowing travelers to
make their own arrangements and to exercise more control over their
lives when they are on the road; compensate traveling employees for
their weekends; let them call home daily on the company's nickel.
</P>
<P>
   But the most resonant message came from Liese, who said more
attention must be paid to ``corporate responsibilities'' in
employee travel, an area that lies beyond the reach of any
governmental workplace or health-and-safety regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations should be accountable, Liese said, ``to their most
valuable resource _ their staff.''

 &HT;    VENTURE CAPITAL, CONSUMER DEMAND FUELING CHINA'S DOTCOM
EXPLOSION
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 14 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Eleven years ago, Steve Sun was a student
hunger-striker on Tiananmen Square being interviewed by CBS News's
Dan Rather on why China needed democracy. Today, with an American
MBA and three years of Wall Street experience, he is a dotcom chief
executive with a 14th-floor corner office in one of Beijing's
newest high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   He and two partners decided only late last year to get in on the
Internet action in China. They threw together a business plan in 10
days, raised more than enough capital in two weeks to start their
company and launched Sinobit.com less than two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the signing of the (World Trade Organization) agreement
between China and the United States that really expedited the
process,'' Sun said, referring to the sweeping trade accord signed
last November. ``We had a conference call that night and really
moved fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He is part of a trickle of students with a U.S. education
returning to China which, though not nearly significant enough to
reverse a decades-long brain drain, is certainly helping fuel the
explosive growth of the Internet in this country of 1.3 billion.
From nearly all facets _ users, entrepreneurs and investors _
interest in all things Web-related is huge and the pace of change
has been breakneck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Silicon Valley squared,'' said Jay Chang, an analyst
for Credit Suisse/First Boston in Hong Kong who specializes in the
Internet in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, government restrictions on content and certain
business operations may be hindering the Web's development, but
entrepreneurs see them as just a part of doing business. In fact,
dotcoms are being formed at the rate of two a day, according to the
state-run China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the government's blocking of certain foreign Web sites
keeping surfers away. The number of Internet users here has been
doubling every six months for the last two years, reaching 8.9
million at the end of last year, according to official Chinese
government figures. Although penetration is low, if triple-digit
growth keeps up, China could have the world's largest Internet
population in just five years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost more quickly than Web surfers can log on, Chinese
entrepreneurs have been giving them more places to click to _ from
sports and entertainment sites to on-line bookstores and
newspapers. Sinobit, which helps select start-ups find capital,
hoped to get 3,000 applications in its first year for its ``Dream
Lab,'' where potential investors can review business plans. In less
than two months, with very little advertising, they received more
than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding this expansion are venture capitalists, mostly from the
United States, but also from Hong Kong, Japan and within China
itself. Until just a of couple months ago, the sense was that they
were throwing money at just about anyone with an idea and an
impressive management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was happening all the time _ some Chinese kid with an MBA
and a slick business presentation getting loads of money,'' said
Mark Baldwin, chief executive of Zhaopin.com, a Beijing
head-hunting firm with a job listing site. ``(Venture capitalists)
love people who talk their language.''
</P>
<P>
   While overseas investors are now showing somewhat more restraint
toward new start-ups, analysts say they don't seem to have the
patience in China that they did with the U.S. market, where they
allow a few years to build an audience before worrying about
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas in the United States, you had that honeymoon
traffic-only stage for a couple years, in China, 1999 was all about
growing page-views. In 2000, they're starting to focus on
revenues,'' said Christopher Mumford, founder of YaoLan.com, the
leading baby-care Web site. ``I think in six to nine months, it's
going to be, 'OK, you have to show us a profit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having the U.S. experience to go by is both a blessing and a
curse, Chinese analysts and executives say.
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese dotcoms have emulated many of the American
business models, they worry that U.S. investors are blindly
applying they're own market conditions to China, which lags at
least a couple of years behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like feeding a baby with beef,'' said Joseph Chen, chief
executive of ChinaRen.com, a Web site geared towards young people.
``A baby needs milk.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intense competition is among the portals, which are
also the leading consumers of foreign capital and are all vying to
become the Yahoo of China. ChinaRen, a U.S.-funded company started
by Chen and two other under-30 Chinese students who all met at
Stanford University, is not unlike other start-ups in that it
spends 70 percent of its budget on marketing and public relations.
It has booked billboard space for the next year-and-a-half. In
fact, billboard space in Beijing is sold out for the next three
years, mostly to high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Because the industry is so young, the search for experienced
employees often leads to a rival's personnel list, which is a
highly-guarded commodity at many companies. Chen said one of his
project managers was offered a six-fold salary increase by a
competitor. He convinced the employee to stay with a promotion and
a 60-percent pay raise. ChinaRen programmers make as much as
US$3,000 a month _ a phenomenal salary in China, where the average
factory worker's monthly wage is less than US$150 and a
journalist's less than US$400.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from U.S. high-tech companies are also being poached
by China's dotcoms. Henry Huang, chairman of a high-tech P.R. firm
in Beijing whose clients include Microsoft, Dell and Intel,
estimates 70 percent of the Chinese managers and directors working
for the big-name American companies have jumped ship for a
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ChinaRen focuses on the under-25 set, allowing them to create
their own Web pages and post photos.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of these unprecedented new avenues for personal
expression, ChinaRen is ever mindful not to upset China's communist
government. With more than 20,000 new photos uploaded every day, 10
people are employed just to vet them. CEO Chen says they avoid
``pornography, politically sensitive stuff; no religious promotion.
It's strictly entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has conflicting motives, analysts say,
wanting to maintain control over the Internet while wanting to see
it develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to become a 21st-Century superpower,'' said Chang,
the Internet analyst. ``To do that, you have to use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal and regulatory framework is still playing catch-up.
While dotcoms wait for a comprehensive set of rules, they've had to
work with piecemeal restrictions on who can provide original news
content, how much foreign investment is allowed, and when and how a
Chinese company can go public abroad. Sina.com, the leading portal,
was forced to carve out its Chinese assets and operations before
listing on Nasdaq last month. And other Chinese dotcoms with IPO
dreams will have to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese Web sites may be politically tame, Internet
exhibitions _ which seem to take place every other week here in
Beijing _ can veer towards the wild side. At COMDEX last month,
attendees were treated to Western women in precariously fastened
halter tops, surrounded by a crowd five-deep, shaking and kicking
to the blasting music while girls in metallic miniskirts and roller
blades handed out brochures.
</P>
<P>
   At Internet World, the audience mobbed the seminar speakers _
mostly Internet executives and investment bankers _ like they were
rock stars. But instead of asking for an autograph, it was a
business card they were all after.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While Internet companies in China are careful to stay well
within political boundaries, most recognize the Web's potential to
transform Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you can say anything you want on the Web,'' said Lu
Benfu, an Internet researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, government think tank. ``This will open society even
more. Secondly, it will help Chinese people enter the world
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as Westerners talk about the free-wheeling Internet
fomenting political change, though, Chinese people, who've proven
adept at adapting to new technologies, don't see it as such a
revolutionary new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will change on its own path at its own speed, but with
determination from the top'' Chen said. ``No external force will
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1989 student demonstrations at Tiananmen Square are
``kind of remote now'' for Sinobit.com's Sun, he still hasn't
forgotten about the six students from his university killed in the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Internet for him foremost is a business venture,
``at least a side effect will be to promote democracy and freedom
in the world.''

 &HT;    LONDON'S NEW TATE MODERN SET TO OPEN
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A 50-year-old power station on the banks of the River
Thames will be reborn Thursday as the Tate Modern, the world's
largest museum devoted to 20th Century art.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled the ``Cathedral of Cool'' by London newspapers, the new
gallery will display more than 600 works in the cavernous red brick
building across the river from St. Paul's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The vast post-war structure was designed by famed British
architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who also designed London's
familiar red telephone boxes. The old plant has been revived in a
US$205 million reconstruction designed by Swiss architects Jacques
Herzog and Pierre de Meuron.
</P>
<P>
   The designers retained the shell of the power station with its
towering central chimney. It dwarfs its neighbor, the reconstructed
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be opened officially by Queen Elizabeth Thursday
with a celebrity-packed party to follow in the evening. The guest
list includes such art denizens as Madonna, Cher, Mick Jagger and
Jerry Hall. Black market tickets to the party are going for 1,000
pounds (about US$1,600).
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, the Tate Modern opens for free on Friday and
thereafter, as public art museums in Britain generally do not
charge for admission.
</P>
<P>
   The old Tate, about a quarter the size of the new museum _ which
used to house the nation's largest modern collection _ has been
reshaped into a gallery of British art.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking innovative ways to display the eclectic collection, the
Tate Modern's curators have organized the artwork into four
categories: Landscape/Matter/Environment; Nude/Action/Body; Still
Life/Object/Real Life; and History/Memory/Society. All the great
names of the 20th century from Picasso to Matisse to Pollock to
Mondrian, are present.
</P>
<P>
   The size and scope of the museum and its arrival in a city as
culturally important as London have forced comparisons with the
other important 20th century art museums, the Pompidou in Paris and
Museum of Modern Art in New York _ both of which are much smaller
than the Tate Modern.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the reviews have been mixed, but the critics have found
consensus in their expressions of awe at the size of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, the size of it,'' wrote Tom Lubbock for the The
Independent. ``Whatever the Tate Modern may be, it's more than just
a gallery. It is an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times wrote with some distaste
that he wasn't sure that bigger meant better. ``The Tate is in part
a temple to vanity, the vanity of a culture that equates spectacle
with substance, with half the building devoted to a vast
entranceway, the museum's deeply gloomy signature space _ and with
an installation that is occasionally eccentric to the point of
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors unencumbered by a critic's erudition, may find the
place an entertaining stew of visual and sensory experiences. The
vast turbine hall, which is 600 feet long and 12 stories high, is
fitted with massive sculptures, including a giant steel spider.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries are simple and functional and offer surprises at
many turns. One moment you are plunged into a blacked-out video
installation, the next you find yourself taking in a view of the
river and city during one of the occasional gaps between galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Enter another room and see Monet's elegant water lilies
competing for your attention with a splattered drawing by Richard
Long. In one room, there's a portrait of a glass of water that
imagines itself to be an oak tree alongside a painting of a glass
on a table and a drawing of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Searle of The Guardian also was troubled a bit by the
sometimes odd arrangement of works, but not enough to dampen his
enthusiasm for the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The display, flawed and problematic as it is, reminds us that
modern art is still an experiment rather than a linear progression
of indisputable masterpieces,'' he wrote. ``This is great.''

<P>
   Homeowners often find selecting a carpet to be difficult. There
are so many styles to choose from, and the descriptions are often
obscure and ill-defined. Indeed, many carpet manufacturers add to
the confusion by using the same or similar terms in a variety of
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Woven or tufted carpet, face weight, SPI, pile, secondary
backing, heat set, plush and shag are just a few of the terms that
a carpet buyer will encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In order to understand some of these terms, it is helpful to
know how carpets are made. Traditional carpets are essentially
woven textiles, and as such, they are made up of a series of
threads or cords that run the length of the carpet. These are
called the warp. Other threads, called the weft, pass under and
over at right angles to the warp threads. Carpets made of just the
warp and weft are called flat weaves or kilims (this term is
commonly applied to tribal and Oriental carpets, but not
exclusively).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to warp and weft, most carpets have other threads
tied into the weave. These are called the pile, and they are woven
so that they stand up from the foundation. The pile is the part of
the carpet that you walk on. Woven carpets must be cut in line with
the warp and weft and they must have a binding along the edges to
keep the threads from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Woven carpets are the oldest types of carpet. Another type of
carpet is tufted. Tufted carpets look like woven carpets, but their
construction is quite different. They have a ready-made back and
the pile is inserted into it. The pile is locked in place with a
coating of latex, and then a secondary back is applied for added
strength. Tufted carpets can be cut in any direction, and they do
not need binding along the edges.
</P>
<P>
   The tufting process allows manufacturers to make carpets faster
and with a greater variety of textures than with weaving. In
general, tufted carpets are less expensive than woven ones, but
they are not as durable.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the terms used to describe carpets have to do with the
profile of the pile. Level-loop carpets have a pile made of loops
of equal size and height. These carpets wear well, are easy to
clean and are good for high-traffic areas like hallways and family
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming the tops of the loops on those carpets makes cut-pile
carpets. This creates a plush pile with a velvet texture. Cut-pile
carpets are not as durable as loop carpets, so they should be
installed in low-traffic areas like the living room or bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Cut-and-loop carpets have a pile of loops and cut loops. This
combination creates a carpet with an uneven textured surface that
is durable but is harder to clean than the level loop or cut loop
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   A Saxony pile is similar to cut pile with one important
difference: the pile fibers are twisted then heat set. Heat setting
bakes the twist into the fibers and makes them more resistant to
matting, fuzzing and denting. Thus a Saxony carpet is able to
retain its plush, velvety texture longer than an ordinary cut-pile
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Berber carpets have tightly spaced loops of thick yarn. These
carpets have a dense textured surface that is very durable, but the
loops readily capture dirt and they are hard to clean.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the terms plush and shag. A plush carpet has
a dense, deep pile. A shag carpet has loops so long they flop over.
Shag carpets have an interesting texture, but they trap dirt and
are difficult to clean.
</P>
<P>
   Other carpet terms are used to describe the density of the pile.
Face weight, for example, indicates the weight per square yard of
the carpet's pile. A heavy face weight of, say, 48 ounces indicates
a plush carpet with extra yarn that will be resilient and
long-wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to this is carpet density, measured in stitches per inch
(SPI). This number tells how much yarn has been put into the face
of the carpet. Generally, a higher number signifies more loops and
indicates better quality.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing carpets by SPI figures can be misleading if the
carpets have different pile configurations. For example a good
cut-pile carpet may have 10 to 12 SPI, while a similar quality
Berber with thick yarn loops may have only 5 to 6 SPI One simple
way to judge the quality of a carpet is to fold it back slightly
(pile side up). The better carpet will reveal less backing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to buying a carpet, the homeowner is also faced with
the problem of selecting a carpet pad and having both installed
correctly. These topics will be featured next week.

   Urban Lichens
</P>
<P>
   Q. While walking in the woods behind my parents' home in Maine,
I became fascinated by the profusion of lichen forms along the
trail. They looked like structures one might find in the sea _ sea
fans, corals and algae. They varied in color from light green to
brown and were stiff, yet not brittle. I gathered up a small
example of each and brought them home to my New York apartment. I
have done a little research and find that they are the symbiotic
association of a fungus and an alga, which grows very, very slowly.
What I can't find is any information about how to keep them alive.
When I spray them with water, they become soft and pliable, but I
am not sure if my samples are still alive. If they are alive, is
there any chance of keeping them alive in my vastly different
environment, or should I send them home?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Send them home, they miss the woods. The relationship between
the algae, which provide the fungus with carbohydrates through
their own photosynthesis, and the fungus, which provides
protection, a place to live and water to the algae, is based on a
very delicate balance of light and moisture. If the balance is
upset one or the other may die, or one may grow faster than the
other. Either way, the lichen _ the combination of the two _ won't
be able to survive. A lot of interesting things grow in New York
apartments but lichens aren't among them.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter and Stand Back
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many years ago I used to see advertisements for a wildflower
seed mixture The promise was that just scattering the seed would
create a meadow. Is this still being sold? Does it really work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Instant meadows are still being sold, and people are still
scattering seeds and dreaming. Predictably, the results are
proportional to the amount of work, not the amount of dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   These seed mixtures are primarily made up of annuals, which will
bloom (and die) during the summer in which the area is seeded,
assuming the seeds land on bare soil, and germinate and grow in the
face of stiff competition from weeds.
</P>
<P>
   But to get a meadow instead of a random sprinkling of flowers
you'll have to kill and remove any plants already growing on the
site. Lightly open up the bare soil with a steel rake, spread the
flower seeds evenly, use a roller for good seed-to-soil contact,
and lightly mulch with weed-free hay or straw to retain moisture
and keep the birds from finding all the seed. Keep it moist, pull
up a chair and enjoy the summer riot of color.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, during the following spring you will probably
find that many of the annuals didn't re-seed themselves enough to
prevent fall's weed seeds from taking hold. So you start all over
again. An annual meadow is an annual job.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better plan. After preparing the site, use a native
perennial wildflower and grass (not the turf variety; grasses like
the 3-foot-tall, clump-forming little blue stem) mixture designed
for your area. Each year the plants grow more roots, eventually
forming an interwoven mass that chokes out annual weeds.
</P>
<P>
   But there simply are no instant, maintenance-free meadows. It
takes two or three years before most of the perennial plants will
reach blooming size. The meadow should be mowed or burned (check
with your fire department to see if it is legal) each fall or
before spring growth begins. While the lilies of the field may not
toil, those who put them there sure have to.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for perennial meadow seed mixtures include Ernst
Conservation Seeds, 9006 Mercer Pike, Meadville, PA 16335, (800)
873-3321; and Prairie Nursery, P.O. Box 306, Westfield, WI 53964,

DEMOCRATS BACK MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats rallied Wednesday around a
bill that would offer prescription drug benefits as a standard part
of the Medicare program, in contrast to the approach favored by
Republicans, who want to subsidize private insurance to help pay
such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen House and Senate Democrats joined in a display of
unity at the White House, where they said they had agreed on a
proposal to offer coverage of prescription drugs to all Medicare
beneficiaries _ 39 million people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal is similar to a plan offered by
President Clinton, but it is somewhat more generous to
beneficiaries and somewhat more expensive to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and members of Congress appeared in the White House Rose
Garden with Betty Dizik, a 73-year-old widow who said she skips
prescribed medications for diabetes and a heart condition because
she cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking for a handout or charity,'' Dizik said. ``I'm
willing to work and do my part. I'm just asking for a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal is embodied in a bill introduced
Wednesday by the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, with 32 of the 45 Democratic senators as co-sponsors. The
House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said he would
soon introduce a bill nearly identical to the Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
   In a Congress controlled by Republicans, the Democrats have no
chance of seeing their bills enacted. But they hope that by taking
a unified position, they can put pressure on the Republicans and
promote negotiations to enact legislation in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Vice President Al Gore and many
congressional Democrats have pummeled Republicans as slow to act on
prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the president sounded a more conciliatory note. ``We all
know we can't achieve our efforts without bipartisan support in the
Congress,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``That's why, just as we are
trying to do with the patient's bill of rights, we want to reach
across the aisle to encourage Republican support, as well. This can
and should be a truly bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Democrats, like Clinton, say Medicare should
cover half of a person's drug expenses up to certain limits _ half
of the first $2,000 in drug expenses starting in 2002. The ceiling
would rise gradually. By 2009, Medicare would cover half of the
first $5,000 in drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some drugs cost much more than $5,000 a year. The
congressional Democrats would provide assistance for people with
very high expenses; Medicare would pick up all of their drug costs
after they spend $3,000 or $4,000 of their own money.

&HT;     GORE NEEDS TO PERFECT CAMPAIGN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, May 14)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore has a great deal to say about many issues
in this campaign, but the manner in which he says them may at times
lose rather than win votes.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Gore, for all his years in politics, often
tends to use old arm-waving, floor-stomping, pre-television
techniques while George W. Bush campaigns with a cool, confident
expression, a modulated voice and control of his arms.
</P>
<P>
   Style may not win elections. But it can help. In 1960 charm,
good looks and a facile sense of humor were the qualities that
edged John Kennedy across the victory line over a charmless Richard
Nixon in history's closest presidential balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin D. Roosevelt's buoyant personality and wit undoubtedly
played a role in his four presidential victories. In 1940, seeking
an unprecedented third term, FDR sabotaged Republican hopes when,
before a cheering throng in Madison Square Garden, he ridiculed GOP
isolationists by reciting, in the meter of ``Wynken, Blyken and
Nod,'' the names of three prominent ones _ ``Martin, Barton and
Fish.'' Soon the audience was chanting with him. And before long
the campaign was over, and Roosevelt was the victor.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he employed humor again and even more
effectively as he sank the Republican's Goodship Thomas E. Dewey.
Speaking at a Teamsters' dinner to a national radio audience, FDR,
according to biographer Frank Freidel, gave ``one of the most
effective performances of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the night he described how the Republicans had attacked
``my little dog Fala'' with the lucicrous charge that Fala had been
left behind when the president visited the Aleutians and that
millions of tax dollars had been spent to fly him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't resent attacks, and my family doesn't resent
attacks,'' said the president in mock seriousness, ``but Fala does
resent them. You know, Fala is Scotch ... and his Scotch soul was
furious. He has not been the same dog since.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared with laughter as did millions of radio
listeners across the land.
</P>
<P>
   As for poor old Tom Dewey and his presidential aspirations,
Harry Truman sank them again four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Truman knew how to invigorate an otherwise dull campaign speech
with a healthy dose of Harry's ``give 'em hell'' remedy. Ronald
Reagan was adept at using self-deprecating humor to lighten his
campaign speeches and win the hearts of his audience. Since he was
the oldest man ever elected president, he had a great time poking
fun at his age.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen Gore at a lunch, dinner or reception knows
he is a friendly man of intelligence and good motivation who enjoys
a good laugh at himself. He was at his best at the annual Gridiron
dinner here in March at which politics and politicians were spoofed
by newspapermen and women who saw and heard a Gore that the public
rarely sees and hears.
</P>
<P>
   Substituting for Bill Clinton, Gore made outrageous fun of
himself and proved the stellar attraction of the evening. Humor
often can be more effective than bombast.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton reclaimed his political king-of-comedy crown at the
annual White House Correspondents Association dinner late last
month when he showed a homemade movie on how little a lame-duck
president has to do.
</P>
<P>
   The film pictures Clinton answering the White House telephones,
preparing a brown-bag lunch for his wife Hillary as she headed to
New York to campaign for the Senate, watching clothes spin round in
a washing machine and rinsing off the presidential limousine.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fine line between presidential humor and presidential
seriousness. A candidate who does or says too many foolish things
can find himself in just as much trouble as one who constantly is
ponderous and pontificating.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's problems is that he sometimes tends to whine. At
other times, he takes an issue and rambles on about it when a
short, crisp explanation of his position would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable that Social Security would become a major
issue, dividing Gore and Bush. Given the erratic manner in which
the stock market has behaved of late, Gore has a good argument when
he complains that senior citizens could get burned badly if they
were to follow Bush's proposal and invest their Social Security
retirement funds in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He has another good issue in the declaration of National Rifle
Association First Vice President Kayne Robinson that the NRA has
``unbelievably friendly relations'' with Bush, who presumably as
president would name Supreme Court justices opposed to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore has solid positions on such key issues as
education, the environment and Medicare. His problem appears to be
a desperate desire to become president and a silly inclination to
shed his proper, affluent upbringing and act like one of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   His task is to be wise, articulate and presidential. At the
moment Bush is doing a better job than Gore in practicing those
traits.

MAKING HOOP DREAMS COME (ALMOST) TRUE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR; ``NBA 2K'' by Sega Sports for Sega Dreamcast; $39.99; for all
ages. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association was one of the marketing
marvels of the '90s. So it is no surprise that NBA simulations have
been a major focus for video game makers, especially in an era when
motion-capture technology and high-speed rendering allow the
developers to offer nearly realistic games. Or rather,
``telerealistic'' games, since television is the driving medium
behind the recent success of both the league and the
league-inspired games.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's basketball video games are licensed NBA products
that feature full player rosters, with images of the real athletes'
faces skillfully mapped onto their virtual bodies. At the top of
this genre is ``NBA 2K,'' by Sega Sports for the Sega Dreamcast
console.
</P>
<P>
   Short of building in celebrity spectators and hordes of
photographers, every effort has been made to mimic a televised
event. The games start with laser-show introductions, include a
stream of cliche-ridden patter by the television announcers for the
Golden State Warriors, take place in digitized versions of actual
stadiums and even include on-court woofing between players. When
Kobe Bryant pulls off a two-handed helicopter jam, for example, he
is prone to crowing, ``I'm bustin' out the whuppin' stick.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the telerealism, you can choose from eight camera
angles, including isolation cameras that track a single character.
Gamers can also call for a replay at any moment. Using the
console's controllers, you can then watch the highlight frame by
frame or freeze the motion and swoop around the scene, recalling
similar effects in ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   In actual game play, characters are impressively rendered, their
movements neither jerky nor truncated, and they move around the
court in an entirely plausible fashion. The telerealism falls apart
only in the close-up replays triggered by players or by the game
itself. That's when the motions seem stiff and the players wear a
single expression: the patented sullen look of the professional
athlete. Only as their programmed shooting moves kick in do they
start displaying a wider range of facial expressions and stop
looking like doll heads on human bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, that is a minor quibble, one that will bother only
players with unreasonably high standards for the suspension of
disbelief (and nit-picking critics). Certainly, the game has a lot
of what gamers call granularity, those little details that make the
action seem real. Would-be coaches can call plays, change defenses
and make substitutions; fantasy-league devotees can trade players
and even conduct a full draft. Game players with Dr. Frankenstein
leanings can build players from scratch, customizing things like
height, bulk and skills as well as facial hair, eyewear and sneaker
style. This character-making feature had one funny effect: I built
a player almost at random, then suddenly realized that I had
created a clone of Kurt Rambis, the gawky backup center to Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar during the Los Angeles Lakers' ``Showtime'' era.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get past all the razzmatazz, there is a fundamental
flaw in the game, one that has tripped up the makers of every
basketball game I have ever tried: you just can't play good
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that problem may be intractable. As anyone who plays
a team sport learns, the person playing offense always has the
distinct advantage of knowing where he's going; the defender can
only guess. That predicament is compounded in video game play,
where you can't watch your opponent's hips or eyes, and where
hitting a single button will propel an offensive player toward the
basket, but adequately covering him requires a far more complex set
of moves. Because you can control only one character at a time, you
have to switch characters constantly as the ball moves around the
court, then move that man to the ball quickly _ a tricky feat in
the traffic of five-on-five half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   That imbalance tends to make for riotously disjointed games. On
offense, you're pulling off plays you would never attempt on a
playground _ no-look passes, behind-the-back dribbling, 360-degree
dunks. And it takes only about three attempts to learn the trick of
successfully lobbing alley-oops that lead to rim-crushing jams, an
apparently unstoppable tactic. Likewise, pushing the Turbo button
while dribbling upcourt tends to give you that extra quick step
required to shimmy behind your opponent for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on defense, your character seems to be playing his first
game ever. If you want to win, you're usually better off posting
the man you actually control near the basket to block layups and
dunks, while letting the game's artificial-intelligence programs
handle the dirty work of actually guarding your opponents. After a
week of rigorous play, perhaps your defense might become middling.
But why bother, when you can be competitive against the computer
without even learning to play solid man-on-man?
</P>
<P>
   Without good defense, ``NBA 2K'' quickly becomes an exercise in
shame, as Rusty LaRue, the Bulls journeyman, grandstands his way up
the court after dunking over Glen Rice, the Los Angeles Lakers
All-Star (or, at least, over your sorry attempt to play as Rice).
The game has a practice mode for passing and shooting, but not for
defense. That is especially disheartening because of ``NBA 2K's''
arsenal of programmed offensive stunts.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that this is only fitting, given how much of
today's NBA play revolves around making the evening sports newscast
with acrobatic slams and fancy dribbling moves. And it is precisely
the realism of those components that makes ``NBA 2K'' such an
exciting game to play; there's no telling what wonder you'll pull
off next. Still, it's defense that wins real basketball games. As
long as virtual hoops draws more on the legacy of the flamboyant
dunkmeister Darryl Dawkins than the fundamentals fanaticism of the
great UCLA coach John Wooden, there is some critical realism sorely
missing. Then again, it's just a video game _ cue the highlight
reel.

<P>
   Q. What is the difference between registering a domain name and
reserving one?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you go to a registration company like Network Solutions to
buy a name for your Web site but don't yet have the host servers
set up for your site, you can reserve the domain name of your
choice so it will be there when you are ready to set up the site.
If you already have your Web host servers in place, you can
register the domain name and provide the domain-name company with
the technical information about your host server that it needs for
registration. Some registration companies will let you register the
name even if you don't have your host information and will hold it
for you until you are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com, another company that sells domain names, recently
announced a Domain Lock Down service for corporate customers. The
service, which costs $99, provides security against those who might
try to tamper with or hijack a registered name.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a Macintosh and use Netscape to browse the Web. When I
have tried to start Netscape lately, it has begun to open, then
crashed. I haven't installed any new software that might be
conflicting with it, and nothing on my system is different.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of factors that could be affecting your
browser, but there is a quick fix to try before picking up the
phone to call for tech support. The Preferences file for your
Netscape software may have become corrupted, and that could cause
it to shut down almost as soon as it starts up.
</P>
<P>
   Double-click on your Mac's hard drive icon and find the System
Folder. Inside that is a folder called Preferences; in there you
will see a folder called Netscape. Inside that will be a file
called Netscape Preferences. Drag that file to your desktop, and
retart your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Try to start Netscape as you usually would and see if it opens
properly. If it does, then your old Preferences file was probably
corrupted, and you can throw out the one on your desktop. Netscape
will create a new Preferences file if it doesn't find one in the
System Folder. One side effect of discarding your Preferences file,
though, is that your custom settings (including your choice of home
page and font size) will return to the default settings, so you
will have to reset them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the minimum software I would need to make my own Web
pages?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you want to take the time to learn HyperText Markup
Language (HTML), the code used to create Web pages, you can get by
with just a basic text editor like the Windows WordPad or the
SimpleText program that comes with each Macintosh. You can view
your Web pages with any Web browser, and you may want to get an
image-editing program for use with graphics and pictures on your
page. A file transfer program like WS-FTP for Windows (or Fetch for
the Mac) will be needed to upload your finished pages to your Web
server.
</P>
<P>
   Most people would rather not have to learn HTML, and there are
plenty of commercial programs available that will let you create
your Web pages by dragging and dropping objects and type onto a
page layout. These programs convert your creations into the HTML
code, and some also include site-management tools that help you
keep track of all the pages on your site. GoLive from Adobe Systems
and HomeSite from Allaire are two options. Programs like Complete
Web Studio by Sierra Home are aimed at home users and simplify the
process even more.
</P>
<P>
   The latest versions of Microsoft Word for both Mac and Windows
will let you save Word documents as HTML files. Many Internet
service providers like America Online will not only give you space
on their servers to keep your Web pages but will also offer you
simple programs to help you create your own pages.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A man's house is his castle _ moat
and all
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A fellow I know who is moving across the country
sent his wife on ahead to find them a house.
</P>
<P>
   When I talked with him the other day, his wife had called to
tell him she had found them a house.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any house, but absolutely the very house that he's
always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It was a brand new house in a brand new development, she said,
and, in fact, they would be among the very first families moving
in.
</P>
<P>
   This struck him as somewhat of a surprise, seeing as how the
very house he had always wanted was an older house in an
established part of town.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he told me. But he didn't tell his wife. He didn't
have the chance. She was talking too fast.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't tell his wife that. She was still talking too
fast.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen has the kind of counter tops they've always wanted,
she told him, and in the back yard there's this concrete thing
where the water runs off, but she couldn't wait for him to see the
counter tops because they were the very kind they had always
wanted, and _
</P>
<P>
   He finally managed to get a word in.
</P>
<P>
   Back up a minute, he said. What concrete thing where what water
runs off where?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you know, she said. No, he said, he didn't know. Tell me, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, she said, it's very nice. She was thinking it would be the
place where the children would like to play.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say what he was thinking. What he was thinking was
drainage ditch.
</P>
<P>
   By that time she was back to the kitchen counter tops. Finally,
he managed to again interrupt her.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, he said, exactly how the lay of the land is in the back
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I don't know, she said. Sort of higher up along the fence
and dipping down in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautiful, she was saying. It's a bog, he was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's what he told me, but I don't think he told his
wife that. I don't think he had the chance. She was already back
talking about the kitchen counter tops, and this time he didn't
interrupt to ask anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been me, I would have asked more about the kitchen
counter tops.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, I would have asked how high off the floor they were.
</P>
<P>
   I think that after they buy this house, and I think they will,
they're going to want counter tops that are high off the floor,
particularly when it rains a lot.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not anything I would tell him. I would tell him how
lucky he is that his wife has found the very house he's always
wanted. I would tell him it's a moving experience.

 &HT;    Preparation now can keep air-conditioning costs down
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We got a preview of summer over the last week with temperatures
in the 80s coupled with high relative humidity, so you might
already be using air conditioning at home.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule of thumb, though, you should use your air conditioners
as little as possible, because cooling your house generally costs
more than heating it. Getting the most out of the money you spend
on air conditioning requires many of the same measures you use to
increase your home's energy efficiency in winter.
</P>
<P>
   _ PREPARING THE HOUSE FOR SUMMER MODE
</P>
<P>
   Start at the top. Attic spaces can become stiflingly hot as the
sun beats down on the roof. Insulation on the attic floor or in the
frames of upper-floor bedrooms in story-and-a-half homes will help
keep that heat out of your living spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Energy's recommended attic insulation for
our climate is R-38. R-value is a measure of an insulating
material's resistance to heat transmission: The higher the value,
the more effective the insulation.
</P>
<P>
   An R-38 rating requires about 13 inches of fiberglass insulation
or 11 inches of loose cellulose. Before the most intense heat of
summer kicks in, this is a good time for upgrading attic insulation
to recommended standards.
</P>
<P>
   Also check out your attic ventilation. Air should have vents to
circulate through your attic so some of the heated air can flow out
and be replaced with cooler fresh air from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Hibner, manager of the Dayton Power and Light Co. Energy
Resource Center, said that if you have replacement windows with
storm windows that open and close, keep them closed all over the
house when your central air-conditioning system is running.
</P>
<P>
   Have your central air-conditioning system professionally
serviced at the intervals suggested in the system's owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   Between professional servicing, keep the area near the system's
outside condenser open. Trim nearby shrubs, high grass and other
plants and clean the grates with a soft brush occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning works most efficiently when air flow through
the system is unobstructed. That means that, in addition to keeping
the condenser clear, you should change or clean the filter on your
furnace at recommended intervals during the cooling season.
</P>
<P>
   The filters on window air conditioners also should be cleaned on
a regular basis. Most units have a filter of foam rubber or some
other material behind a removable plastic grate at the front of the
window unit.
</P>
<P>
   Often the filter can be washed and replaced. Clean the plastic
grate over the filter with a vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Also be sure your window air conditioner fits snugly in the
window or wall opening where it is installed. If there are gaps
around the air conditioner or around any windows in rooms where it
is used, they should be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Check the display where weather-stripping is sold in your
favorite home store; you probably will find something that will
make your rooms more airtight.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure other appliances are set for summer. Turn off your
humidifier. Set your clothes dryer to vent outdoors, and be sure
the vent cover is working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Close the fireplace damper.
</P>
<P>
   Hibner said another way to keep your house cooler is to avoid
turning on the kitchen range. When possible, use a microwave or
small cooking appliance that cools down more quickly than a
full-size range or oven.
</P>
<P>
   _ TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FANS, SHADE
</P>
<P>
   You should also provide shade on the south and west sides of the
house to keep out direct sunlight, Hibner said.
</P>
<P>
   Shade can be outside in the form of retractable awnings or trees
that shed their leaves in winter. Or shade can be indoors in the
form of blinds, shades or drapes that can be drawn when the sun is
strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Fans use only a fraction of the energy of air conditioners, and
they're often all you need to keep cool.
</P>
<P>
   Hibner said homeowners should remember to adjust their ceiling
fans to blow down in summer. Ceiling fans should blow toward the
ceiling in winter to circulate heated air around a room. In summer,
ceiling fans create a breeze across the skin, making people
underneath them feel cooler.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn on your air conditioner, start with a thermostat
setting of about 78 degrees. Using ceiling fans in conjunction with
air conditioners makes rooms more comfortable and might allow a
higher thermostat setting.
</P>
<P>
   Box fans and smaller fans work best when they can contribute to
cross ventilation in a room. Open windows on both ends of a space,
especially during evening hours, and use the fan to move air from
one set of windows to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your screens in good repair so they keep pests out when
your windows are being used for ventilation. You'll find
inexpensive kits to patch screen holes at hardware and
home-improvement stores.

 &HT;    Trader Publishing acquisition to double circulation
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trader Publishing Co., partially owned by Atlanta-based Cox
Enterprises, will nearly double its weekly circulation with a $520
million acquisition of 300 free-distribution, classified
advertising magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Trader Publishing, based in Norfolk, Va., is already the largest
publisher of niche advertising publications for automobiles and
boats, according to Conrad M. Hall, Trader's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Enterprises, owner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and
Landmark Communications each own 50 percent of Trader. Landmark,
based in Norfolk, owns the Weather Channel and other media
properties. Cox referred questions about the transaction to Trader.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Dallas-based publisher UAP Inc. will expand
Trader's offerings into the apartment and real estate segments,
where Trader has relatively little presence, Hall said Tuesday.
UAP's top publications include Apartments for Rent and Harmon
Homes.
</P>
<P>
   Trader will buy UAP from London-based United News &AMP; Media.
United News is selling several units as part of a planned merger
with Carlton Communications that will create the United Kingdom's
largest commercial TV company.
</P>
<P>
   Trader has annual revenue of $650 million, and the new
properties will give the company additional revenue of $300
million, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the new titles will bolster Trader's weekly free
circulation by 4.1 million. Trader already has free circulation of
3.6 million and paid circulation of 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among Trader's 355 titles are Auto Trader, Boat Trader, Auto
Mart and The Employment Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the publications are distributed in convenience stores,
groceries and vending boxes in markets throughout the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The company also operates Web sites such as Traderonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   UAP has little presence on the Internet, Hall said. ``We hope to
dramatically expand their Internet offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he expects the acquisition of UAP to close by the end
of June, but it first must be reviewed by the U.S. Justice
Department. Hall said he doesn't expect any problems.

A GARDENING CHORE WITHOUT ANY BLISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it was such a beautiful, sunny day, I suppose I could have
been outside, shoveling compost and dirt into the big hole where
the pond used to be before we got the dog that likes to swim and
eat electric pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I was at my computer, trying to move icons that
represented a clump of Stella de Oro day lilies across a grid to an
area occupied by some icons that represented ostrich ferns. Those
needed to be deleted because _ have I mentioned this already? _ the
dog chews on ostrich ferns. With the little icons' habit of
clumping up on each other, that click-and-move exercise is harder
than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   So are most gardening chores. With blisters imminent and the
hole in the yard still half-empty, I was lucky last week to stumble
across this free Landscape Planner tool while I was shopping at
Garden.com. Within minutes of creating a plan and naming it ``Area
Formerly Known as the Pond Garden,'' I forgot all about the gaping
problem in the (real) area and instead began to daydream about the
soothing, silvery-leafed hostas I was (virtually) planting in the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I preferred the icons to the actual digging, because
for me the pleasures of gardening have always been as much about
avoiding any job as doing it. I think that's why I spend so many
hours in the winter huddled with seed catalogs, planning ambitious
acres of cutting gardens at a time when the ground is too frozen to
work.
</P>
<P>
   If you share my, uh, relaxed sensibility, then the Internet is
the perfect place to shop for plants. That's because I learned,
during a recent online shopping trip, that it is not easy to find
everything you need quickly or in a single place. So you will
probably be forced to delay both gratification and physical labor.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively few full-service plant and garden-supply
retailers with large inventories who have ventured into the online
market. Live plants, after all, are fragile. They should be
inserted into the dirt only during certain seasons. And they are
notoriously cranky about being packed and shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Not to belittle any concerns the plants might have, but as a
shopper I would like to see bigger selections. I had hoped, last
week, to save a lot of time by comparing prices online, then
placing a fast order or two. With a wait of a few days for
delivery, I would have plenty of time to dig or more likely, to
supervise the shoveling efforts of my husband, who loves the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my town,'' said CarrieAnn Cutler, a researcher at Gomez
Associates who studies the online garden retail market, ``there are
five stores where I can go out and look at each plant I'm buying.
It's hard to compete with that. But this should be a segment
fulfilled by many more retailers, so I think you'll see that the
growth is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler recommended Myseasons.com (www.myseasons.com) in addition
to Garden.com (www10.garden.com). Both offer full refunds for
unsatisfactory merchandise, and she said she liked them for their
site tools and reference materials, and for fulfilling the wide
range of plant needs of both beginners and expert gardeners. If you
order, make sure you know what you are getting. Garden.com, for
instance, ships stock in different sizes and conditions, depending
on the plant. Unlike a local nursery, which at this time of year
will sell most plants in containers, perennials you buy online may
come bare-root.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the online landscape consists of established
mail-order catalog companies that have put up tandem Web sites, as
well as thousands of smaller retailers specializing in specific
plants. While those sites tend to be idiosyncratic _ for instance,
some can only handle online orders that arrive via e-mail and
others have no plant photos _ they may offer wide selections of
their specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Two I like are Hortico Nurseries (www.hortico.com), a Canadian
grower with more than 700 varieties of roses (but watch out for the
hefty shipping costs), and Granite Hill Gardens
(www.granitehillgardens.com), headquartered in Maine. Granite Hill
has a wide selection of ornamental shrubs and responded within two
hours last week by e-mail to a pricing question about a certain
rhododendron (Ken Janeck) whose blossoms start out bright pink,
then fade.
</P>
<P>
   To test the online arms of the mail-order catalog companies,
last week I made a shopping list of about a dozen fairly common
plants widely available in my local nurseries at this time of year:
perennials like Heuchera Palace Purple and Japanese painted ferns,
rhododendrons (Purple Gem) and a sprawling old rose called
Zephirine Drouhin.
</P>
<P>
   I went shopping at three reliable companies _ Jackson and
Perkins (www.jacksonandperkins.com), White Flower Farm
(www.whiteflowerfarm.com) and Wayside Gardens
(www.waysidegardens.wte.net) _ whose plants I have bought, with
satisfaction, in the past. While each had at least one of the items
on my shopping list, none offered all or even most. In fact, many
perennials and roses were sold out. (The Wayside Gardens site was
not updated to reflect sold out merchandise. Only when I phoned a
toll-free number to double check did I learn which items were no
longer available.)
</P>
<P>
   When I phoned Renee Beaulieu, White Flower Farm's public
relations manager, to ask about the possibility of restocking, she
said that I was too late this year to get a climbing rose called
New Dawn and that I also could forget about a Begonia mixture that
I coveted. As for the rest of the 600 products in the company's
spring catalog? ``We're really at the end of our ordering season,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu suggested instead that I order next spring's bulbs now.
The selection of 600 different bulbs from the company's fall bulb
catalog is online; orders placed before July 1 will get a 5 percent
discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can order them today and you won't deliver them until the
fall?'' I asked. ``There's no way I could go outside and plant them
now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The iris we start shipping in August,'' Beaulieu said. ``Most
others, later.''
</P>
<P>
   August is a long way away. So it seemed safe to order $178 worth
of iris reticulata and yellow hyacinths and purple tulips.
</P>
<P>
   That freed me to return to the Landscape Planner at Garden.com,
where I also ordered Heuchera Palace Purple ($4.99 a plant for
bareroot specimens, compared with $11.99 for a bushy container
plant at a local nursery). Garden.com informed me the plants would
not arrive before May 15, which gives me enough time to think about
how an icon representing a big brown dog might look sitting right
in the middle of them.

   New York Mayor and Senate candidate Rudy Giuliani, who has been
seen frequently in public with a close female friend, Judith
Nathan, announced today he's arranging for a formal separation from
his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover. Giuliani told reporters that
he has spoken to Hanover and his two children about the move, but
refused to give details. ''It's been a very painful road; hopefully
we'll come to an agreement that protects our children,'' Giuliani
said. ``This is something that has developed over some period of
time.'' Giuliani emphasized that he is not yet getting a divorce.
Hanover, an actress and TV personality, is rarely seen in public

<P>
   BUSH PROPOSES HEALTH CARE TAX BREAKS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush moved further onto traditionally Democratic turf
by proposing tax incentives for the elderly to buy health care
insurance, and financial relief for people who care for a parent or
other elderly relative at home. He did this today at the Ridgecrest
Village Senior Center in Davenport, Iowa. The plans were fueled by
statistics showing that half of older women and one-third of older
men are likely to need nursing home care. Under the first proposal,
Bush would provide a full income tax deduction for long-term care
insurance payments to everyone not already on employer-subsidized
long-term care plans. Estimated cost: $5.1 billion over five years.
Bush also proposed establishing an additional tax exemption for
each elderly spouse, parent or other relative cared for in
someone's home. That exemption is currently $2,750 a year.
Estimated cost of that: $2.3 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   BUT W., WE HARDLY KNOW YOU
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush urged newspaper execs today to focus on issues of
substance rather than political sniping. Speaking from Iowa via
satellite to the Newspaper Association of America convention in New
York, Bush was pressed by New York Times publisher Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger Jr. about his willingness to meet with newspapers'
editorial boards. Bush has complained to his traveling press corps
that the Times' opinion pages are too liberal for his taste.
Sulzberger said he had informally surveyed some of his colleagues
at the convention _ both liberals and conservatives _ and none had
met Bush personally. ``For those of us who have responsibility for
the editorials that run in our papers and for helping to shape that
point of view up to and including endorsements, we feel a little
bit of loss not being able to actually sit down with you, look you
in the eye and have a bit of a discussion and dialogue,'' the
publisher said.

   COACH OSBORNE WINS A BIG ONE
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg took the first step
toward reclaiming Sen. Bob Kerrey's seat for the Republicans,
easily defeating Secretary of State Scott Moore and two other
candidates in the GOP primary. Stenberg will take on popular former
Gov. Ben Nelson, who easily beat a homeless man who was his only
opponent in the Democratic primary. And retired Nebraska Cornhusker
football coach Tom Osborne routed his two opponents in a GOP
contest for the House and will face Democrat Rollie Reynolds, a
real estate investor, in November. In West Virginia, Gov. Cecil
Underwood, who was elected to his first term as governor in 1956
and to his second term in 1996, easily won the GOP nomination for a
third term. At 77, Underwood is the nation's oldest governor. He is
also the only Republican in a statewide office in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH WITH EDGE IN ELECTORAL COLLEGE
</P>
<P>
   Six various state polls were released today on big Electoral
College states with the most potential impact in the November
general election. Al Gore led 50-36 percent in California and 56-36
percent in New York, giving him firm leads in the two largest
states with a total of 87 electoral votes. George W. Bush led 70-23
percent in his home state of Texas and 47-40 percent in Florida,
where his brother Jeb is governor _ two states with a total 57
electoral votes. Gore and Bush were statistically tied in
Pennsylvania and Illinois _ two states with 45 electoral votes.
Overall, Bush leads or has an edge in 17 states with 183 electoral
votes, while Gore is ahead in 10 states with 146 electoral votes,
according to an analysis of state polls out this year. Electoral
votes needed to win: 270.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD THING HE GOT HIMSELF SCREENED
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani, New York Newsday reports, has slashed funds for
prostate cancer screening in his current New York City budget plan.
Giuliani, who was diagnosed with the disease himself a couple weeks
ago, would eliminate a $750,000 program to provide free testing to
uninsured New Yorkers. Other potential cuts in public health
include a $2.1 million reduction for health programs for poor
children and a $1 million cut for family planning services in poor
communities suffering from high infant mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
   THEORETICALLY, YES _ POLITICALLY, EH?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, who's been something of a stealth supporter of the
proposed trade deal with China, has finally flown a few sorties
visible on everyone's radar screen. With a tough House vote on the
deal two weeks away, Gore, at the White House with the current
president and two ex's _ Jimmy Carter and Jerry Ford _ gave his
most robust defense yet of the deal to give China normal trading
status on a permanent basis, despite the fierce opposition of
unions, environmentalists and human rights activists: ``It is right
for American jobs. It is right for the cause of reform in China,
and I believe it will move us closer to the strong and stable world
community that we all seek to create.'' Even so, questions remained
about whether his heart's in the effort, and whether a Gore
administration would do much to expand free trade. ``I don't think
he's motivated on this,'' says Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for
International Economics, who backs lowered trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   COME HULL AND HIGH WATER
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Arizona Gov. Jane Hull's endorsement of a
fellow governor, George W. Bush, over her fellow Arizonan, John
McCain, left bad feelings. Last month, Hull agreed to give up the
governor's prerogative of leading the state's delegation to the
Republican convention. McCain easily won the primary and thus the
right to control the state's 30-member convention delegation. Now,
the New York Times reports that McCain wants his wife, Cindy, to
lead the delegation instead, something that rankles Hull
supporters. The issue is to be decided at the state party
convention on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN JOCKEYING FOR 2004 POSITION
</P>
<P>
   John McCain positioned himself for a possible presidential bid
in 2004 with his belated endorsement of George W. Bush. Senior
McCain campaign aides say that they expect the three-term senator
from Arizona to seek the White House four years from now if Bush
loses to Al Gore in November. The defeated Republican challenger
embraced Bush just warmly enough at their summit in Pittsburgh to
escape blame if the Texas governor goes down. But McCain signaled
that his hard-hitting populist insurgency is merely sidelined _ and
not scuttled _ by his defeat at the hands of Bush's privately
funded $70 million juggernaut in the GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   NO JOCKEYING AT ALL WITH BRADLEY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore still has not met with Bill Bradley, who has not stumped
or raised funds for Gore since grudgingly agreeing to help him two
months ago. The ex-New Jersey senator has refused to relinquish his
nearly 500 delegates and has refrained from urging the 3 million
Americans who voted for him to switch their allegiance to the vice
president. There has been no public purging of the bad blood
Bradley has for Gore, whom he said cannot be trusted with the
presidency. Said Mike Murphy, chief media strategist for John
McCain, to the Washington Times: ``Bradley still has enough
national stature to create huge and horrific problems for Gore.
Bradley's important and is being ignored by Gore. And if Bradley
wanted to, he could make a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   BAYH-BAYH AND NIGHTY-NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton says he hopes someday to cast a presidential
vote for Sen. Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat seen as a possible
running mate for Al Gore. Clinton heaped much praise on Bayh at a
fund-raising event in Maryland for Indiana Rep. Baron Hill. Bayh
attended the fund-raiser, but left before Clinton's speech so he
could return home to tuck his children into bed. ``He went home,
and he should have,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   TEXANS MOVING IN
</P>
<P>
   Another ally of George W. Bush has joined the Republican
National Committee. Ray Hunt of Dallas, chairman and CEO of Hunt
Oil Co., has been named finance chairman of the RNC's Victory 2000
Committee. Hunt is a longtime supporter and close friend of Bush.
The head of the committee is another Texas Republican, Fred Meyer,
a former state party chairman. Having sewn up the GOP presidential
nomination, Bush has been shifting allies to the RNC. Other Bush
backers now there include his campaign political director, Maria
Cino, a deputy for political and congressional relations; and
Jeanne Johnson Phillips, one of Bush's original Texas fund-raisers,
now deputy chairman for operations.
</P>
<P>
   NO WHINING, JUST MOAN-ING
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's new interim chairman says he wants to hold
onto the job despite its obvious drawbacks. The party ``sort of
runs the chairman instead of the other way around,'' said Gerry
Moan. ``It's not easy.'' Moan, vice chairman since July, became
chairman of the fractious organization when Pat Choate resigned
last week, citing family illness. Party officials, as well as a
presidential nominee, are to be elected at the Reform convention
Aug. 10-13 in Long Beach, Calif. Moan, 52, is a Long Island, N.Y.,
native who moved to Tucson, Ariz., in 1998. He is a materials
manager for Maxi Switch Inc., a manufacturer of computer circuit
boards.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET FILTER IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet and nonstop news cycles has repaved the
road to the White House. But despite the big changes brought on by
online access to campaigns, a primaries post-mortem by Eric Hauser
and Howard Opinsky, press secretaries for Bill Bradley and John
McCain respectively, concluded that television still remains the
best way to connect with the voters. Money may be raised over the
Internet, but it's spent on TV advertising. The workshop itself was
an Internet event, available via a live interactive video stream on
CNN's allpolitics.com Web site. It was sponsored by the Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at
Harvard, in collaboration with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   CATSKILLS SCHTICK, BUT THE YIDDISH ACCENT?
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist Al Gore tried out a Borscht Belt routine before
about 450 members of the Anti-Defamation League in Washington. He
noted his presidential campaign is headquartered in Nashville and
dished up what he called the latest top ``Jewish
Country-and-Western'' tunes to come out of Music City . No. 4: ``I
was one of the chosen people until she chose somebody else.'' No.
3: ``The second time she said `Shalom' I knew she meant goodbye.''
No. 2: ``I've got my foot on the glass, now where are you?'' And
No. 1 (drum roll, please): ``Mommas don't let your ungrateful sons
grow up to be cowboys when they could very easily just have taken
over the family business that my own grandfather broke his back to
start and my father sweated over for years, which apparently
doesn't mean anything now that you're turning your back on such a
gift.'' The audience roared with laughter and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY CHALLENGER SHORT OF SIGNATURES
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that Republicans might not have a Senate
nominee this year in Massachusetts, GOP hopeful Jack E. Robinson
said today he has collected enough signatures to challenge Sen.
Edward Kennedy in November. Robinson said he submitted 13,000
signatures to local town clerks before the 5 p.m. Tuesday deadline.
U.S. Senate candidates need 10,000 certified signatures to get on
the ballot. Of those 13,000, only 5,800 have been certified so far,
according to Secretary of State William Galvin, and the remainder
are subject to challenge for a variety of reasons. Robinson, 39, is
an African-American former Eastern Airlines executive now running a
cell phone business. If he fails to get on the ballot, it will mark
the first time since 1916, the year United States senators began
being popularly elected, that a Massachusetts Democratic Senate
candidate will run without Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   YOU SCRATCH MY BACK . . .
</P>
<P>
   A coming fund-raiser in Georgia is stoking speculation about
political races four years or so down the road. On Monday, Jeanne
Shaheen, the Democratic governor of New Hampshire, will be the
beneficiary of an event in Atlanta _ a bit south of Concord _ that
planners hope will raise at least $25,000 for her re-election. And
one of the hosts, as well as one of the contributors, will be
Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, a first-term Democrat who is beginning to
win national attention for his policies on improving schools and
limiting sprawl. The New York Times quoted Barnes chief of staff
Robert Kahn as saying his boss is simply supporting a fellow
Democratic governor, not pocketing a chit to be cashed for New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary in 2004 or 2008. The event
for Shaheen is being organized by Michael Coles, a prominent party
fund-raiser and Barnes ally who met Shaheen while working for Vice
Al Gore in New Hampshire last winter.

   IF IT LOOKS LIKE RAPE ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. In New Orleans for Mardi Gras and drinking heavily, my
friends and I got separated. When I returned to our hotel, I found
my college roommate in bed with a girl from our school. Days later,
I learned he'd had sex with her while she was in a
drug-and-alcohol-induced stupor. In my view, he is a rapist, but I
don't know how to react, given my friendship with him and my
sympathies for her.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Virginia
</P>
<P>
   A. This does sound like date rape, and the first thing you
should consider are the wishes of the victim. How is she
responding? Does she want to report this to the police? What help
would she like from you? Her interests are paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Your attitude toward the rapist should be shaped by his attitude
toward his crime. If he is remorseful and has asked his victim's
forgiveness and looked for a way to make amends and sought
counseling, then you can continue your friendship. Remember, people
make bad _ even dreadful _ choices. It is how they respond to their
errors that is key. However, if he brushes off the entire matter,
then you should have no more to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how could you? Will you introduce him to your other
female friends? Will you warn them to avoid him? It is difficult to
see how you could ever again think of him in an amicable and
unguarded way.
</P>
<P>
   And you should say all this to him. Tell him that you value his
friendship, but that unless he takes this seriously and realizes
that he has a problem with drinking, or alcohol, or women, then you
can no longer be his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Back in high school, a girlfriend and I debated the abortion
issue in Sunday school. I favored legal abortion; she did not, even
to save the mother's life, because if a woman died it was God's
will. A few years later, she sent me a letter detailing her own
abortion. Now, decades later, she is a professor at a college of
our denomination. Should I out her?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Illinois
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd chalk up her conversion to necessity; life has a way of
altering our adolescent ideas. If I were held to everything I
advocated in high school, I'd still be listening to the Dave Clark
Five and sporting an unattractive haircut _ not a pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   If her work at the college does not include taking an
anti-abortion stand, then her personal beliefs on this issue are
not relevant, and you should respect her privacy: that is, no
outing. If, however, she aggressively takes a public anti-abortion
stand, then her hypocrisy is entirely to the point, and you can
include it in the debate. But before you take so strong a step,
have a conversation with your old friend. It can't hurt to know
more about the causes of her action and the consequences of yours.
</P>
<P>
   Q. While working for a major studio, some co-workers and I were
mistakenly issued extra paychecks. I suggested that we alert the
payroll department, but my friends disagreed. Since the show was
almost over, payroll would not have time to uncover the mistake.
Plus, we had worked extra hours for a particularly parsimonious
studio. I put my check away uncashed but never called payroll
because that would be snitching on my friends. Was my response
appropriate?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some people think that the American film industry is stale
and unimaginative, but I'm encouraged by the boundless ingenuity of
your colleagues when it comes to justifying whatever happens to be
in their interest. Of course you can't keep the money. And while
you needn't explicitly inform on your friends, you must tell the
payroll office about the mistake with your check.

INVASION OF THE DESIGN LAB MUTANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also INDUSTRIAL-GELS) By STEPHEN P. WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time, in the distant '80s, when Corian
was such an exotic material it had to be installed by licensed
technicians. Now it's just another tired surface at Home Depot, and
everyone is lusting for raw concrete countertops that resemble
picnic tables at a state penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   New materials for the home are being introduced daily, some with
the half-lives of fashion accessories. Recently, a fabric coated
with Philippine chicken feathers came on the market, in the form of
lampshades. Surely some enterprising design aficionado already has
fantasies about feathering his breakfast nook. Can infamy, and
Kmart, be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners of America, the future is here. Picture a house clad
with shiny steel shingles. Imagine traversing a floor made of glass
tiles suspended several inches in the air on thin metal posts.
Would you feel safe sleeping next to walls made of loose rock held
in place by supersize garden fencing? How would the neighbors react
to a house built from concrete pig-sty partitions?
</P>
<P>
   All these materials and more are available from a growing number
of designers who are bypassing traditional materials _ wood,
plaster and marble _ for less costly industrial supplies. Driven by
budget, or simply eager to explore the sculptural possibilities and
light transmission of unconventional fabrics and resins, designers
read chemistry journals, NASA Web sites and labels in hardware
stores. They advocate chemical filters as wallpaper and medical gel
packs as seat cushions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undergoing a design revolution in the use of materials
these days,'' said Paola Antonelli, an associate curator in the
department of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art.
She foresaw this change in her groundbreaking 1995 show at the
Modern called ``Mutant Materials,'' which credited scientists with
inventing the new materials that architects and designers use in
unorthodox ways.
</P>
<P>
   Material Connexion is the place to find these new materials in
Manhattan. Anyone with $500 dollars for four hours of assisted
research is welcome to explore this for-profit private archive at 4
Columbus Circle. The architecture team Diller &AMP; Scofidio thumbed
through the thousands of samples on file while researching
materials for their innovative redesign of the Brasserie restaurant
on East 53rd Street. The cash-poor can view design riches in the
free lobby exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   While Material Connexion has its share of natural materials like
coconut fabric and bamboo paneling, most of the samples are plastic
or metal. While design-minded inhabitants of the late 20th century
considered fake materials declasse, today's strivers say materials
can't be fake enough. Brazenly artificial resins, chemical foams
and bizarre three-dimensional fabrics are all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the changes we're seeing now will be as radical as what
happened in the '60s,'' said George Beylerian, who founded Material
Connexion four years ago. ``Plexiglass was new. Urethanes.
Beautiful lacquers and plastics. Materials then made designers
jump. I give the equation M equals D: materials drive design.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But it's also true that materials can drive architects
and designers crazy. The very fact of its newness means that a
material has to be tested before it is used, to be sure it is
strong enough and doesn't have some undesirable quality like toxic
vapors. Building codes offer some protection against faulty
applications. Some decisions are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de
Meuron were not taking engineering risks when they designed walls
made of loose rock held in check by wire mesh cages at the Dominus
Estate Winery in the Napa Valley. They knew at the mesh, called
gabion, had been used to hold back rocky hillsides all over the
Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But often architects must don white coats and investigate. This
willingness to explore is essential to the work of Jeff Parsons and
Manuel Fernandez-Casteleiro of Manhattan, who used a transparent
mesh divider in their White Street office made from tennis court
fence windscreens, to add the appearance of structure without a
wall. The architects' inventive nature prompted a Park Avenue
couple to let them build an elevated glass floor in their
apartment's art gallery/guest room. Parsons and
Fernandez-Casteleiro designed the floor to reflect diffused light
from the cloth-covered windows back up onto their paintings. In the
process they gave the apartment some thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnight guests said the reflections from the glass were so
disorienting they feared having to make their way to the
bathroom,'' said a beaming Fernandez-Casteleiro.
</P>
<P>
   He can beam because he knows there is no real danger. The
architects designed the steel pegs and glass tiles themselves,
laboriously poring over computer simulations and a mock-up on their
office floor to make sure the client would not be hearing the sound
of breaking glass. The only person who ended up suffering was the
apartment's housekeeper: The gap between the glass and the subfloor
makes a perfect lint trap. But the only way to get a vacuum in
there is to lift up the floor tiles one by one with a suction cup.
Is this in anyone's job description?
</P>
<P>
   The apartment was recently sold, and one suspects the new owners
will just rip everything out and start over, perhaps with something
practical like a parquet floor. But all is not lost. The couple
asked the designers to make over their next town house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about mutating the glass floors to the walls as
a way of dematerializing the interior of the town house,''
Fernandez-Casteleiro said. Housekeepers, pray for release to the
god of Windex.
</P>
<P>
   But mutating is what these guys do best. They encased the bar at
the East Village restaurant Coup in the same rubber used as shock
absorbers in bridge construction. The finished bar has the look of
unpolished black Corian and the feel of a bicycle grip. Equally
surprising is that the deep mahogany colored ``wood'' panels in
Coup are made from phenolic resin, a plastic normally used to
insulate high-voltage switches.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Diller and Richard Scofidio, who won the James Beard
award for restaurant design on Monday for the Brasserie, in the
windowless basement of the Seagram Building, also specialize in
mutating materials. Wanting to suggest transparency at the
entrance, they called on Mary Bright, who specializes in
architectural curtains _ not the velvet kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bright suggested an entry curtain that appeared to billow even
though it was immobile, and subjected mesh and plastic to what she
calls a stretch test, meaning she hung them in her studio for a few
days to see if they changed shape. The resulting ``wall'' does not
seem too far removed from a shower curtain, except for one
curiously compelling detail. Faced with city ordinances, Bright
installed shiny zippers that let a small panel of mesh curtain fall
away, revealing an exit sign that glows mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   Another ethereal glow emanates from the resin tables Diller and
Scofidio designed for the restaurant. ``Elizabeth gave us pretty
detailed drawings, with the metal understructure visible from above
the tabletop,'' said Karen Atta, of Atta Inc, the Manhattan
workshop that made the tables. ``It was a real challenge to cast
the understructure directly into the resin, which we'd never done
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Resin, which is a type of cast plastic, tends to expand and
contract at a faster rate than metal, and on Atta's first seven or
eight attempts the resin cracked right off the metal as it cooled.
Finally she devised a way to slow the cooling process and solve the
problem. Atta recently began selling similar tables to the public
at prices ranging from $700 to $3,000 _ example of how new
materials can be more expensive than the old-fashioned ones.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rockhill, an architect, and his associate, David Sain, take
a similarly labor-intensive approach to the houses they build
themselves around Lawrence, Kan., using hand-cut steel shingles
unpainted concrete panels.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhill continues his radical experiments with his students at
the University of Kansas who have banded together under the moniker
Studio 804. They chose an unusual marine-grade plywood to clad a
home built for a low income family in Lawrence. The plywood is made
from okoume, a water-resistant wood from Gabon _ available through
North American Plywood in Santa Fe Springs, Calif. It is a lustrous
brown, is reasonably priced for good-looking wood siding at 89
cents a square foot, and needs a only a coat of varnish for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Future generations of au courant materials will not only have to
look good and be strong, they will need many of the senses that
humans have, said Atonelli at Modern. Foams now ``remember'' shapes
and there are fabrics that release antibacterial substances.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media
Laboratory envision superhuman abilities for future materials. They
predict that the dividing line will blur between objects in the
home and the computers that will run them. For these houses, far
``smarter'' than those being created today, materials had also
better be on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your shoes should be retrieving the day's personalized news
from the carpet before you even have time to take off your coat,''
says one Media Lab manifesto. If these explorers have their way,
weird plastics and chicken feather fabrics will soon seem as quaint
as bricks and mortar.

GEL THAT BREAKS THE MOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (With INDUSTRIAL-MATERIALS0  
 By JULIE V. IOVINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Considering the appeal of gels you can eat (Jell-O in
the sandbox years, salmon aspic in your Julia Child phase), why has
it taken so long for gels to become an ingredient in furnishings?
</P>
<P>
   Gel, also called techno-gel, is a semiliquid polyurethane. It is
notable for its elasticity and for its ability to absorb shock and
conform to or ``remember'' shapes. It was first used by the
orthopedic industry on hospital mattresses, wheelchair seats and
wrist and arm rests. Gel seats cushion aging bikers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are attracted to its natural translucence and
jewel-bright color quality. Rem Koolhaas, the Pritzker
Prize-winning architect, called for gel seating when renovating the
Second Stage Theater on West 43rd Street. At the new Brasserie on
East 53rd Street, gel bar stools are as pliant as the bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Moss, at 146 Greene St., introduces Soft, a chaise
longue created by Werner Aisslinger for Zanotta. A clear blue or
orange gel mattress sits on an aluminum and fiberglass grid, making
the chaise look like a space-age waffle. It's heavy, but durable
enough for outdoor use (though at $4,175, it might be wise to lock
it up). Keen to dip into gel as the trend takes shape, Totem, at 71
Franklin St., will have gel-based pieces by Aisslinger this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's catching on fast,'' said Liat Margolis, the research
director of Material Connexion, the materials archive. ``For a lot
of people,'' she said, ``anything that looks like Gummy Bears is a
good thing.''

PENRY-JONES-THEATER) 
 By MATT WOLF  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For a while they came in pairs, as if progressing
toward some unseen thespian ark: Daniel Day-Lewis and Kenneth
Branagh, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth, Ralph Fiennes and Hugh Grant,
Joseph Fiennes and Jude Law. Every couple of years, Britain offered
up another incipient movie star or two, and an Anglophilic American
public responded enthusiastically. Often starting as ensemble
players at London's fringe and state-financed theaters, they would
emerge out of that egalitarian climate, with its deliberately
alphabetical billing, and go on to leave movie audiences weak at
the knees _ and asking one question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know who the latest one is,'' said James
Frain, the 32-year-old Englishman who plays Natalie Portman's
American boyfriend in the new film ``Where the Heart Is.''
Referring to the current appetite abroad for his own countrymen,
Frain added, somewhat wryly, ``Hollywood is a very impatient
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once international stardom was the preserve of a lucky few
_ Olivier or Burton, Finney or Hopkins or O'Toole _ these days
everyone wants in on the act. The result is a new generation of
Britboys, many of them still sufficiently unknown that you might
spot them on the London subway. But you'd better look fast before
they enter the land of the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between this latest crop and previous ones lies
not in quality but in numbers: instead of pairs, think clusters;
no, better yet, packs. Britpacks. However invidious it may be to
name names, it's hard to resist the temptation. Dominic West, Jason
Isaacs, Dougray Scott, Ioan Gruffudd, Daniel Craig and Kevin McKidd
as well as Frain. To which one could just as easily add Rupert
Penry-Jones, Ben Chaplin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ed Stoppard, James
Purefoy and Paul Bettany. Not to mention Christian Bale, although
his revelatory performance in ``American Psycho'' sets him apart.
For the moment, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good actors over here,'' said Jason Isaacs,
a relative unknown whose glistening eyes could become identifiable
catalysts for fear once ``The Patriot,'' in which he stars, opens
on June 30. The film is a Hollywood period epic set during the
Revolutionary War in which Isaacs plays a British colonel who
becomes the relentless nemesis of Mel Gibson's American rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from a 40-minute teaser for the movie, one gets the
impression that screen evil may not have reached quite such
well-spoken proportions since Ralph Fiennes delivered his
career-making performance in the 1993 film ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever seen anybody as evil as I am,'' said
Isaacs, who in conversation couldn't be warmer or more open. (About
everything, that is, except his age. ``I'm as old as you need me to
be,'' he told a reporter, admitting only to being ``in my 30s.'')
``I kill everything in my path,'' he added. ``I think I cross every
boundary known to man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now on location filming yet another American movie, ``Sweet
November,'' directed by Pat O'Connor and starring Keanu Reeves and
Charlize Theron, Isaacs seems to have crossed that most important
boundary: a role to lift a good company player, of which Britain
boasts literally hundreds, into the next echelon of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Isaacs headed out to the San Francisco set
of ``Sweet November'' earlier this month immediately after
completing a run in a London play. In Gary Mitchell's ``Force of
Change,'' at the Royal Court's Jerwood Theater Upstairs, Isaacs
earned warm reviews _ and $400 a week _ for adopting a Belfast
accent to play a member of that city's Royal Ulster Constabulary.
Seventy-two people saw the show at each sold-out performance,
resulting in a smaller audience throughout the run than might see
one day's screenings of ``The Patriot'' at the average multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Joseph Fiennes went from his own Royal Court play,
``Real Classy Affair,'' by Nick Grosso (the fellow Britboy Nick
Moran, from ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' appeared with
him), to film renown in 1998 courtesy of ``Shakespeare in Love.''
``For a lot of British actors, the theater is home,'' Fiennes said.
``It's what they did before you knew them, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   Frain, for instance, completed his own Royal Court play,
Christopher Shinn's ``Other People,'' earlier this year before
heading back to Los Angeles, his second home of late. But despite
appearing in ``Reindeer Games,'' ``Titus'' and ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' he still manages to avoid many of the annoyances that
accompany celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get recognized, which is fantastic,'' said Frain, who
will next be seen in the Istvan Szabo film ``Sunshine'' with Ralph
Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Dominic West, 30, currently on view as Sandra
Bullock's charming if dangerous boyfriend in ``28 Days.'' (The role
perpetuates the image of the Briton as lethal seducer fondly
remembered from, among others, Jeremy Northam in the 1995 Bullock
film ``The Web.'') But keen London theatergoers in 1997 could have
seen West in a variety of roles at the Old Vic Theater as part of
the director Peter Hall's repertory season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People regenerate or rejuvenate themselves in theater,'' said
Ismail Merchant, the producer who over the years has given early
employment to British actors like Hugh Grant, James Wilby and
Rupert Graves _ all alumni of the Merchant-Ivory movie ``Maurice''
in 1987 _ as well as Ben Chaplin and James Purefoy, both of whom
appeared in the 1995 ``Feast of July.'' ``Theater gives these
actors a boost,'' said Merchant, whose latest film, ``The Golden
Bowl,'' stars Northam, part of a previous crop of British talent,,
``and then Hollywood is eager to devour them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McKidd, 26, first came to attention in ``Small Faces'' and
``Trainspotting,'' both set in his native Scotland, and appeared
last year in the American director Rose Troche's ``Bedrooms and
Hallways,'' playing a bisexual Londoner. In an interview, McKidd,
who made his American stage debut last year at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music in the Racine play ``Britannicus,'' agreed with Merchant:
``You have to go back to the theater just to check in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the theater, he added, you can get feedback: ``You want to
feel what the audience is feeling. If you don't, you start to lose
a bit of the skill.''
</P>
<P>
   McKidd's most recent stage appearance, last fall, was in a
London revival of `` 'Tis Pity She's a Whore,'' the bloodthirsty
Jacobean drama by John Ford. Leading that production was Jude Law,
just before his role in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' brought him an
Oscar nomination and a British Academy Award, raising his movie fee
to what is said to be the $5 million level.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Brits just better? They're certainly better schooled
in the craft, which in turn opens up broader career possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they're so used,'' said the director Mary Harron,
who put Bale, 26, a Welshman, at the murderous center of ``American
Psycho.'' ``These guys are really character actors, whether they're
good-looking or not. I don't think you would ever go see a
Christian Bale performance the way you would, say, a Ben Affleck
performance.''

LONDON: Affleck performance.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She elaborated on the point: ``I like Ben Affleck, but I
wouldn't cast him in anything that involved total transformation.
American acting is very, very personality-based.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where training comes in, even if Bale is one of the few
to have learned the acting trade on the job, not at a drama
academy. (He was barely a teen-ager when he played the well-bred
English boy interned in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Steven
Spielberg's 1987 film, ``Empire of the Sun.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often,'' said Ellis Jones, vice principal of the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art, the prestigious London drama school,
``right from the first audition, you think, `OK, fine; all we've
got to do is get the actor to speak properly and point him at the
casting director.' There are a lot of very strong young males
coming through at the moment. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Jones cites Geoffrey Streatfeild (pronounced
STRET-field), a name that is admittedly hard to forget.
Streatfeild, 25, was plucked from the academy's three-year program
early to start filming a television movie, ``Sword of Honor,''
based on the Evelyn Waugh trilogy, for Channel 4. The film's
producer, Gillian McNeill, spotted Streatfeild in a student
production of the 18th-century British comedy ``The School for
Scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spoiled a little bit in the U.K.,'' said McNeill, whose
television film stars Daniel Craig, yet another Britboy several
years older than Streatfeild. ( Craig played Derek Jacobi's young
lover in the recent film ``Love Is the Devil,'' about Francis
Bacon.) ``There's such a lot of good talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with that talent, fortuitously, comes an ever-expanding
film market, with the result that the two feed off each other.
``It's a result of the widening global marketplace,'' said Debra
Zane, an independent casting director in Los Angeles, whose resume
includes casting a then barely known Ben Chaplin opposite Uma
Thurman in ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs'' in 1996. (More
recently, she worked on ``American Beauty'' and ``Galaxy Quest,''
while Chaplin went on to ``The Thin Red Line,'' among other films.)
</P>
<P>
   Americans remain fascinated with all things British, which can
translate to mean classy and even exotic. ``Producers certainly are
intrigued by English talent,'' said Zane, ``and they always want to
find that fresh face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're slowly developing a worldwide appeal now,'' said
Gruffudd, 26, the Welshman who has progressed from rescuing Kate
Winslet in ``Titanic'' to supporting Glenn Close in the forthcoming
Disney film ``102 Dalmatians.'' (As it happens, Gruffudd's
flatmate, his fellow Welshman Matthew Rhys, is now playing Benjamin
Braddock to Kathleen Turner's Robinson in a West End version of
``The Graduate.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you turn, there's another British actor,'' said
Isaacs of ``The Patriot.'' ``There are loads of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest any performer lose heart amid the apparent onslaught,
Isaacs offers words of solace. ``Just when somebody thinks they've
been left behind because all their peers have made it,'' he said,
``that's when that one makes it.'' &QL;

 LATEST ITEMS ON eBAY: SEIZED LOOT  
 (Circuits)  
 By MINDY SINK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was once the loot of local criminals is now a hot seller on
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is auctioning seized and recovered property online as an
alternative to selling the goods at a local auction or store. The
effort has been so successful that at least two other states are
thinking of following suit.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon began selling items from law enforcement agencies online
last year. Among recent items offered by the state (under the eBay
user ID of oregontrail2000) are cell phones, printers, clothing,
collectible coins, a wheelchair and mountain bikes. Most of the
goods were either forfeited or seized in raids by local law
enforcement agencies or the state Department of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   California and Minnesota have gotten in touch with officials in
Oregon to learn how their states can run similar programs, and
California has put some unclaimed property up for sale on eBay as
part of its own test.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon sells ``just about anything the local police department
seizes in a crime,'' said Nole Bullock, program representative for
the state's Department of Administrative Services, which keeps
track of the state's surplus property. The state also sells surplus
items like traffic lights, street signs and old furniture from
libraries and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said the state had sold a mountain bike for $1,000 and
had received a top bid of $1,425 for a 12-carat opal, although the
reserve price had not been met and the stone remained unsold. Those
items, like much of what is sold, were probably stolen from a
private owner before being confiscated by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two wheelchairs from the police department, and they
must have been stolen from somebody,'' Bullock said. A ``bucket of
miscellaneous tools'' that recently sold for $132.50 was probably
stolen from a construction site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although police auctions and property seizure auctions are not
new, the selling of this merchandise online is proving to be more
profitable than sales through the usual local auctions or sealed
bids at a property warehouse. ``We're more like a consignment
shop,'' Bullock said. ``We're getting an American value instead of
an Oregon value.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bullock said, surplus hubcaps for Crown Victoria
police cars used to be sold shrink-wrapped by the hundreds for a
few hundred dollars. On eBay, he said, a set of four sells for $150
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers come from all over the United States and the world,
including Korea and Italy. For Oregon residents who do not have a
computer or Internet access, the state has set up five computer
terminals in the main property distribution center so people can
bid online.
</P>
<P>
   The state has discovered that the smaller items sell best
online. The shipping costs for items like oak desks are often more
than the selling prices, Bullock said, and buyers often back out
once they realize that they have to pay the shipping costs. Seized
and out-of-service vehicles are also being sold, but they must be
retrieved in person.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's department keeps a steady flow of items on the virtual
auction block, 60 to 100 at a time, and Bullock said the gains from
the sales for the individual state agencies could equal the cost of
hiring one more police officer. Twenty percent of the sales goes
into running the program, and the rest goes back to the
contributing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a certain amount of political heat from the local
auctioneers,'' Bullock said. ``But our duty is to the taxpayers and
to get the best possible return for the property.'' The state
continues to have six local auctions a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon property auction can be found on eBay or at
tpps.das.state.or.us/surplus.

PASSING OF FAIRBANKS ENDS AN ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL KELLEY   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s death this week turns the final page on
one of the great chapters in movie history _ the era of the
swashbuckler.
</P>
<P>
   A scion of Hollywood royalty, Fairbanks became, before the age
of 40, a matinee idol, a respected star of major films, a decorated
hero of World War II and an accomplished producer. Then, in the
early 1950s, after starring in several films of diminishing
quality, he turned his back on motion pictures and became a
powerful executive in the then-new medium of television.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks may not have attained the legendary stature of his
actor father, Douglas Fairbanks, the silent screen's first and
greatest swashbuckler. But he was a more versatile performer and
certainly a better businessman.
</P>
<P>
   He was also easy to make friends with, as I found early in 1980,
when I drove from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to North Palm Beach for an
afternoon interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks, wearing white canvas shoes, yellow slacks and a blue
blazer, greeted me warmly with a pitcher of iced tea and two
glasses. As we talked, he guided me around his small estate on the
inland waterway _ ``The Vicarage,'' built in the '20s by grateful
parishioners for their local pastor. We settled by his swimming
pool, and began the formal interview.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived girded for battle, my mind filled with the minutiae of
Fairbanks' career, the result of three days' cramming at the local
library.
</P>
<P>
   I was in for a surprise. No one, I soon learned, knew the
Fairbanks family history _ in and out of Hollywood _ better than
Doug Jr. himself. I would occasionally get a film's release date
wrong, or forget whether it was in color or black-and-white. This
was, of course, in the days before home video made classic movies
readily available. When I made a mistake, Fairbanks would gently
correct me.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him question after question, pressing for more details
than I could possibly include in a Sunday newspaper feature. He was
inexhaustible, rattling off one anecdote after another with such
vividness that the films we were discussing seemed to have been
made only a few years before, rather than several decades hence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every reference Fairbanks made to his life and work was
self-deprecating.
</P>
<P>
   He talked candidly about his four-year marriage to Joan Crawford
in the late '20s (``We were both young, but she already had this
great career going, while I was scarcely known ... It couldn't have
lasted''); his early successes, notably 1939's ``Gunga Din'' (``It
was a great ensemble _ Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and me _ with no
one of us more important than the others''); and the career
interruption for naval service, which resulted in his receiving the
Silver Star, Britain's Distinguished Service Cross, and France's
Legion of Honor (``I went off to win World War II single-handed,
and fortunately wasn't killed'').
</P>
<P>
   He delighted in debunking apocryphal Hollywood stories. When
acquaintances would tell him that, in the course of their world
travels, they had passed by the location in India where ``Gunga
Din'' was shot, Fairbanks would politely inform them that, in
truth, the entire picture was filmed in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Fairbanks was active in corporate and
charitable pursuits, and like most successful men, he didn't suffer
fools. I was afraid he might consign me to that category because I
didn't know as much about his movies as he did.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not to be. My article, titled ``Last of
Swashbucklers,'' appeared a few weeks later, and it was written
from the point of view of a film buff who's not as clever as he
thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks, whose writing included a two-volume autobiography,
read the article with great amusement. The day after it was
published, he called me on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very inventive, writing it at your own expense that
way,'' he said. ``I think you've got a bright career ahead of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It turned out I wasn't the only beginner whose professional
ambitions were encouraged by Douglas Fairbanks Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As my friendship with British actor Christopher Lee grew through
the ensuing decade, I learned how important Fairbanks was to him at
a crucial time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1952 to 1956, when I was just starting out, Douglas cast
me in a dozen, maybe more, episodes of his syndicated TV series,
`Douglas Fairbanks Presents,''' recalled Lee, who recently returned
from shooting ``Lord of the Rings'' in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those years ago, when I was unknown, it was Douglas who
gave me the priceless opportunity to learn to work before a
camera,'' Lee said. ``The experience was probably the most valuable
I ever had. Because it was television, there was a lot of dialogue,
the episodes were each shot in eight to 10 days, and you learned
while doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks was an Anglophile _ he served under Adm. Lord Louis
Mountbatten, who introduced him to Prince Philip and Queen
Elizabeth II _ which endeared him to Lee, when more-brusque
American producers barnstormed through Britain in the post-war
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw him with a smile,'' said Lee, ``and his entering
a room instantly boosted your spirits. He was one of the few people
I knew in show business who was a good friend to me both personally
and professionally. He was a true friend and someone I felt
genuinely close to, which is rare in this profession.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Fairbanks wrote the introduction to a book devoted to
Lee's film work up to that time. Characteristically, Fairbanks
asserted that if he hadn't ``discovered'' Lee and put him on TV,
some other enterprising producer would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that was Douglas,'' offered Lee. ``He was nothing if not
gracious.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s, I would interview Fairbanks whenever a
project merited coverage, such as in 1981 when he appeared in
``Ghost Story'' with Fred Astaire, John Houseman and Melvyn
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, a note _ on embossed stationery _ would arrive at
my office. The return address would be either ``The Vicarage'' or
Fairbanks' Manhattan residence, The Beekman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just returned from a bit of Marco Polo-ing about the globe,
dear boy,'' it would begin, ``and wanted to drop you a line ...''
Then he would regale me with cursory details of his current
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent years, Fairbanks would infrequently turn up in
one of those ``talking heads'' interview programs about vintage
Hollywood. And I would privately worry about how frail he looked.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, he made his final ``official'' appearance at a New
York screening of one of his best films, Max Ophuls' ``The Exile''
(1948). The movie was produced by Fairbanks' own company, but legal
entanglements have kept it out of circulation for decades. The 35
mm nitrate print shown at the retrospective was provided by Martin
Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks, seated at the rear of the theater in a wheelchair,
managed a smile and a wave of enthusiasm to the crowd before the
lights went down. That was the last time the public saw him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lee, in New York for a book signing, spoke on the phone with
Fairbanks within several weeks of the screening of ``The Exile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him at his apartment, and he sounded fine, full of
good cheer, as always,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the last time I talked to him. I know he was 90
when he died, and very frail. But I suppose you unconsciously
expect people like Douglas to go on forever. And when they die,
it's always a shock.''

WEILL AND LENYA: FROM WEIMAR WITH LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Listen up, Liebchen. This year is Kurt Weill's double
anniversary _ he was born in 1900 and died in 1950 _ and it comes
only two years after the centennial of the birth of Lotte Lenya,
his wife. The resulting cultural attention is a good excuse to get
to know two of the leading lights of Germany's Weimar artistic
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurt Weill Foundation for Music (www.kwf.org) offers a
wealth of information for both cultural enthusiasts and people who
know little of Weill beyond ``Mack the Knife'' and little of Lenya
beyond her role as Col. Rosa Klebb in ``From Russia With Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Weill's life spanned the first half of the 20th century,
his work spanned the serious and the popular. A cantor's son and
one of the century's great German composers, he collaborated with
Bertolt Brecht on ``The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny''
and ``The Threepenny Opera.'' Fleeing the Nazis, he ended up in
Hollywood and on Broadway, where he wrote ``September Song'' and
acclaimed musicals like ``One Touch of Venus,'' ``Lady in the
Dark'' and ``Street Scene.'' He died while working on a musical
version of ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   Weill's popularity after his death was ensured by Lenya
(1898-1981), whom he had married in 1926 and who had helped make
``The Threepenny Opera'' a European smash. Her American stage and
recording career bloomed in the 1950s, starting with a revival of
``The Threepenny Opera'' (the song ``Pirate Jenny'' became her
anthem). By 1966, when she appeared as Fraulein Schneider in
``Cabaret,'' she had become a symbol of Weimar Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Challenging traditional aesthetic boundaries and expectations,
Weill has frequently been cited as the `most problematic' composer
of the 20th century,'' Kim H. Kowalke, director of the foundation,
writes in a centennial introduction. ``At once `serious' and
`popular,' `high' and `low,' European and American, his legacy is
as diverse as it is hybrid in genre.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Weill Foundation, based in Manhattan, was begun by
Lenya in 1962 and expanded after she died and willed it royalty
income from Weill's copyrights. It administers the Weill-Lenya
Research Center, is sponsoring a complete critical edition of his
works, publishes a newsletter and helps judge the annual Kurt Weill
Prize for scholarship in 20th-century musical theater. In 1998, it
established the Lotte Lenya singing competition. The Web site
includes a thorough bibliography, a discography, an events calendar
and a performance schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes 11 short audio files of Lenya reminiscing. (In
one snippet, she says: ``My mother can't carry a tune. My father
was even worse.'') She recalls meeting Weill: ``People have
sometimes asked me, `Was it love at first sight?' I think that's
the silliest question of all the questions.'' She continues, ``If
you talk about love, that takes a little time, and it came.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an audio file of Weill singing verses of ``Speak
Low.'' You can almost sense the cigarette smoke rising above lidded
eyes in a roomful of regrets and booze.
</P>
<P>
   Another linked highlight is the World Weill Day Visitors' Book,
created to record comments about Weill on and shortly after his
100th birthday, which was March 2. Many comments are touching.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of summers ago I made a pilgrimage to the graves at
Haverstraw,'' says one woman's entry, referring to Weill's and
Lenya's graves near the Hudson River. ``As I reverently cleared the
rubbish and weeds away from the stones, I thought, `At last! An
opportunity to give something back for all that I've received at
these hands!' It was a beautiful July day, and I sat at the grave
for several hours singing, talking, crying, saying thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Weill, the political pariah and musical innovator, would
probably have especially enjoyed this centennial comment from
Middle America: ``In honor of the occasion, the LMI Club (`Ladies
Musical Improvement,' founded in 1904, now affectionately referred
to as `Lunch More Important') of Waterloo and Cedar Falls, Iowa
(and surrounding communities), presented three Weill songs at our
meeting on March 2: `Mack the Knife,' `Speak Low' and `My Ship.'''

`ANIL'S GHOST': UNEARTHING THE TRAGEDIES OF CIVIL WAR IN SRI
LANKA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Sri Lankan setting for Michael Ondaatje's delicately
fragmented new novel, the figure known as the artificer assumes
special importance. This is the artisan deemed worthy to paint eyes
on a statue of the Buddha, a task that may be done only at 5 a.m.
(the hour of the Buddha's enlightenment) with the help of a mirror,
so as not to look straight into the deity's gaze.
</P>
<P>
   It is by this indirect means that ``the artificer brings to
light sight and truth and presence,'' one of the book's many
haunted characters observes. The author, in contemplating the
dreadful toll that the civil war beginning in the mid-1980s has
taken on his native land, aspires to the same role.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in ``The English Patient,'' Ondaatje is able to
commingle anguish and seductiveness in fierce, unexpected ways.
``Then he turned on a slim hose and let it hover over each bone,''
he writes alluringly, ``air nestling into the evidence of the
trauma as if he were blowing cool breath from a pursed mouth onto a
child's burn.''
</P>
<P>
   That image, for all its sensual loveliness, happens to describe
a forensic examination of the skeleton of a headless torture
victim. Of the warfare among government, antigovernment insurgents
and separatist guerrilla forces that provides the book's implicit
backdrop, he writes: ``And we were caught in the middle. It was
like being in a room with three suitors, all of whom had blood on
their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anil's Ghost,'' like the 33-year-old heroine of its title,
steps into this catastrophe at a point when much of its damage has
already been done. Born in Sri Lanka but having spent much of her
life in England and America, Anil returns to her childhood home
under the auspices of a Geneva-based human rights organization. A
forensic anthropologist, she is part of a team investigating
possible war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anil had read documents and news reports, full of tragedy, and
she had now lived abroad long enough to interpret Sri Lanka with a
long-distance gaze,'' Ondaatje writes. ``But here it was a more
complicated world morally. The streets were still streets, the
citizens remained citizens. They shopped, changed jobs, laughed.
Yet the darkest Greek tragedies were innocent compared with what
was happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anil finds herself paired for the investigation with a
government-selected archaeologist named Sarath, a remote man 16
years her senior. Together Anil and Sarath find four skeletons whom
they nickname Tinker, Tailor, Soldier and Sailor, the last a source
of obsessive fascination. Anil becomes convinced that pinpointing
Sailor's identity and the circumstances of his death will provide
the damning evidence she and Sarath are seeking. But only in this
detective-story premise, and in the curiously theatrical gesture
that ends the book, does ``Anil's Ghost'' adhere to any
conventional storytelling patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The English Patient'' (despite the exquisite fluency of
Anthony Minghella's screen adaptation) ``Anil's Ghost'' is a novel
more in name than in essence. The author of 11 books of poetry,
Ondaatje brings an oblique poetic sensibility to unraveling the
mysteries at work here. Layers peel away from both Anil and Sarath,
with a past full of ghosts for each of them and with assorted
vignettes and memories scattered across the book's fertile
landscape. The path through this terrain is not a clear or simple
one.
</P>
<P>
   The book drifts in flashback, for instance, from Guatemala to
the Miami bedroom where Anil has a tryst with her married lover,
Cullis, who is as much on her mind as Sailor the skeleton. She
speaks about the Spanish names for bones; he says he has written
something about Norwegian snakes. While Cullis sleeps, in the kind
of effortlessly bewitching gesture Ondaatje creates so gracefully,
she photographs him, then buries the film inside his suitcase as a
souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   But as to how such moments _ or those in which Anil writes a
letter to John Boorman about his film ``Point Blank'' or ponders
lyrics to a song set in New York state by the McGarrigle sisters _
connect with the book's essential business in Sri Lanka, that
remains indistinct. Frustratingly so, since the scattered aspects
of this voyage of discovery are separately so powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The book's real strengths lie in its profound sense of outrage,
the shimmering intensity of its descriptive language and the
mysterious beauty of its geography, with so many discrete passages
that present the artificer in Ondaatje so well. The atlas itself,
artfully used _ with places named Ambalangoda and Andigama,
Ginigalpelessa and Boralesgamuwa _ enhances the sense of the
gorgeously exotic throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to be able to live in a place or a
situation where you must use your sixth sense all the time,'' says
a surgeon in the story, describing what is most inviting about this
morally outraged, viscerally vivid book.
</P>
<P>
   Like the elderly blind sage Palipana, Sarath's mentor, who has
had the gift of reading between the lines of texts to glimpse
hidden meanings, Ondaatje does not deal comfortably with the
obvious. But his sixth sense _ his poet's sense _ is akin to that
of Ananda, the book's character who is ultimately assigned the job
of imagining Sailor's missing features. What Ananda recreates is
not the literal physiognomy of Sailor. He conjures a different
face, one that means much more.

CISCO TO OPEN ITS LARGEST FACTORY, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest sign that the Internet-driven new economy is
breathing life back to New England's old manufacturing economy,
Cisco Systems Inc. will open its largest factory in a building that
once cranked out computers for Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of workstations and servers, the 674,000-square-foot
plant in Salem, N.H., will soon be making optical networking
equipment, the latest technology for ferrying vasts amounts of
Internet traffic over fiber-optic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is buying the plant for more than $40 million. At full
capacity, it is expected to have 2,500 workers, about 25 percent
more than it had at its peak when Digital owned it, according to
Carl Redfield, Cisco's senior vice president for manufacturing, who
had visited the plant several times when he was an executive at
Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cisco is based in San Jose, Calif., the network equipment
maker has been making rapid inroads into New England. Just last
week, the company said it would buy ArrowPoint Communications in
Acton for $5.7 billion in stock. The purchase is Cisco's eleventh
acquisition in New England, and its second largest worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement was marred by reports that the US
Securities Exchange Commission is looking into the possibility of
insider trading in the ArrowPoint deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC has made a preliminary inquiry into the situation,''
Mojgan Khalili, a Cisco spokeswoman, confirmed, saying the probe is
routine. ``Cisco is cooperating fully as expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cisco's recent expansions into New England continues to
be regarded as a positive development, with the company poised to
hire thousands of local workers for its plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's decision to locate its sixth and largest manufacturing
plant in Salem reinforces the region as the hub of the rapidly
growing optical networking industry, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of North America's capabilities for producing optical
networking equipment is within an hour's drive of each other'' in
New England, Redfield said. ``That was part of the reason why we
decided to establish a plant here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco also needed a plant that could be up and running quickly
so Cisco could keep up with a flood of customer orders, and the
Salem site met that requirement, said Redfield. Otherwise, Cisco
risks losing customers to rivals Lucent Technologies Inc. and
Nortel Networks Inc., and a crop of New England-based upstarts such
as Sycamore Networks Inc. in Chelmsford, Mass. and Appian
Communications in Boxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The optical networking industry has been booming and is expected
to grow from sales of $6.6 billion in 1999 to $23 billion in 2003,
according to estimates by RHK, a market research firm in South San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Optical networks use light to transmit vast amounts of
information over glass fibers that resemble thin fishing lines.
Telecommunications companies around the world such as AT&AMP;T and Bell
Atlantic have latched on to optical networks as the latest
technology for ferrying video and voice traffic over the Internet.
And companies such as Cisco are scrambling to meet the exploding
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco is just beginning to address the optical environment,''
said Chris Nicoll, a director at Current Analysis, a market
research firm in Sterling, Va. ``They've made a number of
acquisitions in this space. But the company now needs to get it all
together into a cohesive solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salem factory is expected to become Cisco's hub for its
optical networking business. But the decision to open its own plant
is unusual because the company prefers to outsource most of its
manufacturing to contractors in a system the company calls
``virtual manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco owns just five factories worldwide, including two in
Silicon Valley, one in South Carolina and two in Italy and France
that came from Cisco's February acquisition of Pirelli Optical
Systems. Cisco decided to open its own plant because very few
outside contractors exist for this relatively new product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to farm this out, but there's no one to farm it out
to today,'' said Redfield. ``This is a case where we will have to
build the expertise in-house and then transfer that capability to
our manufacturing partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salem plant has sat idle since Digital's new owner, Compaq
Computer Corp., sold the property for $29 million earlier this year
to Boston-area real estate investors Donald Levine and Lewis
Heafitz. Cisco's deal to purchase the plant and the surrounding 110
acres of land is expected to close in June. The company said it
will spend up to $50 million to improve the property.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is already hiring technicians and engineers to work in the
plant so it can start shipping orders by the end of the year,
Redfield said.
</P>
<P>
   After Cisco's recent flurry of acquisitions, New England has
become Cisco's largest presence outside of California in square
footage. The company recently purchased 580 acres of land in
Boxborough, Littleton and Harvard, and is building about 1.8
million square feet of office space on the property. With
ArrowPoint, Cisco now employs 2,200 workers in New England, about 8
percent of its total work force.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's stock fell $3.25 a share to $59.50 Wednesday after
Cisco's chairman, John Chambers, said the company was having
trouble getting enough parts to meet demand and the shortage could
hurt the company's future financial performance.

 &HT;    'ANTIGRAVITY' MAY DOMINATE THE UNIVERSE, SCIENTISTS SAY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    Eds: Part three of the occasional ``Window on the Universe''
series.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although it has nothing to do with the evil
compulsions of science fiction villains, there appears to be, after
all, a dark side of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Something is causing the universe to expand _ not at the speed
scientists would expect from the Big Bang explosion that created
everything and flung it all apart, but faster. And faster.
</P>
<P>
   After locking horns with such thought-defying concepts such as
extra-spatial dimensions and ``dark matter'' that exists separate
from the ordinary stuff that stars and planets and human beings are
made of, cosmologists have taken up the idea of a ``repulsive''
force.
</P>
<P>
   Acting against the universal gravitational pull that causes
matter to be attracted to other matter, the repulsive force seems
to cause distant galaxies to be pushed away from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Some astronomers are calling the theorized repulsive force
``dark energy,'' but others prefer to call it ``repelling energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of this repelling energy _ if in fact it does
exist and is not merely the result of some astrophysical equivalent
of failing to carry the two _ does not mean that Newton's apple
will fall back up to the tree. Galaxies will continue to collide,
and meteors will continue to fall on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the repelling energy may overcome the force of gravity
only in great open areas of space, where galaxies are far apart and
have only weak gravitational attraction. In any case, the apparent
discovery has rocked the world of physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that there are fundamental issues that our physics
cannot explain,'' Shaul Hanany, an astrophysicist at the University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis, said last week. ``We have known that two
masses attract each other. Now we have learned that there are forms
of energy that repel, and we don't know what this energy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanany was one of the authors of an article published last week
in the Astrophysical Journal Letters(cq) describing measurements
made by a high-altitude balloon launched from the National
Scientific Ballooning Facility in Palestine, Texas, to study
something called the cosmic microwave background.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are convinced this dim glow of radiation, which
pervades all space, was left behind by the formation of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas balloon flight, a two-hour experiment in 1998,
measured something called the ``anisotropy'' of the cosmic
microwave background. The term refers to tiny but distinct
differences in the temperature of the microwave radiation at
various points in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Texas experiment, known as MAXIMA for
``Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array,'' were almost
identical to those from a balloon flight over Antarctica announced
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in late April.
</P>
<P>
   By measuring the side-by-side differences in the microwave heat,
both groups were able to produce a ``snapshot'' of small areas of
the universe a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in heat, both teams of scientists said, were
left behind by clumps of early, hot matter that eventually cooled
and expanded to become galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   However, in addition to these baby pictures of the universe, the
temperature measurements allowed scientists to make complicated
calculations that show what kind of matter and energy make up the
cosmos today, Hanany said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanany and other scientists from the University of California,
Berkeley, and universities in Italy, Portugal, Poland and England
said their analysis of the fluctuations convinced them that 60 to
65 percent of all the matter and energy in the universe consists of
the newly theorized ``repelling energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal matter and the energy associated with it _ heat, light,
and so forth _ make up only about 5 percent of everything, the
MAXIMA team reported. The rest appears to be something called
``dark matter,'' which evidently has nothing to do with ``dark
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the everything is expanding at an increasing speed
doesn't work with the traditional Big Bang concept, which had the
the universe more or less coasting along because of the original
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Under one set of assumptions, gravity would someday halt the
expansion and pull everything back together again into a ``Big
Crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other assumptions held that the expansion would go on forever,
constantly slowing but never quite stopping, until all matter and
energy had evaporated into nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is true, scientists now think.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, two teams of astronomers from several
universities announced that, after studying the light given off by
supernovas, the enormous explosions of stars, they had discovered
that the expansion is not slowing down at all. It is speeding up.
</P>
<P>
   The results staggered the astronomy world. Something _ some
called it ``antigravity'' _ is overcoming the force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The supernova experiments confirmed what astrophysicists had
already believed _ that space is being ``stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a car traveling on a rubber highway that is being
stretched. A car setting out on a 60-mile trip at a constant speed
of 60 miles per hour would not arrive in one hour, because the
distance would be stretched during the trip.
</P>
<P>
   As light from the stellar explosions plods along at its
customary speed of 186,000 miles per second, its arrival at the
Earth is delayed by the expansion of space.
</P>
<P>
   What was not expected was the discovery that light from the more
distant supernovas is being delayed at a greater rate that that
from the nearer. The further one travels, the faster space is being
expanded. The only explanation that works, Hanany said is that
repulsive ``dark energy'' of empty space is forcing everything
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the 1800s, people thought everything about the
universe was understood,'' he said. ``Immediately afterward came
quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of relativity, and they saw
how little they knew. Now we are in a similar position.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their ability to measure temperature differences of as
little as a one hundred-thousandth of a degree, the two balloon
experiments took their microwave ``snapshots'' of only a tiny patch
of sky.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center on the outskirts
of Washington are putting the final touches on a new satellite that
is to be launched next year on a mission designed to map the cosmic
microwave background across the entire sky.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, known as the Microwave Anisotropy Probe, will
provide the first detailed picture of the entire universe as it
looked 12 to 14 billion years ago. The results may or may not allow
for more precise calculations that could eventually explain the
nature of ``repelling energy,'' said NASA physicist Charles
Bennett, a principal scientific investigator on the project.
</P>
<P>
   And even if it does, it may not prove the existence of anything
that could be called ``anti-gravity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we may find is that it's just gravity, but gravity that
is behaving in a way that we're not accustomed to,'' he said.

EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the name of that new book? Isn't the story vaguely
familiar? Are we talking about plagiarism? Self-plagiarism? These
questions are raised by a recent example of a traditional literary
gambit: the repackaging and even the rewriting of past clunkers by
best-selling authors into somewhat new books that will possibly
sell in the hundreds of thousands on the second go-around.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's column was about the relatively fresh strategy for
using the brand name of a popular author to make money, which is to
franchise it. That is, the writer as Colonel Sanders. Tom Clancy,
for instance, conceptionalizes a book and approves or disapproves
it as the project proceeds. Someone else writes it. Both names are
on the cover, the brand name, of course, in larger type. That
process is really all about cash.
</P>
<P>
   But later this month one of the most popular authors in recent
years, James Patterson, is leveraging his name and best-selling
status the old-fashioned way. He is publishing in glossy hardcover
a rewritten and renamed version of a novel, ``Virgin,'' that first
appeared in 1980 and then quickly sunk from sight. In March a
somewhat rewritten version of a paperback he published in 1986 as
``Black Market'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster) was renamed ``Black Friday''
and reissued by Warner Books in paperback.
</P>
<P>
   For some authors, like Patterson, pride in craft plays a large
part in these literary resurrections, but so does book publishing's
eternal quest to squeeze more lucrative opportunities from the work
of its principal talent. Still, while there may be something
disquieting about an author granting someone else the license to
write under his name, it is not necessarily a disturbing idea for a
writer to try to make a book better by rewriting it and selling a
new version, providing that when the new rendition is published,
the writer's surgery has been made clear.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motives of a particular author and publisher, the
republication of a rewritten book has a long tradition, for the
authors of literary works as well as popular commercial and romance
fiction. In 1900 Theodore Dreiser's first novel, ``Sister Carrie,''
a tale of a country girl who became the mistress of a wealthy man
and then an actress, so horrified its publisher, Doubleday, Page &AMP;
Co., that it was virtually suppressed. Dreiser, under attack as
immoral, tried distributing it himself with little luck. The novel
was reissued in 1919, but it was not until 1982 that it was finally
published with many passages restored from his original manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Authors aren't easily satisfied. In 1978 John Fowles' cult novel
``The Magus'' was reissued by Little, Brown. At a hefty 656 pages,
it exceeded the original 1965 version by 70 pages and was
considerably reworked. He was still dissatisfied with his most
popular novel. In the foreword he wrote that even with the revision
it is ``a novel of adolescence written by a retarded adolescent.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous rewrite in American publishing was probably
Fitzgerald's ``Great Gatsby.'' It was originally sent to his
publisher Scribner's in 1924 under the title ``Trimalchio.'' His
editor, Maxwell Perkins, told him that ``the novel is a wonder,''
but that the main character was ``somewhat vague,'' that ``the
reader's eye can never quite focus upon him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald revised, cutting and pasting, disclosing more
information about Gatsby's earlier life, reshaping supporting
characters. The book became the story of the Jay Gatsby we now
know, which sells several hundred thousand copies annually.
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal of the trend, ``Trimalchio,'' the failed version,
if it can be called that, will be published for the first time this
month by Cambridge University Press. Which raises the question: Is
it fair and proper to publish a version of a writer's work that the
writer withheld?
</P>
<P>
   More recently the writer with perhaps the greatest itch to
rewrite has been Dean Koontz, the best-selling author of
psychological thrillers, who has rewritten a number of his early
paperbacks. Yes, his name brand makes these books best sellers the
second time out, but mostly he does it for pride of craft. He's a
better writer now than when he started.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Little, Brown will publish Patterson's
``Cradle and All.'' It's hard to imagine that it will not be a best
seller. If one looks carefully at the bottom of the front cover
flap the reader will see a small box in which it is disclosed that
the book is based on an earlier Patterson novel, ``Virgin,'' and
``includes scenes and characters from that book.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Patterson's success in making his name a brand product
since the first publication of ``Virgin,'' the book probably could
have been republished into an instant best seller without a changed
comma. But Patterson said that the book ``has been sitting in my
brain file.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt that I got it where I wanted it,'' he said. ``I
didn't feel I had it right. I always thought this was a neat story
but no one ever read it.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did he do?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he rewrote part of it in the first person
``because I'm more comfortable there.'' In ``Virgin,'' the main
character was a Catholic nun who was also an amateur detective. In
``Cradle and All'' she has been converted to being a former nun who
is now a professional private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned some things about telling a commercial story; I
substantially rewrote this,'' Patterson said. ``I always felt
`Black Market,''' now ``Black Friday,'' ``was too dense, and I went
in and cut out 70 or 80 pages of extraneous information. There are
two or three others I'd like to redo.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the pride of craft _ ``I don't feel I've written my
best thriller yet,'' Patterson said _ there is the drive by
publishers and their best-selling authors to increase their potency
in the marketplace. ``Black Friday'' is in the stores, and
``Cradle'' will soon be as well.
</P>
<P>
   In September ``Along Came a Spider'' is to be reissued in
paperback to ride the coattails of the movie version; in October
there will be a paperback version of ``Pop Goes the Weasel,'' last
year's hardcover best seller by Patterson; and in November there's
his new hardcover, ``Roses Are Red,'' featuring Patterson's
franchise character, Alex Cross, the psychologist detective.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, does anyone care about our opening questions? The
answer is: apparently not, if it's a good yarn from a brand name
writer. Anyway, why should there be extra respect for a novelist
who can only tell a story one way?

ECONOMIC SCENE: GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON INNOVATION NEEDED IN NEW
ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: In the excerpt from Adam Smith, there are some 18th-century
spellings.) 
 By JEFF MADRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could we be hearing right? The Treasury Secretary, Lawrence
Summers, made a speech in San Francisco on Wednesday that not only
talked some economic sense but whose first priority was not to
assuage the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Summers again pushed the line that open markets around the
world were essential to future growth. But he also broached a more
sensitive subject: maybe some of those surplus Treasury balances
should be used to buttress the so-called ``new economy'' rather
than to reduce taxes or shore up Social Security. This is one of
the most important economic speeches of the Clinton administration.
Better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Summers' point is that the new economy requires spending
on education and research because it is based not on big factories
and distribution systems but on ideas and innovation. Some of those
government surpluses should be spent on just these matters, rather
than worrying about reducing interest rates by cutting government
borrowing even more. He is essentially right, in my view. Maybe
more right than he realizes.
</P>
<P>
   This economy is not any more ``new'' than the economic
transformations of the 1920s, 1950s and 1960s were in their day
(and surely no more revolutionary than around the last turn of the
century.) In fact, for all the raves from Washington and Wall
Street, economic growth even in the late 1990s was not equal to the
fastest growth rates of those eras.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in the mid-1990s, there was an unmistakable rise
in the rate of economic growth that has just about confirmed that a
transformation similar to those that occurred at past turning
points is now underway. In my view, this transformation is less
potent than those in the past, but potent it will be.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize its potential, however, will require more effort
than Americans generally acknowledge. Every such economic
transformation in the past was accompanied by enormous increases in
spending on education, transportation, communications, and,
ultimately, technological research. Much of this was undertaken or
subsidized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Take education. In the 1800s, Americans developed a free
mandatory primary school system. In the early 1900s, high school
education spread rapidly. And after World War II, aided by the GI
Bill and the expansion of public universities, Americans went to
college in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Or take transportation. In the 1800s, first canals, then
railroads were built. In the early 1900s roads followed. And in the
1950s and '60s, Washington _ under the guise of national defense _
paid to build the interstate highway system.
</P>
<P>
   In communications, the telegraph first knitted together the
nation _ and began the connection to the global economy. Then came
the telephone, followed by television. Now, it's the Internet. And
just as the telegraph reduced inefficient transportation
requirements _ after all, people didn't have to get on a horse to
deliver a message anymore _ the Internet may reduce transportation
needs as well by, among other things, encouraging more shopping
from home.
</P>
<P>
   But every economic transformation has unique characteristics as
well. Enter Summers. He says that the new economy requires more
innovation. In fact, all such economic transformations were based
principally on new ideas and exciting innovation, as Joseph
Schumpeter, the economic exponent of creative destruction, so
clearly pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   I think Summers is right that the demand for innovation has
increased dramatically. This didn't start only a few years ago,
however. The innovation economy began in the mid-1970s when
Japanese manufacturers, led by Toyota and Honda, learned how to
make varied and high-quality cars far more productively than their
Detroit counterparts. Suddenly, there were many more types of cars
on the road at affordable prices. Standardized markets were
replaced by fragmented ones, and the rate of introduction of new
products rose dramatically, not only for manufactured good, such as
packaged food and appliances, but for services, such as airline
trips, cable television and financial products such as mutual
funds. None of this could have happened without the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, new products, marketing ideas, financial strategies,
innovative salesmanship and constant change became the keys to
competitive success. A new product rushes in, as Summers says,
captures the market and is quickly displaced by a still newer one.
This is far from a new model, but the pace is faster.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that an educated and sophisticated work force
and on-going aggressive investment in technological research are
now more important than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   How does American society make the most of this? As in the past,
it will require government funds. Not for everything, especially in
the modern age, which has so many more capable people and developed
private institutions than in the past. But it was New York state
that first built the canals; the federal government that subsidized
the railroads and paved the highways; local government that built
the nation's schools; land-grant universities and the military that
spawned a lot of our technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some will demur. Indeed, private industry built the
communications infrastructure in the 20th century and is now
building the Internet. But the Pentagon, as is apparently now known
by every school child, developed the Internet in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   And there is strong economic theory to support a role for
government. Let me quote from Adam Smith, no modern liberal:
</P>
<P>
   ``The third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is
that of erecting and maintaining those publick institutions and
those publick works, which, though they may be in the highest
degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a
nature, that the profit could never repay the expence to any
individual or small number of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists now recognize that some investments of crucial
benefit to society as a whole will not be made by business because
any single company, or even industry, will not reap all the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkably prescient Adam Smith had it right 225 years ago.
By renewing our faith in public investment, Summers is following in
his footsteps. Given what we have read about Summers' ambitions,
nothing would please him more.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will be active early Thursday in
Illinois and Indiana as the remnants of a thunderstorm complex
drift to the southeast. Meanwhile, the area of low pressure that
triggered this system Wednesday night will cause chilly rain in the
northern Plains Thursday. Farther west, snow showers will be found
in the mountains of Wyoming and Montana as colder air sweeps
southward.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will turn cooler Thursday in the wake of a cold
front. Showers and clouds will linger in northern New England,
although places farther west will see sunshine by the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure moving over the Southeast will provide sunny skies
and unseasonably high temperatures. The deserts of the Southwest
will remain very hot. Valley showers and mountain snow will
continue to plague the Pacific Northwest as moist breezes surge
inland.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MIDNIGHT SUN
</P>
<P>
   Though much of the East has had unusual warmth in early May, the
surest sign of approaching summer is at frosty Barrow, Alaska. The
sun rose at 2:50 a.m. Wednesday and will remain above the horizon
continuously until Aug. 2. At Barrow, the northernmost weather
station in the United States, the summer sun will be obscured by
clouds nearly 80 percent of the time. The nearby Arctic Ocean
typically remains covered with ice until late July, keeping the
average air temperature at 33 degrees during the reign of the
midnight sun.

   `Wasp Star (Apple Venus 2)'
</P>
<P>
   XTC / TVT Records / 12 tracks / Our critic's grade: A
</P>
<P>
   After two decades, you'd think XTC would tire of updating the
Beatles every few years. You'd be wrong. And we should all be
grateful that Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding are sticking it
out. XTC's latest Lennon-McCartney homage is the duo's best album
in 15 years. Gone (wisely) is the arty orchestra play that drenched
1999's spotty (if often brilliant) ``Apple Venus.'' In its place
are the tight guitar-bass-drums pop, baroque lyrics and killer
hooks that made XTC an enduring '80s-radio treat. Catchy songs like
``Stupidly Happy'' and ``Playground'' echo XTC classics like
``Mayor of Simpleton'' and ``Respectable Street.'' And much of
``Wasp'' has that irresistible hum-along-at-first-listen quality
that rewards repeated listenings. Bottom line: This just might be
the best record Paul McCartney never made.

<P>
   The curly locks are gone. The choir-boy vocals have grown
ragged. And the crowds have thinned (along with his hair). But
Peter Frampton's live show, as rendered here, hasn't changed a lick
since his monster 1976 hit ``Frampton Comes Alive!'' Those sappy
first-kiss acoustic ballads. The chiming rock-guitar solos. That
silly voice-box trick. It's all here. Again. Which begs a question:
Why bother? It's one thing to reprise a classic with a new element.
Pink Floyd did it with ``The Wall Live.'' So did Joni Mitchell with
her symphony-backed hits collection. But it's another thing
entirely to contrive a second lightning strike with a
by-the-numbers retread. Midway through ``Show Me the Way II,''
Frampton sums it up nicely when he confides, ``I can't believe this
is happening ... again.'' Frankly, Pete, neither can we.

</P>
<P>
   If there's a battle on CD between New Orleans-based hip-hop
labels No Limit Records and Cash Money Records, No Limit has added
a new weapon to its arsenal. Its name is Krazy. And it's almost
scary how much his muscular vocals dip, wind and sound a lot like
the late charismatic rapper Tupac Shakur. Other than that, the
re-emergence of Master P, Silkk the Shocker and Mystikal under the
name of their home's area code is the usual lengthy visit with the
rich and project-minded. Without longtime collaborators Beats by
the Pound, the production doesn't come off as confident, but
``Wobble, Wobble,'' ``Check 'em'' and ``We Bust'' are still catchy.

 &HT;    Death by chocolate, sour cream
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gidget Erwin of Smyrna, Ga. requested a chocolate cake with
sour cream in both the cake and frosting, it conjured a distant
memory for Eleanor Ragsdale, who sent this recipe from a book
published by the San Francisco Junior League.
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale says her husband made the cake just once _ for her
birthday 20 years ago _ but she remembers the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if memory serves me correctly,'' she says, ``it is
delicious.''

 &HT;    Daring portrait of dysfunctional family
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever more remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama that won five
Oscars, including best picture of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mendes (Broadway's ``Cabaret'') and former Mariettan Alan
Ball (a sitcom heavy hitter) have fashioned a fin de siecle
tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in midlife limbo.
Combining the compassion and quirkiness of a James L. Brooks film
with the darker charge of David Lynch's ``Blue Velvet'' period, the
movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully
Screwed Up.
</P>
<P>
   Among its other well-deserved Oscars: best director, screenplay,
actor (Spacey) and cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   `American Beauty'
</P>

<P>
   &QR;  ``Bringing Out the Dead'' (R) _ Martin Scorsese performs
another deft autopsy on New York after dark in this savage,
sorrowing look at a few days in the life of a paramedic whose beat
is the mean, messy streets of Hell's Kitchen. As played by Nicolas
Cage in ``Leaving Las Vegas'' mode, he's alcoholic, burned out and
haunted by the spirits of those he couldn't save. A kinda romance
with Patricia Arquette doesn't work, but there's excellent work by
John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore as Cage's various
partners. Think of a big-screen ``ER'' episode, only given the full
Scorsese treatment. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mystery, Alaska'' (R) _ A by-the-numbers but fairly pleasant
David-vs.-Goliath comedy on ice. Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria and
Burt Reynolds star in TV wiz David E. Kelley's tale of small-town
hockey lovers taking on the New York Rangers. The movie piles on
raunchy jokes and is a soggy series of bite-size vignettes and
spoon-fed emotions. For all that, it's still pretty watchable.
Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Straight Story'' (G) _ David Lynch shifts gears in this
lyrically simple little film based on the true story of 70-plus
Alvin Straight (Oscar nominee Richard Farnsworth), who drove his
1966 John Deere riding mower more than 300 miles to reconcile with
his estranged brother (Harry Dean Stanton). The movie is a sublime
celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind, welcoming,
gloriously eccentric. Grade: A-

 &HT;    Dance movies that have all the right moves
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All you need to know about dance in the movies can be summed up
in five words: Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. They're the guys. The
ones to watch. The ones to keep watching. But the new dance-centric
movie ``Center Stage,'' opening Friday, reminds me that dance
movies come in all shapes, sizes and forms. Here are a few ideas to
keep you on your toes:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``All That Jazz'' (1979) _ A Me Musical to top off the Me
Decade of the '70s, Bob Fosse's quasi-autobiographical movie about
a driven but brilliant director/choreographer has a kind of ``4
1/2'' plot. But, boy, those moves _ especially the singularly
sensational mass-audition opening that made any movie version of
``A Chorus Line'' redundant. In the Fosse role, Roy Scheider seems
in a perpetual sweat, but then, that's the kind of movie this is _
a highly charged, glitzed-up tribute to, as Fosse/Scheider says,
``magic time.'' This is also the movie that rescued Jessica Lange's
career. True, her role as an enigmatic Angel of Death isn't big,
but it gave her work after the ignominy of ``King Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Red Shoes'' (1948) _ Distinguished director Michael
Powell put his best foot forward with this poetic tribute to the
enchantments of ballet. The story line is simple melodrama: A
renowned impresario (Anton Walbrook) discovers a sublime young
dancer (Moira Shearer) and makes her a star. But her love for her
art is challenged by her falling in love with a young composer
(Marius Goring). The movie takes its name _ and, in a sense, its
theme _ from the Hans Christian Andersen fable about a young girl
bewitched by her red dancing slippers. Powell writes in his
voluminous memoir that the project was conceived with Merle Oberon
in mind. When that fell through, he insisted on casting a dancer in
the lead. But Shearer, he adds, never cared about making movies;
like her character, she only cared for dance. ``I never let love
interfere with business,'' he wrote. ``Or I would have made love to
her. It would have improved her performance. A dancer is like a
nun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Turning Point'' (1977) _ On the one hand, the movie is
notorious for receiving 11 Oscar nominations and going home with
none. On the other, it's a well-crafted and well-acted (and, best
of all, well-danced) look at the behind-the-scenes world of ballet
while, at the same time, being a study of friendship and choices.
Anne Bancroft is the aging prima ballerina, and Shirley MacLaine is
her former colleague, who long ago turned her tutu in for a
homemaker's apron. Their battleground, so to speak, is MacLaine's
dancing daughter (Leslie Browne), who comes to New York to
apprentice with Bancroft's company. Mikhail Baryshnikov introduced
his genius to moviegoers as the troupe's charming but ego-ridden
star. He also earned one of those 11 nominations in the best
supporting actor category.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``West Side Story'' (1961) _ It also nabbed 11 Oscar
nominations, but it went home with 10, including best picture,
director (split between Robert Wise and choreographer Jerome
Robbins) and both supporting awards in acting (George Chakiris and
Rita Moreno). As the first movie to ``modernize'' the ``Romeo and
Juliet'' saga, screenwriter Ernest Lehman's adaptation of Arthur
Laurents' play places the lovers' tragedy against the backdrop of
feuding gangs in Manhattan, circa 1960. Leonard Bernstein's score
is pulsatingly powerful, and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics trickily
memorable, but what everyone remembers is the dancing, especially
the celebrated six-minute opening sequence. You're never alone _
snap, snap. You're never disconnected.

 &HT;    With the click of a mouse, online service delivers the goods to
your house
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grocery shopping may never be the same _ not since Webvan.com
brought the supermarket to Atlanta's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-com delivery service officially began rolling out meat,
potatoes and more from its Suwanee warehouse to kitchen counters
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer's Edge couldn't wait to see how the system works, so with
the help of Roswell homemaker Donna Kibler, we put Webvan to the
test right out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Kibler, a stay-at-home mother of two boys ages 8 and 10, usually
shops on Mondays, so she places her order through Webvan.com on
Sunday afternoon. All she has to do Monday is wait for Webvan.
</P>
<P>
   We hang out with Kibler as she navigates her way around
Webvan.com. Here's how it goes:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sunday, April 30
</P>
<P>
   2:10 p.m.: Kibler takes a break from digging a drainage pipe in
the front yard with her geologist husband, Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Kibler begins her virtual trip to the supermarket _ shoes off
and relaxed in a comfy chair in front of her PC. It takes a few
minutes to tinker with the registration page but faster than you
can say, ``Will I ever find a parking space?'' Kibler schedules her
delivery for the
</P>
<P>
   3-3:30 p.m. time slot the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on to selecting items and scratching them off her
written list.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding her mouse down the bread list, Kibler is pleased to find
the IronKids Round Top Bread her family likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay about $1.89, so at $2.24, this is a little more
expensive,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   However, she quickly finds a loaf of sourdough in the Artisans
Bread section that at $2.44 was quite a bit less expensive than
what she usually buys.
</P>
<P>
   Kibler continues. She double clicks on a pint of yogurt to
enlarge and checks to see if it's what she wants. It is _ and with
a click it ends up on top of the growing list on the left side of
her screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's tallying right there,'' she says, pointing to the
running total. ``I love that. I'm going to save the meat for last
to see what I can afford,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She moves on to the vegetables. She's picky about apples. ``They
have to be really crisp, not soft at all.''
</P>
<P>
   3:08 p.m.: Kibler nears the end of her list. Like visiting a new
store, it takes awhile to navigate and find what you're looking
for.
</P>
<P>
   3:25 p.m.: Kibler maneuvers her mouse to the meat section. She
picks out a USDA Choice eye of round roast between 2 and 4 pounds,
a pack of chicken breasts and four inch-thick New York steaks.
</P>
<P>
   As she scans the final total of $119.31, Kibler notes it isn't
more than what she typically spends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things cost a little more,'' she decides, ``but then
others are less, so it pretty much evens out.''
</P>
<P>
   3:35 p.m.: She quickly checks out by entering her credit card
number. Less than an hour and a half has passed since she logged
on.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Monday, May 1
</P>
<P>
   2:30 p.m.: Delivery day finds Kibler digging in her front yard
again. This time, it's flowers. She's pleasantly surprised when the
beige van with the Webvan logo pulls up to her house 15 minutes
early.
</P>
<P>
   2:45 p.m.: Courier Joe Gilbert loads bright yellow and green
plastic containers on a dolly. Kibler despises grocery shopping and
isn't fond of lugging the endless sacks from car to kitchen. No
such hassle with Webvan.com. Gilbert brings everything into the
kitchen, unloads the boxes and places all items on the counter.
</P>
<P>
   2:55 p.m.: Kibler makes a beeline for the bread and apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bread is soft and squishy like we like it, and the apples
are really crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   Score another one for Webvan. ``I really like my roast,'' she
says as she continues to sort her purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Kibler thinks the lean steaks look just like what she would have
picked out.
</P>
<P>
   After Gilbert sets everything out, he prints out Kibler's
receipt from a little printer attached to his belt. The bill is $15
less than she figured because of a ``grand opening'' promo. He also
gives her an itemized list of her order before he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:04 p.m.: Everything is put away.  &QR;  Postscript: The entire
process has taken a little more than two hours all told, and Kibler
never left her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   What is Webvan.com?
</P>
<P>
   Online grocery store Webvan.com was introduced last year in San
Francisco. Officials chose Atlanta as its second market because,
after San Francisco, it's the most Internet-connected city in the
world, says Chris Ohlund, Webvan's general manager in Atlanta.
Eventually, officials hope the concept will click in major cities
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   With a simple click on the Atlanta icon on the home page, you
can buy 50,000 products online. These include groceries, bakery
items and deli meats as well as health and beauty products,
flowers, baby products, books and office supplies _ everything from
soup to nuts for a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   Say, for example, you want to find your favorite box of cereal.
Under groceries, click on breakfast, then on cold cereals, then
flakes and brans. You have 21 different choices, including
Kellogg's Corn Flakes (12 ounces, $2.57), Post Natural Raisin Bran
(25 ounces, $3.57) and Kellogg's Cracklin' Oat Bran (17 ounces,
$4.57). Or how about nutitional cereals? Your 20 choices include
Total (10 ounces, $3.77) and Special K (12 ounces, $3.67). And a
shredded wheat lover has 12 choices.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a thrifty shopper, click on the sale icon to find
good deals on items ranging from Lender's Onion Bagels to fresh
strawberries to Hunt's tomato sauce.

 &HT;    Bundt pan makes for a boffo presentation
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bette Justice of Marietta yearned for a Bundt pan when she moved
to Atlanta from Cincinnati after graduating from college some years
ago. But the popular pan was hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, my aunt sent one to me from Boston, and I've used the
pan now for over 25 years,'' Justice wrote in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   A good Bundt pan is worth seeking out and then cherishing for
decades. Especially with so many delicious recipes for making the
most of the hills, ridges and vales in the cake pan's design.
</P>
<P>
   Those same ridges and vales, of course, can make greasing a
Bundt pan a challenge. Some time ago we asked Shirley Corriher for
advice. Baker's Joy, a nonstick cooking spray that greases and
flours the pan at the same time, can be ideal. Lecithin is the
greasing agent; it contains fewer calories than many oils used for
greasing pans.
</P>
<P>
   Corriher also offered the ``double-grease'' technique as an
option. Butter the pan well and place in the freezer for five
minutes or so, just long enough for the butter to set. Then oil the
pan (with vegetable oil or vegetable-oil spray), dust with flour
and immediately pour in the batter.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the beautiful shape of the Bundt pan can be
used for other purposes. My friend Fern Hallman uses mini-Bundt
pans as rice molds. And Sarah Lopez sent this e-mail suggestion for
a fat-free, sugar-free, carbohydrate-free way to enjoy the Bundt
pan: Hold the pan upside down by the center and hit it gently with
a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bundt pan is a heavy-duty one, the resulting resonance
matches the quality of a fine Tibetan bell,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   THE TUBE PAN VS. THE BUNDT PAN
</P>
<P>
   One of the frequent questions we get concerns the difference
between the tube pan and the Bundt pan. One woman called while her
oven was still smoking, angry that a peanut butter poundcake recipe
we had published had spilled over.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with her for a few moments, we quickly figured out
the problem _ she had poured a recipe intended for a tube pan into
a Bundt pan.
</P>
<P>
   For the record: a 10-inch tube pan (or angel food cake pan)
holds 16 cups of batter. It's shown at left. A 10-inch Bundt pan
holds 12 cups of batter.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime you are wondering how much a pan will hold, simply fill
with water and then pour water into a measuring cup (or pour water
from measuring cup into the pan). Baking pans generally can be used
interchangeably if they hold about the same amount of batter.

   Bette Justice won first prize at a company picnic with this
popular recipe. First, poke holes in the cake; then glaze, letting
it really seep in.
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 (3-ounce) package lemon gelatin
</P>
<P>
   1 (18.25-ounce) package lemon cake mix (such as Duncan Hines)
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Juice of one lemon or 1 teaspoon lemon flavoring
</P>
<P>
   For the lemon glaze:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) margarine, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   To make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 10-inch
Bundt pan. Bring water to a boil and stir in gelatin. Set aside to
cool. In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, oil and cooled
gelatin mixture. Mix well. Add eggs and lemon juice. Pour into
prepared pan and bake 40 to 45 minutes or until light golden brown.
Cool in pan approximately 20 minutes, then invert onto serving
plate.
</P>
<P>
   To make the lemon glaze: Combine melted butter, confectioners'
sugar and lemon juice in a small mixing bowl. Mix on medium-high
speed for 3 to 5 minutes, or until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Using a fork, poke holes all over the cake. While cake is still
warm, drizzle with lemon glaze.

   My ``tunneling'' technique leaves a bit to be desired. The
``tunnel'' of filling never seems to land in the center. But it
sure doesn't matter _ I always end up with a pretty, tasty cake.

this cake knocked my socks off. I'll be serving it at summer
gatherings. Thanks again to Barbara Geier.

   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder

   1 1/2 teaspoons rum extract
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour Bundt pan.
</P>
<P>
   To make the cake: In large bowl of an electric mixer, cream
butter and sugar until light. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating
well after each addition. In a medium mixing bowl, sift together
flour, soda, baking powder and salt. Add to the butter mixture,
alternating with buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry
ingredients. Add the extract and pour into prepared pan. Place pan
in oven and bake 1 hour or longer, until a toothpick inserted in
the cake comes out clean.

cup water. Cool and then add 1 1/2 teaspoons rum extract and 2
tablespoons sugar. Brush on the warm cake in several coatings,
sprinkling granulated sugar over the cake between each coating. The
coating has a crunchy, glistening texture when finished that
provides a wonderful contrast to the tender cake.

   This recipe from the 1966 bake-off contest is one of the most
popular Pillsbury recipes of all time. The cake was created by Ella
Helfrich of Houston, and originally called for a frosting mix for
the filling that is no longer available. So the Pillsbury kitchens
have updated the recipe _ but it's every bit as good. The
popularity of the fluted Bundt tube pan increased after this recipe
won the contest.
</P>
<P>
   For the filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 (3.4-ounce) package chocolate fudge
</P>
<P>
   pudding and pie filling mix (not instant)
</P>
<P>
   1 (6-ounce) package (1 cup) semisweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped walnuts
</P>
<P>
   For the glaze:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 teaspoons milk
</P>
<P>
   In medium saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups milk and pudding mix;
cook as directed on package. Add chocolate chips; stir until
melted. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 12-cup Bundt pan
or 10-inch tube pan. In large bowl, combine sugar, butter and
shortening; beat until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs; mix
well. Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. Add flour,
1/2 cup cocoa, baking powder, salt and 1 cup milk; beat at low
speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes at medium speed. Stir in
walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve 2 cups of the batter. Pour remaining batter into
prepared pan. Spoon filling in ring on top of batter, making sure
it does not touch sides of pan. (You may not use all the filling,
but you should use at least 2/3 of it.) Spoon reserved batter over
filling.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until cake springs back when touched
lightly in center. Cool 1 hour; remove from pan. Cool 1 1/2 hours
or until completely cooled.
</P>
<P>
   In small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and 1/4 cup cocoa.
Add enough milk for desired drizzling consistency. Spoon over cake,
allowing some to run down sides.
</P>
<P>
   Use very sharp or serrated knife to slice cake. Best when served
same day; store any remaining cake in refrigerator. _ From ``The
Best From 50 Years of Bake-Off Contests'' (Pillsbury Cookbooks,

 &HT;    A Bundt cake on the table is a fluted sign that festive times
are ahead, and a reminder of past celebrations
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Geier remembers that the highlight of many of her
childhood weekends was a family outing to a college football game.
Sure, the games were fun; but the Bundt cakes were even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and her friends would exchange their favorite Bundt
cake recipes so they wouldn't get bored with the same cake each
week,'' said Geier of Berkeley Lake, Ga. ``I make many of them now
for special occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Zipfel of Smyrna, Ga., fondly recalls her mother jotting
down Bundt cake recipes from a radio show called ``Party Line''
that aired in Searcy, Ark. Her mother shared the recipes with
Zipfel's grandmother. And during visits, Zipfel and her grandmom
would often sneak a slice to share over secret early-morning chats
before others in the house woke up.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, Bundt cakes have added that festive touch to so
many occasions. Sure, bake the cakes in some other pan and the
flavor will be pretty much the same. But flutes add flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to put the typical heavy, sweet icings on
them,'' explained Geier. ``Yet they are incredibly tasty. They
always draw rave reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a weekend to pull the fluted beauty off the
shelf, it's this weekend. Why not thank Mom for all those Bundt
cakes she's baked over the years by making her a special one for
Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we have Moms to thank for the Bundt pan. Fifty years
ago, a group of Minneapolis homemakers (members of the Hadassah
Society) asked the local Northland Aluminum Products if they could
produce a cast aluminum pan similar to the kugelhupf pan popular in
Germany. A few were made for them, along with a few extra, under
the Nordic Ware brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, a poundcake baked in the Bundt pan was featured
in the Good Housekeeping cookbook, and demand picked up. But the
Bundt pan really earned its spot on the kitchen shelf at the 1966
Pillsbury Bake-Off. One of the top recipes was the Tunnel of Fudge
cake. After the competition, Pillsbury received more than 200,000
requests for help in finding the pan and Northland had to operate
on 24-hour shifts to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are an estimated 40 million Bundt pans in America.
There's probably one in your mother's kitchen, if not your own.
There are numerous sizes and even a couple of variations on style
(festive and star) available today _ just take a peek at
www.bundt.com.
</P>
<P>
   The name Bundt comes from the German word ``bund,'' which means
a gathering. So the Bundt cake is meant to be special enough for
gatherings and parties. Rita Brommer of Lilburn thinks so. She
takes a Bundt cake she calls Spicy Sweet Treat to her senior
meetings and whenever she goes visiting out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Hayden of Atlanta loves to use her Bundt pan to make a rum
cake. She once took the cake to her office when she worked in New
York. ``The odor of the rum filled the elevator and heads began to
turn to find out what poor soul had been hitting the bottle so
early in the morning,'' recalls Hayden, who actually uses rum
extract in the cake. The recipe is inside, along with others from
Geier and Brommer and Linda Williams Cattanach of Blairsville.
</P>
<P>
   Cattanach shared a coveted recipe she and her Zeta Tau Alpha
sisters loved _ Virginia Martin's Sour Cream Pound Cake. Martin
passed away a few years ago, but since then Willa Jones has
continued the tradition of baking the poundcake in a Bundt pan and
offering it up for auction at the group's annual fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a spirited and good-humored competition to
take the cake home,'' said Cattanach. ``It's the top bid of the
day.''

 &HT;    Web full of recipes sure to warm Mom's heart
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because your mother has given you a million things doesn't
mean she wants you to do the same for her on Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pointing and clicking yourself into debt dipping
into the fancy and expensive Mother's Day gifts that abound on the
Internet, most mothers would prefer something from the heart.
Mother's Day is truly an observance where, gift-wise, it really is
the thought that counts. As ever, a meal thoughtfully prepared,
with special touches meant just for her, can be more memorable than
an expensive gift. Balancing out all the e-commerce are many sites
brimming with pure inspiration and ideas on how to make the day
special for Mom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you want to pull off an extra-special day, this is a good
place to start. A Mothers Day Celebration at
food.homearts.com/food/thoughts/enter/46enta16.htm offers
straightforward advice on how to ``wow your biggest fan _ and
toughest critic _ on her special day'' with a party in her honor
and great food. Starting with ``Setting the Mood,'' it suggests:
``It's spring. Keep it light, airy and informal.'' It has tips
about invitations (forget just using the phone _ make it special
with a handwritten invite). Special Mother's Day touches for napkin
rings, place cards, music, candles and flowers also are included.
Menu suggestions for a Mother's Day brunch include seasonal choices
like Salmon and Asparagus Salad or Bow-Tie Pasta With Baby
Artichokes and Basil. For an appetizer, a light fruit compote or
salad of pineapples, strawberries and mangoes is suggested. For a
Mother's Day Sunday supper: leg of lamb with pistachio topping,
spring risotto and couscous-stuffed artichokes. Sections also
include stunning desserts and extravagant beverages.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Holiday Channel at www.holidaychannel.com/mothersday is
another good place to visit if you want to expand on the
chocolates-and-flowers routine. How about surprising Mom with an
authentic recipe favored by her personal heartthrob celebrity? Here
you will find Frank Sinatra's favorite clam sauce, scrod from Paul
Newman, grilled tuna from Billy Joel and others. Also included is a
to-do list outlining what to do, hour by hour, for a perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you are not a whiz kid in the kitchen and feel you're not
up to the challenge of whipping up a gourmet meal for Mom, check
out A Million Dollar Menu for Mom at
secure.foodwine.com/food/egg/egg0598/mealmom.html. You'll find
detailed instructions on how to produce a fabulous menu of Shrimp
Cocktail Appetizer, Cold Poached Salmon With Tangy Mustard-Mayo
Sauce, Tender Steamed Asparagus, Orange-Scented Couscous and
Raspberry Granita for dessert. It has a timetable, shopping list,
equipment list and minute-by-minute, hold-your-hand instructions,
along with pictures of everything so you will know how it's all
supposed to look.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you decide that going to a restaurant is still the thing to
do, visit Nice and Easy Mother's Day at
www.party411.com/holidays-mothers.html _ a site that considers the
notion that dragging everyone over to Mom's house for Mother's Day
is as much fun for her as doing the wash. But even at a restaurant
you can add a personal touch. The site advises that you provide the
floral centerpiece. Just let the restaurant know you're bringing in
something so they will make room. Or go for a surprise (for Mom)
and drop it off or have it delivered.

 &HT;    Atlanta's Little Five Points is funky, friendly and brimming
with fun spots
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe you've ventured into the heart of Little Five Points to
take in a play. Or perhaps you've taken out-of-towners _ to prove
that Atlanta really does have a bohemian edge.
</P>
<P>
   But if you haven't thought of funky Little Five Points as a
shopping venue, it's time to take a walk on the wild side.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend a good slice of a sunny afternoon people watching,
shopping for that eclectic little treasure, getting your navel
pierced and having your fortune told.
</P>
<P>
   And all this just on the strip of Euclid Avenue from Fifi
Mahony's to El Myr restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Stanton of Buckhead was window-shopping on Euclid
recently while waiting for a friend she was meeting for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really grateful that we have a place like Little Five
Points,'' she says. ``Where else around here can you be entertained
by the merchandise and the customers?''
</P>
<P>
   On Euclid Avenue you'll find that most shops have been recycled
many times, pretty much unrecognizable from their original intent.
For instance, the space that now houses Home Store Futon Gallery
was for years a Piggly Wiggly, then an A&AMP;P and more recently
Sevananda Natural Foods Market.
</P>
<P>
   In December it opened as a slick wood and brick showroom filled
with futons and accessories of every size and color, including
contemporary frosted glass stacked tables, cotton rugs and candles.
If you have a Midtown loft to furnish, this is the place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Wander down to Urban Tribe Tattoo and you won't find sailors on
shore leave getting ``Mom'' emblazoned on their chests. Instead
you'll see young adults pouring over photos of tattoo designs in a
brightly lit area heavy with the scent of antiseptic. At the large
glass counter, you can peruse a variety of rings to decorate
various pierced body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of people coming in here, especially this time of
the year. They're wearing less clothes and want to show some
skin,'' professional piercer Alyson Funderburk says.
</P>
<P>
   Make that embellished skin. According to Funderburk, Tribe's
business is equally divided between piercings and tattoos. Oh, and
if you're wondering what are the most popular body parts for
piercing at Tribe _ navels and tongues. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   For the literary type, A Cappella Books offers new books as well
as used and out-of-print volumes. Here you can sell and trade books
you no longer want.
</P>
<P>
   Cross the street and enter Gypsy Market through a courtyard
beckoning with a bubble machine, pungent incense, seductive
drumming and a psychic reader. Inside this exotic warren you'll
find a cache of incense, candles, crystals and Allen Ginsberg's
books of poetry. Those who need a bit of relaxation can make use of
Gypsy Market's Mind Ride, a machine intended to transport the user
to a calm, centered state.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking that perfect pair of oh-so-tall platform sandals to go
with the teeny crochet bikini? Check out Envy clothing store for
both.
</P>
<P>
   If your taste runs to black vinyl, pastel lace, a little
delicate something in chains and 6-inch spike heels, consider
meandering through Throb.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss its twisted sister store, Fifi Mahony's. Here you can
buy that hard-to-find Zombie green lipstick from Ben Nye Makeup,
tiaras and even body glitter. But outrageous hairpieces and wigs
draw many folks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 16-year-old girls going to the prom who want
baby-pink wigs to match their dresses,'' manager Tim Scott says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their parents would rather they wear a wig than dye their hair
that color. But we have that, too, if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: Take the Downtown Connector to the North
Avenue exit (the Varsity will be on your left). Turn left on North
Avenue (crossing over the interstate) and travel east about 2 1/2
miles. Then, go right onto Moreland Avenue until you reach the
intersection of Euclid Avenue; turn right.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most stores are open daily. Some stores stay open until
7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Metered and nonmetered street parking and parking
behind some stores, including Outback Outfitters &AMP; Bikes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Restrooms available in most restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accessibility: The sidewalks are pretty rough, and some of the
stores are cramped for space and not ideal for wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You won't find typical fast-food chain fare in this part of
town. Check out E.A.Y.C. (Euclid Avenue Yacht Club) when you want a
boisterous, publike atmosphere. Here you'll dine on pork burritos,
Kansas City brisket sandwich plates and even veggie Philly
sandwiches. Can't have a yacht club without seafood, so you'll also
find a fried fish sandwich as well. My guess, however, is that much
of the clientele goes for those Bloody Marys made from scratch.
Prices range from $2.25 to $7.50. 11 a.m.-2:30 a.m.
Mondays-Fridays; noon-2:30 a.m. Saturdays; 12:30-11:30 p.m.
Sundays. 1136 Euclid Avenue. 404-688-2582.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Calcutta Restaurant is a culinary paradox. Not only will you
find typical Indian dishes such as tandoori chicken and
mulligatawny soup, but you'll also encounter Cajun chicken
eggrolls. You're in Little Five Points _ enough said. Prices range
from $2.25 to $11.25. Lunch:11 a.m.-3 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays.
Dinner: 5:30-10:30 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays; 5-11 p.m.
Fridays-Saturdays; 5-10:30 p.m. Sundays. 1138 Euclid Avenue.
404-681-1838.

 &HT;    Locate hard to find items
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But because of the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It,The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O.
Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com
(please include your name, the city you live in and daytime phone
number); or call 404-582-7642.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year at Target, we bought the bird food Squirrel Away.
It has an ingredient that keeps squirrels from pigging out on
whatever you put in the bird feeders. Target no longer carries this
item. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Randy and Teresa Mills, Fayetteville , Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon, those pesky squirrels will have to dine elsewhere.
Squirrel Away, which is mixed in with bird feed, is a natural,
safe, nonviolent way of discouraging squirrels. Home Depot carries
it in selected stores. We found ours at 815 Sidney Marcus Blvd.
N.E. (404-231-1411). A 3-ounce package is $3.96 and treats 50
pounds of seed. You can also order online at www.squirrelaway.com
or call 1-800-229-5454. Two 3-ounce packages are $9.95 and include
shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrel Away is made from peppers that are full of vitamins,
proteins and lipids. They also contain capsaicin, the natural
substance that makes peppers spicy. It's distasteful to mammals,
including squirrels, chipmunks and raccoons, but attractive to
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When my husband and I lived in Pittsburgh, we could find
Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce but not the RedHot Buffalo Wing Sauce. And
we can't find it here. The sauce also makes a great marinade for
grilled boneless chicken breast. Best of all, it's fat-free. Any
ideas?
</P>
<P>
   _ June McKeon,
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This request was almost too hot to handle. Like many food
items, Frank's RedHot Buffalo Wing Sauce has limited distribution
in the Northeast and Midwest. And it's quite limited in the South.
However, you can order it directly from the company, Reckitt
Benckiser: 1-800-456-9477. A 12-ounce bottle is $2.49. The
manufacturer says the sauce ``is specially prepared so you can
easily re-create the great taste of restaurant-style wings at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Wash &AMP; Curl shampoo. I bought it over a year
ago, but now it's nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   _ Debbie Bowen, Dawsonville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another curly question: I am looking for Wash &AMP; Curl by
Nutra Care. I have used it for years, but now I can't find it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Ann Miller, Peachtree City, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Trying to find this shampoo is enough to make your hair curl.
But we persevered and found it at Drug Emporium, 1543 Ga. 138 in
Conyers (770-929-0274). An 8-ounce bottle is $3.29. Made for fine,
limp, dry hair, this shampoo, says manufacturer Nutra Care, ``will
leave your hair fresh and clean and provide the most beautiful
curls with body, bounce and resilience after styling.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: For many years, I have been a fan of Fracas perfume, but
lately I have not been able to find it. Do they still make it? My
husband gave me this perfume when we were engaged in 1950. That's
why I am deeply attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Mueller, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Fans of this fragrance from French designer Robert Piguet are
legion and include Madonna, Kim Basinger, Martha Stewart and
Courtney Love. The white floral _ consisting of tuberose, jasmine,
jonquil, lily of the valley, white iris _ first hit counters in
1948, dropped out of sight in the United States in the '80s, then
was relaunched in 1996. For a limited time, the company is offering
a 1.7-ounce eau de parfum spray and 4-ounce body lotion in a black
evening bag trimmed with white flowers ($55). Look for it at
Scentimentals, 9700 Medlock Bridge Road, Duluth (678-417-0422) You
can also buy the fragrance separately at Neiman Marcus in Lenox
Square (404-266-8200). A 1/4-ounce parfum is $75; a 1.7-ounce eau
de parfum spray is $60.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you please help us find the embroidered cotton shirt
called a guayabera in size XL. These shirts come in pastels and
white and are worn loosely over trousers. No one in the Georgia
mountains seems to know what we want, and our husbands are about to
wear out their old ones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alice Green and Shirley Paul
</P>
<P>
   A: This summer, your spouses will be stylish and dapper in their
guayaberas. Made of cotton, these short-sleeved sport shirts were
originally worn by men in Cuba. They have large front pockets and
are trimmed with embroidery and tucks. We discovered our shirt
($7.95) at Haband Outlet, 2105 LaVista Road N.E. (404-633-1993). It
comes in pastels and white and is available in sizes up to 3X.
Similar shirts are known as Mexican wedding shirts, because grooms
wear them for weddings in Mexico.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a brilliant afternoon recently, fresh off a flight
from Detroit and eager to absorb the sun's rays pouring into a
frenzied haunt near Lincoln Center, Michael Daugherty was doing
what he claims to do best: peeling away layers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you?'' he asked his unwitting accomplice, a waitress,
sizing her up. ``Are you an actress or a dancer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An actress and a singer, mostly musical theater,'' she
responded, complete with a new Screen Actors Guild card, a small
part in an Off Off Broadway show and hopes for a break, soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you have to be patient,'' Daugherty said, gesturing
toward Avery Fisher Hall, the home of the New York Philharmonic.
``I'm 45 years old, and I'm just having my first piece played over
there. It takes a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, yeah,'' she said. ``In fact, I just got a guy who is 38
or something, and he just got a Broadway play.''
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty smiled, his bubble only slightly deflated by the
woman's reluctance to play his game. ``Well, some people have it
young,'' he said, ``but usually it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, is there a Xerox machine anywhere in the
restaurant?'' he asked, not quite matter-of-factly. ``Would you
mind making a few copies for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Charmed, the waitress headed toward the back office, papers in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what my father has done his whole life,'' Daugherty
explained. ``Wherever I am, I talk with people: the store owner,
the concertmaster, the waitress. I like to talk. I like to listen.
Some composers are always filtering everything out to write `pure'
music. I'm always tuned to the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   With its pop-culture imagery and playful inclusion of jazz, rock
and funk, Daugherty's music could hardly be called pure in any
sense of the word. And where on earth _ or beyond _ he is tuned,
listeners may judge for themselves beginning My 17, when the
Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Slatkin, presents Daugherty's
``U.F.O.,'' a concerto written for and about the Scottish
percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Commissioned by Slatkin and the
National Symphony, the work was given its premiere last year in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty described the effervescent Glennie, who, improbably
for a percussionist, is deaf, as having an ``otherworldly, magical
presence.'' The work, drawing its inspiration from the
flying-saucer shape of cymbals (one of Glennie's is named Alien
Disc by the manufacturer) and from the myriad other unidentifiable
objects in a percussionist's battery, fits neatly into Daugherty's
gimmick-laden catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He has, after all, paid musical homage to Liberace (``Le Tombeau
de Liberace'' for piano and orchestra), Elvis Presley (``Dead
Elvis'' for bassoon and orchestra), J. Edgar Hoover (the string
quartet ``Sing Sing''), Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (the opera
``Jackie O''), Desi Arnaz (``Desi'' for symphonic winds), Barbie
(``What's That Spell?'' for two vocalists and small ensemble) and
Superman (``Metropolis Symphony''); sometimes, even in non-operatic
works, the characters are represented by musicians in costume. A
cursory glance also reveals titles evocative of 1930s pulp
magazines, names like ``Sunset Strip,'' ``Route 66,'' ``Flamingo''
and ``Bizarro.''
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty has held news conferences in bowling alleys. And the
cover of his CD ``American Icons'' shows him, all 6 feet 8 inches,
wearing a beret and a leather vest, and pattering on bongos in the
middle of a heartland highway.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises the question: is this stuff for real?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Daugherty said, rattling off a list of
commissions in the works for ensembles including the Philadelphia
Orchestra and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which
this year awarded him its Elise L. Stoeger Prize. ``There's a
veneer of pop culture, but think about the way film critics write
about alternative movies: say, `Buffalo 66' or `Pulp Fiction.' They
play off American culture. In classical music, this really hasn't
been done much. It is a lonely journey in some ways.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was a journey Daugherty began in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where
his mother was a physical-education teacher and his father a
dance-band drummer who subsidized his livelihood with stints as a
used-car salesman, an ambulance driver and a manager of a women's
clothing store. The oldest of five musical brothers, who all turned
professional, Daugherty grew up playing keyboards in local bands,
enamored of the soulful syncopation of early Motown and the wails
and growls of James Brown, whose recordings he tracked down in
black-owned beauty shops across town.
</P>
<P>
   He studied jazz at North Texas State University but discovered
instead a passion for orchestral music. In 1976, he moved to New
York, where Pierre Boulez was the Philharmonic's music director,
and the driving force in composition was an exhaustive complexity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, on a Fulbright fellowship, he traveled to Paris to
study at Ircam, the center for acoustical and musical research
founded by Boulez. There, in front of his computer, Daugherty
himself subscribed to the more-is-more theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that I wanted to understand the most complex music
being written at the time, and I learned how to do that,'' he said.
``And then I had all the techniques under my belt, but at the same
time I couldn't find a connection with my past. Anything emotional
to me, I couldn't make that connection in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   He fared better at Yale, to which he had been drawn by his
curiosity about the Connecticut composer Charles Ives and, in turn,
Ives' interest in another New Englander, Ralph Waldo Emerson. While
working toward a doctorate (which he earned in 1986), he studied
composition with Earle Brown, Jacob Druckman, Bernard Rands and
Roger Reynolds, trying to determine, in his words, ``what it meant
to be a composer, emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something that was never discussed in all my
schooling,'' he said. ``All through the years, you're going to
concerts, meeting composers, but the emphasis is always on the
technical: how to build, how to write, how to come up with new
tuning systems or new ways to structure music using mathematical
principles like algorithms. Now I was searching for an emotional
core.''
</P>
<P>
   He found it through the nurturing of the Hungarian composer
Gyorgy Ligeti, with whom he studied from 1982 to 1984 in Hamburg,
Germany. ``Ligeti was the one who encouraged me to look back to my
roots,'' he said. ``Here you had one of the heavy avant-garde
composers of the 20th century telling me that European contemporary
music was dead and to look back to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Midwest for the first time since he had left
for college, to a teaching gig at Oberlin College in Ohio,
Daugherty rekindled his love of car culture and embarked on an
adventure of rediscovery, driving through the back roads of
America, rummaging around book stores and antique markets and
mulling over the tales he pried from strangers who passed his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to spend hours going through outdoor flea markets, with
thousands of people selling knickknacks,'' he said. ``I would
discover one thing, maybe an old postcard, and I'd get the idea for
a piece. It was something that connected with me, like an icon or a
relic from the past. Going through those flea markets was like
going through the Louvre, but instead of Egyptian artifacts you'd
have American artifacts.''
</P>
<P>
   In his studio in Ann Arbor, where he now teaches composition at
the University of Michigan and lives with his wife, Yopie Prins, a
professor of English and comparative literature, and their
11-year-old daughter, Evelyn, named after Daugherty's mother, he
tinkers on his computers far into the night, responding to visual
stimuli scattered across walls and shelves, the fruits of his
never-ending peregrinations.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty's music, imbued with a wry sense of timing and eerie
references to the past, is a sort of collage, though he loathes the
term (along with ``postmodern'') for its implied sterility and lack
of integrity. A single concept is explored in its most literal
sense; then layer after layer is peeled away, in the manner of an
archaeological exercise, until countless associations have been
examined.
</P>
<P>
   In ``U.F.O.,'' Daugherty envisioned limitless possibilities in
the changing nature of the percussion world. ``If you say, `eight
metal instruments,' and you let the percussionist choose them,'' he
said, ``the piece will always be evolving, because each
percussionist will always come up with new things to play, new
ideas, new sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by a replica of Glennie's arsenal, he tinkered with a
variety of atmospheric sounds he imagined that his alien muse might
have brought along on her trip to this planet. He imagined other,
less obvious things as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Leonard Slatkin's parents had played inHollywood
movie scores of the 1950s, and they most certainly played some of
those science-fiction scores. I love that sound of trilling
strings, and I wanted to evoke that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Glennie, the composer's embrace of performance-theater
issues within the framework of symphonic music has long held an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not at all afraid to display aspects of his life through
music which have been of influence to him,'' she said by e-mail.
``He has a distinct musical voice from which we can always expect
an element of surprise. I have to be a fan of a composer's work in
order to ask them to write a piece for me, as it was in Michael's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play a character, and this is a strong element in
the concerto. I am an alien encountering all things `earthy'
through my many `alien' instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, another of Daugherty's cultural compilations will
begin to take shape when the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, of which
he is composer in residence, gives the premiere of ``Rosa Parks
Boulevard,'' a tribute to the civil-rights legend, and the first
segment of ``Motor City Triptych,'' commissioned for the city's
tricentennial in 2001.

TREASURIES BOOSTED BY U.S. NOTE AUCTION, DOWNTURN IN STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities were up sharply
Wednesday, lifted by a successful government note auction and steep
losses in the stock market.

   The Treasury sold $8 billion new 10-year notes, an auction
market participants said was in line with expectations. The notes
were awarded at a price to yield 6.475 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In when-issued trading leading up to the sale, the notes were
being offered at a price to yield 6.48 percent, down from 6.52 the
previous day. The actively traded 10-year bond was yielding 6.42
percent Wednesday, down from 6.52 percent Tuesday. Its price, which
moves in the opposite direction, increased 23/32, to 100 18/32.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up 26/32, to 101
13/32. The bond's yield fell to 6.15 percent from 6.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rupert, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a market
research and analysis firm, said ``the weakness in equities gave a
boost to Treasuries.''
</P>
<P>
   With most participants anticipating a half-percentage point
tightening next week by the Federal Reserve, Rupert said, the
market would quickly turn its speculation to the June and August
meeting. A tame Consumer Price Index report next Tuesday could
diminish thoughts of a similar increase in June.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Cheung, vice president, Asset Management
Department/Fixed-Income Division of Wilmington Trust in Wilmington,
Del., said the bond market had incorporated an aggressive Fed move
into its rate structure. ``Equities have pretty well passed the
height of earnings releases and are likely to seek a trading range
while waiting for the Fed to hand out its next batch of medicine,''
Cheung said. ``We will just have to wait to see if it is a single
dose or a double shot.''

 &HT;    Noteworthy feat: Birds' songs quite sophisticated
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frogs croak. Dogs bark. Wolves howl. But birds sing.
</P>
<P>
   When songbirds chirp, trill and warble, we call it singing.
While some scientists argue whether birds' ``songs'' are true
music, many others believe that studies of songbirds can contribute
to the understanding of the origins of human music and its
evolution. To this end, biologists and musicologists are
collaborating in a relatively new field called biomusicology.
Birds' music, they note, lies very close to counterparts in the
music of people.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ornithologists have noted birdsongs pitched to the
same musical scales used by people. The wood thrush, a native of
Georgia, can conform to the familiar Western diatonic scale; the
hermit thrush, which winters in Georgia, may sing with the
pentatonic scale of traditional Asian music, according to research
by Luis Baptista of the California Academy of Sciences in San
Francisco. In fact, such musical phenomena as the borrowing of
melodies, singing in duets or duels, and passing down traditions
through families from generation to generation also show up in
birds, Baptista reports.
</P>
<P>
   Some species may even compose in sonata form. Another Georgia
native, the song sparrow, for example, ``belts out one of its
themes, equivalent to a sonata's opening exposition, then fiddles
with it a bit here and there much the same way a non-feathered
composer develops a theme,'' says a report in Science News. ``The
sparrow eventually burbles the original theme again, a version of a
sonata's final recapitulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring songs
</P>
<P>
   Ornithologists Georgann Schmalz of Fernbank Science Center and
Emily Jo Williams of the Department of Natural Resources are
leading a series of ``birding boot camps'' around the state this
month to help birders recognize birds by their song alone. The
hard-to-master skill is needed to help conduct a breeding bird
survey in the state this month. Some bird songs and calls, however,
may be easy to remember by using sound-alike phrases of mnemomics
and phonetics. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parula warbler: ``zeeee-up,'' buzzy ascending notes tipping
over at the end.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Common yellowthroat: ``witchety, witchety, witchety.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prothonotary warbler: ``zweet, zweet, zweet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Painted bunting: a cheery whistle, no mnemonic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Yellow-breasted chat: a buzzy buzz, no mnemonic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Black and white warbler: ``wheezy, wheezy, wheezy,'' sounds
like a squeaky metal wheel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Yellow warbler: ``sweet, sweet, sweet, I'm so sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tufted titmouse: ``peter, peter, peter.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Robin: ``cheer up, cheerily, cheerily.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  White-throated sparrow: ``poor Sam Peabody, Peabody,
Peabody.''
</P>
<P>
   Field notes
</P>
<P>
   Reports of first-time backyard sightings of rose-breasted
grosbeaks, beautiful songbirds that migrate through Georgia this
time of year, are pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley McCormack: ``We have lived in our house in Stone
Mountain 25 years. This year we have had rose-breasted grosbeaks
that we have never had before.'' Julie Warner of Gwinnett: ``I
don't know how common they are, but in the 3.5 years I've lived
here, this is the first time I've seen them.'' Linda Lee of
Lilburn: ``Today was the first time I had ever seen a rose-breasted
grosbeak. He was on our platform feeder eating until a blue jay
scared him away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sky
</P>
<P>
   The moon is in first-quarter phase, so look for it in the south
as it gets dark, says Fernbank astronomer David Dundee. None of the
planets are visible this week because they all appear too close to
the sun.

GYMNASTICS BODY PLANS TOUGHER OLYMPIC SELECTION PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ USA Gymnastics will choose its Olympic team more
subjectively than ever this summer to make sure the best athletes
make it to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to play by the same rules as the rest of the
world,'' said federation president Bob Colarossi Wednesday after
the selection procedures had been released.
</P>
<P>
   That means the women's committee can choose any six gymnasts,
regardless of the results of the July nationals in St. Louis and
the August trials in Boston. And the men's committee can name
four-time US champion Blaine Wilson even if he misses both
nationals and trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the team we put on the floor will be the team that
gives the US the best chance to medal at the Olympic Games,'' said
Colarossi. ``End of story. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other federations such as track and field and swimming,
which pick their Olympic squads at one-shot trials, USA Gymnastics
traditionally has opted for a more flexible process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're a subjective sport, we're not about the first
person to touch the wall or cross the wire,'' said Colarossi.
</P>
<P>
   Although the top three men (and almost certainly the top three
women) from the combined nationals/trials standings are guaranteed
tickets to Sydney in September, the federation still wants wiggle
room in case a top star can't compete in July or August. And
because international rules allow for one-event performers, USA
Gymnastics may decide to bypass an all-arounder to choose a
specialist who can produce a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to adapt to this, and select a team that
will be competitive,'' said Colarossi.
</P>
<P>
   However, the federation has tightened entry requirements for the
nationals, which count for 40 percent of the score. Except for
members of last year's world team, every gymnast must qualify at
preliminary events. That means members of the 1996 team such as
Shannon Miller and Dominique Moceanu, who've been struggling to
regain gold-medal form after lengthy layoffs, will have to place
well at the US Classic in Tulsa, Okla., in early July to make it to
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike last time, when Miller and Moceanu were allowed to
use their scores from nationals and skip the trials, gymnasts now
must compete at both events to guarantee spots. The one exception
is Wilson, who missed a world all-around medal by .001 points last
year but is coming off shoulder surgery. If he's injured or ill
this summer, he can petition directly to Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that for Blaine because of what happened to Dan Hayden
in 1988,'' said Colarossi.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, clearly the top US male that year, had to compete
injured at the trials and missed making the team, which finished
11th in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Though the selection procedures say only that the top three
women will be ``considered'' for guaranteed spots, national team
coordinator Bela Karolyi said it was ``highly, highly, highly
unlikely'' they wouldn't get them.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the men's and women's teams will be chosen by
committee shortly after the final trials events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not leave that arena without naming the US Olympic
team,'' promised Karolyi.

`THE LOVE MACHINE': SEX, LIES AND CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Easily the most unpleasant character in ``The Love Machine,''
Gordon Eriksen's malicious satire of cybersex, is the movie's pushy
prime mover, Becca Campbell (Marlene Forte), a fictional
documentary filmmaker who doesn't know the meaning of the word
boundary. Nosy, bullying, self-righteous and duplicitous, Becca is
so intimidating to the people she interviews in the name of truth
that it's a wonder any of them put up with her for more than five
minutes, let alone come back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Those unlucky people, all connected with New York University,
share something else. They lead secret erotic lives that they
flaunt on personal links connected to a Web site,
The-Love-Machine.com, set up as a prank by a cynical student
operating out of a science lab.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-behaved character is Julio (Gary Perez), a married
professor of Latin American studies who brazenly advertises himself
as a stud and exhibits nude pictures of himself and two dozen of
his student conquests. The most inexplicable behavior belongs to
Akira (Jun Suenaga), a Japanese student whose Web site shows
pictures of him and his gay roommate, Javier (Al Rodriguez),
embracing, even though Akira vehemently denies his homosexuality
when confronted with the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Shino (Tomo Omori) and her boyfriend, Mike (Will Keenan), are
exhibitionists who troll the Internet looking to fill out a menage
a trois. Beverly, a middle-aged librarian, publishes an explicit
diary of her (possibly imaginary) affairs with two much younger
men. Chip (Chip Garner), who is gay and black, is looking for a
boyfriend but has a finicky list of qualifications that practically
ensure his quest will be futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Machine,'' which opens Thursday, is so well acted
that in certain scenes it could pass as an actual documentary. Its
fatal flaw is not its execution but its premise. The movie begins
with the ludicrous assumption that the cyberspace alter egos of
these characters, most of whom reveal their faces (and a great deal
more), are super-secret identities that bring their owners deep
shame. When Becca first interviews them under false pretenses, they
are unaware that she knows of their alter egos, and every one of
them blithely dismisses the idea of making erotic connections via
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Our intrepid documentarian, however, has not only visited her
subjects' racy Web sites, she has surreptitiously trailed them with
a camera crew to uncover their secret lives. Exuding hostility and
contempt, she bluntly confronts first Julio, who threatens legal
action, and then his wife, Cecilia (Mariana Carreno), with evidence
of Julio's infidelities. She also takes it upon herself to inform
Akira's fiancee, Kyoko (Kayoko Takahashi), of her boyfriend's
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The most far-fetched assumption is that a deeply closeted gay
man, terrified of discovery by his strait-laced family, would allow
any compromising pictures of himself to be circulated. In real
life, moreover, people, especially those with exhibitionistic
tendencies, are much more likely to boast about their sexual
adventures in cyberspace than to try to conceal them. ``The Love
Machine'' is a nasty (if titillating) little film whose notions
about cybersex, shame and today's erotic climate are way off base.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT CRAFTS ITS OWN ANTITRUST REMEDY
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to a federal judge's order, Microsoft
Corp. on Wednesday rejected calls for a breakup and instead offered
to impose curbs on its business practices that it claimed ``fully
redresses the antitrust violations found by the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, announced after the close of the major financial
markets, Microsoft called on U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson to summarily dismiss a plan crafted by the Justice
Department and 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   That April 28 proposal would cleave the software giant into two
firms. One would market Windows operating system used by nearly 90
percent of personal computers, while the other would sell
applications products, such as Word and Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   But if the judge wants to weigh the government's breakup
proposal, then Microsoft said it would need six more months to
prepare its defense, to be followed by ``a full trial on relief''
to begin Dec. 2 in Jackson's courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   At a cable industry convention earlier Wednesday in New Orleans,
Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer declared, ``Our
company will not be broken up. It will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In offering its own remedies to correct what Jackson found last
month to be grossly illegal conduct, Microsoft said it was willing
to stop displaying the Internet Explorer browser icon on the
Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The company would also would let computer makers prominently
feature any other software, including products from Microsoft
rivals, on the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous amount of flexibility (for computer
makers) and a very large concession by Microsoft,'' Bill Neukom,
Microsoft's top lawyer, said in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft proposed a sliding schedule of further court dates,
each one linked to how far Jackson was willing to go in dealing
with the government's proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued that the ``need for deliberate procedures is
especially strong because much of the intellectual property the
government seeks to confiscate relates to products and
technologies, such as Windows 2000, that were not even mentioned at
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Court intends to consider such draconian relief,
Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and
deliberately,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a court-imposed timetable, a reply from the government is
due May 17. Jackson will hold an initial remedy hearing May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's proposals were part of a two-pronged legal strategy
by Microsoft. On the one hand, the company offers a remedy plan
that deals with the court's finding that it broke the law, while on
the other hand preparing a legal appeal that claims it did nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said that even if Jackson adopted the Microsoft plan to
the letter and rejected all the government's proposals for both
interim and long-term relief, the company would still ``consider''
filing an appeal to stay his order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has invited the court to destroy or hobble an
American company that is a model of success in the high technology
arena, and to do so explicitly to reshape the single most
productive and envied industry in the United States,'' the six-part
Microsoft filing said.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark antitrust ruling issued April 3 after months of
settlement talks collapsed, Jackson held that Microsoft had
illegally abused its monopoly powers in ways that harmed consumers
and throttled its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that ``despite the strongly disapproving language
used by the court in certain portions of its findings of fact and
conclusions of law, the antitrust violations actually found by the
court are not sufficiently broad to warrant the drastic relief
requested by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   It added, ``In stark contrast to the relief sought in its
complaint, the government seeks to rip apart the company that until
recently had the largest market capitalization in the world _ an
extreme remedy not even (originally) hinted at. ... The law and the
facts do not support such a radical step.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The formula that Microsoft submitted to Jackson on Wednesday
went a good deal further than a negotiated consent decree
settlement that would have been acceptable to the Justice
Department officials two years ago, on the weekend before the
government filed its landmark suit. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
rejected that deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the new plan did not go as far as its final offer in
settlement talks that failed shortly before Jackson issued his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The company's offer sounds similar to its 1995 consent
agreement, said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and
Information Industry Association. The Justice Department launched
the current antitrust case after claiming Microsoft violated that
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to turn back the clock to 1995 and say,
'OK, we can live with the consent agreement,' `` said Wasch, who
supports a breakup. ``It's the antitrust equivalent of 'no TV for a
week.' ``

&HT;     EX-JUDGE APPOINTED TO REVIEW SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER'S EDITORIAL
INTEGRITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp. appointed a former federal
judge Wednesday to review the editorial policies of The San
Francisco Examiner as a result of testimony by the paper's former
publisher that he offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorial
treatment in exchange for the mayor's support of Hearst's plan to
buy the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Charles B. Renfrew of San Francisco will lead the `` internal
review'' and will set the scope and duration of the inquiry, Hearst
spokeswoman Debra Shriver said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew was a U.S. District judge in Northern California from
1972 to 1980. From 1980 to 1981 he served as deputy U.S. attorney
general. In 1983, he became a vice president of Chevron Corp. in
charge of legal affairs, and in 1984 he became a Chevron director.
</P>
<P>
   His current law practice focuses on alternative dispute
resolution and internal corporate investigations, Hearst said.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony last week, Timothy O. White said he offered the
deal to the mayor on Aug. 30. White later disavowed the testimony
in a statement Hearst sent to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein, who said he was at the
meeting between White and Brown, said White made no such offer, and
denied that the newspaper's opinion pages were improperly slanted
in Brown's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst suspended White after his testimony, and appointed George
Irish, president of Hearst newspapers, as acting publisher of The
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   White's testimony came during a trial in federal court to decide
whether Hearst can buy the Chronicle for $660 million and pay a
local publisher to take the Examiner off its hands. Former mayoral
candidate Clint Reilly is trying to persuade a judge to block the
Chronicle purchase as a violation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Irish, responding to a petition signed by 80 Chronicle employees
expressing ethical concerns over White's testimony, said in a
letter Tuesday, ``Unequivocally, any practices that compromise
editorial independence or integrity will not be tolerated in the
newsrooms of any of our newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Hearst valued and respected White.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our confidence in his abilities that caused us to
promote him to the position of publisher and editor of the San
Francisco Examiner and we regret deeply the circumstance in which
he and we find ourselves,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Renfrew to review ``the correctness of White's
statements,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be unlimited access to any and all employees and
any and all documents,'' James Asher, the chief legal officer for
development of the Hearst Corp., told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew, 71, a graduate of Princeton University and the
University of Michigan Law School, spent almost two decades as an
associate and partner at the Pillsbury, Madison &AMP; Sutro law firm in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A Detroit native, he served in the Navy from 1946 to 1948 and in
the U.S. Army in 1952 and 1953.
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated to the federal bench by Republican President
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   At Chevron, he was involved in negotiations over a $77 million
settlement with four states, California, Washington, Oregon and
Arizona, in a lawsuit accusing Chevron, Mobil Corp. and Shell Oil
Corp. of gasoline price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he joined the San Francisco office of the law firm of
LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby &AMP; MacRae, concentrating on commercial
litigation as well as alternative dispute resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew has also served as panelist in disputes over legal fees
in major court cases. He is a member of an arbitration panel
appointed to decide how much to pay the lawyers who represented 46
states in a $206 billion settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trial on Reilly's suit continued Wednesday before
U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who unsuccessfully bid for The Examiner, contends
Hearst's proposed purchase of the Chronicle will result in an
illegal monopoly in which Hearst owns the only major metropolitan
daily newspaper in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly claims Hearst's plan to sell The Examiner to local
publisher Ted Fang and his family, and to give them a subsidy of up
to $66 million over three years, is a sham meant to facilitate
Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. He contends the subsidy is
insufficient to run a viable competitor to Hearst's Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst disputes Reilly's contentions. The Fangs also deny their
deal with Hearst is a sham. They have said their Examiner would
compete with Hearst's Chronicle for readers and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's testimony focused on one of Reilly's newspaper
consultants, Michael Weaver. Weaver testified that The Examiner
would lose $20 million to $50 million a year if it did not have its
profit-sharing agreement with the larger Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly had been expected to testify Wednesday as a key witness,
but his lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, said he would not call his client
to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Reilly consultant J. Scott Schmidt, a former
president of Thomson Newspapers West, which owned several daily and
weekly papers in California, testified that Hearst's subsidy was
not enough to support a ``worthy competitor'' to the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said it would take a subsidy of at least $50 million a
year for three to five years. And, he testified, the Fangs would
have to boost The Examiner's current daily circulation of 108,968
to about 300,000 to attract enough advertising to finance a
competitive paper. The Chronicle's circulation is 465,535.
</P>
<P>
   In his bid for The Examiner, Reilly sought a $200 million
subsidy from Hearst over six years, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Christopher Hockett, an attorney for
the Fangs, Schmidt acknowledged that he had no information about
the Fangs' plans for publishing The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted making math errors that resulted in his
over-estimating some annual costs by $28 million of publishing The
Examiner, though he said he stood by his overall conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto has said he may call Irish to testify about what he knew
of White's talks with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   White sent Irish two e-mails about conversations he'd had with
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 30, 1999, White said he and Bronstein had had lunch with
Brown that day, and, ``I asked Willie how I was going to justify to
my superiors in New York wanting to support him and cooperate with
him when he was seeming to go out of his way to make our lives
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was opposing Hearst's initial plan to buy the Chronicle
and close The Examiner if no buyer for it could be found.
</P>
<P>
   In court on May 1, Alioto asked White, ``Is it not correct that
you were in fact intending to convey to Mayor Brown that his
support for Hearst's proposed acquisition of the Chronicle would
result in more favorable treatment for him in The Examiner?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' White replied, adding, ``That wouldn't affect the
journalism side. It would affect the editorial side.''
</P>
<P>
   White later said he was tired and confused by Alioto's
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Bennack, Hearst's president, also is expected to testify
at some point in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, The Examiner and the Chronicle have had a joint
operating agreement to share combined revenue and costs of
printing, advertising and circulation. They split the remainder,
with each paying the costs of its independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was set to expire in 2005, but Chronicle
Publishing Co. decided to sell the Chronicle to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   The trial on Reilly's suit is the nation's first to consider
whether early termination of a joint operating agreement violates
the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act, which permits the agreements
as exemptions to antitrust laws. The act was meant to keep alive
newspapers that might otherwise fail, so communities could benefit
from multiple editorial voices.

<P>
   NEW YORK_ Trisha Brown's new jazz-inspired dance piece is a
beauty, a perfect blend of the vernacular and the abstract. The
work, ``Rapture to Leon James,'' received its New York premiere on
Tuesday night when the Trisha Brown Dance Company opened its second
and final week at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canto/Pianto,'' a revised suite of dances from Brown's staging
of the Monteverdi opera ``Orfeo,'' was also seen on a program that
included ``Locus,'' a solo, and ``For M.G.: The Movie,'' an oddly
private tribute by Brown to Michel Guy, who died in 1990; he
admired her work before and after he was France's culture minister.
The last two pieces exhibit a Brown trademark: too many ideas
behind each dance that the choreographer does not share with the
audience. A program note can provide a clue, but more often than
not the deliberately illogical can look merely arbitrary. ``For
M.G'' is hard going, but in ``Locus'' Brown seduces the viewer with
the quality of her performance.
</P>
<P>
   In this solo in silence, the movement (a long phrase including a
little twist of the torso, a hand lifting a foot, a forward bend
from the waist toward invisible corners) is less important than its
contrast between the fluid and the angular. One doesn't really have
to know that Brown once saw herself inside an imaginary cube and
that the locus of the title refers to more than one specific point
within that cube.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one doesn't have to worry about concepts in ``Rapture
to Leon James,'' in which Brown was inspired by a film featuring
James, who was a star of the Lindy Hoppers at the Savoy Hotel in
Harlem and who died in 1970 It is not that ideas, especially about
structure or distillation of social dances, are absent. It is that
the theatricality of a polished image takes over, making the
choreography accessible on several planes.
</P>
<P>
   The piece becomes an ode to jazz as music, dance and social
activity. The fine score by Dave Douglas complements the
choreography, too contemporary to turn to a literal interpretation
of swing music. Terry Winters' wonderful set, a tower of golden
disks, recalls cymbals or records. The dancing refers to
jitterbugging, the Charleston and lines in which Lindy Hoppers
would follow a leader. Yet like the score and the decor, the
dancing evokes the real thing without depicting it.
</P>
<P>
   Especially startling and effective is the way Brown adapts her
usual high-flying system of partnering to an image of swing
dancing. Kathleen Fisher and Keith Thompson's duet may recall
jitterbuggers' tosses and throws. Yet all the shapes are geometric
(a woman wrapped around a man's body with legs held out in V
formation). Mondrian's ``Broadway Boogie Woogie'' comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Tipton has outdone herself with the lighting, changing
the backdrop's colors. Jazz is hot or cool, and Tipton's palette
from fuchsia to turquoise creates the aura of shifting energy that
brings into relief the gray-white-black tones of the costumes. The
whole work gleams.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's brilliant conceit is that it takes two to jitterbug, and
the choreography is built upon pairs of dancers who rarely touch.
Two women, Brandi Norton and Fisher, set the pace, swiveling
torsos, swinging arms and extending legs. They dance in unison but
are apart, down to every waddle and pelvic thrust impelled by the
percussion.
</P>
<P>
   The melody on the brass instruments expands the dance. Thompson
and Stacy Matthew Spence shadowbox wittily across the stage, and
Thompson is superb when he leads a group: the image is of
improvisation, real or simulated. ``Rapture'' is about a community,
but the dancers, including Mariah Maloney, Seth Parker, Todd Stone,
Katrina Thompson and Abigail Yager, stand out as spirited
individuals. ``Rapture'' has legs.
</P>
<P>
   The music and choreography were commissioned by the American
Dance Festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts through their Doris Duke Awards for Dance and Jazz Music
Collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   The music was played live by Douglas, on trumpet, and his
musicians: Greg Tardy, tenor saxophonist; Greg Cohen, bassist; and
Susie Ibarra, percussionist.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Canto/Pianto,'' its four sections (``The Wedding,''
``The Message,'' ``Journey to the Underworld,'' ``The Death of
Orfeo'') offer a compressed version of the dramatic action that
Brown directed in Monteverdi's opera. The full production was seen
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last year, but this is the first
time the suite of dances from the opera has been performed in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Although the choreography is not literal, what looks like pure
movement is often combined with heightened gesture. At times a
dancer substituting for a singer mouths the words heard on a
recording. The group sections focus on jumbles of dancers who reel
off lines in cumulative patterns. Even more effective is the use of
frozen tension, as in the underworld, symbolized by four men in
slow motion. They line up, forming a wall with Fisher, standing in
beautiful stillness to one side.

MICROSOFT FILES COUNTERPROPOSAL TO GOVERNMENT'S BREAKUP PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq) filed its counterproposal to the
government's breakup plan Wednesday, asking instead for a remedy
involving limits on its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal asks Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who has ruled
the software company violated antitrust laws, to set restrictions
governing its license agreements with computer makers. The
restrictions would prohibit Microsoft from withholding license
agreements from companies that ship or promote operating systems
other than its ubiquitous Windows system.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also require Microsoft to allow computer
makers to ship versions of Windows that do not include Internet
Explorer, the company's Web browser, as a default browser.
</P>
<P>
   This plea for leniency, required by the court, comes despite the
company's clearly stated plans to appeal Jackson's ruling. In the
proposal, Microsoft seeks to show that even if the government's
case proves antitrust violations, breaking up the company is an
ineffectual and overly radical solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 17 attorneys general proposed last
month to split the company into two parts. One company would own
the operating system business while the other would own the
remainder of Microsoft's assets, including the Office software
package, Web browser and the MSN network of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal also contains conduct remedies,
including some that appear in the company's proposal. Two states
abstained from the government proposal because they oppose the
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares fell 1 5/8, or 2.4 percent, to close at 66
3/16 Wednesday. The proposal was released shortly after markets
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Conclusions of Law in the case, issued April 3, found
that the company was discriminatory in granting access to parts of
the Windows code called applications programming interfaces, which
software designers need to make their programs work with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   He also ruled that the company broke antitrust laws by tying
Internet Explorer to Windows. Microsoft contended that the browser
is an integral part of Windows, not an unlawfully tied application.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also found the company maintained its Windows monopoly
by setting deals with computer makers to promote Microsoft products
over those from rival software makers. Computer makers were also
kept from altering the desktop, the screen that appears when no
programs are running and features the icons of various programs,
Jackson ruled.

 CBS's `JESUS' MINISERIES SHOULD APPEAL TO ALL  
 By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Religion and television often are awkward companions, either
piously observant or discomfortingly distant in an effort to avoid
offending anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But they fit well together in CBS' ``Jesus,'' a four-hour
miniseries that airs at 9 p.m. Sunday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are followers of Jesus' teachings will find much to
admire and those who come from other religious, or non-religious
backgrounds will find a fascinating story that is both involving
and educational.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Sisto, a rising young actor best known for the films
``Clueless'' and ``White Squall'' and last season's ``The '60s,''
is compelling as Jesus, who carries himself with a sense of honor,
but also a touch of cockiness, as if he thrives on the awe he
inspires with his ``miracles,'' which his performance seems to
suggest are nothing but magic tricks to get people to pay attention
to him.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which was shot primarily in Morocco and partly in
Malta, has a lush look, giving the miniseries a sense of quality
and importance.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in a slightly fragmented style with the death
of Joseph, which prompts flashbacks to playful times as Mary and
Joseph deal with the realization of their son's birth. But Jesus
never loses his playful attitude, flirting with Mary of Bethany and
dancing at celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The film is filled with dramatic moments, heightened to just the
right level by Roger Young and composer Patrick Williams. That's
never more true than in a near-climatic scene between Jesus and
Satan, played with power and a persuasive argumentative style by
Jeroen Krabbe.
</P>
<P>
   Young has put together a superb cast that includes Jacqueline
Bisset as a radiant and supportive Mary, Gary Oldman as the Roman
governor Pontius Pilate, Christian Kohlund as the pious-but-weak
religious leader Caiaphas, and particularly G.W. Bailey in the
fictional role of Livio, a conniving adviser and informant to
Pilate.
</P>
<P>
   In a case where other roles can overwhelm an actor, it is
difficult to watch ``Will &AMP; Grace'' star Debra Messing as Mary
Magdalene without expecting a punch line, but she does convey some
tenderness. And Armin Mueller-Stahl is all but wasted in the brief
role of Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The film, utilizing a team of historical and biblical advisers,
presents its story in a way that should interest some and move
other viewers, without offending anyone, aside from those with the
strictest or most focused interpretations of the Bible. Like ``The
Ten Commandments,'' this ``Jesus'' could become a perennial
presence on television.

UNILEVER'S FIRST QUARTER PROFITS RISE 12 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Unilever, the food-to-detergents consumer goods giant
that is trying to buy Bestfoods for $18.3 billion, said Wednesday
that its first-quarter operating profit rose 12 percent in what the
company depicted as a first victory in an ambitious program to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of Unilever, a British-Dutch company based in
London and Rotterdam, had fallen sharply when the bid was announced
on May 3. It strengthened Wednesday on the earnings news, with the
British shares closing up 5.3 percent at 4.0375 pounds, or $6.12,
and the Dutch shares up 7.2 percent at 52.35 euros, or $48.09.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., has rejected the Unilever
bid and is said by analysts to be seeking a higher offer than
Unilever's $66 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in Unilever's stock price does not directly
affect the all-cash bid for Bestfoods, the parent company of
supermarket brands that include Knorr soups, Hellman's mayonnaise
and Dove soap. But Unilever's earnings performance offered what
analysts said was evidence that a $5 billion, five-year program
announced in February is showing results.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting measures include a plan to winnow Unilever's
1,600 brands to 400, close 100 factories and reduce the global work
force of 250,000 by 10 percent. Wednesday's figures, said David
Lang, an analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, ``reflect the
success they are having in focusing on major brands.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in profit, which surpassed analysts' expectations,
came without a strong gain in sales, indicating the effects of cost
cutting. The company said profit from operations rose to 716
million euros, or $659 million, compared with 640 million euros in
the period a year earlier. The figures were based on exchange rates
in the first quarter, lifted in part by the euro's weakness against
the dollar. Dollar sales in the United States account for about
one-fifth of Unilever's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Unilever's rationale in bidding for Bestfoods is to
strengthen its position in both the United States and in emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Bestfoods, Unilever has been pursuing an aggressive
strategy of acquisitions, buying Ben &AMP; Jerry's for $326 million and
Slim-Fast for $2.6 billion last month as part of what it says is an
effort to concentrate on high-growth top brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy of focusing resources on leading brands is on
track,'' the company's co-chairmen, Antony Burgmans and Niall
Fitzgerald, said in a statement. ``We are managing the migration to
a faster-growth portfolio without endangering our profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   They made no direct reference to the Bestfoods bid, which, a
company spokesman said, ``seems to be at a bit of an impasse.'' But
in a presentation to analysts, Unilever said it thought it had
offered a fair price, and a company spokesman said Unilever
believed there was a ``substantial role'' for Bestfoods managers in
a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the benefits of the proposed deal, the company
said the combination was like ``marrying the girl next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's figures showed Unilever's cost cutting to be
producing more notable financial results than similar measures at
the rival Procter &AMP; Gamble, which last month reported its first
drop in quarterly earnings in nine years.

PHYSICIST GROUP SAYS MISSILE DEFENSE TESTS FALL `FAR SHORT' 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM J. BROAD 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Physical Society, the world's largest group of
physicists, Wednesday faulted the Pentagon's test program for its
anti-missile defense system as ``far short'' of what the president
needs to make an informed decision about whether the proposed
weapon can actually shoot down enemy warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism comes as the Pentagon presses ahead with an
interception test set for June and President Clinton prepares to
decide afterward if the nation should build a limited defense
against missile attacks by rogue states. Its cost is estimated at
up to $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The group zeroed in on what it called meager testing of possible
ways an enemy might outwit the proposed weapon system, which would
consist initially of 100 ground-based interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, it said, should make no decision to build a
National Missile Defense unless it is shown ``to be effective
against the types of offensive countermeasures that an attacker
could reasonably be expected to deploy with its long-range
missiles.'' Such demonstrations, it said, could be achieved through
analysis and interception flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the group added, the tests that the Pentagon has
conducted and plans to carry out in the time before the president's
decision ``fall far short of those required to provide confidence''
in the technical feasibility of the weapon system.
</P>
<P>
   The physics group, based in Washington, in its brief statement
made no specific recommendations on what kinds of tests the
Pentagon should do prior to a deployment decision. The statement
was posted Wednesday on the group's Web site, www.aps.org.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said the group had ignored ``literally a
mountain'' of anti-missile research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident that our test data will allow the
president to make an informed decision,'' said Lt. Col. Richard
Lehner of the Air Force, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-missile flight test scheduled for June is the fifth in
a series bedeviled by delays. Two of the experiments were target
flybys, one succeeded in hitting a mock warhead and one failed.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner said 17 more tests are to be performed before 2005, when
the proposed system is to be switched on. Data from these
experiments, he added, will help designers improve the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   To date, targets in the interception tests have consisted of a
single mock warhead and a single decoy balloon. The Pentagon says
it plans to increase decoy complexity in future tests.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a 175-page study by the Union of Concerned
Scientists and the Security Studies Program of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology said that an enemy could easily fool the
anti-missile system with swarms of fake and disguised warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent friends and foes of the proposed anti-missile system
have asked the Clinton administration to delay a decision on
whether to build it until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The American Physical Society, which represents more than 42,000
physicists, said the anti-missile statement was adopted by its
48-member council on April 29, during its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, it said, does not imply that the group has taken
a position on the wisdom of an anti-missile deployment, only its
technical viability.

<P>
   If you suffer from a tinge of paranoia and worry about snoops
listening to your telephone conversations, a new device called the
Privatel may ease your mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Privatel, a 12-ounce box that plugs into an analog or
digital telephone, uses 168-bit encryption to scramble voice
communications over telephone lines. Two devices are required to
ensure secure conversations _ one for the caller and another for
the recipient. Once both users press the ``secure'' button on their
Privatel boxes, their conversation is unintelligible to people who
might be tapping the wire illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The device was designed by L-3 Communications, a New York
company that develops communications systems and other high-tech
products. According to the company, the Privatel is the same device
that has been used by the U.S. military, the National Security
Agency, and the FBI, among others. Developers at L-3 expect that it
will be popular among executives who rely on telephones to conduct
business with people in other countries, where restrictions on
wiretapping by corporations and government agencies are often
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't recognize that there is no protection of security
overseas,'' said Frank Lanza, L-3's chairman and chief executive.
``There is tremendous vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanza would not comment on whether the device's encryption could
be descrambled by the U.S. government. But it was the NSA that
approved L-3's commercialization of Privatel, so it seems likely
that federal agencies have figured out a way to decode the device's
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Each Privatel unit costs $595; the price drops to $495 if 100 or
more devices are bought at a time.

   Watching the Great Fire From a Safe Distance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We may never know whether the convergence of Mrs. O'Leary's cow
and a lantern started the Great Fire of Chicago on Oct. 8, 1871,
even though we do know that the blaze began in or near the O'Leary
barn. There was a long drought that year, and Chicago had thousands
of wooden buildings and miles and miles of wood-paved streets and
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Conflagration, as it was called, is chronicled on the
site of the Chicago Historical Society, with a written account and
photographs and prints of the city before and after the event
(www.chicagohistory.org/fire/intro/gcf-index.html). The site also
describes relief efforts and the city's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Fire overshadowed another huge blaze that same night.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 8, 1871, Peshtigo, Wis., a lumber town not far from
Green Bay, was devastated along with 1.25 million acres of
surrounding forest. Nearly 1,200 people died.

   Hearing Aid's Flexible Cover Makes a Good Fit Easy to Get  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walk-and-wear hearing is what Dr. Craig Newman, an audiologist
at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, calls the new hearing aids he
has been dispensing.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, Newman has been equipping patients with
a tiny digital hearing aid (about the size of a raisin) that is
easy to fit.
</P>
<P>
   The device is slipped into a soft foam disposable cover that is
much more flexible than the harder coverings of other hearing aids.
The foam, with a microchip inside, slides right into the ear canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audiologist programs the chip to provide clear sounds, and
you are in and out the same day,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing aid, a gray plastic device, is manufactured by Sonic
Innovations in Salt Lake City. A patient's hearing is evaluated and
an impression is made of the ear. In a few weeks, the patient
returns to have the doctor check the fit, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Judy Simpson of Magna, Utah, said she liked the
device because it eliminated the cleaning chores necessary with her
former hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the foam cover gets dirty, I can just throw it away and
put in a new one,'' she said. ``And because it's so tiny, most
people can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I've gone in for ear surgery because they can't see
a big thing sticking out of my ear.''

   When No Excuse Will Do, Hallmark Cards to Print Out
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through the miracle of technology, electronic greeting cards can
really save your hide when holidays (like, say, Mother's Day this
weekend) sneak up on you. But now you can ``care enough to send the
very best'' even if you don't have the time to go to the store and
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   SierraHome has just released its Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe
software, which will let Windows users customize and print genuine
Hallmark and Shoebox greeting cards. There are more than 3,000
cards included in the program's CD-ROM, including many of the same
designs that are sold in Hallmark stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe program is not limited to
greeting cards. The package includes Snapshot Express, a
photo-editing program, as well as event planner software to keep
track of birthdays and important dates, 10,000 clip-art images and
20 type fonts. There are also more than 150 templates that can be
used to create stationery, postcards, stickers, calendars and other
types of personalized products.
</P>
<P>
   The software also offers card content from Hallmark's Tree of
Life category, which focuses on Jewish holidays, as well as from
the company's Mahogany line, which offers African-American themes.
Maxine, the crabby old woman who is featured in a series from
Shoebox Greetings, makes an appearance among the card selections,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe can be purchased in software stores
or online at www.hallmarksoftware.com for $49.95 (or $29.95 for a
smaller version with less content). Hallmark also sells a selection
of cardstock-quality paper, suitable for use in home printers, that
can be ordered from a link on the site.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who already have electronic postage software, the
hardest part of card-sending now might be extracting yourself from
your chair to go to the mailbox.

Guzman presented his proposal in February, a thesis reviewer at his

&HT;     CLINTON ORDERS HELPS PROVIDE AIDS DRUGS TO AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed an executive order
Wednesday designed to encourage African nations hit by the HIV and
AIDS epidemic to import and manufacture inexpensive generic
versions of drugs to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The order halts any U.S. government move to penalize African
nations if they violate intellectual property laws by manufacturing
or importing cheaper generic AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The president's action codifies into law a bill that Democratic
Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin
tried unsuccessfully to include in an African trade bill likely to
pass Congress this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the devastating impact of AIDS, the United States will
not require or negotiate restrictive rules in the intellectual
property rights area,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Wednesday the president's order ``strikes a
proper balance between the need to enable sub-Saharan governments
to increase access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and the need to
ensure that intellectual property is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the order is consistent with World Trade
Organization rules, which give countries flexibility on
intellectual property laws if they are facing a public health
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug makers have opposed efforts to erode their patents on
expensive AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, said the pharmaceutical industry agreed
with the president on the need for incentives to develop new AIDS
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But he criticized the executive order for adopting a
``discriminatory approach to intellectual property laws'' and
focusing exclusively on pharmaceuticals. ``We recognize that AIDS
is a major problem, but weakening intellectual property rights is
not the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, in an impassioned speech Wednesday on the Senate
floor in which she stopped several times to wipe away tears, blamed
Republican Senate leaders for stripping the drug measure from the
African trade bill last week, calling it ``really unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Africa is facing a ``health emergency of monumental
proportions,'' with 5,500 people in Africa dying each day from
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   About 34 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected
_ equivalent to the population of California _ and 11.5 million
have died, representing 83 percent of the world AIDS deaths since
the epidemic began nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destruction caused by HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa by
far surpasses the devastation caused by famine, war and even
genocide in Rwanda,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HIV/AIDS crisis is driving families in Sub-Saharan Africa,
worn down by widespread poverty, to the brink of disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Infection among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa is eight times the
rate of infection worldwide. While Africa has 10 percent of the
world's population, it has 70 percent of the worldwide total of
people infected with HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is sparked by the HIV
virus, which attacks the body's immune system. HIV can stay dormant
for a period of years but when it progresses to the AIDS stage, it
renders the patient susceptible to a host of ailments, including
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the epidemic is taking a terrible toll on
children.
</P>
<P>
   Of 510,000 children killed by AIDS throughout the world, 470,000
were African children _ 92 percent of the world's total, Feinstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, AIDS has placed an entire generation of
Africa's children in jeopardy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   American AIDS groups immediately praised the executive order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans can be proud of their president today,'' said Jeff
Jacobs, director of governmental affairs for AIDS Action. ``With
the stroke of his pen Bill Clinton has signaled that this country
is seriously engaged in the global war in AIDS The best medicines
available to fight AIDS are outrageously expensive. Almost nobody
in developing countries can afford these therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights
Campaign, a Washington advocacy group for gays and lesbians, said
the executive order ``shows the commitment and the leadership of
the Clinton administration and acknowledges that we need a global
strategy to address the AIDS epidemic.''

<P>
   By Jodi Picoult
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pocket, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Picoult's latest novel reads like a cross between the Harrison
Ford movie ``Witness ``and Scott Turow's novel ``Presumed
Innocent,'' with a dose of television's ``The Practice'' thrown in
to spice up the legal dilemmas. An Amish teenager named Katie
Fisher is accused of murdering her newborn child after hiding her
pregnancy from her parents and her Amish boyfriend (he's not the
father). Philadelphia lawyer Ellie Hathaway takes her case and
moves in with Katie's family for the duration of the trial, giving
Picoult the descriptive fodder of Amish life (especially
interesting is her portrayal of the austere Aaron Fisher, Katie's
father). When Ellie's old flame, a psychiatrist, comes to evaluate
Katie, he stays on for another romantic go-round with Ellie. It's
all appealing, suspenseful reading, despite unbelievable courtroom
antics and a final scene that is meant as a surprise but reads like
an afterthought. Picoult, who lived among the Amish to research her
book, portrays them unsentimentally but compassionately. Enjoy.

   Leave it to ``The Onion,'' that shameless parody of print
journalism, to badmouth Special Olympians, to suggest that we
prefer Oprah's Book Club because the Drew Carey Book Club is too
challenging, to publish a guest column by JonBenet Ramsey. In other
news, we learn that Mother Teresa was sent to hell in a ``wacky
afterlife mix-up,'' that nine people were drawn and quartered at a
Renaissance Fair, that a new study proves human babies are not
inquisitive but are ``actually extraordinarily stupid.'' Last year
some very serious people published very serious books about the
major events of the 19th century, but ``The Onion'' came along and
aced them all with ``Our Dumb Century: 100 Years of Headlines From
America's Finest News Source.'' Is this book as funny as that one?
No, but it's close enough if you observe the ground rules: Always
remember that nothing is sacred (hence the photo of Christopher
Reeve and his chair bolted to the top of the Washington Monument),
and good taste is checked at the door.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Someone should write a book about Ted Conover - or maybe, in a
strange way, he has done it himself many times. His work is
sometimes called ``participatory journalism,'' but that, especially
in this case, seems inadequate to describe it. He has ridden trains
with hoboes in one book (''Rolling Nowhere''), travelled with
illegal aliens in another (''Coy(beginitalic)o(enditalic)tes'') and
mixed with Aspen's elite in ``Whiteout.'' But nothing engages
Conover's imagination like a prison. He tried to get into one as a
journalist, but was turned down, so he went in as a recruit and
spent a year as a corrections officer in Sing Sing, one of the
nation's most troubled maximum-security prisons (the title of his
book is the term for a novice officer). This is his fascinating
look at a disturbing place - every day, he writes, ``your stomach
lets you know, just before the shift starts, what it thinks of this
job'' - and the men who coexist there. It's a revealing book by one
of the most daring and compassionate journalists working today.

   ``I know you may be bored hearing so much about my hair, but
this is what matters when you are 13,'' writes Tarbox. ``Besides,
my hair was the only part of my body that I liked.'' The portrait
Tarbox paints of herself as a Connecticut 13-year-old is indeed
boring, and full of an adolescent's obsession with her flaws. and
her family's shortcomings. It might all be depressingly average,
except for one thing. In a teen chat room on American Online,
Tarbox met a boy named Mark, who was friendly and made good
conversation. They kept in touch, and their friendship began to
seem like destiny. Eventually he flew to Texas to meet her when she
was in Dallas for a swim meet, but there is nothing romantic about
what happened between them in his hotel room. Katie narrowly
escaped disaster, and, after learning from police that Mark was 41,
she and her mother pressed charges against him. This is a story
every parent should read, a cautionary tale about the importance of
love and, more importantly, vigilance. There's nothing boring about
it.

   If you love to fly or just like to watch the planes, the
Birdwatcher Report is for you.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, an aviation enthusiast who works for the city
Aviation Department, compiles the monthly report.
</P>

   Jones spends his spare time watching and photographing planes
that fly in and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He
researches the aircraft, and then writes the Birdwatcher report for
the Aviation Department newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   This month's issue include a report on the plane that brought
former Phoenix Suns guard Dan Majerle to the Valley as a member of
the Miami Heat (a former Malaysian Air System Boeing 727-212.)
</P>
<P>
   There are also photos of different planes at satellite airports
around the Valley, from a Chinese-built copy of a MiG trainer at
Deer Valley Airport to a ``forlorn DC-7'' sitting at Phoenix
Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   The site is linked off the main Sky Harbor page

   ``AUDOBON''
</P>
<P>
   We always thought the skull-and-crossbones label was enough, but
that was before we read (beginitalic)Audubon(enditalic), which has
learned that certain pesticides can be harmful if swallowed.
Cheerfully titled ``The Killer in Your Yard,'' the article offer
alternatives to soaking you lawn in DDT. There is a Big Stupid
Chart that looks toxic itself. After all, it is painted silver.
There is a well-done piece on new diseases that are cropping up in
the ocean, infecting coral reefs, seals, turtles, dolphins and many
other aquatic creatures. Experts believe that the combination of
pollution and global warming are tipping the scales in favor of
``underwater killers'' - bacteria, viruses, parasites and toxic
algae. Depressing, but informative. To lighten your spirits, the
magazine offers a guide to ``weekends in wilderness - pretty places
you can visit that are only a short drive from the city.'' Of
course, to Audubon, a short drive is like four hours. So fill 'er
up.

   ``GEORGE''
</P>
<P>
   If you stopped looking at this magazine somewhere along the way,
give it a second chance this month. It's been redesigned, and this
is the first issue to bear the stamp of its new editor, Frank
Lalli. It also comes out firing, with a fascinating excerpt from
the autobiography of feminist Betty Friedan, who reveals that her
husband physically abused her. The magazine, which has separate
covers for newsstand and subscriber sales, leads with a story about
Elian Gonzalez, and though you might be sick of that cute little
Cuban boy, this story actually tells the tale of three people who
survived the shipwreck and 11 others who died. My favorite article
is a piece by Jon Stewart, host of (beginitalic)The Daily
Show(enditalic), who is quietly becoming the funniest man on
television. Who else could get away with having Bob Dole as a
sideman?
</P>
<P>
   ``NEW YORKER''
</P>
<P>
   Offers some interesting slice-of-life features on jobs, all told
in the first person. One is the tale of a street vendor who sells
coffee and doughnuts off a cart in lower Manhattan. He hits the
street at 5 a.m. and has to deal with hostile yuppies all day long.
``The worst thing is the customers, almost all of whom are
appallingly hateful, horrible people.''' Hmmm. In New York? Naaa.
Another chronicles the exploits of a basketball coach at a Catholic
school who admits he breaks all sorts of rules recruiting players
and everyone looks the other way. (The school is not named). ``It's
what you have to do to win,'' he explains. Another longer article
follows a car salesman from his first day to his first big sale. In
between, there's some pretty funny stuff, including the inside
chitchat between the sales people. In the end, he ends up -
surprise! - disillusioned and bitter. You'd think a story like that
would have a happy ending, like ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PRIORITIES''
</P>
<P>
   Provides your daily dose of affirmation. To buy a magazine that
is subtitled ``The Journal of Professional and Personal Success,''
you just have to be something special. They offer a lightweight
feature on former Phoenix Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who gave up one
of the glitziest jobs in the world to spend time with his family.
Oh yeah, and travel around and broadcast games for TNT. Also
features a cover story on uber-director Steven Spielberg, which
apparently was written without actually talking to him. There are
some canned quotes from press releases, and an interview with
Spielberg's wife, actress Kate Capshaw, but no close encounters
with his E.T.-ness. They do, however, have a nice publicity still
of Spielberg sitting next to a dinosaur foot. In the self-help
category, there is a piece on how to survive a downsizing, and
another on how to work at your computer without contracting the
dreaded repetitive-stress injury. By the way, who took my chair?

``The worst thing is the customers, almost all of whom are
appallingly hateful, horrible people.''' Hmmm. In New York? Naaa.
Another chronicles the exploits of a basketball coach at a Catholic
school who admits he breaks all sorts of rules recruiting players
and everyone looks the other way. (The school is not named). ``It's
what you have to do to win,'' he explains. Another longer article
follows a car salesman from his first day to his first big sale. In
between, there's some pretty funny stuff, including the inside
chitchat between the sales people. In the end, he ends up -
surprise! - disillusioned and bitter. You'd think a story like that
would have a happy ending, like ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PRIORITIES''
</P>
<P>
   Provides your daily dose of affirmation. To buy a magazine that
is subtitled ``The Journal of Professional and Personal Success,''
you just have to be something special. They offer a lightweight
feature on former Phoenix Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who gave up one
of the glitziest jobs in the world to spend time with his family.
Oh yeah, and travel around and broadcast games for TNT. Also
features a cover story on uber-director Steven Spielberg, which
apparently was written without actually talking to him. There are
some canned quotes from press releases, and an interview with
Spielberg's wife, actress Kate Capshaw, but no close encounters
with his E.T.-ness. They do, however, have a nice publicity still
of Spielberg sitting next to a dinosaur foot. In the self-help
category, there is a piece on how to survive a downsizing, and
another on how to work at your computer without contracting the
dreaded repetitive-stress injury. By the way, who took my chair?

 &HT;    COULD ARIZONA'S LISA GRAHAM KEEGAN CUT IT AS EDUCATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd Bankofier, vice president of the Arizona Board of
Education, jokingly referred to her as ``Secretary Keegan'' during
a recent board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Secretary,'' as in Secretary of Education Lisa Graham
Keegan of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Some think it has a certain ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two influential magazine columnists, including George Will in
(beginitalic)Newsweek(enditalic), have mentioned Keegan, the
state's superintendent of public instruction, as a possible U.S.
Education secretary if George W. Bush is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Few now think the suggestion is far-fetched. In fact, all this
talk about Keegan's candidacy has Arizona folks wondering: Is she
qualified?
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top education post, now inhabited by Richard Riley,
is massive. The U.S. Education secretary is in charge of 175
programs and a $38 billion budget. The federal government pumps
money into such areas as bilingual education, lunches for
low-income students and classroom technology.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan-watchers have mixed views on whether she's ready to
ascend to the federal level. The complicated, well-spoken and
intelligent woman who moved to the state's top education job in
1994 after dabbling in politics in the Legislature has many allies
- and just as many detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Some like Keegan's stance on state testing and the fact that she
so quickly attached Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards to a
high school diploma. They applaud her for cultivating charter
schools, which are publicly and privately funded schools that are
meant to inspire competition and encourage district schools to do a
better job.
</P>
<P>
   And they say she could take her successes in Arizona onto the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say Keegan's alternative education system is
weakening public education rather trying to fix the problems from
within. They say she isolates those whom her state job is designed
to support, mainly teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this is happening as Arizona continues to land at the
bottom nationally when it comes to its high dropout rate, low
teacher salaries and per-pupil funding.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan is flattered by what she calls all of the ``pundits'
stuff.'' Her staff members were quick to fax the
(beginitalic)Newsweek(enditalic) column to local media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a fifth-grade son and second-grade daughter at
Kiva Elementary School in the Scottsdale Unified School District
acknowledges that she's not loved by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   She's willing to admit that the education system has flaws.
That's the only way to begin the process of change, Keegan said.
But that type of attitude has a tendency to offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fuzzy about opinions,'' Keegan said. ``You have to be
critical of the way things are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it bothers her when folks charge that she's trying to
dismantle public education. Just because she supports private
schools doesn't mean she's anti-public education, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My definition of public education is education that's
supported by the public, by which the child benefits,'' Keegan
said. ``So much of public education is private enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Love her or not, folks agree that Keegan has demonstrated
nimbleness and political savvy in recent months, gliding
effortlessly from Sen. John McCain's camp, where she spent at least
a week on the campaign trail, into the good graces of Bush after
McCain dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret she's hungry for a job in Washington, D.C., a
city she frequents. In 1994, she founded the Education Leaders
Council, a group of reform-minded education chiefs in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   Her national speaking engagements run from Harvard University to
the National Press Club to, most recently, a weekly gathering of
Republican senators. She's also been to Argentina twice to talk
about charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   While state Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoenix, may not
agree with Keegan's support of vouchers and other conservative
ideas, he does admit she possesses attributes that make her a good
candidate for U.S. Education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very articulate and good at expressing her perspective
on education,'' he said. ``She's willing to have a thoughtful
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about Keegan, it may be premature to start
taking her national press notices too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bush campaign officials are mum on the matter,
saying it's premature until the Republican National Convention
rolls around this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no list at this point,'' spokesman Scott McClellan
said. ``The governor will think about that in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan, who is 40 years old and has lived in the state since she
was 3, doesn't spend much time dwelling on her critics. She is
spending her time working on ideas for her job description, should
she find herself in the Bush Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said she would revise the way federal money goes to the
states, tying it more closely to each student instead of funding
programs. She would be an advocate for more charter-school laws and
encourage equal funding to get rid of the disparity between rich
and poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than mandate what states do, however, Keegan sees her
role as one in which she would free them up to increase student
achievement standards.
</P>
<P>
   That's why parent Onnie Shekerjian believes Keegan is qualified
to be education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush wants some one with courage, intelligence and
good common sense, then Lisa certainly should be in his top list of
people,'' said Onnie Shekerjian, who heads up the Arizona Parents
Association for Children's Education and has several children in
East Valley schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the national education chief needs to be in touch with
schools. Some school district officials across Arizona worry that
Keegan isn't, saying she makes decisions and then leaves districts
to carry them out without the needed resources.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, for example, the state Department of Education,
with the blessing of the Board of Education, decided to allow
students with limited English proficiency to have the math portion
of AIMS translated into their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   But officials made the call a week before the test was
administered.
</P>
<P>
   K.R. Scott, a Mountain Pointe High School government teacher who
ran against Keegan in 1998 as a write-in candidate, said Keegan
tends to isolate educators.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that, when she took office, she got rid of
professional education specialists and replaced them with
``political functionaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an inherent distrust of educators,'' Scott added. ``A
lot of people don't feel like they have a voice with her. If you
give her a national stage, I worry about the divisiveness.''

 &HT;    JEFF SHAARA PICKS UP FATHER'S PEN (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: MOVING IN ``E'' and ``L'' categories)

 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, no matter where you hide, destiny finds you.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jeff Shaara, who was a rare-coin dealer when his father
died in 1988. Though his dad had written a Pulitzer Prize-winning
book on the Civil War ((beginitalic)The Killer Angels(enditalic)),
Jeff had never shown any interest in writing.
</P>
<P>
   That would soon change.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Michael Shaara's death, the popularity of
historical fiction was surging, fueled by Ken Burns' sweeping
documentary (beginitalic)The Civil War(enditalic)(beginitalic).
(enditalic)In 1993, (beginitalic)The Killer Angels (enditalic)was
made into the Turner film (beginitalic)Gettysburg(enditalic), and
the movie's director suggested that Jeff find someone to write a
sequel and a prequel.
</P>
<P>
   He found someone all right - himself. Two bestsellers later,
Jeff Shaara is still surprised at his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people asked me, how did I get the courage to sit
down and write,'' said Shaara, who will be in Phoenix on May 17 to
promote his new novel, (beginitalic)Gone For Soldiers(enditalic).
``It really didn't take courage, because I had no expectations
{hellip} that any publisher would take this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara knows he'll be known as the son of Michael Shaara, whose
book was recognized as a masterpiece when it was published in 1974
but never enjoyed commercial success. Jeff said his first two
books, (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)The Last Full Measure, (enditalic)both of which are
headed to the big screen, were simply the continuation of his
father's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)I
showed the manuscript to my sister, and she said, `This is being
written by the ghost of Michael Shaara,''' Jeff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's proud when people compare his style to his father's
but that he never set out to imitate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that works,'' Shaara said. ``Then it becomes all
style and no substance. {hellip} The voice has to come from
somewhere else. I think, certainly, I've been influenced by my
father's style, there's no doubt about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a great compliment when somebody tells me they
see similarities in my style and my father's.''
</P>
<P>
   To produce the Shaara brand of historical fiction, both Jeff and
his dad put the reader into the minds of historical figures,
re-creating conversations during key meetings and battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hearing their thoughts and hearing their words,''
Shaara said. ``By definition, that's fiction. There was nobody
walking around behind these guys with a pad and paper writing down
everything they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some have criticized the re-creation technique, Jeff said
all the work is based on months of research. Shaara pored over
memoirs and eyewitness accounts to re-create history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those meetings are real. {hellip} Any of the commanders in the
book could have said any of the words that I'm putting in their
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many see as a break with his father, Shaara's new book
is not about the Civil War. Instead, he chose the Mexican-American
War, in which future Civil War commanders like Ulysses S. Grant,
Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson first learned the
art of combat. At that time, the two future Confederate generals
were fighting in the same uniform as Grant under the same Union
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, (beginitalic)Gone for Soldiers
(enditalic)(named for a verse in the Pete Seeger song
(beginitalic)Where Have All the Flowers Gone?(enditalic)) is the
story of two opposing generals, War of 1812 hero Winfield Scott of
the United States and Mexico's Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   To get inside their heads, Shaara found Scott's unpublished
memoirs at West Point and consulted Santa Ana's memoirs, which were
recently translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Shaara said the Mexican-American War (1846-48) often is
overlooked. Though it allowed the United States to acquire most of
what is now Arizona, New Mexico and California, its short duration
and proximity to the Civil War make it a footnote in most history
books.
</P>
<P>
   There are also strong parallels with Vietnam, Shaara notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was seen as a bully's war, (that) basically we were going
down there to grab land,'' Shaara said. ``The themes are similar.
You have this big muscular country going down and beating on these
little guys. You had a lot of that in Vietnam. There was also the
sense that the soldiers were unappreciated back home.''

everything they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some have criticized the re-creation technique, Jeff said
all the work is based on months of research. Shaara pored over
memoirs and eyewitness accounts to re-create history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those meetings are real. {hellip} Any of the commanders in the
book could have said any of the words that I'm putting in their
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many see as a break with his father, Shaara's new book
is not about the Civil War. Instead, he chose the Mexican-American
War, in which future Civil War commanders like Ulysses S. Grant,
Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson first learned the
art of combat. At that time, the two future Confederate generals
were fighting in the same uniform as Grant under the same Union
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, (beginitalic)Gone for Soldiers
(enditalic)(named for a verse in the Pete Seeger song
(beginitalic)Where Have All the Flowers Gone?(enditalic)) is the
story of two opposing generals, War of 1812 hero Winfield Scott of
the United States and Mexico's Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   To get inside their heads, Shaara found Scott's unpublished
memoirs at West Point and consulted Santa Ana's memoirs, which were
recently translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Shaara said the Mexican-American War (1846-48) often is
overlooked. Though it allowed the United States to acquire most of
what is now Arizona, New Mexico and California, its short duration
and proximity to the Civil War make it a footnote in most history
books.
</P>
<P>
   There are also strong parallels with Vietnam, Shaara notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was seen as a bully's war, (that) basically we were going
down there to grab land,'' Shaara said. ``The themes are similar.
You have this big muscular country going down and beating on these
little guys. You had a lot of that in Vietnam. There was also the
sense that the soldiers were unappreciated back home.''

   ``PLAIN TRUTH''
</P>
<P>
   By Jodi Picoult
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pocket, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Picoult's latest novel reads like a cross between the Harrison
Ford movie ``Witness ``and Scott Turow's novel ``Presumed
Innocent,'' with a dose of television's ``The Practice'' thrown in
to spice up the legal dilemmas. An Amish teenager named Katie
Fisher is accused of murdering her newborn child after hiding her
pregnancy from her parents and her Amish boyfriend (he's not the
father). Philadelphia lawyer Ellie Hathaway takes her case and
moves in with Katie's family for the duration of the trial, giving
Picoult the descriptive fodder of Amish life (especially
interesting is her portrayal of the austere Aaron Fisher, Katie's
father). When Ellie's old flame, a psychiatrist, comes to evaluate
Katie, he stays on for another romantic go-round with Ellie. It's
all appealing, suspenseful reading, despite unbelievable courtroom
antics and a final scene that is meant as a surprise but reads like
an afterthought. Picoult, who lived among the Amish to research her
book, portrays them unsentimentally but compassionately. Enjoy.

<P>
   (Three Rivers, $16)
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to ``The Onion,'' that shameless parody of print
journalism, to badmouth Special Olympians, to suggest that we
prefer Oprah's Book Club because the Drew Carey Book Club is too
challenging, to publish a guest column by JonBenet Ramsey. In other
news, we learn that Mother Teresa was sent to hell in a ``wacky
afterlife mix-up,'' that nine people were drawn and quartered at a
Renaissance Fair, that a new study proves human babies are not
inquisitive but are ``actually extraordinarily stupid.'' Last year
some very serious people published very serious books about the
major events of the 19th century, but ``The Onion'' came along and
aced them all with ``Our Dumb Century: 100 Years of Headlines From
America's Finest News Source.'' Is this book as funny as that one?
No, but it's close enough if you observe the ground rules: Always
remember that nothing is sacred (hence the photo of Christopher
Reeve and his chair bolted to the top of the Washington Monument),
and good taste is checked at the door.

   By Ted Conover
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Someone should write a book about Ted Conover - or maybe, in a
strange way, he has done it himself many times. His work is
sometimes called ``participatory journalism,'' but that, especially
in this case, seems inadequate to describe it. He has ridden trains
with hoboes in one book (''Rolling Nowhere''), travelled with
illegal aliens in another (''Coy(beginitalic)o(enditalic)tes'') and
mixed with Aspen's elite in ``Whiteout.'' But nothing engages
Conover's imagination like a prison. He tried to get into one as a
journalist, but was turned down, so he went in as a recruit and
spent a year as a corrections officer in Sing Sing, one of the
nation's most troubled maximum-security prisons (the title of his
book is the term for a novice officer). This is his fascinating
look at a disturbing place - every day, he writes, ``your stomach
lets you know, just before the shift starts, what it thinks of this
job'' - and the men who coexist there. It's a revealing book by one
of the most daring and compassionate journalists working today.

   By Katherine Tarbox
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you may be bored hearing so much about my hair, but
this is what matters when you are 13,'' writes Tarbox. ``Besides,
my hair was the only part of my body that I liked.'' The portrait
Tarbox paints of herself as a Connecticut 13-year-old is indeed
boring, and full of an adolescent's obsession with her flaws. and
her family's shortcomings. It might all be depressingly average,
except for one thing. In a teen chat room on American Online,
Tarbox met a boy named Mark, who was friendly and made good
conversation. They kept in touch, and their friendship began to
seem like destiny. Eventually he flew to Texas to meet her when she
was in Dallas for a swim meet, but there is nothing romantic about
what happened between them in his hotel room. Katie narrowly
escaped disaster, and, after learning from police that Mark was 41,
she and her mother pressed charges against him. This is a story
every parent should read, a cautionary tale about the importance of
love and, more importantly, vigilance. There's nothing boring about
it.

</P>
<P>
   If you love to fly or just like to watch the planes, the
Birdwatcher Report is for you.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, an aviation enthusiast who works for the city
Aviation Department, compiles the monthly report.
</P>
<P>
   Jones spends his spare time watching and photographing planes
that fly in and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He
researches the aircraft, and then writes the Birdwatcher report for
the Aviation Department newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   This month's issue include a report on the plane that brought
former Phoenix Suns guard Dan Majerle to the Valley as a member of
the Miami Heat (a former Malaysian Air System Boeing 727-212.)
</P>
<P>
   There are also photos of different planes at satellite airports
around the Valley, from a Chinese-built copy of a MiG trainer at
Deer Valley Airport to a ``forlorn DC-7'' sitting at Phoenix
Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   The site is linked off the main Sky Harbor page
(http://www.phxskyharbor.com/skyharbr/index.html), which has plenty
more information about the airport.

   ``AUDOBON''
</P>
<P>
   We always thought the skull-and-crossbones label was enough, but
that was before we read (beginitalic)Audubon(enditalic), which has
learned that certain pesticides can be harmful if swallowed.
Cheerfully titled ``The Killer in Your Yard,'' the article offer
alternatives to soaking you lawn in DDT. There is a Big Stupid
Chart that looks toxic itself. After all, it is painted silver.
There is a well-done piece on new diseases that are cropping up in
the ocean, infecting coral reefs, seals, turtles, dolphins and many
other aquatic creatures. Experts believe that the combination of
pollution and global warming are tipping the scales in favor of
``underwater killers'' - bacteria, viruses, parasites and toxic
algae. Depressing, but informative. To lighten your spirits, the
magazine offers a guide to ``weekends in wilderness - pretty places
you can visit that are only a short drive from the city.'' Of
course, to Audubon, a short drive is like four hours. So fill 'er
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``GEORGE''
</P>
<P>
   If you stopped looking at this magazine somewhere along the way,
give it a second chance this month. It's been redesigned, and this
is the first issue to bear the stamp of its new editor, Frank
Lalli. It also comes out firing, with a fascinating excerpt from
the autobiography of feminist Betty Friedan, who reveals that her
husband physically abused her. The magazine, which has separate
covers for newsstand and subscriber sales, leads with a story about
Elian Gonzalez, and though you might be sick of that cute little
Cuban boy, this story actually tells the tale of three people who
survived the shipwreck and 11 others who died. My favorite article
is a piece by Jon Stewart, host of (beginitalic)The Daily
Show(enditalic), who is quietly becoming the funniest man on
television. Who else could get away with having Bob Dole as a
sideman?
</P>
<P>
   ``NEW YORKER''
</P>
<P>
   Offers some interesting slice-of-life features on jobs, all told
in the first person. One is the tale of a street vendor who sells
coffee and doughnuts off a cart in lower Manhattan. He hits the
street at 5 a.m. and has to deal with hostile yuppies all day long.
``The worst thing is the customers, almost all of whom are
appallingly hateful, horrible people.''' Hmmm. In New York? Naaa.
Another chronicles the exploits of a basketball coach at a Catholic
school who admits he breaks all sorts of rules recruiting players
and everyone looks the other way. (The school is not named). ``It's
what you have to do to win,'' he explains. Another longer article
follows a car salesman from his first day to his first big sale. In
between, there's some pretty funny stuff, including the inside
chitchat between the sales people. In the end, he ends up -
surprise! - disillusioned and bitter. You'd think a story like that
would have a happy ending, like ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PRIORITIES''
</P>
<P>
   Provides your daily dose of affirmation. To buy a magazine that
is subtitled ``The Journal of Professional and Personal Success,''
you just have to be something special. They offer a lightweight
feature on former Phoenix Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who gave up one
of the glitziest jobs in the world to spend time with his family.
Oh yeah, and travel around and broadcast games for TNT. Also
features a cover story on uber-director Steven Spielberg, which
apparently was written without actually talking to him. There are
some canned quotes from press releases, and an interview with
Spielberg's wife, actress Kate Capshaw, but no close encounters
with his E.T.-ness. They do, however, have a nice publicity still
of Spielberg sitting next to a dinosaur foot. In the self-help
category, there is a piece on how to survive a downsizing, and
another on how to work at your computer without contracting the
dreaded repetitive-stress injury. By the way, who took my chair?

   That's ``Secretary,'' as in Secretary of Education Lisa Graham
Keegan of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Some think it has a certain ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two influential magazine columnists, including George Will in
(beginitalic)Newsweek(enditalic), have mentioned Keegan, the
state's superintendent of public instruction, as a possible U.S.
Education secretary if George W. Bush is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Few now think the suggestion is far-fetched. In fact, all this
talk about Keegan's candidacy has Arizona folks wondering: Is she
qualified?
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top education post, now inhabited by Richard Riley,
is massive. The U.S. Education secretary is in charge of 175
programs and a $38 billion budget. The federal government pumps
money into such areas as bilingual education, lunches for
low-income students and classroom technology.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan-watchers have mixed views on whether she's ready to
ascend to the federal level. The complicated, well-spoken and
intelligent woman who moved to the state's top education job in
1994 after dabbling in politics in the Legislature has many allies
- and just as many detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Some like Keegan's stance on state testing and the fact that she
so quickly attached Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards to a
high school diploma. They applaud her for cultivating charter
schools, which are publicly and privately funded schools that are
meant to inspire competition and encourage district schools to do a
better job.
</P>
<P>
   And they say she could take her successes in Arizona onto the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say Keegan's alternative education system is
weakening public education rather trying to fix the problems from
within. They say she isolates those whom her state job is designed
to support, mainly teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this is happening as Arizona continues to land at the
bottom nationally when it comes to its high dropout rate, low
teacher salaries and per-pupil funding.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan is flattered by what she calls all of the ``pundits'
stuff.'' Her staff members were quick to fax the
(beginitalic)Newsweek(enditalic) column to local media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a fifth-grade son and second-grade daughter at
Kiva Elementary School in the Scottsdale Unified School District
acknowledges that she's not loved by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   She's willing to admit that the education system has flaws.
That's the only way to begin the process of change, Keegan said.
But that type of attitude has a tendency to offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fuzzy about opinions,'' Keegan said. ``You have to be
critical of the way things are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it bothers her when folks charge that she's trying to
dismantle public education. Just because she supports private
schools doesn't mean she's anti-public education, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My definition of public education is education that's
supported by the public, by which the child benefits,'' Keegan
said. ``So much of public education is private enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Love her or not, folks agree that Keegan has demonstrated
nimbleness and political savvy in recent months, gliding
effortlessly from Sen. John McCain's camp, where she spent at least
a week on the campaign trail, into the good graces of Bush after
McCain dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret she's hungry for a job in Washington, D.C., a
city she frequents. In 1994, she founded the Education Leaders
Council, a group of reform-minded education chiefs in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   Her national speaking engagements run from Harvard University to
the National Press Club to, most recently, a weekly gathering of
Republican senators. She's also been to Argentina twice to talk
about charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   While state Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoenix, may not
agree with Keegan's support of vouchers and other conservative
ideas, he does admit she possesses attributes that make her a good
candidate for U.S. Education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very articulate and good at expressing her perspective
on education,'' he said. ``She's willing to have a thoughtful
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about Keegan, it may be premature to start
taking her national press notices too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bush campaign officials are mum on the matter,
saying it's premature until the Republican National Convention
rolls around this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no list at this point,'' spokesman Scott McClellan
said. ``The governor will think about that in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan, who is 40 years old and has lived in the state since she
was 3, doesn't spend much time dwelling on her critics. She is
spending her time working on ideas for her job description, should
she find herself in the Bush Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said she would revise the way federal money goes to the
states, tying it more closely to each student instead of funding
programs. She would be an advocate for more charter-school laws and
encourage equal funding to get rid of the disparity between rich
and poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than mandate what states do, however, Keegan sees her
role as one in which she would free them up to increase student
achievement standards.
</P>
<P>
   That's why parent Onnie Shekerjian believes Keegan is qualified
to be education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush wants some one with courage, intelligence and
good common sense, then Lisa certainly should be in his top list of
people,'' said Onnie Shekerjian, who heads up the Arizona Parents
Association for Children's Education and has several children in
East Valley schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the national education chief needs to be in touch with
schools. Some school district officials across Arizona worry that
Keegan isn't, saying she makes decisions and then leaves districts
to carry them out without the needed resources.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, for example, the state Department of Education,
with the blessing of the Board of Education, decided to allow
students with limited English proficiency to have the math portion
of AIMS translated into their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   But officials made the call a week before the test was
administered.
</P>
<P>
   K.R. Scott, a Mountain Pointe High School government teacher who
ran against Keegan in 1998 as a write-in candidate, said Keegan
tends to isolate educators.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that, when she took office, she got rid of
professional education specialists and replaced them with
``political functionaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an inherent distrust of educators,'' Scott added. ``A
lot of people don't feel like they have a voice with her. If you
give her a national stage, I worry about the divisiveness.''

 &HT;    Youngsters show little grasp of issues facing Cuban boy
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three grown men in long black robes will rely on their
collective legal wisdom to decide whether a 6-year-old boy can ask
for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   For what it matters, most kids that age in metro Atlanta don't
know what political asylum is.
</P>
<P>
   They can't even spell it.
</P>
<P>
   The topic comes up because the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
downtown Atlanta is to hear argument today in the case of Elian
Gonzalez, the 6-year-old whose mom drowned while trying to bring
him here from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen found Elian on an inner tube in the ocean last fall.
His dad wants to take Elian back to Cuba, but the boy applied for
political asylum while living with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   First-graders at Holy Innocents' Episcopal School in Sandy
Springs have heard about the case on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fisherman found him,'' one boy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No! It was a dolphin!'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian is a first-grader just like them, and since he
signed an eight-page application for asylum that comes with 12
pages of instructions, it seemed natural to ask them if they know
what ``political asylum'' means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's somebody being nice to somebody,'' said Mitchell
Tucker, 7, as he crumpled and uncrumpled a pale white Dixie cup
with a design of light pink and yellow flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it stealing?'' one asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking?'' asked another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forget what political means,'' said Christine Georgakokos,
7.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Ernst, a girl with short, dark hair and round glasses,
shot her right hand up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's being nice to somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``These questions are, like, for high schoolers,'' Megan said,
staring down at the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me a sports question,'' Mitchell said, still crumpling his
Dixie cup.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of his classmates sat under a tree near the playground
Tuesday afternoon to answer tough questions about refugees and
asylum and persecution. They snapped twigs and picked one blade of
grass after another.
</P>
<P>
   First-grader Charlie Stroman craned his neck toward the
playground while the boy beside him, Addison Baitcher, tried to
crack the asylum riddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm missing art,'' Charlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God!'' Charlie said. ``We're missing art for sure!''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government gives asylum to people fleeing
persecution suffered because of their race, religion, nationality,
membership in a social group or public opinion. So what does
persecution mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like punching you and stuff and they take them to jail
and put them in the electric chair,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooo! I know! I know!'' Charlie said. ``I'm serious!''
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like going to jail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later and 45 miles away, the youngsters on the White
Sox T-ball team of the McDonough Youth Association wrestled
uneasily with the questions and arrived at similarly vague
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Brett McDevitt, a 5-year-old who would rather have been on the
swing set, answered questions patiently in dusty cleats, a white
uniform with black pinstripes and an oversized black baseball cap
that said ``Sox'' just like the ones in the Major Leagues. When
asked to define political asylum, he volunteered a half-hearted
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaf?''
</P>
<P>
   His mom, Bonnie McDevitt, said Brett can make decisions about
what to order in a restaurant _ it's usually a toss-up between a
hot dog or chicken _ but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they act on impulse,'' she said of kids his age.
</P>
<P>
   Brett crossed his arms across his chest and narrowed his eyes
when asked a typical question _ Question 3 of Part D _ of Form
I-589, the Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal,
the very same form that Elian signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you, your spouse, your child(ren) or your parents ever
filed for, been processed for or been granted or denied refugee
status or asylum by any other country?''
</P>
<P>
   Brett didn't understand the question, but said an older kid
might.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Thomas Lavergne, a baseball player who was at George C.
Alexander Memorial Park on Tuesday evening and who, at 9, is a full
three years older than Elian. Did he know what the government was
asking in Question 3 of Part D?
</P>
<P>
   ``How my family is run?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas on political asylum:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of that word.''
</P>
<P>
   On the meaning of persecution:
</P>
<P>
   ``It just flew out of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   One 6-year-old at the park thought Cuba was ``a kind of musical
instrument.'' Another 6-year-old, Matthew Davis, thought the name
``Elian Gonzalez'' sounded familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's close to Speedy Gonzalez,'' he said, chomping bubble
gum before a game against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Most in children were eager to please when asked to spell
``asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I-C-L-M-E,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A-S-I-G-H-T-H-E-M,'' said Ben Hart, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rodden-Bayo, an 8-year-old whose mom came here from Cuba
when she was 2, came a little closer when he spelled ``asylum'' as
``A-S-C-L-I-M-E.'' He said he's heard the words ``political
asylum'' and ``persecution'' on television but does not know
exactly what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   He knows who Elian Gonzalez is, though, and he thinks the
government should let him stay because Cuba is a dangerous place
with an awful human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better in the United States than it is in Cuba,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His mom, Lourdes Bayo, said she thinks her son was ``mature
enough'' at age 6 ``to know where he wanted to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children might not understand'' legal terms like asylum or
persecution, she said, ``but they understand how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big issue here is that the media is making it seem
like children cannot make their own decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids do not make the decisions in Justin Ray's house. He's a shy
5-year-old who was at the park in McDonough to watch his brother
Cordero play first base for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes as he spoke, Justin stuck the index finger of his
right hand in his mouth. Alternately, he would raise up both arms
and tug his ears up to look like Dr. Spock.
</P>
<P>
   Justin said he likes green beans, mashed potatoes and fried
chicken but does not choose what or when to eat. He said only kids
who are 10 years old can make those kinds of decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they have to be 25.
</P>
<P>
   Or 40.

   ``They're like punching you and stuff and they take them to jail
and put them in the electric chair,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooo! I know! I know!'' Charlie said. ``I'm serious!''
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like going to jail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later and 45 miles away, the youngsters on the White
Sox T-ball team of the McDonough Youth Association wrestled
uneasily with the questions and arrived at similarly vague
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Brett McDevitt, a 5-year-old who would rather have been on the
swing set, answered questions patiently in dusty cleats, a white
uniform with black pinstripes and an oversized black baseball cap
that said ``Sox'' just like the ones in the Major Leagues. When
asked to define political asylum, he volunteered a half-hearted
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaf?''
</P>
<P>
   His mom, Bonnie McDevitt, said Brett can make decisions about
what to order in a restaurant _ it's usually a toss-up between a
hot dog or chicken _ but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they act on impulse,'' she said of kids his age.
</P>
<P>
   Brett crossed his arms across his chest and narrowed his eyes
when asked a typical question _ Question 3 of Part D _ of Form
I-589, the Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal,
the very same form that Elian signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you, your spouse, your child(ren) or your parents ever
filed for, been processed for or been granted or denied refugee
status or asylum by any other country?''
</P>
<P>
   Brett didn't understand the question, but said an older kid
might.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Thomas Lavergne, a baseball player who was at George C.
Alexander Memorial Park on Tuesday evening and who, at 9, is a full
three years older than Elian. Did he know what the government was
asking in Question 3 of Part D?
</P>
<P>
   ``How my family is run?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas on political asylum:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of that word.''
</P>
<P>
   On the meaning of persecution:
</P>
<P>
   ``It just flew out of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   One 6-year-old at the park thought Cuba was ``a kind of musical
instrument.'' Another 6-year-old, Matthew Davis, thought the name
``Elian Gonzalez'' sounded familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's close to Speedy Gonzalez,'' he said, chomping bubble
gum before a game against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Most in children were eager to please when asked to spell
``asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I-C-L-M-E,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A-S-I-G-H-T-H-E-M,'' said Ben Hart, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rodden-Bayo, an 8-year-old whose mom came here from Cuba
when she was 2, came a little closer when he spelled ``asylum'' as
``A-S-C-L-I-M-E.'' He said he's heard the words ``political
asylum'' and ``persecution'' on television but does not know
exactly what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   He knows who Elian Gonzalez is, though, and he thinks the
government should let him stay because Cuba is a dangerous place
with an awful human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better in the United States than it is in Cuba,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His mom, Lourdes Bayo, said she thinks her son was ``mature
enough'' at age 6 ``to know where he wanted to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children might not understand'' legal terms like asylum or
persecution, she said, ``but they understand how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big issue here is that the media is making it seem
like children cannot make their own decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids do not make the decisions in Justin Ray's house. He's a shy
5-year-old who was at the park in McDonough to watch his brother
Cordero play first base for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes as he spoke, Justin stuck the index finger of his
right hand in his mouth. Alternately, he would raise up both arms
and tug his ears up to look like Dr. Spock.
</P>
<P>
   Justin said he likes green beans, mashed potatoes and fried
chicken but does not choose what or when to eat. He said only kids
who are 10 years old can make those kinds of decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they have to be 25.
</P>
<P>
   Or 40.

&HT;     ATLANTA FANS SHOW WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO THEM

<P>
   They finally got around to booing John Rocker in Atlanta the
other night.
</P>
<P>
   Not because Rocker's sentiments had just been translated from
Der Fuhrer's German to the King's English.
</P>
<P>
   Not because Atlanta Braves fans came down with a case of
collective conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Not because the citizens of Atlanta decided that _ upon sober or
merely semi-inebriated reflection _ they will not in any way
endorse a bigot and a boor and a bonehead.
</P>
<P>
   Not because the Braves' bullpen stopper is such a rock head that
the only way he can keep his foot out of his mouth is by refusing
to comment publicly on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, parents who expect sports to send society nothing but
wholesome messages. Sorry, kids. Sorry, minority groups. Sorry,
unwed mothers. Sorry, gays. Sorry, New Yorkers. Sorry, everybody
who doesn't consider wearing a white sheet over the head the
highest form of fashion. There is no feel-good ending in sight to
the Rocker saga.
</P>
<P>
   They finally got around to booing John Rocker in Atlanta the
other night for one reason and one reason only.
</P>
<P>
   Brought in to protect a ninth-inning lead, Rocker provided the
sort of relief that rat poison would give to an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker entered the game against the Philadelphia Phillies
with a 4-1 lead Friday night, a crowd of 40,174 gave him a standing
ovation. Rocker preened and he posed, basking in the adulation from
the same fans who gave him a standing ovation upon his return from
a two-week suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Then Scott Rolen hit a home run. Then the Phillies hit two
singles, followed by a one-out triple, followed by a two-out single
to put the visitors in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Rocker went from Atlanta hero to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Boo!!! Boo!!! Boo!!!
</P>
<P>
   Not because Rocker is a smug, contemptible, hateful excuse for a
human being. Not because Rocker is the one who made all the hateful
and insensitive remarks to a magazine reporter, yet blames
everybody but himself for the resulting fallout. Not because Rocker
smirkingly takes the cheers, autograph requests and signs of
support as proof that he is a man of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Booo!!! Boo!!! Boo!!!
</P>
<P>
   Because Rocker frittered away Braves starting pitcher Tom
Glavine's night of work. Because in less than an inning, Rocker's
earned run average shot from 0.96 to 4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever some rogue athlete returns after punishment _ usually
of the slap-on-a-wrist variety _ for some misdeed, people wonder
aloud about ``the message'' it sends. You want to know the message
that gets sent day after day, week after week, year after year? The
message is that, like it or not, double standards exist.
</P>
<P>
   Always have. Always will. The higher on the food chain that
somebody is, the less the chance of paying retail prices for
misdeeds. Star athletes, likewise, get consideration that lesser
lights don't. It's just that when a star athlete is involved, the
world insists on watching and weighing in on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the worries about the message sent when Robert Downey
Jr. squeezes movie gigs in between trips to prison and drug rehab?
Where is the concern about the message kids get when Sean ``Puff
Daddy'' Combs gets busted on gun-possession charges? Where are the
calls for action when Whitney Houston spaces out during a Grammy
Awards gig and gets pulled out of an Academy Awards performance
because of erratic behavior?
</P>
<P>
   But when Darryl Strawberry flunks a drug test, when Mark Chmura
gets arrested on charges of having sex with a teenager, when
Latrell Sprewell wraps his hands around a coach's throat, the
message being sent becomes a major concern. People get
sanctimonious about out-of-control athletes, right up to the moment
one of those public enemies joins their team.
</P>
<P>
   To most of the country, Sprewell is still the rebel without a
conscience who tried to choke his boss. To New York Knicks fans,
he's the beloved ``Spreeeeee'' who gives the team at least a hope
and a prayer of winning a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the public support that Rocker receives undoubtedly is a
backlash against the overreaction to his remarks. Rocker has
created more of a stir for being a blowhard than NFL players Rae
Curruth and Ray Lewis did for getting charged with murder. Just
because Rocker's words got blown out of proportion doesn't give him
some sort of moral high ground. His petulance, his inability to say
or do anything conciliatory, speak loudest of all.
</P>
<P>
   About the only smart thing Rocker has done since breaking out
his World Wrestling Federation act is to adopt a no-comment policy
on all matters. Otherwise, Braves management would live in mortal
fear of interviews like this:
</P>
<P>
   Blow-dried TV guy: ``So, John, what kind of pitch did he hit?''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker: ``I threw a !%!! fastball to that !!&AMP;!! guy, who looks
like a !!X%%! foreigner, if you ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   They booed John Rocker in his home park the other night, and it
was as unsatisfying as it was overdue. They booed him for the
emptiest of reasons, these same Atlanta Braves fans who stood and
cheered his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a happy ending, then the best hope is that
Rocker's karma comes back to him full-force, rendering his left arm
as lame as his brain.

LIBERAL ECONOMICS EXPERT IS APPOINTED RUSSIA'S PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday named as prime
minister a chief foreign-debt negotiator and a liberal economics
expert. The long predicted move, some experts said, bodes well for
efforts to tame Russia's feral style of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   That view was bolstered by a separate report Wednesday that
Putin might abolish the Fuel and Energy Ministry as he reorganizes
the cabinet. The immensely powerful agency has often been attacked
as a seat of corruption and a brake on capitalist reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, has been first
deputy prime minister, then the government's No. 2 post, since
Putin became acting president in January. He frequently stood in
for Putin as the acting president campaigned for the full four-year
term that he won in elections in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasyanov, 42, is best known as the pragmatic and savvy
negotiator who persuaded private Western creditors in February to
agree to a reduction of nearly $32 billion in Russian debt.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors, known as the London Club, agreed after months of
talks to accept bonds worth as little as 62.5 cents for every
dollar owed them. That now seems an exceptionally good deal for
Russia, which was _ and is _ reaping an unexpectedly large income
from a rebounding economy and exports of high-price oil.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Regling, who negotiated with Kasyanov as the German
Finance Ministry's chief international officer in the 1990s, called
him an extremely tough bargainer who won the respect not just of
the Germans, but also of the Americans in the Treasury Department,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he signed off on something, you knew it was really a done
deal,'' said Regling, now a finance expert in London. ``There are
always all these advisers around. But he didn't need that. You
could really do it with just two persons in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Kasyanov, a tall, beefy man with a gravely
voice and a crushing handshake, goes to the lower house of
Parliament, the Duma, which plans a vote next Wednesday. The
speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, predicted that Kasyanov
would be confirmed easily, even though the Communists have serious
questions about the Kremlin's economic bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Duma members are not allergic to Kasyanov,'' Seleznyov
said.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among Russian experts was that Kasyanov would
continue to have a strong hand in fiscal policy, pushing for a
streamlining of tax and regulatory codes.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Budget Committee in Parliament, Alexander
Zhukov, said in a radio interview the government was preparing
``drastic changes to some of the main taxes,'' including the income
and excise taxes and the payroll tax for welfare funds, which could
change the landscape of the budget and economy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the semi-official Interfax news service quoted a
government source as having said Putin is considering eliminating
several cabinet-level agencies, including the Economics and the
Fuel and Energy ministries. Their duties would be folded into the
Finance Ministry and other departments.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuel and Energy Ministry has been marked by liberals as a
test of Putin's willingness to confront entrenched interests.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the oil industry is in private hands, natural
gas remains more or less a government monopoly. And the ministry
wields enormous influence _ much of it for the benefit of special
interests, critics say _ through its control of pipelines and the
pricing of oil products.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the critics have demanded the ouster of Energy
Minister Victor Kalyuzhny, who they say has imposed new production
quotas and tariffs that insiders can easily manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov hedged when asked about a cabinet shake-up. ``It is
necessary to make some adjustments in the structure of the federal
organs of power,'' he said, adding that those changes ``will not be
global ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Some express doubts _ similar to those expressed about Putin _
as to whether Kasyanov is willing to free Russia's economy from the
grip of the financial-industrial combines which now dominate
several industries and their government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Russia's racier muckraking newspapers have dubbed
Kasyanov ``Misha Two Percent,'' charging that as Russia's finance
minister, he gave well-connected bankers inside information about
terms for the resale of old Soviet-era debts. Kasyanov has flatly
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like Putin, Kasyanov is also pegged by Moscow's rumor mill as
close to two tycoons, Boris A. Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, who
have amassed huge stakes in Russia's oil, metals and media
industries. Already this year, the two have cornered 70 percent of
Russia's aluminum industry with the blessing of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky and Abramovich both raised eyebrows by showing up at
invitation-only events surrounding Putin's inauguration on Sunday.
One of the best-known liberals of President Boris Yeltsin's regime,
Boris Nemtsov, warned this spring that Kasyanov's elevation to
prime minister would mean a continuation of the robber-baron
capitalism that helped ruin the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov also scoffs at that. ``I don't have any concrete ties
to any particular financial-industrial group. I maintain contacts
with everybody,'' he said at an April news conference. ``I meet
with Berezovsky very rarely - perhaps once every six months.''
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, Kasyanov is credited with supporting a one-third
increase in oil-export taxes and a requirement that oil companies
pay their taxes in cash rather than through barter _ two measures
opposed by the so-called oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   He rose the hard way. A graduate of the Moscow Automobile and
Road College, he worked at the old Soviet central planning
committee before switching, with the Russian government, to a
free-market economic philosophy after the Soviet Union died in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov spent two years at the economics ministry before
joining Yeltsin's finance ministry where he held several posts
before being finance minister. Under Putin, he kept that title and
added the post of first deputy prime minister, the job he held
until Wednesday's announcement.

&HT;     HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERS ATTACK PHONE TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders announced Wednesday they
will try to abolish the federal excise tax on telephone calls, a
move they said would allow more Americans access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the GOP leaders said at a news conference on Capitol
Hill that removing the tax would make dial-up Internet connections
less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, said that when the
House votes next week on the phone-tax issue, it will be taking
steps to ``permanently ban government access charges on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the current federal 3 percent tax on long-distance
phone calls and 2.7 percent tax on local calls, Armey said,
``That's the biggest problem we have for equal access to the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the federal phone taxes, which raise more than $5
billion a year for the U.S. treasury, unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, who
co-chairs the Congressional Internet Caucus, also said taxing phone
calls hinders Internet access. He added that such levies are among
the ``most unfair, regressive taxes.'' Like other sales taxes,
phone taxes require poor people to pay the same rate as wealthier
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the lower-income person, (the phone tax) is the most
unfair charge of all,'' Goodlatte said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey and Goodlatte spoke before the House voted Wednesday to
extend the ban on taxing sales over the Internet until 2006. The
current moratorium will expire in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Harvey, a spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., said he had proposed phasing out the telephone tax
in a recent speech but had no position on whether it should be
eliminated immediately.

&HT;     ADVANCE MAN FOR HEAVENLY MESSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CECILE S. HOLMES   
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ He's completely comfortable talking about the
metaphysical,
</P>
<P>
   but Robert J. ``Bob'' Danzig never expected to become an advance
man for
</P>
<P>
   those winged messengers people call angels.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig, 66, left his post running Hearst Newspapers two years
ago to
</P>
<P>
   become a motivational speaker and author. In his new book,
``Angel
</P>
<P>
   Threads'' (Frederick Fell Publishers Inc., $14.95), he recounts
stories
</P>
<P>
   from his life and others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The tales show how life journeys can be reshaped by ``angels.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean all of these angels are actual messengers from
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Many are angelic people, like the fellow hospital patient who
reached
</P>
<P>
   out to Danzig after he had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Life is like a tapestry, woven with diverse people, places and
</P>
<P>
   experiences, Danzig said May 3 during a talk for the Houston
Food Bank
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian Award Luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thread that you who are connected to this food bank share
is you
</P>
<P>
   share the power of the thread of inspiration,'' he said.
``Someone was a
</P>
<P>
   thread of inspiration in your tapestry, and you are to others.
You share
</P>
<P>
   that. You also share the power to excite.''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig avoided a formal address from the podium. Instead,he
shucked
</P>
<P>
   his jacket and spoke in his shirtsleeves and suspenders, walking
among
</P>
<P>
   the round tables in the Westin Galleria Hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   He joked, pausing once to admire a woman's hat. He poked fun at
himself,
</P>
<P>
   then turned serious, jabbing the air to make important points as
500
</P>
<P>
   people listened.
</P>
<P>
   He told how a social worker helped him believe in his own worth
when he
</P>
<P>
   was a youngster and how his first boss gave him confidence when
she told
</P>
<P>
   him, ``You are full of promise'' when he was a newspaper copy
boy.
</P>
<P>
   For Danzig, life's tapestry is enriched by multicolored-threads,
</P>
<P>
   especially influence from people ``with the qualities'' of
angels.He
</P>
<P>
   decided to write his current book after meeting people whotold
him of
</P>
<P>
   their encounters with angels and realizing keyinfluences in his
own
</P>
<P>
   life tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, one man's story describes a visible, 8-foot angel.
``With
</P>
<P>
   others, it (the concept of angels) is more a notion of what it
might be
</P>
<P>
   like to describe love,'' Danzig said.
</P>
<P>
   He understands the skepticism such ideas provoke. But he remains
</P>
<P>
   grateful for the angellike people who have crossed his path and
</P>
<P>
   influenced his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig began his work with Hearst as an office boy at the Albany
Times
</P>
<P>
   Union when he was only 16. Reared in five foster homes after his
parents
</P>
<P>
   divorced when he was 2, Danzig served in the U.S. Navy and then
attended
</P>
<P>
   college at night.
</P>
<P>
   His career with Hearst spanned 46 years. In 1969, he was named
publisher
</P>
<P>
   of Hearst's Albany, N.Y., Capital Newspapers. He became head of
the
</P>
<P>
   company's Newspaper Group in 1977, holding that position for
more than
</P>
<P>
   two decades.
</P>
<P>
   He became an industry leader, serving such groups as the
Newspaper
</P>
<P>
   Association of America and the American Press Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He left newspapers for public speaking and writing because he
wanted to
</P>
<P>
   share his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea if I could write a book, if I could become a
successful
</P>
<P>
   speaker, if I could connect with a university,'' he said in an
</P>
<P>
   interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each case, someone had crossed my path with some knowledge
of how to
</P>
<P>
   write a book, how to become a successful speaker, how to connect
with a
</P>
<P>
   university.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each case, all I did was accept the gift they offered me
and explore
</P>
<P>
   that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig now teaches the ``Confidence Course'' at New School
University in
</P>
<P>
   New York. He has written two other books, ``The Leader Within
You'' and
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitamins for the Spirit,'' and is planning a fourth book. With
his wife,
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Brady-Danzig, a lyric soprano, he set up a private
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig donates all speaking fees and book royalties to the
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great yearning among people for the softer values
of life,''
</P>
<P>
   he said. ``It has less to do with religiosity or religion than
it does
</P>
<P>
   with feeding or sharing one's spirit. There is a profound
spirituality
</P>
<P>
   out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a guy who's run a huge, multimillion-dollar corporation
come to
</P>
<P>
   talk to them has lubricated my audience,'' he said. ``That opens
doors. If
</P>
<P>
   I was an Episcopal priest, it might be different. When I'm done,
there
</P>
<P>
   are people lined up to hug me. They're not really hugging Bob
Danzig;
</P>
<P>
   they're hugging the idea of insights to nurture and nourish
their
</P>
<P>
   spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig's book is full of such insights, offering stories of
people who
</P>
<P>
   nurtured others or were befriended by other nurturing souls.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig firmly believes people can learn from ``angels,'' whether
they
</P>
<P>
   understand those messengers as actual winged envoys from heaven,
or more
</P>
<P>
   as people or experience that helped open new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things that open the possibility of love, relationship
and
</P>
<P>
   sharing are so often triggered by some event we didn't plan,''
Danzig
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences might be called coincidences, but Danzig says
they are
</P>
<P>
   permeated with a ``spirit force'' more significant than
happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences teach us that ``we are not alone,'' Danzig
said. ``There
</P>
<P>
   are either persons, events or circumstances that surround and
guide our
</P>
<P>
   lives. All of them have some spirit component.''
</P>
<P>
   But has he ever seen a real angel?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in terms of the physical,'' Danzig said in an
interview
</P>
<P>
   after his Houston speech. ``I think in terms of the spiritual.
Every
</P>
<P>
   person I've talked about here is angellike.''

HOPING TO ATTRACT FOREIGN MONEY, SOUTH AFRICA CRACKS DOWN ON
INSIDER TRADING

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ For years, the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange was nearly as notorious among international financiers as
the country itself was among human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from the world, apartheid-era South Africa learned to
play by its own rules, its financial markets evolving into an
insular, incestuous morass where insider trading was a key part of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a decade after the country began a political
transformation, South Africa's market has found that it, too, must
change. Backed by a new law, regulators have taken aim at insider
traders.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year under the new law, the market has won six
settlements totaling almost 2.2 million rand ($320,000), and more
important, they say, they have sounded a new opening bell here in
the financial capital of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be scared,'' said Peter Redman, a former
broker and stock exchange chairman who is now a senior surveillance
official for the exchange, ``so that they just don't do this sort
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators are, by their own admission, a long way from that
point, but they are pressing ahead, knowing that much is at stake.
Indeed, for South Africa's financial sector and the stock exchange
in particular, few matters are more pressing. The country is slowly
rebuilding its economy, and it craves the foreign investment a
thriving stock exchange could bring. Emerging markets like South
Africa, Brazil and South Korea are hot, and as a barrier to
investment, national borders are fast becoming obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   What remains an obstacle here and in many other emerging
markets, though, is the fear of being bamboozled. Foreign investors
want to know that they are trading on a level playing field, that
they have access to the same company information that local
investors do.
</P>
<P>
   It is a concern that South Africa's chief insider trading
enforcer, Rob Barrow, has heard all too often from people with
money to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them have made it very clear to me that they resist
coming into the South African market, sometimes with substantial
money, or money that would be substantial to us and our economy
because they've been here before and believe they've been taken to
the cleaners,'' said Barrow, chairman of the country's newly formed
Insider Trading Directorate. ``That, of course, is the perception
we are trying to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johannesburg Stock Exchange's trading volume increased
nearly ninefold, from 5.2 billion shares at the end of 1995, to
43.1 billion at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Insider trading _ trading on nonpublic information that could
affect a stock's price _ was never much of a secret here. And for
decades, under the Companies Act, it was a criminal offense. But it
was impossible to prosecute. The charges were hard to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt, and prosecutors were frequently ill equipped to
handle such complicated cases. So the accusations hardly ever saw
the inside of a courtroom. Not once, in fact, did South Africa ever
win an insider trading conviction under the old law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Insider Trading Act enacted last year, however,
insider trading not only became a criminal offense but a civil one,
too. In a civil proceeding, the standard of proof is not as high,
and that has opened a new door for the authorities here.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the authorities say, they hope to send someone to
prison for insider trading. But after years of seeing no results,
at least they have, in the civil settlements won so far, something
to show for their work.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest settlement, won late last year, Ron Sackstein,
chief executive of I-Fusion Holdings, a local information
technology company, paid just over a million rand, or about
$160,000, to settle insider trading accusations against him.
</P>
<P>
   While most agree that the civil actions are a measure of
progress, sentiment is split on whether settlements are enough to
discourage dishonest traders. In some cases, the terms have allowed
those accused to remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't really just be a civil action,'' said Ian
McMillan, chief investment officer for Fleming Asset Management in
Cape Town. ``It should be more serious. If your penalty is just a
monetary one, the incentive is there to try it because maybe you
can make more than they'll take.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pott, the southern Africa representative for the
International Finance Corp., a unit of the World Bank, said he,
too, would like to see an even more aggressive approach by
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question in investors' minds still is are the
deterrents of a sufficient magnitude,'' said Pott, who said his
agency had about $100 million in investments here. ``I guess that
is our concern, and we would hope that they would go one step
further toward how the SEC deals with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa, swamped by every sort of crime and struggling
to remake its apartheid-era system of law enforcement, has nothing
like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's army of
investigators and prosecutors with the skills and resources to turn
complicated, painstaking investigations into coherent, viable
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   So as South Africans see it, they are doing the next best thing,
said Nicky Newton-King, the stock exchange's legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the world, what is happening with white-collar crime is
people are moving to civil remedies because very few courts and
prosecutors have the technical skills to actually get behind this
sort of contravention,'' she said. ``If what you can do is take the
profit out of the crime for the guys that are doing it and you can
stop and make them think, then I think you've been successful.''

</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even giving potential insider traders pause is seen as a
step forward in South Africa, where history helped instill insider
trading into the ethos of a business establishment dominated by the
white minority. Dodging trade sanctions demanded a certain
creativity. Forged certificates of origin for products made here
were commonplace, and in one form or another, that sort of scheming
took hold in quite a few corners of the business sector. There was
``a culture of insider trading,'' Redman said.
</P>
<P>
   And the structure of corporate ownership and management that
evolved, mostly out of necessity, during the era of sanctions only
encouraged the sort of misbehavior the country is now trying to
stamp out. With little foreign investment and ownership, the
biggest South African businesses became nests of complex cross
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a concentration of power,'' said Bill Urmson, the
stock exchange's director of surveillance. ``And an awful lot of
information was flowing into those very few citadels of power,
which made the opportunity for insider trading more severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, securities regulators and market administrators are trying
to teach companies how to conduct themselves in this new, open
environment. Guidelines about who disseminates information, who
gets information and when are more common.
</P>
<P>
   It is a work in progress, to be sure. In March, in the latest
move toward a more transparent corporate culture, the stock
exchange announced plans to require directors to disclose dealings
in their companies' shares promptly. Such requirements are standard
in the world's biggest markets, and adopting them here would be
another step toward bringing the stock exchange in line with its
more reputable counterparts in New York, London and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are not only in South Africa. International
investors, enchanted by the promise of emerging markets, have
pressed for change from South America to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization of markets demands globalization of
regulation,'' said Miroslaw Kachniewski, a Polish securities
regulator who heads an international committee examining
enforcement in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, part of the International Organization of
Securities Commissions, is scheduled to present a report at that
organization's annual meeting, which starts this weekend in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Putting all the world's securities regulators on the same page,
as far as what constitutes insider trading and what the appropriate
response is, is the ultimate objective of Kachniewski and his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of regulators are aware,'' he said in a
phone interview from Warsaw. ``However, there are some
jurisdictions where insider trading is not a criminal offense, and
I hope our research will help give regulators the information they
need to convince their governments that changes are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, South Africa is not that far behind compared with
efforts in developing nations. ``I think among emerging markets,
and certainly in Africa, they are ahead of the pack,'' Pott said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barrow, the insider-trading enforcer, knows he will be
judged, not on his success in winning legal battles but on the
market's success in winning over wary investors. ``You can only
judge the success on the perception of the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange, that the JSE is a market with sufficient integrity that
anyone can trade on it,'' he said. ``I think we are well on our way
to getting there.''

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Officials investigating a malicious
program that disrupted computer systems around the world said
Wednesday that they were looking for a young computer student who
recently wrote a thesis proposal with elements that were similar to
a virus that has disabled e-mail systems around the world in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who appears to have gone into hiding, is Onel de
Guzman, 23, who lived in the same apartment in Manila as a man and
woman who were first named on Monday as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   When de Guzman presented his proposal in February, a thesis
reviewer at his computer college noted on it: ``This is illegal''
and ``We do not produce burglars.''
</P>
<P>
   The program released last week, a hybrid of varieties known as
viruses and worms, ricocheted around the world as an attachment to
e-mail messages with the subject line ``I Love You.'' Opening the
attachment activated the program, which then sent itself along to
addresses found in the victim's e-mail software. In addition, the
program tried to fetch additional software from a Philippine Web
site that could pilfer passwords from the user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the college, AMA Computer College, said a second
student, Michael Buen, had written a software program that might
have been combined with de Guzman's work to create the virus. The
officials said he, too, had gone into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thesis proposal, though not illegal per se, could be used
as part of the structure of the current virus,'' said Luis
Pagulayan, the college's general counsel.He said subpoenas were
being issued by the National Bureau of Investigation for both
students, although investigators have not formally named them as
suspects. The bureau is continuing to investigate the couple,
Reomel Ramones and Irene de Guzman, whose apartment was raided on
Monday. Irene de Guzman is Onel de Guzman's older sister.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones and Irene de Guzman were initially named as suspects
when investigators traced the virus to a computer in their
apartment, but when authorities raided the apartment on Monday the
computer had been removed. Ramones was detained, but Irene de
Guzman disappeared after promising to surrender to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Secretary Artemio Tuquero said Wednesday that Ramones,
who was held overnight Monday at the National Bureau of
Investigation and who will face charges on May 19, may have been a
``fall guy'' but that it was too soon to drop charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Abad, executive vice president of the college, said of
Onel de Guzman: ``We are not saying he is a suspect. If ever we
found something about the thesis, it could only be a circumstantial
lead. We do not know whether he did develop this as a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was his impression that if the two students were
involved in creating the virus their intention was to steal and use
passwords, not to spread destruction through the world's computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news reports, both students were members of
an underground campus group called GRAMMERSoft, which did
programming work for hire and also wrote and sold thesis projects
to other students. But college officials said they could not
confirm that the two were members.
</P>
<P>
   Abad said he had asked teachers what they recalled about Onel de
Guzman. ``He's the quiet type,'' Abad said. ``He's an average
student, although in some subjects he is getting very high grades.
In our grading system, 1 is the highest and 5 is failing. In one
subject, in Assembly Language, he got a 1. It's a pretty hard
subject, and he got a flat 1 on it. And on other computer subjects
he got a 1.5, a 1.25.''
</P>
<P>
   Buen's and Onel de Guzman's names surfaced over the weekend when
computer security researchers in the United States and Sweden found
that one component of the rogue program closely resembled
password-stealing programs discovered in recent months by U.S.
anti-virus researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier programs contained both a list of names and
references to the Philippine computer college and the GRAMMERsoft
group. Buen's name appeared in a brief resume, and de Guzman was on
an extended list of names inserted in the program, perhaps as
references.
</P>
<P>
   Pagulayan, the college's general counsel, said the two were
among 10 possible suspects on a list given to Philippine
investigators by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   He said the name of Onel de Guzman immediately rang a bell at
the school because, although many thesis proposals are rejected,
his was turned down because ``it was contrary to law, dealing with
hacking, dealing with a virus. That is not something that happens
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Abad said Buen's thesis, which was accepted and which led to his
graduation from the school last Friday, contained information that
could be used to create multiple copies of computer files.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you merge both programs you can come up with this virus,''
said Karim Bangcola, senior vice president of the college.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Onel de Guzman's proposal, which was titled ``E-mail Password
Sender Trojan,'' was never developed into a full-fledged thesis,
and he did not graduate as scheduled last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, which was obtained by The Associated Press, he
wrote that his software ``will be helpful to a lot of people,
especially Internet users, to get Windows passwords such as
Internet accounts to spend more time on the Internet without
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote: ``We spend a lot of money to pay for accounts for
only using a couple of hours. So this program is the main solution.
Use it to steal and retrieve Internet accounts of the victim's
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the thesis proposal was rejected, Abad said: ``It
carried a feature that could enable the software to steal
passwords. And there's a recipient and it will steal the
recipient's password and all the other names in the recipient's
address book.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, all the names in that address book will be
sent new e-mails automatically, and exponentially again you will
get the e-mails and Internet accounts of these people,'' he said.
``We saw that to be very illegal and very immoral, and so we
disapproved the thesis proposal. It never got developed within
AMA.''

VIRUS CAUSED MORE DAMAGE THAN PAST COMPUTER VANDALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A computer security expert told a U.S.
congressional panel in Washington on Wednesday that the ``I Love
You'' program had caused far more widespread damage than similar
episodes in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Peter S. Tippett of ICSA.net in Reston, Va., said a
preliminary survey by his company indicates 98 percent of
businesses in North America received the email, and 65 percent had
computers infected by the attached virus. In contrast, he said, a
program known as Melissa that spread in similar fashion last year
reached only 20 percent of the companies in North America and 10
percent were infected.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, Tippett estimated, the ``I Love You'' program caused
$3 billion in damages and lost time. Lloyd's of London has
estimated it will ultimately cost more than $15 billion.

WAR IS BETTER THAN SIERRA LEONE'S PEACE

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ Sometimes it is better to wage war than to
agree to an unstable and unworkable peace, a proposition that the
current crisis in Sierra Leone bears out.
</P>
<P>
   A peace agreement signed in July 1999 was supposed to help
rebuild Sierra Leone by installing a coalition government, composed
of the current president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and Foday Sankoh, the
ruthless leader of the main rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Sankoh became a vice president and
commissioner of diamond resources, the country's main source of
income. Three of his lieutenants became ministers of government.
All were offered a blanket amnesty for past crimes. In exchange,
U.N. peacekeepers were to take the weapons of all combatants.
Instead, the rebels have captured and disarmed 500 peacekeepers,
and the country is in chaos once again.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement failed for several related reasons. It mistakenly
assumed that the rebels were interested in peace, let alone had an
interest in real governing. It assumed that there was a civil war,
and treated Sankoh as a legitimate champion of the rural poor,
whose interests he claimed to represent. In reality, Sankoh was
interested only in taking advantage of a corrupt state that had
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   So, from the rebels' point of view, why have peace when it is
the absence of law and order that enables one to loot? Why let
peacekeeping troops enter the country's diamond mining area if one
is profiting from the sale of these riches on the black market?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rebels never had any intention of honoring the
peace accord; they were only interested in waging war and looting
the country. The United Nations, so reflexively attached to the
mantra of peace at any price, sent peacekeeping troops when there
was no peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and the State Department, which helped
negotiate the peace accord, should have known better. As recently
as March 1999, the U.N. Security Council threatened to prosecute
Sankoh for war crimes. Earlier, a State Department report on Sierra
Leone noted the discovery of civilian mass graves in areas where
the rebels had attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the United Nations and the United States agree to a
power-sharing agreement with Sankoh, whose forces have killed,
raped and maimed tens of thousands of men, women and even children?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is quite simple and found in President Clinton's
statement during his April 1999 visit to Rwanda, when he lamented
the lack of U.S. action to stop the genocide there. After this
speech, the Clinton administration wanted to show that it cared
about human rights in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord was quick and cheap, but doomed. Let us hope
that the West now recognizes this _ and doesn't opt for a second
try at an accord. In the last few days Olusegun Obasanjo, the
Nigerian president, has agreed to send his country's soldiers back
to Sierra Leone, provided the West pays their costs. Not only
should these soldiers be better equipped and trained, they and
Kabbah's forces must also have the ability to fight back _ in
effect, waging war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best solution _ because unlike the West, Nigeria has
national interests at stake. Trouble anywhere in West Africa is a
threat to its stability. And Nigeria might recognize what the West
hasn't _ that peace in the region can only be won through war.

CORPORATE GREED FUELS TRADE DEAL

 By JAMES P. HOFFA    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are being bombarded in an expensive and
sophisticated public relations campaign intended to convince them
that giving China permanent normal trade status is essential to our
long-term economic prospects. But permanent normal trade status for
China has little to do with helping American workers and everything
to do with the quest for profits by corporations that know no flag.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a decade of economic expansion, real wages for
blue-collar Americans are down, pensions are being cut and jobs are
being lost in the name of so-called free trade. Since the North
American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1993, for example,
hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   American workers should not be asked to compete with foreigners
who are not paid a living wage or who work in inhumane conditions.
That is why the Teamsters and other unions have joined human rights
activists, environmentalists, and religious and consumer groups
that vigorously oppose giving China the trading privileges it has
not yet earned.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support granting permanent normal trade status argue
that while China is not perfect, the only way to change it is to
welcome it fully into the world economic community. This means
admitting China to the World Trade Organization and ending the
yearly review that allows Congress to hold the country accountable
for its abysmal human rights and labor record.
</P>
<P>
   Today in China, political opponents are imprisoned without trial
and religious groups are persecuted. Similarly, many Chinese who
fight for basic civil rights or for a voice in the workplace are
jailed. This means that many of the products made in China and sold
in America are essentially produced by people who have no say in
their working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since 1992 China has not complied with the terms of
bilateral agreements with the United States on issues like prison
labor and intellectual property rights. Why should we trust them
now?
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the upgraded trade status will try to tar my union
and other opponents as backward-thinking, self-interested
protectionists. But the Teamsters are pro-trade. We recognize that
the jobs of thousands of our members are based on expanded trade.
But we also know that thousands of our members, have lost jobs
because of it, and the earnings of many more have been depressed
because of competition based on paying the lowest wage to workers
who have no say in their conditions and pay.
</P>
<P>
   There are also those in Congress who think we can grant China
permanent normal trade status and still address rights abuses
through a joint congressional-presidential commission. But what
good will the findings of such a commission do without the power to
act on them? Toothless proposals will do nothing to end China's
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States replaces the annual review of China's
record with permanent normal trade status, it will squander its
leverage for promoting basic freedoms in China. We must reject this
trade policy, built for and by multinational corporations, in favor
of one resting on democratic values and the promise of raising
living standards for all.
</P>

Teamsters.)

IN CHINA, A YOUNG WOMAN'S RISQUE NOVEL ELICITS STRONG REACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Zhou Weihui, dressed in a traditional black
silk Chinese dress slit to mid-thigh, had gathered her friends and
acquaintances on a veranda overlooking this city's famous 1930s-era
waterfront, ostensibly to say goodbye to society for a while. She
wanted to drop out of sight, she said, because she was under too
much pressure from China's propaganda machine, which was busy
trashing her best-selling novel, ``Shanghai Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Zhou's publisher had destroyed the page proofs and all
of the books in stock, arguing _ after having sold at least 80,000
copies _ that the novel was in poor taste and that Zhou, 27, was
too outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Beijing's Press and Publication Bureau raided a book
fair in the capital and confiscated dozens of copies. And tens of
thousands more copies are being destroyed around the country while
the state media denounce Zhou as ``decadent, debauched and a slave
of foreign culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Baby'' tells the story of Coco, a 25-year-old
waitress who falls in love with a tall and handsome but impotent
and drug-addicted man named Tian Tian. She moves in with him, and
later begins an affair with a married German. ``One is for love,
the other is for lust,'' Zhou explained on the Shanghai veranda, a
cigarette fixed between her silver-nailed fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of young
Chinese have bought the book, making Weihui, as she prefers to be
called, a national phenomenon. She is the country's most popular
writer since Wang Shuo, whose late-1980s writings about Beijing's
disaffected youth became so popular that the books are now
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Few other contemporary Chinese writers come close. ``Shanghai
Baby'' has gone through six printings since it was first published
last September and several pirated editions are circulating around
China. A newspaper in Guangzhou even serialized the book, but
published only half before it was forced to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right to hold some book signings and other
promotional activities, but things should be done to a moderate and
proper degree,'' said An Boshun, Zhou's editor at Chunfeng
Literature and Art Publishing House, in a state-run newspaper last
week. In other words, Weihui has become too popular _ a strange
thing for a publisher to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   An, who has published a series of novels by the country's ``new,
new generation'' of writers, was slightly more forthcoming in a
phone call. ``It's an ideological matter,'' he said, declining to
discuss the matter further.
</P>
<P>
   Weihui's writing, and that of a handful of similar women of her
generation, has set off a debate about what is literature in a
country with a literary tradition stretching back thousands of
years and where belles-lettres have often been considered
politically suspect. Destroying books that challenge the state's
worldview occurred as early as 213 B.C., when Emperor Qin Shi
Huangdi burned all the books in the realm in an attempt to unify
people's thought. China's current government has periodically
resorted to similar, if less thorough, acts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a People's Daily editorial reminded readers that
literature ``is a temple of holiness,'' and said that ``these
pretty women writers, who have split from the solid foundation of
Chinese creative writing and the rich historic and cultural
background of Chinese literature, who know a smattering of
Marguerite Duras and Henry Miller and dare jump onto the stage to
do a striptease, will eventually feel ashamed of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The book touches on many social issues long taboo in Chinese
literature, with graphic, if sensitive, descriptions of sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strip to my bra and panties in the humid, night breeze from
the Huangpu River. I hope this scene will stimulate Tian Tian. I
continue, like a stripper. `Have a try. Come to me, like a real
lover, honey. Give it a try'.''
</P>
<P>
   Coco's impotent lover eventually dies of a heroin overdose and
her German lover returns to his homeland, leaving her bereft in a
city of vanity and desire.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The book is one of the first in China to portray Weihui's
generation of urban women, born in the 1970s, as they search for
moral grounding in a country of shifting values. In many ways, her
age group's dislocation from China's traditional culture is
reminiscent of the generation gap that characterized the West in
the 1960s _ an era that Weihui evokes with references in her book
to Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and others.
</P>
<P>
   Weihui sees herself as a feminist helping her generation of
women understand themselves. ``This is the first book to tell young
modern girls how to face sex,'' Weihui says. ``I just write the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth has always been difficult for China's cultural
mandarins to handle. Nearly two decades ago, China banned the
writings of another woman, Dai Houying, whose novel ``People, Oh
People!'' was among the first books to explore people's emotions
during the Cultural Revolution. Dai's writings, which are now back
in print, were deemed too frank at the time.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If indeed Weihui was going into seclusion, she was doing it with
as much fanfare as she could muster. She fox-trotted on the veranda
with a spiky-haired woman in a sleeveless blue top as a film crew
and several photographers gyrated around her, recording the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The party felt staged _ the guests were an odd mix of ages and
backgrounds, including the young man who applied her makeup. A tray
of sliced French bread was drying out on a table next to a platter
of coarse cakes covered with whipped nondairy cream. Waitresses in
red skirts, white shirts and limp bow ties served tepid beer, Coke
and red wine. The Lennon Sisters warbled from floor speakers, ``One
day a little girl, the next day a lady,'' in an off-target attempt
to create an atmosphere befitting Weihui's dress and the prewar
bank buildings behind her.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the film crew was working on a documentary that,
combined with a dramatization of Weihui's works, will be sold on
video disk together with her next book, ``Evil Pearl,'' a tragic
story about a woman of Shanghai's demimonde. ``It's about how
desire leads to destruction,'' Weihui said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weihui is the daughter of an army officer and spent three years
of her childhood living in an army-occupied temple from which the
monks had been expelled during the chaotic Cultural Revolution. She
studied literature at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University and
has written four previous books: ``The Shriek of the Butterfly,''
``Virgin in the Water,'' ``Crazy Like Weihui'' and ``Desire
Pistol.'' She hopes to publish ``Shanghai Baby'' in Taiwan, Japan
and France.
</P>
<P>
   Off-camera, she exudes an impersonal affability. ``I think I'm
an elegant person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, she headed home to her mother,
clutching a red silk handbag and a small black cell phone that rang
steadily at 15-minute intervals. Despite her bold stance, the
mounting criticism was taking its toll, touching, perhaps, the
filial emotions of a more tradition-bound woman deep inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't know who is right,'' she said. ``Maybe I am
wrong.''

DEMOCRATS BACK MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats rallied Wednesday around a
bill that would offer prescription drug benefits as a standard part
of the Medicare program, in contrast to the approach favored by
Republicans, who want to subsidize private insurance to help pay
such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen House and Senate Democrats joined in a display of
unity at the White House, where they said they had agreed on a
proposal to offer coverage of prescription drugs to all Medicare
beneficiaries _ 39 million people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal is similar to a plan offered by
President Clinton, but it is somewhat more generous to
beneficiaries and somewhat more expensive to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and members of Congress appeared in the White House Rose
Garden with Betty Dizik, a 73-year-old widow who said she skips
prescribed medications for diabetes and a heart condition because
she cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking for a handout or charity,'' Dizik said. ``I'm
willing to work and do my part. I'm just asking for a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal is embodied in a bill introduced
Wednesday by the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, with 32 of the 45 Democratic senators as co-sponsors. The
House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said he would
soon introduce a bill nearly identical to the Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
   In a Congress controlled by Republicans, the Democrats have no
chance of seeing their bills enacted. But they hope that by taking
a unified position, they can put pressure on the Republicans to
enter negotiations leading to the enactment of Medicare drug
benefits this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Vice President Al Gore and many
congressional Democrats have denounced the Republicans as slow to
act on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the president sounded more cooperative today. ``We all know
we can't achieve our efforts without bipartisan support in the
Congress,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``That's why, just as we are
trying to do with the patient's bill of rights, we want to reach
across the aisle to encourage Republican support, as well. This can
and should be a truly bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Democrats, like Clinton, say Medicare should
cover half of a person's drug expenses up to certain limits _ half
of the first $2,000 in drug expenses starting in 2002. The ceiling
would rise gradually. By 2009, Medicare would cover half of the
first $5,000 in drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some drugs cost much more than $5,000 a year. The congressional
Democrats would provide assistance for people with very high
expenses; Medicare would pick up all of their drug costs after they
spend $3,000 or $4,000 of their own money.
</P>

   Daschle said his bill ``dedicates $50 billion'' to insurance
covering such catastrophic expenses from 2003 to 2010. By contrast,
the president requested $35 billion for the years from 2006 to
2010.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the congressional Democrats would provide protection
against catastrophic drug costs for three more years, at an
additional cost of $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are developing their own proposals. The chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, William Roth, R-Del., is drafting
legislation but has not given any hint of the details. House
Republicans are fleshing out their proposal, under which the
government would subsidize private insurance to help pay drug costs
for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the administration are both scrutinizing drug
prices. Federal officials said they were investigating several drug
companies to see if they had overcharged Medicaid, Medicare or
other government programs by overstating their wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   The American unit of Bayer A.G., the German drug company, said
it had begun talks with the Justice Department in the hope of
reaching a settlement over drug prices that would avoid costly
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of concern about drug costs, Sen. James
Jeffords, R-Vt., introduced a bill that would make it easier for
Americans to import medications from Canada, where drug prices are
often much lower.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jeffords' bill, Americans could import a limited amount of
prescription drugs, perhaps a three-month supply, for personal use.
In addition, pharmacists and wholesalers could import certain
prescription drugs and pass the discounts on to American consumers.
Co-sponsors of the bill include Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan
Collins, both Republicans from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry opposes the bill, saying it could expose
Americans to adulterated or counterfeit drugs. But the bill
instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to regulate
imports to ensure that drugs are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and congressional Republicans generally say that
Medicare drug benefits should be enacted as part of a more
comprehensive effort to revamp Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator,
Wednesday commended the sponsors of one of the more ambitious
bipartisan proposals to redesign Medicare, Sens. John B. Breaux,
D-La., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn. Jennings said the latest efforts by
the senators were ``quite encouraging.''

was under too much pressure from China's formidable propaganda
machine, which was busy trashing her best-selling novel, ``Shanghai
Baby.'' Already, her publisher had destroyed the page proofs and
all of the books in stock, arguing _ after having sold at least

   AFRICA-U.S. (Washington) _ President Clinton, in the face of

that the U.S. government will not seek to interfere with countries
in that region that may violate U.S. patent law in order to provide
AIDS drugs at lower prices. The language of the executive order is
nearly identical to an amendment that was deleted at the behest of

U.N. RECEIVES GOVERNMENT REPORT ON TORTURE IN THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GENEVA _ In its first report on its compliance with the U.N.
Convention Against Torture, the United States Wednesday defended
its efforts to eliminate any such practices, including police
brutality and inmate abuse, which human rights advocates maintain
are regular occurrences in America.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, like the 117 other countries that have signed
the 1984 convention, is obliged to detail to the body's review
committee every four years incidents of torture and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment of its citizens and to describe the
steps taken to stamp out such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States ratified the convention in 1994, this
was its first report to the U.N. committee monitoring compliance.
Still, Harold H. Koh, the assistant secretary of state for human
rights, told the committee that the 74-page report ``makes clear
our unequivocal and unambiguous condemnation of torture as a tool
of governmental policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups disagreed. On Tuesday, Amnesty International
filed its own 45-page report with the torture committee that
described specific cases that it said violated the international
pact.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Amnesty officials said they had documented
``numerous instances of the torture or ill treatment of men, women
and children by U.S. police or custody officials as well as cruel,
inhuman and degrading prison conditions,'' and mistreatment
``disproportionately directed at racial and ethnic minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents are ``fast becoming institutionalized across the
country,'' said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty's
U.S. branch.
</P>
<P>
   Koh conceded Wednesday that there are ``continuing areas of
concern within the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our commitment is unambiguous, our record is not
perfect,'' he told the committee. ``Torture does not occur in the
United States, except in aberational situations and never as a
matter of government policy. When it does occur, it constitutes a
serious criminal offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. report acknowledges that there have been instances,
``and in some cases even patterns or practices of'' police abuse,
brutality and unnecessary or excessive use of force, that included
tear gas, pepper spray, stun guns, stun belts, police dogs,
handcuffs and leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
   The report also listed racial bias and sexual abuse of prisoners
by guards and other prisoners as problem areas, along with lack of
police accountability, overcrowded prisons and confinement of
children in substandard or abusive correctional facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Frank admissions of possible treaty violations before the U.N.
committee are unusual, but this did not spare the U.S. officials
from extensive questioning. The committee's chairman, Peter Thomas
Burns, a Canadian law professor, labeled the reported use of stun
guns and belts by federal marshals ``quite alarming.'' This was
particularly true, he said, because they can be set off
accidentally and administer a substantial voltage and serious pain.
</P>
<P>
   Koh insisted that no legal cases had been brought to
substantiate any charges of deaths or serious injuries to prisoners
as a result of stun belt use. The belts are used only in
transporting dangerous prisoners, he said. Misuse of stun guns by
local police departments can be challenged in court, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, he also rejected committee
criticism that U.S. insistence on applying its own definitions of
torture rather than those specified in the international treaty
created loopholes in its enforcement. ``There is no act that
constitutes torture that cannot be or is not prosecuted under
federal or state law,'' argued Koh, himself a former law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. record on fighting torture ``ranks near the very top,''
he said. ``Other countries ratify treaties but they don't obey
them. We obey these treaties.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee will make formal criticisms and recommendations on
the U.S. report next week. Last week, the experts reviewed China's
record, and urged it to step up efforts to eliminate torture.

SAVING ZEUGMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zeugma should be saved. The site of two ancient cities is about
to be drowned. A dam across the Euphrates river will create an
artificial lake to meet the demand for hydroelectric power for
southeastern Turkey. But the dammed waters will flood much of
Zeugma in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a do-or-die version of television's ``Antiques Roadshow,''
archeologists are scrambling to save as many artifacts as they can,
including still-vibrant mosaics from the second or third century.
Of course, instead of hunting in grandma's attic, these
archeologists are hunting in civilization's basement for pieces of
human identity.
</P>
<P>
   The area was a prime place to cross the Euphrates. Through time
Assyrians, Romans, and Greeks lived there. Later, Arabs, Turks,
Crusaders, and Kurds fought over the area. In the Middle Ages,
Zeugma was forgotten as the main crossing over the Euphrates moved
downstream.
</P>
<P>
   One might wish for a Poseidon or Zeus to protect the site or a
Moses to hold back the water. A less epic but simpler approach is
available to the Turkish government: Delay the dam project for a
few months so archeologists can complete more of their rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Zeugma _ whatever its fate _ should become a vivid cautionary
tale for the preservation community. That the site existed and the
dam was coming were known facts. Researchers attracted funds and
other support from the French and Turkish governments as well as
from private companies to excavate and map the area, but that
wasn't enough to beat the racing clock of progress.
</P>
<P>
   What happens the next time a site is threatened? One wise step
would be to build larger coalitions of interest. In addition to
government and industry, more museums and universities could be
pulled in to keep track both of significant sites and potential
threats posed by development projects.
</P>
<P>
   Time steals a great deal, turning cities to rubble, paper to
dust, and people _ if they're lucky _ into memories. This rush of
years cannot be stopped. But at Zeugma the rush of water could be.

BLUNDER IN WEST AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In peacekeeping as in war, the faster a blunder is acknowledged,
the sooner it may be corrected. That is the harsh moral of the
civil war that has revived this month in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The attention of the outside world has been drawn to the plight
of United Nations peacekeepers who were sent to the West African
nation to supervise a peace agreement that existed only on paper.
This week, 498 of the poorly trained and lightly armed
blue-helmeted UN troops were taken hostage by the forces of local
warlord Foday Sankoh, a glorified diamond thief who muscled his way
into a power-sharing peace treaty last July.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's fighters became infamous for their practice of hacking
off the hands and arms of citizens who defied the warlord by voting
for Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. Despite such
sadistic methods, Sankoh persuaded Washington, London, and the rest
of the outside world to grant him eight ministers in a coalition
government and a complete pardon for all his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The great powers behind the illusory peace treaty of last July
blundered in trusting Sankoh to keep his promises after a West
African armed force that had been keeping the peace withdrew from
Sierra Leone this month. Equally foolish was their unfounded
assumption that a few thousand UN peacekeepers might be able to
protect themselves, much less the preyed-upon population of Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no stomach for a full-scale intervention by any
of the permanent members of the Security Council, the next best
thing is for the rich and powerful nations _ those that wish to
make good their blunders _ to subsidize the return of a bigger and
better armed version of the West African forces that had kept the
peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial error, not to be repeated this time, was the naive
belief that a criminal like Sankoh could be placated in a
power-sharing government. The blue helmets of the UN can help only
if there is a peace to keep. Where there is no peace, well-meaning
outsiders must choose a side to take or stay out of a civil war
like Sierra Leone's.

FACIAL MUSCLES REVEAL LYING; HONEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you tell when someone's lying? Don't listen to the words.
Watch the face.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are reporting that people who have suffered brain
damage that wipes out their ability to decipher speech are much
sharper than almost everybody else at spotting lies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that most people are very good lie detectors. In fact, study
after study has shown that the vast majority are no better than a
coin-toss at discriminating truth from falsehood _ and that
includes policemen, psychiatrists, judges, and customs inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast, stroke victims who suffer from a disorder
called receptive aphasia _ the inability to comprehend speech _ can
detect nearly three lies out of every four.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that, at least for some kinds of lies, words
apparently get in the way of other telling clues to deception. When
the brain's left-hemisphere speech comprehension area is damaged,
that removes the distraction of words. The researchers believe that
other parts of the brain gradually sharpen, especially
right-hemisphere areas attuned to tiny, fleeting facial expressions
that betray true feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are negative emotions that are coming through _ social
smiles interspersed with tiny moments of fear, sadness, or disgust
that leak through,'' said Nancy L. Etcoff, a Massachusetts General
Hospital psychologist who conducted the study with colleagues in
San Francisco and New Jersey. Their results are published in the
current British journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Paul Ekman of the University of California at San
Francisco, who collaborated on the study, said aphasia patients are
better at detecting a certain kind of deception _ a lie about what
someone is actually feeling at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean you can generally disregard what people say,
not if you're trying to discern if someone is being truthful about
past action, about what they're planning to do next, or about their
beliefs,'' Ekman said. ``In all those cases, you have to be able to
not only understand the words but look for clues within the words
and clues in the discrepancy between the words and what the face
looks like and how the voice sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But other research, Ekman said, is showing that a small fraction
of people are skilled at spotting all kinds of lies. He thinks
that's because they take in all the inconsistencies in facial
expression, voice, body language, and words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of 5,000 people we've tested we've found two or three percent
who have this uncanny knack,'' Ekman said. ``There are people who
can do it 85 or 90 percent of the time. We're trying to find out
how they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new aphasia study confirms suspicions some have had about
the special insights of aphasia patients. In his 1985 book, ``The
Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,'' neurologist Oliver Sacks
recounts a scene in which aphasia patients laughed uproariously as
they watched President Ronald Reagan deliver a televised speech,
even though they couldn't understand his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the aphasics knew was that Reagan didn't look like someone
who was believing what he was saying,'' Ekman said.
</P>
<P>
   To test the hypothesis that aphasia patients had special
lie-detecting skills, the researchers recruited 10 stroke patients
who could follow simple instructions and asked them to watch
videotapes of nurses describing scenes they were watching on tape.
If the nurse was telling the truth, the aphasia subjects were told,
hold up one finger; if she was lying, hold up two.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses were asked to describe a pleasant scene, whatever
they were actually watching. But half the time, they were looking
at distressing pictures of burn victims and amputees.
</P>
<P>
   The aphasia patients' responses were compared with those of
three other groups on the same test _ 10 patients with right-sided
brain damage that conceivably could have dulled their ability to
read facial and voice clues; 10 healthy adults similar in age and
sex to the aphasics; and 48 healthy MIT undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   The 68 non-aphasia patients did no better than 50-50 in
detecting which nurses were lying. But as a group, the aphasia
subjects detected lies six times out of ten, relying on facial cues
and vocal cues together. The lie-detection rate went up to 73
percent when aphasia patients relied on facial expression only,
indicating these visual cues are paramount.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 10 aphasia patients proved no better than the
non-aphasia subjects at detecting lies. But significantly, that
patient was the only one whose stroke had occurred less than a year
earlier. Etcoff said this suggests it takes time for aphasia
patients to develop enhanced lie-detection skills after their
language abilities are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study is so interesting,'' said Jerome Kaplan, a speech
pathologist who works with aphasia patients. ``It provides evidence
that these folks are able to pick up more subtle changes in vocal
expression, quivers, maybe a little more sheen on a person's face.
They often have an enhanced perception of emotion in others.''

viruses are script-based and are harder to catch. Even a recent
antivirus program can be vulnerable to new forms of attack.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the most important thing you can do is to get in the
habit of backing up your important files. Then, if the worst
happens, the worst won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   All Windows-based computers come with an integrated backup
utility _ the sort of application Microsoft added to the operating
system before the Justice Department started getting excited about
such things _ but that has not stopped at least a dozen companies
from offering backup utilities of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days the main backup media were floppy disks and
tapes. Today the home computer owner has many options, including
floppies, Zips, CD-RW drives and even Internet-based remote storage
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The actual software and hardware tools for backing up a hard
drive will be discussed here next week. But the general philosophy
of backup deserves attention first, because it does not matter what
kind of backup software or hardware you have if you do not use it.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Weafer of the Symantec Antivirus Research Center spends
most of his time thinking of ways to prevent viruses from getting
into computers in the first place, but he also stresses that a
reliable backup plan is essential to computer security. The key
points to keep in mind, he said, are the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The backup process has to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has to be regular.
</P>
<P>
   _ The backup files have to be stored away from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Backup software must be tested periodically, before it is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Many people avoid contemplating the horror of losing weeks',
months' or even years' worth of data. As Samuel Johnson said,
``Nothing focuses the mind as sharply as the news that one will be
executed in a few days.'' Pretend that a virus will execute your
computer tomorrow at dawn. Are you focused?
</P>
<P>
   The best backup strategy is the one that you will use the most.
If the process is too complicated, the temptation will be to skip
it.
</P>
<P>
   Nurture the discipline to make a backup schedule and stick to
it. Decide how much work you can afford to lose. A week's worth?
Then schedule a backup session once a week, and make it a ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Do not store the backup files on the same computer, or even in
the same room, with the original files. The best strategy is to
keep at least one full backup of your files in some other place,
just in case. It is more work, and you will be lucky if it is
wasted effort, but it is prudent to make at least two copies of
each backup. Keep one locally, and entrust the other to someone off
site.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient asks a dentist, ``Do I have to floss all my
teeth?'' the dentist usually responds, ``No, only the ones you want
to keep.'' The same holds true for backing up computer files. Back
up only the ones you would hate to lose.
</P>
<P>
   You do not need to back up the actual application programs,
assuming you have a legal copy of the software and kept the
original disks as you were supposed to do. If you were using a
bootlegged copy of the application, viruses can be seen as cosmic
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Do not neglect the final step: Test your backup system. Try to
reinstall the backup files.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago I diligently made sets of backup disks using a popular
backup program. When the day of reckoning finally came, the result
of a failed hard disk, the backup program informed me that it could
not decompress the files it had compressed. My backups were in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a virus, do not try to reload your backup files
on the infected computer until you are positive that it has been
thoroughly disinfected and protected. If the virus is still lurking
on the system, it will corrupt the backup disks immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The ``I Love You'' virus, also known as the Love Bug or the Love
Letter worm, infected tens of thousands of Windows-based computers
around the world in the past week. If you have not received one of
those love letters, please do not feel unloved. There is nothing
affectionate about the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the poisoned e-mail is harmless, but opening the
attached file leads to heartbreak, or at least heartburn. Once
unleashed, the virus burrows into the roots of the PC, where it
tries to steal passwords and return them to an e-mail address in
the Philippines. Meanwhile, it rummages though the victim's
Microsoft Outlook address book and sends a copy of itself to
everyone listed there. That is why the virus files appeared to come
from friends and acquaintances, and why they quickly clogged
computer systems around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The virus does some immediate damage, too. It hides the victim's
MP3 music files, which is annoying, but it also trashes any JPEG
graphics files it finds by overwriting them. While the music files
often can be recovered, digital photos and graphics are typically
lost.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, however, it probably destroyed a significant
portion of the world's reservoirs of digital pornography and
bootlegged Metallica music files.
</P>
<P>
   There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that these latest
viruses were deliberately released into the wild by law enforcement
agencies, the music industry or the makers of antivirus software,
although a cynical paranoiac might note that each benefited
immensely from the rapid spread of the viruses over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Collections of MP3 music files are clogging computer systems on
college campuses around the world. The record industry and some
musicians like the heavy-metal band Metallica are upset that
pirates are trading MP3 recordings of their music over the Internet
without paying royalties. The release of a global MP3-killer virus
as a tactical weapon would have a much more immediate effect than
lawsuits in destabilizing the file format, which has no facility
for copyright management.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there are vast collections of innocent, perfectly
legal JPEG graphics files on computers around the world, but the
same file format is popular for distributing pornography over the
Internet. A virus designed to attack specific file formats, or to
search for and destroy files containing certain keywords, could be
an interesting tool for law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the Love Bug virus merely hides the MP3 files,
making them invisible. Before you despair over losing all the MP3
files you have lovingly collected over the last year or two, go
into Windows, click on My Computer, click View, click Folder
Options, click View and check ``show hidden files.'' Chances are
your Metallica files are still there.

PATIENTS' RIGHTS BILL STUCK IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia has changed leaders, America has chosen two
presidential nominees, and the world's first successful gene
therapy has unfolded since the US House and Senate last year agreed
to iron out differences in their competing plans to regulate the
nation's health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, after the House followed the Senate in passing
a version of the Patients' Bill of Rights, there were 22 issues on
the table. Wednesday, 17 issues remained in dispute. No significant
progress has been achieved in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   And as the pressures of election-year politics steadily rise,
the prospect of Congress's producing a landmark agreement on how
health care should be provided to tens of millions of Americans is
fading. Both Republican and Democratic negotiators agree that fewer
than 50 legislative days remain before they run out of time to act
in the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, irked by the apparent stalemate and eager to
make sweeping changes in the health-care system a centerpiece of
his legacy, has summoned to the White House Thursday the leaders of
the closed-door negotiating conference.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton, who some critics have accused of
clouding the issue by separately campaigning for an ambitious
prescription drug plan, will call on the negotiators to quickly
resolve their differences or risk a backlash from voters who yearn
for tougher regulations on health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has yet accused the other of acting in bad faith.
But the climate has grown frostier as negotiators remain divided on
nearly every pivotal issue, most notably whether the federal
protections should cover all 161 million Americans with health
insurance or just the 48 million consumers whose medical coverage
is exempt from state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed and concerned by the slow pace of the
conference,'' US Sen Edward M. Kennedy said Wednesday. ``Every day
of delay means that more patients and their families will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the 32 negotiators continue to wrangle privately. But
the lawmakers have not met formally since April 13. And no meeting
is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The lull poses a sharp contrast to the hoopla on Capitol Hill in
October after the House broke a decade-long logjam and approved the
most comprehensive plan to expand federal protections for medical
consumers since the advent of health maintenance organizations a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen cemeteries that have more activity than this
place,'' the Senate's Democratic leader, Thomas Daschle of South
Dakota, said of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who had set March 31 as their goal to
complete the negotiations, said they remain confident that a
reasonable compromise can be forged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference committee has been made steady progess and
finalized bipartisan agreements on a number of issues,'' said Gail
Osterberg, a spokeswoman for Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, who
is assistant majority leader and the committee's chairman. ``When
you consider the enormous differences, the fact that we've been
successful in negotiating these is quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators have agreed in principle on regulations that
would guarantee access to reasonable emergency care, permit
patients to see pediatricians and specialists without prior
approval from their primary doctors, and allow women to continue to
be reimbursed for care from physicians who have left their health
plan during the patients' pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Left unresolved are such hot-button issues as whether patients
could sue their health plans or obtain independent reviews of their
providers' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not even begun to discuss the critical issues of
health plan accountability and assuring that all HMO members will
be protected by the reforms,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both parties also expressed concern about the
delay, noting that the legislative calendar soon will be clogged by
an effort to pass 13 spending bills to keep the government running
when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GOP leaders questioned Clinton's motive for
summoning negotiators to the White House. Many Republicans have
long contended that Clinton and Democratic leaders are more
interested in scoring political points with the issue than
searching for common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the White House's greatest fear is that a bipartisan
managed-care proposal will come out of Congress this year,'' said
Idaho Senator Larry Craig, the GOP's policy chief in the Senate.
``I think the president is getting into the middle of it in an
attempt to mess it up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said through his spokeswoman, ``It would be very easy to
blow up this process, and we hope that is not the White House's
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats believe Republicans are purposefully
undermining the push for broad patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the March 31 deadline passed us by, it became clear that
most Republicans, and particularly the conferees, are unwilling to
empower doctors and patients to make medical decisions,'' said
Senator John F. Kerry.

GIULIANI CAMPAIGN BESET BY PERSONAL REVELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The melodrama that is the New York Senate race took
another sharp turn Wednesday as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced
that he and his wife of 16 years are separating.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night one well-placed Republican said Giuliani would
drop out of the contest. However, his campaign manager, Bruce
Teitelbaum, said the Senate run ``remains all-systems-go.''
</P>
<P>
   The events mark the latest of several recent developments that
are transforming the country's hottest political race into a
chronicle of one man's emotional roller-coaster of a life.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past few weeks:
</P>
<P>
   _ Giuliani was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ His wife, Donna Hanover, canceled her role in a stage
production of ``The Vagina Monologues,'' to avoid embarrassing her
husband's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ The mayor confirmed reports that he has been seeing another
woman, whom he called ``a very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wednesday, after Giuliani said he and Hanover are discussing a
formal separation, Hanover made her own statement, all but
confirming old rumors that Giuliani had an affair a few years ago
with one of his staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a campaign like this in New York,'' Hank
Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant, said. ``The state
that gave us Nelson Rockefeller, Robert Wagner, and Bobby Kennedy
is now serving up a soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes these developments peculiarly New Yorkish _ or
perhaps just modern _ is that nobody knows what effect they will
have on the election.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Giuliani cannot be lambasted for hypocrisy. He
has never been a ``family values'' Republican.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton can no longer be lambasted for
her husband's morals by ``family values'' foes.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Giuliani might have so alienated the state's
most conservative voters that they will cast their ballots for a
third-party candidate or simply stay home.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Clinton has no way to go on the attack,
partly because of her own glass house, partly because it may be
unseemly to attack a man with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A poll indicates 77 percent of New Yorkers consider Giuliani's
affair a private matter that will not affect their vote. However,
12 percent say it makes them less likely to vote for Giuliani _
which, in a race that is already neck-and-neck, could be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been known that Giuliani's marriage is shaky. He and
Hanover, an actress and an anchorwoman on TV's Food Channel, have
rarely been seen together for three years. Their relationship has
been so openly tense that, after reporters asked Hanover how she
voted in the 1997 mayoral election, she replied, ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage, which was visibly affectionate when Giuliani was
first elected in 1993, took a bad turn around the time rumors
spread that the mayor was having an affair with his press
spokeswoman, Christyne Lategano.
</P>
<P>
   Those rumors were never proven, despite many tabloid reporters'
efforts, but Hanover came close to confirming them Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that she tearily read outside Gracie Mansion,
where she lives with their two children, Hanover said, ``For
several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public
life because of his relationship with one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not mention anyone by name. Lategano resigned more than
a year ago. Giuliani appointed her to head the city's tourist
bureau, and she has since married.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover also revealed that she made a ``major effort'' to save
the marriage last May, and that she and Giuliani ``reestablished
some of our personal intimacy through the fall'' _ but then, he
``chose another path.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News revealed last week that Giuliani has been dining
out regularly with a woman not his wife. The New York Post then
identified her as Judith Nathan, a 45-year-old Upper East Side
divorcee, and added that they have been seeing each other for
nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in his shaky-voiced statement Wednesday, said, ``I'm
very sad, I feel terrible.'' He called Hanover ``a wonderful
woman...a wonderful mother. ... Who knows why these things
happen?'' He also called Nathan ``a very very fine person'' who
``helps me a great deal,'' adding, ``I'm going to need her now
maybe more than I did before.''

IN SRI LANKA, A GENIAL CENSOR ENFORCES TOUGH NEW PRESS RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Sri Lanka's chief censor is an amiable
executioner of words. With lips slightly pursed as he pores over
articles, he zealously wields his thick black marker even as he
shares a chummy exchange with journalists sitting around his desk.
</P>
<P>
   His job is to purge criticism of the government's faltering war
on separatist rebels from newspapers, radio and television.
``Sometimes they criticize army officers by name _ by name!'' said
the censor, Ariya Rubasinghe, this week during an interview at his
office in Colombo, the capital. ``That is nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubasinghe is very busy these days scratching out chunks of
objectionable copy. The government has recently suffered
devastating setbacks in its 17-year war with the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, and last week it imposed what journalists here said
was the harshest censorship of the press ever. It also banned
public rallies and trade union strikes that are deemed contrary to
national security, as well as ``seditious'' words, defined as those
spoken or written to try to create discontent among the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   Like many governments at war, governments in this democratic
nation have periodically clamped down on the press during the long
campaign against the rebels, who have frequently used terrorist
tactics in a crusade to win a separate state for the Hindu Tamil
minority.
</P>
<P>
   But the new regulations are more far-reaching and include harsh
new penalties. A newspaper's printing presses can be seized, its
offices closed and its journalists punished for refusing to submit
to Rubasinghe's pen. The censorship rules are also imposed on
foreign correspondents and international news agencies filing
articles from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   During a civil war that has taken more than 60,000 lives and
scared away many tourists and much foreign investment in this
island nation of 18 million people, the curtailment of civil
liberties is one of the less noticed costs. Rubasinghe, the
government's director of information and chief censor _ responsible
for supervising a staff of 10 subcensors _ noted how willingly the
press has complied with the new rules. ``They are 100 percent
cooperative, except a very few,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Iqbal Athas, a veteran defense correspondent for The Sunday
Times, said: ``They can arrest me, take my house, my vehicle. They
can imprison me for as long as a year without any legal process.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga has chosen to censor those who
have most consistently warned about the shortcomings of the war
effort at a time when all the military gains made during her six
years in power are in danger of coming undone.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the nation on Monday, Kumaratunga _ who has been
credited with trying to stop the use of torture and extrajudicial
killings by the military _ said the emergency regulations were only
temporary and would be carried out so ``there will be a minimum of
violations of fundamental human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But opposition leaders accuse her of using the crisis to keep
bad news out of the papers for political reasons. Parliamentary
elections are to be held in a few months, and the military
reversals can only hurt her party.
</P>
<P>
   The censorship is also unpopular with some voters. While she was
on her break, Iromi De Silva, a hotel worker in Colombo, tried to
make sense of Athas' column about the war in The Sunday Times, but
she could not follow it. There were large patches of white space
where words would have been. A cartoon showed a blindfolded man
gagged by a sheaf of emergency regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get any news by reading this,'' De Silva said in
disgust. ``And we have a right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga won election in 1994 as a tribune of peace. Her
administration spent months negotiating with the Tigers, but the
talks broke down, and she decided to try to crush them militarily.
</P>
<P>
   At the cost of thousands of lives, the military recaptured the
city of Jaffna, heartland of the Tamil-dominated north, from the
Tigers, and has held the city for five years. Now, Jaffna is at
risk again; the Tigers have put the government troops on the
defensive and taken two crucial military bases. They started
another offensive Wednesday and claim to have come within two miles
of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, military analysts and journalists say the
government's failings have been those of leadership, of strategy
and of faulty, if not corrupt, procurement of the basic tools of
war. The war effort has been led by Kumaratunga's uncle, Anuruddha
Ratwatte, whom she has elevated from a reserve lieutenant colonel
to a three-star general.
</P>
<P>
   While the government-owned Daily News has blared headlines in
recent days like ``Support President to Safeguard Lanka,''
independent newspapers have been running columns with huge blank
spaces stamped with the word ``censored'' in bold letters.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Denish, a correspondent for The Sunday Leader, turned in a
2,200-word column. Most of it was cut out, including a simple
description of the military losses and the government's attempt to
portray them as part of a tactical withdrawal. Censors also
eliminated reporting that the air force's shortage of airworthy
aircraft was ``due to bungling by Defense Ministry authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   International news agencies based in Colombo have also been
censored. Last Friday, on the first day the new rules were
enforced, news agency reporters said their descriptions of an
opposition rally called to protest the censorship were censored.
Reuters has been filing its main daily news story about the
conflict out of London, beyond the censor's reach.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times submitted a news article to Rubasinghe on May
5, in which he made minor changes. This article on censorship was
reported in Colombo, but was not censored because it was filed from
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lankan newspapers, which have been inserting the word
``censored'' in places where cuts have been made, some deletions
have a kind of teasing quality. A column in The Island about
India's role in the conflict, written by a retired Sri Lankan
Foreign Ministry official, K. Godage, included these snippets:
``Sri Lanka is in dire straits _ CENSORED,'' and ``My question to
Indian authorities is why they wish to wash their hands off
CENSORED.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Sri Lankan journalists who have been heavily censored
by Rubasinghe speak fondly of him. For six years, he has been the
man they called for the government's version of events, and he has
always been pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when he does the most painful things, you can't get mad
at him,'' said Athas, 55, the country's leading military
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   But Athas is a keen critic of censorship and of the government's
management of the war. In recent months his readers have been given
presentiments of the government's disastrous military performance.
</P>
<P>
   His readers also know the lengths to which some people in the
military have gone to intimidate him. Two air force officers have
been charged with breaking into his home two years ago, holding an
automatic pistol to his head and terrorizing his wife and
7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Athas had been writing exposes about the flawed
decisions of the air force, as well as serious irregularities in
its purchases of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral, it seems, is do not expose corruption or
misdeeds,'' he wrote then. And now the government has explicitly
forbidden journalists to write about the military procurement
process.
</P>
<P>
   Athas said the government seems to have convinced itself, ``If a
story isn't told, it hasn't happened.''

RWANDA AND UGANDA, SUPPOSEDLY ALLIES, MAY STUMBLE INTO WAR

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Rwanda and Uganda, allies in central Africa,
are threatening to turn their well-trained armies on each other if
they cannot resolve the tensions that have flared in recent days
into small-scale skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the top military commanders of the two nations met in
Rwanda and their presidents agreed to meet in Tanzania on Sunday to
head off any further fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But each country continued to accuse the other of massing troops
along their common border _ a development that, if true, could
intensify the dispute. But several outside officials said there was
no evidence of major troop movements on either side.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years, Rwanda and Uganda _ small nations with
outsized influence in the region _ have been fighting to oust the
president of Congo, Laurent Kabila, and are thus nominally on the
same side.
</P>
<P>
   But their troops clashed last summer in the Congolese city of
Kisangani and again last Friday in a much smaller battle that
nonetheless reignited the tensions and mutual distrust. At least 30
people were killed in the latest fighting, half of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The situation appeared to be easing on Monday, when the two
nations agreed to a truce brokered by a U.N. team in the region and
said they would pull their troops out of Kisangani to make way for
peacekeepers to monitor a general cease-fire to the much larger
conflict in Congo. But on Tuesday, each side accused the other of
initiating a renewed round of shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, amid alternately harsh and conciliatory words from
both sides, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Paul
Kagame of Rwanda agreed to the meeting in Tanzania. Presidents
Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzanzia are to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Jeje Odongo of Uganda and Brig. Gen.
Kayumba Nyamvasa of Rwanda, their countries' top military leaders,
met in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both Rwanda and Uganda said they hoped the
mediation would end the dispute, which has puzzled many experts
because until last summer the two countries and their leaders had
been close friends with common goals in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is going to be defused,'' said Emmanuel Ndahiro,
a spokesman for Rwanda's army and an aide to Kagame. ``It's
madness, to say the very least.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope Kivengere, a spokeswoman for the Ugandan president, said,
``Our differences with Rwanda are really not fundamental.'' She
added: ``When these clashes appeared, as they did last year, we sat
down and sorted them out. We will sit down again on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a top Ugandan army official, Brig. Gen. James
Kazini, was quoted Wednesday as saying that Uganda was ready to
fight if provoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we're ready for them,'' The Monitor, a Ugandan
newspaper, quoted him as saying. ``We're beginning to realize these
people may be real enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndahiro repeated the accusation that Uganda has been building up
its troop strength along its southern border, next to Rwanda.
Uganda denied it had sent troops to the border, saying it has had
soldiers stationed in the area for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   While the dispute may seem to the outside world like so much
bickering between two small nations, the stakes are high: the
cooperation of Rwanda and Uganda is essential to the success of the
larger cease-fire agreement in Congo.

AT THE THEATER, ORCHESTRA PITS ARE FILLED IN WITH DIGITAL MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No orchestra members will be in the pit riffling
through their scores and checking their instruments when the
curtain rises Thursday night on the New York City Technical College
revival of ``Evita.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because 35 loudspeakers have replaced them, arranged in
front of the audience where an orchestra once sat.
</P>
<P>
   It is those speakers, connected to a computer fully stocked with
the digitally sampled sounds of a range of orchestral instruments,
that will pour forth the accompaniment to ``Don't Cry for Me,
Argentina'' as Evita sings her sad farewell from the stage. Welcome
to the virtual orchestra, the group that always plays on pitch and
never calls for a coffee break.
</P>
<P>
   So while Argentina may restrain its tears, future musicians in
the audience may well weep, when they realize what this show and
others like it could mean for their job prospects. Only the singers
and actors in this production are human. The orchestra that
accompanies them is digital.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the digital orchestra _ not from the podium but from
a computer console _ will be David B. Smith, co-creator of the
system and an assistant professor at New York City Technical
College, which is sponsoring the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, once a violinist himself, does not see his 100 percent
simulated symphony orchestra as a threat to his former colleagues.
``We're not driving musicians out of business,'' he said. ``Our
purpose is to support touring groups and small ensembles that
otherwise can't afford an orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   At this week's performances of ``Evita,'' at Klitgord Auditorium
in Brooklyn, Smith will probably be found sitting near the stage
with the score at hand; he prefers a printed version to the
electronic one his computer can readily display. ``I check the
score,'' he said, ``but mainly I'm looking at the conductor and the
singers.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will be watching to make sure that the music he is cueing
keeps time with the musicians on the stage, neither getting ahead
of them nor lagging behind.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he will tap out a rhythm on a keyboard, the rate of
which will tell the computer whether to speed up or slow down its
music. At a rehearsal, he watched both the conductor and singers
closely, constantly varying his electronic rhythm in response to
the conductor's baton with a rubato that even Puccini, a master of
the slow and fast, might envy.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers that emit the sound of an orchestra are arranged in
a semicircle just below the stage, with one speaker dedicated to
each instrument. The string section _ once wooden violas, violins
and cellos _ has been replaced by 16 high-tech flat-panel speakers
positioned on metal stands that put them at about nose level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celli are the big ones,'' Smith said, pointing to the
largest of the speakers, rectangles about the size of a movie
poster. ``They are bigger because they have to get down two octaves
below middle C, in the 60-hertz range.''
</P>
<P>
   The harpsichord that is heard in Evita's death scene shares a
speaker with a piano. Other speakers are reserved for instruments
like the French horn, the oboe, the clarinet and the harp, as well
as for the occasional gong and log drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sample every single pitch and articulation, either live or
on CD,'' said Frederick Bianchi, co-creator of the system and an
associate professor and director of computer music at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute. ``For instance, we have literally 8,000 or
9,000 samples of the violin created and stored.'' Bianchi is even
careful to separate upbow and downbow strokes for all the stringed
instruments being sampled.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Bianchi have spent 15 years developing their musical
system. ``We've had 2,000 performances and never a crash,'' Bianchi
said. ``Of course, we also provide a backup system just in case,
but the primary system has yet to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Their company, Realtime Music Solutions, offers to music
directors the digitally sampled sounds, sequencing software and
show files that contain the information to perform a particular
score. One of the systems is currently on the road with a tour of
``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The score is for 30 players,'' Smith said. ``The tour has
seven people, so we supplied the other 23 instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Synthesizers are nothing new in orchestra pits, of course.
Despite the best efforts of unions, they have been making steady
inroads there during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Johnson, a violinist who plays in the ``Beauty and the
Beast'' orchestra on Broadway, opposes their incursion. He and the
show's four other violinists have their sound filled out by a
synthesizer at every performance. ``First they take away 10 of our
15 violins,'' Johnson said, ``and then add a synthesizer, but it's
not the sound of live people.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that virtually all Broadway pits had synthesizers.
``I don't understand how any self-respecting artistic director
could continue the process toward more and more synthesized
music,'' he said. ``The essence of live theater is live performers.
You don't go to a baseball game to see robots.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Bianchi, in contrast, are eager to make digitally
sampled music available to an ever increasing audience. They
particularly want to help smaller groups, like high school
musicians who want to put on a play but don't have enough players
for a full orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying, `Get rid of the orchestra,''' Bianchi said.
``We can make your seven people better. We want to enhance, not
replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the programs offered many advantages. ``There are
lots of sequencing programs, but ours is tempo agile,'' he said.
``That means the person performing the virtual orchestra has the
ability to mold the music in real time, slowing down or speeding up
with real expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the equipment for the performance of ``Evita'' was
purchased through a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
which is financing a program in new sound technology at the
college, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The technical support staff for the performances of ``Evita'' is
composed almost entirely of students training in New York City
Technical College's stage technology program, preparing for the
increasingly high-tech world of backstage theater. Some of the
singers are professionals, others are college students.

 &HT;    Miami's angry turmoil over Elian echoes 1960s Havana
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vacations are supposed to be fun.
</P>
<P>
   But last week when I returned to the city I have always
considered home to see relatives and frolic in the Atlantic Ocean,
my emotions were a grab bag of sadness, anger and regret.
</P>
<P>
   After living in Atlanta for the past 2 1/2 years, I returned to
Miami, the place where I was raised. My parents and I _ a
3-month-old infant at the time _ moved there in October 1960 after
leaving a turbulent Havana, Cuba, in the throes of Fidel Castro's
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miami is almost no different, mired in its own ugly episode
of hatred and rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful city is torn and raw, a place where politicians
are raging, where friends are bickering and where brothers, sisters
and cousins have turned their backs on each other because they
refuse to accept one another's views.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about a 6-year-old Cuban boy who innocently landed on
U.S. shores after his mother, stepfather and nine other people died
at sea when the small motorboat they used to escape Cuba capsized.
The verbal wars also are about the aging Castro, who after 40 years
in power in the island nation, is still pushing the buttons of
Miami's Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the saga of young Elian Gonzalez and the history of
the 73-year-old dictator.
</P>
<P>
   But the emotional destruction left in Miami after federal agents
seized Elian from the home of his relatives April 22 is worse than
any hurricane the city has ever weathered.
</P>
<P>
   Natural disasters tend to unite a community. The wake left by
this child's plight has destroyed this one.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through the city's Little Havana section last week, my
mother and I could not help but struggle with the knots in our
throats. My mother, in her early 20s when she left Havana, began to
cry. The scene before her was jarring. Cuban flags of every size
flew from the windows of homes and businesses. They flew from cars,
trucks and SUVs driven by both young and old. Signs bemoaning
Elian's departure were posted everywhere and anywhere room would
permit. Most of the signs screamed angry words at President Clinton
and Attorney General Janet Reno. The hatred was palpable as we
rolled though the streets in our tiny rental car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so awful,'' my mother said to me in Spanish as we
turned onto a street where a man sold Elian T-shirts from a rickety
wooden cart. ``The story of this little boy, these signs, all the
hatred on the Cuban radio stations and on TV, it's the history of
our country unfolding right in front of us. It's always been so
tormented.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of us gulped when we spotted the shiny black ribbons tied
to every chain link fence in the row of houses across the street
from the tiny home where Elian stayed for five months. The front
yard of the home of Lazaro Gonzalez _ Elian's great uncle _ is
jammed with bouquets of wilting flowers and stuffed animals stained
by mud and rain; the wooden swing set where the world watched the
charming boy play daily, was depressing in the punishing Florida
sun, quiet and empty.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of neighbors stood in front of their homes, their
faces blank. One man sat in a small lawn chair in the middle of the
street in front of the Gonzalez home. He held a Cuban flag in his
left hand as he staged a silent vigil for who knows what.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at my aunt's house in Coral Gables, just west of
Miami. Nightly we were treated to the constant banter of
commentators bashing the U.S. government on Spanish-language radio.
My aunt and her husband, both staunch anti-Castro Cubans, had very
definite opinions of how things should have played out in the Elian
situation. While we understand their feelings and support their
anti-Communist sentiments, there were some things we disagreed
with.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time ever, neither my mother nor I dared to
air our views. Our relatives would have harshly criticized us for
opposing them. We would have argued and it would have gotten ugly.
This was a first for me, a normally outspoken woman.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we met a man at a friend's house. His name is
Jorge Vasquez. He told us this ugly situation would pit friend
against friend, neighbor against neighbor: ``People are fighting
over this. It's one of the worst things that has ever happened to
Miami.'' On April 28, more than 80,000 Cuban-Americans marched in
Little Havana in a peaceful protest decrying the federal raid that
took Elian. There were angry words. There was mockery of Clinton,
Reno and Castro. But mostly there was resignation. A few miles
south, 2,500 Anglos held their own protest against the
Cuban-American community along U.S. 1. A small plane flew above the
demonstrators with a banner that read: ``One down, 800,000 more to
go.'' The sign referred to Elian and the 800,000 Cuban-Americans
who live in Dade County. A man dragged a Cuban flag on the street.
</P>
<P>
   That made me angry. Never before had I felt so Cuban as at that
very moment. Why did this man drag the flag of my country? In all
the years I had lived in Miami, I had never seen such turmoil. As a
journalist, I had covered riots in Miami, but never had I seen
people so torn apart. Now I know why the man with the distant look
on his face keeps his silent vigil in front of the Gonzalez home in
Little Havana. He stares at Elian's empty swing set and jungle gym
and wonders if Miami will ever be at peace again.

DNA TEST FREES INNOCENT MAN JAILED 10 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He cried the first night the prison doors closed behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote poetry and short stories to help pass the decade he
spent behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three years ago, Neil J. Miller made a request that
changed his life. Adamant that he had not committed the crime for
which he was serving 10 to 25 years in jail, he asked a lawyer if
genetic testing might free him.
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with a dozen jubilant friends and family members
gathered around him, many offering public prayers of thanks, Miller
walked out of a courthouse, freed by sophisticated DNA testing that
wasn't available when he was convicted of raping and robbing an
Emerson College student in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise be to God,'' Miller, now 33, said in a hallway in
Suffolk Superior Court shortly after his release was announced.
``Praise be to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by attorneys for the New York-based Innocence Project,
which helped exonerate him, Miller insisted that he harbored no
resentment despite spending the past decade behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate nobody,'' he said. ``I don't hold no animosity
toward anybody. But I hope I can move on, the victim can move on,
and everybody else can move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Miller was convicted of the aggravated rape and armed
robbery of the 19-year-old student, who identified him from a
photograph, and later in person, as the man who had assaulted her
in her apartment on August 24, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But with the aid of DNA testing coordinated by the Innocence
Project, based at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law, Miller was
able to prove that he was not the source of semen found on the
victim's bed and body.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the newly discovered evidence, the Suffolk County
District Attorney's Office and Boston Police acknowledged Miller's
innocence and arranged for his release.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's exoneration marks the third time in the past year that
men convicted of crimes in Suffolk County have been freed, although
Miller is the only one of the three freed as a result of DNA
testing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, however, Marvin Mitchell was released from prison after
DNA tests showed he was not the man who had raped a 12-year-old
girl abducted from a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Miller spent ten years in prison for a crime he didn't
commit,'' said Innocence Project co-director Peter Neufeld, who
called Miller's imprisonment ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld praised prosecutors for cooperating with efforts to free
Miller. But he had harsh words for the criminal process that
resulted in Miller's wrongful conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he questioned prosecutors' reliance on
cross-racial identification, citing statistics that indicate that
people have difficulty identifying someone of another race.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is black and the victim is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machinery of this justice system is unfortunately very
broken at the moment,'' Neufeld said, ``and is going to need some
serious reform.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Neufeld, Miller is the 65th person in the United
States to have been unjustly convicted and later cleared by DNA
testing, and the second in Boston. Of those 65, Neufeld noted,
eight were on death row.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller was released, he was surrounded by a circle of friends
and family, including one woman who videotaped the long-awaited
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is beyond words,'' said Glynnada Hayes-John, Miller's
cousin. ``I mean, he's been locked up for ten years and you can't
get that back. But we're going to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' added Miller, who plans to live temporarily with
his sister in Boston until he saves enough money for a place of his
own, ``but I'm also nervous and scared.''

STUDY FINDS INTERNET OF SOCIAL BENEFIT TO USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Internet use has become associated more and more with
social isolation, some researchers are finding that the opposite
may be true.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released on Wednesday by the Pew Internet
and American Life Project, a research center in Washington, more
than half of Internet users found that e-mail was strengthening
their family ties. And Internet users in the study reported far
more offline social contact than non-users. Women in particular
said they found e-mail very useful in keeping in touch with friends
and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Internet users have a more robust social
network than non-Internet users,'' said Lee Rainie, director of the
project. ``There doesn't seem like there's any diminution of social
networks because people are spending a lot of time online.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet users in the study were far more likely to report that
they had a significant network of relatives and friends to call on
in time of need. Nearly half of Internet users reported that they
had a social network, but only 38 percent of non-users did. The
more years respondents had been going online, the more likely they
were to report that they had a social network.
</P>
<P>
   And although 8 percent of Internet users said they were socially
isolated, far more non-users _ 18 percent _ reported that they had
either no one or hardly anyone to turn to. On the subject of
offline, real-world contact, nearly 75 percent of Internet users
said they had visited family or friends the day before they were
asked the question, but only 61 percent of non-Internet users said
they had made such visits.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey was conducted from March 1 through March
31. Interviews were conducted with 3,533 adults, and 1,690 of those
were Internet users. The sampling error was plus or minus 2.5
percentage points for the full sample, and plus or minus 3
percentage points for data about the Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   These conclusions seem to contradict the findings of a study
released in February by the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative
Study of Society, but the studies took very different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In that study, the researcher, Prof. Norman Nie, concluded that
the Internet contributed to social alienation. Because people were
spending more time on the Internet, his findings showed, they were
spending less time in social endeavors. The study found that 8
percent of regular Internet users attended fewer social events and
that 59 percent of regular users said they watched less television
as a result of time spent online. Thirteen percent said they spent
less time with friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stanford study, subjects were asked how much time they
spent on various activities, including time online, but were not
asked how they felt about their online communication. The Pew study
asked about the quality of their online communication and whether
subjects felt that it had improved their relationships, but the
study did not ask how much time they spent on activities online and
offline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are measuring communication and contact among people,
e-mail being an important component of that communication and
connection,'' said Rainie, director of the Pew study. The Stanford
study's conclusions, he said, were based on ``a value judgment that
any kind of conversational contact was more socially valuable than
other types of contact.'' The study distinguished between e-mail,
telephone conversations and face-to-face visits.
</P>
<P>
   Nie, the researcher on the Stanford study, said that if he had
to do it over, he would ask how people felt about the quality of
their Internet communication. However, he said, ``that's not
something survey research is particularly good at.'' Such questions
would be more appropriate for a psychologist's couch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was convinced that e-mail communication was not as
valuable as face-to-face interaction. For example, he said, some of
his relatives had recently sent e-mail from every port while
touring the world on a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful to hear about their exciting tales,'' Nie
said, ``but it had none of the emotional quality of spending an
evening with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The different conclusions of the studies could signal the
beginning of a stream of seemingly contradictory studies about the
Internet. Bruce Bimber, director of the Center for Information
Technology and Society at the University of California at Santa
Barbara, said the contrast between the two studies showed that the
Internet had become too diverse to examine as a singular
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers discovered the same thing about television in past
years. Though studies of television viewing showed that the
audience was less engaged in society, those who watched public
television were more engaged. The same may be true for segments of
the Internet-using population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop thinking about the Internet as a single entity
with a single effect,'' Bimber said. ``It's going to take several
more years before the research has a standard set of measures.
Before we do that, we're going to get pieces of the puzzle that
don't necessarily fit together but aren't contradictory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pew study produced separate data for men and women with some
clear differences. The study reported that about 9 million women
had gone online for the first time in the last six months, a number
that comprises about one-tenth of all women in the United States.
For the first time, women make up half the Internet population.
</P>
<P>
   Women, the study found, are more likely than men to say that
e-mail has improved relationships with family and friends. Nearly
60 percent of women said they found e-mail very useful for
communicating with family members, but only 44 percent of men said
so.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed little evidence that time on the Internet
prevents people from communicating in other ways. For example,
parents and children who exchange e-mail said they talked on the
phone just as often. More than 75 percent said they talked on the
phone at least once a week and sent e-mail just as much.
</P>
<P>
   They did not deride the use of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking people to judge the value of that contact, and
they're reporting that they value that contact,'' Rainie said.
``They felt there were improvements and a greater volume of
communication. You can make the case that that's a social
benefit.''

BUSY HURRICANE SEASON FORECAST; EXPERTS CALL PREPARATION CRUCIAL
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Weather forecasters for the federal government said
Wednesday that residents along the East Coast and in the Caribbean
should prepare for a particularly active hurricane season this
year, with stronger and longer-lasting storms.
</P>
<P>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects an
``above average'' hurricane season. Eleven or more tropical storms
have been predicted, with seven developing into hurricanes; three
or more will be major hurricanes, officials said. (A major
hurricane reaches maximum sustained winds of more than 110 mph.)
</P>
<P>
   D. James Baker, the under secretary for oceans and atmosphere at
the Department of Commerce, said that La Nina, which is defined by
cooler than average temperatures in the central and eastern
tropical Pacific, continues to a have significant influence on
weather conditions and hurricane forecasts. The current forecast
suggests that La Nina will fade by August.
</P>
<P>
   ``During last year's hurricane season,'' Baker said, ``La Nina
was bold, and clearly defined, and gave forecasters more
certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the remnants of La Nina, combined with other weather
patterns including warmer than normal Atlantic Ocean temperatures,
will ``affect hurricane activity over very long time scales.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the conditions are ``ripe for hurricane activity.''
</P>
<P>
   La Nina, which has dominated global weather patterns for the
last two years, is responsible also for worsening drought
conditions in the Midwest and South, weather officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Warm conditions have arrived early this year along the East
Coast, with record high temperatures in some places. And rainfall
has been inconsistent in the last few months, depleting soil
moisture in a swath of states throughout the South and Midwest,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The drought will ``get worse before it gets better,'' said John
Kelly, assistant administrator at the oceanic and atmospheric
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in forecast technology are helping meteorologists
track storms, but hurricanes and tropical storms wreak havoc every
year along coastal regions. Last year, five hurricanes struck
mainland United States, killing 60 people, according to the oceanic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. During the
peak months _ August to October _ many of the storms begin over the
tropical Atlantic Ocean and move toward the Caribbean Islands or
the coastal United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for economic catastrophe in coastal cities and
towns has increased dramatically in recent years because more and
more people are moving to the coasts,'' said Secretary of Commerce
William Daley, who oversees the oceanic and atmospheric
administration. ``It is imperative that local residents and
businesses be prepared to protect themselves and their property.''

 &HT;    Chips are hot stuff these days
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chip company stocks may have been hammered on Wednesday, but the
sell-off is anything but indicative of the state of the
semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chips are hot stuff these days, and many of the companies that
make them have embarked on expensive campaigns to build and equip
factories to keep pace with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Chips used in wireless phones and equipment and Internet-related
networking gear are the hottest chips going today, but demand is
strong in all sectors of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, semiconductor makers are feeling the effects
of their decision to slow down spending on factories and equipment
during the industry's three-year slump that began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are scrambling like mad to add capacity,'' said
George Burns, an analyst with Strategic Marketing Associates in
Santa Cruz, Calif., which tracks the chip industry's factory
investment. ``This is a boom-and-bust industry and right now, we're
in the boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Austin, which is second only to Silicon Valley in its
concentration of chip companies, the effects aren't hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Inc. workers in East Austin have been working for weeks
to install dozens of pieces of advanced manufacturing equipment
into MOS 13, the company's most advanced chip factory. It also is
expanding its other two local factories.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola will spend more than $400 million at MOS 13, the bulk
of $600 million its spending at all three of its Austin chip
factories this year. The expansion push is part of Motorola's $2.6
billion worldwide spending plan worldwide to boost chip production
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's aggressive expansion plans are just a small part of
the record $55 billion that chip makers expect to spend on
factories and equipment this year in response to the sudden strong
surge in demand for chips.
</P>
<P>
   The big expansion plans by Motorola and other chip makers has
meant money in the coffers of Applied Materials Inc., which on
Wednesday reported record earnings, sales, new orders and
backlogged orders for the quarter ended April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Applied, which announced heavy layoffs less than two years ago,
now is making chip equipment in Austin almost around the clock. The
company has 4,500 workers in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., the chip industry's largest player, plans to spend
$6 billion this year on new factory capacity designed meet
continued strong demand for its Pentium processors. Intel also
plans to spend $100 million over the next year to build and equip a
new chip design center in downtown Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's main rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., does almost all
of its domestic manufacturing in Austin and employs some 4,500
people locally. It has budgeted $700 million on capital spending
this year, with most of that money targeted for its new factory
Dresden, Germany, which expects to ship its first commercial
products in June.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's management also is talking with partner Fujitsu Ltd. in
Japan about adding to their Japanese joint venture manufacturing
operation for non-volatile flash memories, which are used in
wireless phones and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   AMD won't disclose how much it is spending in Austin this year,
but the company said it continues to add equipment to Fab 25 as its
shifts production from its older K6-2 processors to its more
advanced Athlon chips. Samsung Austin Semiconductor will spend
another $200 million this year on advanced manufacturing equipment
that will allow its Austin factory _ its only domestic
manufacturing plant _ to make more advanced memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cypress Semiconductor Corp. plans to add 10 percent
to the capacity of its Round Rock manufacturing plant, but the
company still has no plans this year to start again building the
major chip factory project there that it canceled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cypress is trying very hard not to get caught up in this mass
building hysteria to add capacity,'' said spokesman Joe McCarthy.
The company does plan to build the unfinished project in Round Rock
sometime in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
   At Motorola, the Austin expansion is part of a company-wide push
to boost manufacturing capacity by 30 percent this year from its
worldwide chip sales of more than $7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aggressively going after business,'' said Bill Walker,
Motorola's top executive for chip manufacturing. ``You have to take
advantage of it while the business is there. You've got to keep
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Motorola's expansion should create 400 to 500 new
manufacturing jobs in Austin this year. Despite those new jobs, the
company said its Austin employment remains at about 10,000 _ the
same level as four years ago. The company prefers to round its
local employment figures to the nearest 1,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also will close its 25-year-old MOS 3 factory in East
Austin this year. The factory, which makes chips from small 4-inch
diameter silicon wafers, is no longer considered to be competitive,
Walker said. Workers will be transferred to the company's other
factories in the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman explained that even though the company is hiring
workers, work force attrition helps keep its total employment close
to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Does the current expansion in the chip business mean chip makers
will have too much capacity for their own good in the near future?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the semiconductor industry and, of course, they are
going to overdo it,'' said Burns, the analyst. ``We have a year and
a half before we see a slump in equipment spending.''

 &HT;    Ramseys sue book publishers
 &HT;    By Andrea Ball
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ John and Patsy Ramsey sued a Fredericksburg
publisher and two Travis County businessmen for $11.7 million,
claiming their book wrongly called the Ramsey's 13-year-old son a
murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor House Publishing Group is accused of libeling Burke
Ramsey in its book, ``A Little Girl's Dream? A JonBenet Ramsey
Story.'' The book claims Burke sexually molested and killed his
6-year-old sister JonBenet in 1996. He was 9 at the time of the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys call the book malicious, negligent and false in the
lawsuit filed late Tuesday in Travis County District Court _ one of
several filed nationwide in defense of Burke.
</P>
<P>
   But Dwight Wallington, owner of Windsor House and the book's
author, isn't backing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they're suing us,'' said Wallington, whose company
was in Austin when the book was published in 1998. ``I welcome it.
Now we can get at the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits also names Travis County residents Peter Des Camps and
James Conn of Windsor-Golf Distribution, a now-defunct holding
company involved with financing the book. ``We are investigating
the claims in the lawsuit and will issue a statement later,'' Des
Camps said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also names Eleanor Von Duyke, a beauty pageant
organizer listed as the book's co-author. The book was to be an
account of Von Duyke's experience in the pageant industry, but the
focus later shifted to JonBenet, Wallington said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Duyke, whom Wallington said was angered by the final version
of the book, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in the
basement of her parents' home in Boulder, Colo. Police have said
Burke is not a suspect but that John and Patsy Ramsey remain
``under an umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her death, the blonde JonBenet has been the subject of
countless books, tabloid covers and television shows. Amateur and
professional sleuths continue to publicly speculate on the little
girl's grisly fate.
</P>
<P>
   Wallington, who said he worked on the book for five months,
theorizes that Burke habitually molested JonBenet and accidentally
killed her that December night. The Ramsey's dispute the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burke Ramsey was a happy, normal 9-year-old boy prior to his
sister's murder,'' the lawsuit reads. ``He did not engage in sexual
molestation or abuse of his little sister JonBenet. He is not a
chronic liar as the defendants have claimed. And, most important of
all, Burke Ramsey did not kill his younger sister.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is one of a string of libel suits filed by the
Ramseys in defense of their son. On Monday, they sued the New York
Post and Time Warner for $4 million each, and several other
lawsuits are pending, said Lin Wood, the Ramsey's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said Burke has seen the tabloid headlines, and the family
fears that he will be emotionally scarred by the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, fortunately, has a young person's God-given defenses,''
Wood said from his Atlanta office. ``Everything is fine right now.
But this could hurt him down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallington stands by his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I do this to bother Burke Ramsey? No,'' Wallington said.
``Did I do it to get to the truth? Absolutely.''

DOWNLOAD TRAVEL PLANS AND INFORMATION ON A HANDHELD DEVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By JOE HUTSKO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether your travels take you to another city or another
continent, it helps to know something about your destination: where
to eat, where to stay or what to see. In the past, that meant
taking along travel or restaurant guides and a pocket diary for
keeping track of travel arrangements, appointments, reservations,
torn pages from directories, maps and other bits of travel-related
data.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can carry all that information on a computer. Although a
laptop can make a handy travel companion, the smaller, handheld
personal digital assistants are even more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   With pocket-size handhelds, there are basically two choices:
devices running the Palm operating system, like Palm's own
handhelds or the Handspring Visor, and those from Casio, Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard, which use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system
or its newer, more capable successor, Pocket PC. Just as the Palm
camp has a lead of many millions of units over the Microsoft
faction, Palm and its cousins also have the edge in travel
products.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of travel information available for handhelds,
which is useful even if your idea of traveling involves nothing
more than a trip to a new neighborhood in search of an exotic meal.
The publishers of popular travel and entertainment guidebooks have
a presence on the Web, and some have adapted their products to the
handheld market. From Fodor's to Frommer's, Lonely Planet to Zagat,
the guides served up by these brand names for online or handheld
use generally match their printed counterparts in tone, style and
content.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers loyal to any of the guides can visit their Web sites
for products, services and online addendums to the printed
editions. Users must pay to download some information, but all
offer some free online-based services and listings that can be
saved to a PDA as a text file or Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Downloadable guides vary in depth and price. Zagat restaurant
guides for Palm devices, for instance, are published by Landware
for $29.95 for the first city and $14.95 for each additional city.
Also for Palm-based devices are the Weissmann City Profiles guides,
published by Aramis and priced at $59.95 for a package of major
cities in either the United States or Europe. Information about
individual cities can also be downloaded for $12.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   More in tune with modern trekkers are the Web-based upstarts
that are challenging the old hands with innovative services. The
goods and services they offer are free to subscribers; advertising
is the source of their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in the handheld information-on-the-go trade is AvantGo,
which runs on both Palm and Windows CE and Pocket PC devices.
Gaining access to the software and services requires registering
with the site, then downloading the information to a PDA. AvantGo
organizes the available Web sites, called channels, by categories.
For travelers, the City/Regional and Travel categories are most
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Choices in these categories are many and far-reaching, including
a version of the popular CitySearch.com service, which gives a
rundown of what is going on in most United States (and some
foreign) cities. The information includes live shows and movies,
restaurants, nightclubs and other recreation and events. Other
AvantGo travel channels include a mapping program for getting from
Point A to Point B, and RestaurantRow-.com, which organizes
restaurants based on ZIP code and will even phone or mail in a
reservation on your behalf through the channel's concierge service.
</P>
<P>
   After the user picks channels of interest, the AvantGo site
plucks the desired bits of information from the partners (including
The New York Times) that are the sources of material. That data is
transferred to the handheld the next time the user runs Palm's
HotSync program or Microsoft's ActiveSync on Pocket PC's.
ActiveSync can also be set to update the handheld constantly as
long as it is in its cradle, connected to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pocket PC and Palm users may also choose to turn any Web
page into a custom channel. The Pocket PC approach is a one-step
process, requiring only a click of the Create Mobile Favorite menu
in Internet Explorer to send the page to the device the next time
it is synchronized. Palm users use AvantGo to accomplish the same
thing, with an extra step thrown in: they choose how often to
update each page _ at every sync, only once or once a week. AvantGo
for the Pocket PC works the same way.
</P>
<P>
   A compelling new city guide for Palm devices is Vindigo, which,
unlike AvantGo's wide-reaching selection of channels, focuses on
eating, shopping and playing. The service looks only at New York,
although the company says it expects to offer information for other
cities by summer. The Vindigo program gets its information from New
York Today, which is owned by The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Tap in a location, and Vindigo arranges your options
accordingly, relative to the closest cross-streets. Listings can
also be browsed by neighborhood, and many are accompanied by a
brief review. The program automatically generates walking
directions to get you where you want to go by the most direct
route. The company said it was exploring other platforms, which
means Pocket PC.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to be connected anywhere, anytime, Palm sells
the Palm VII, a wireless device that gives the user access to the
Palm.Net service, which offers live Web clippings of specific,
tailored information (as opposed to the actual Web sites
themselves). The Palm.Net site's Web clipping applications for
travelers include flight schedules and tracking for major airlines,
traffic coverage and directions, Fodor's and Frommer's guidebooks,
a gas station finder and weather reports.
</P>
<P>
   Palm.Net's Web-clipping service has been criticized for being
too expensive. The basic service is $9.99 a month for 50 kilobytes
of data (about 150 Palm VII screens), an extended plan is $24.99 a
month for 150 kilobytes, and a volume plan is $39.99 for 300
kilobytes. Each plan charges 20 cents a kilobyte if the data limits
are exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Palm.Net and other vendors are coming up with improvements that
make the Palm VII more useful. For example, PalmNet's new unlimited
plan, for $44.99 a month, lets users clip to their hearts' content.
While Palm.Net's e-mail lets subscribers check only their Palm.Net
e-mail accounts, ThinAir software by ThinAirApps allows the Palm
VII to check e-mail accounts at most other places.

MARKET PLACE: SEC CHIEF SEEKS MORE OVERSIGHT OF ACCOUNTING FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Wednesday called for increased oversight of
accounting firms and new rules on conflicts of interest at the
firms, saying that both are necessary to keep auditors independent
and standards of financial reporting in the United States high.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the New York University law school, the SEC
chairman, Arthur Levitt, said that accounting professionals are
being tempted to lower auditing standards to keep paying customers
happy. ``Too many auditors are being judged not just by how well
they manage an audit, but by how well they cross-market their
firm's nonaudit services,'' he said, referring to consulting
services that now make up the bulk of the revenues at large
accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor independence and reliability is at the heart of investor
confidence in corporate financial statements, Levitt said. ``With
our markets at their present level and with international
competition being more a factor than ever before, it's critical
that we do not lose the public confidence that has made our markets
the greatest in the world,'' he said in an interview. ``The surest
way to lose that confidence is to step back from the commitment to
full disclosure and accurate numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's reaction to Levitt's speech was generally
supportive. ``I believe that there is a real need for a change in
the regulatory environment and a need for global financial
reporting standards,'' said James J. Schiro, chief executive
officer of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``The chairman's initiatives
will play a crucial role in accomplishing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Anderson, senior vice president for technical services
at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
industry's trade group, said: ``I'm not sure we heard anything new
and different in this speech. These things have been on our plate
for years.'' Revealing some sensitivity about the prospect of
increased regulatory scrutiny, Anderson said he would not comment
on the concept ``until we see a formal proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is focusing on three major areas. First, it will require
accounting firms to examine their past conduct and detail any
violations of independence rules that may have occurred. It also
wants to see greater oversight of the accounting profession by the
Public Oversight Board, an independent accounting industry review
organization set up by Congress more than 20 years ago after the
bankruptcy of Penn Central Railroad. As envisioned, the oversight
board would better shape the agenda and the code of conduct for the
profession and conduct special reviews of practices when needed.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the SEC staff will prepare new rules about which
consulting services may be offered by accounting firms to their
corporate clients and which should be forbidden given the conflicts
they pose, Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, the SEC staff will also come up with revised
rules on stock ownership by employees of accounting firms. The
existing rules, which prohibit auditors and their families from
holding stock in companies the accounting firms count as customers,
have been viewed as too restrictive. For example, the spouse of an
accounting firm's partner in a California office is barred from
owning stock in a company that is an audit client of the firm in
Maine. Levitt said the new rules will get rid of irrationality.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The regulatory scrutiny comes after a series of high-profile
corporate accounting frauds, at companies including Cendant,
Sunbeam and Livent, which their auditors missed. Public
shareholders lost hundreds of millions of dollars in these cases,
and confidence in accountants was shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, partners and employees at PricewaterhouseCoopers
were found by the SEC to have routinely violated rules forbidding
their ownership of stock in companies they were auditing. The
investigation found 8,064 violations at the firm, which then
dismissed five partners. Pricewaterhouse said at the time that it
did not believe that the integrity of any audit had been
compromised by the violations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of auditor independence has grown thornier in recent
years as accounting firms have remade themselves into full-service
operations, in which auditing takes a back seat to more profitable
consulting services. According to the SEC, auditing now represents
30 percent of accounting firms' revenues, down from 70 percent in
1977, while consulting and other advisory services represent more
than half of revenues, up from 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for conflict is that an auditor, eager to get
consulting fees from a corporate customer, is not as aggressive on
its audit as he might otherwise be. John H. Biggs, chairman of
TIAA-CREF, the pension fund management group, said that his
organization makes it a rule to hire separate firms for audits and
for consulting services. ``When you're paying the auditor $3
million to do an audit and paying them $17 million to do management
consulting, it's way out of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence A. Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corp., said:
``Arthur is trying to do the right thing. There's no question what
he's trying to do is divorce auditing from consulting on a formal
basis, and I think American business has no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A further indication of the change that is roiling the
accounting profession is KPMG's announcement last week that it
plans to spin off the majority stake in its consulting services
unit in an initial public offering aimed at raising $1 billion. If
a KPMG auditing client owned stock in the consulting firm, a
conflict could arise.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's call for greater power for the Oversight Board comes
just a week after the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants sent a letter to the board saying that it would no
longer pay to cover the board's investigation of violations of
investment rules. The Oversight Board, headed by Charles A.
Bowsher, former United States Comptroller General, is financed by
1,300 accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the letter, Anderson explained that it was a
routine attempt ``to get our arms around a work plan for this
project. It unfortunately got blown out of proportion. We have
always supported a strong oversight board, and we will continue to
support it,'' he said. But, he added, the SEC should not manage the
oversight board.
</P>
<P>
   Others saw the letter as an attempt by the accounting group to
stifle investigations into its member firms' conduct. After
Levitt's speech yesterday, Bowsher said: ``We intend to make sure
everyone understood the P.O.B. was not going to be intimidated and
was not going to be pushed around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiro of Pricewaterhouse said: ``Funding for the P.O.B.'s
special independence compliance reviews must be continued.
Thwarting special reviews is contrary to the profession's
interests.''

NO PROGRESS SEEN IN ETHIOPIA-ERITREA PEACE EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
  By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ A seven-member U.N. Security Council
delegation ended a weeklong trip to Africa unable to persuade the
leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia to stop preparing for war and to
return instead to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few days, the diplomats said, they expect to
begin discussing what steps the Security Council can take to put
more pressure on Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and
President Isais Afwerki of Eritrea to pull back from battle over a
disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassadors, from the United States, Britain, France, Mali,
Namibia, the Netherlands and Tunisia, left a series of meetings
with the Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders disappointed to varying
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the delegates cited lack of concern shown by the
countries' leaders, both former guerrillas, when asked to consider
the human consequences of a war that the diplomats unanimously call
``senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of these two has a sleepless night over this,'' an
ambassador said of Meles and Isais, who had in recent years been
held up as positive examples of a new generation of pragmatic
African politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders of separate nationalist rebel movements that fought
the Ethiopian government for three decades, they were once in
alliance. War broke out between them unexpectedly in 1998, years
after Meles had become prime minister of Ethiopia, and Isais had
successfully seceded to form the independent nation of Eritrea,
taking with him the only Red Sea port at Assab.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Asmara airport Wednesday, Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative at the United Nations and the
leader of the delegation, was asked whether Meles and Isais had
decided to go to war and whether any admonition from the Security
Council would make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say, with great reluctance and foreboding, that the
welfare of the peoples of this region does not receive the priority
that we think it should in the determination of this issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation's unusual field trip ended with questions still
hanging over agreements with several other African nations,
specifically those involved in the war in Congo, the former Zaire.
One agreement, with the President Laurent Kabila of Congo is to
open the way for the eventual stationing of U. N. peacekeeping
troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
   After the unraveling last week of a U.N. peacekeeping mission in
Sierra Leone, council members say that they are more determined
than ever to see that a mission to Congo is deployed carefully and
commanded effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The mission in Sierra Leone has been criticized as being below
strength and poorly commanded by an Indian general, Vijay Kumar
Jetley. The mission intended for Congo is smaller than that in
Sierra Leone, though Congo is many times larger.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council delegation, which began its trip on May 3
in Brussels, visited not only Congo, but also Zambia, where a Congo
peace accord was signed almost a year ago; Zimbabwe, which supports
Kabila with troops; and Rwanda and Uganda, two nations that once
supported Kabila but are now fighting him with their troops and
through rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   The envoys said that most of the leaders they met want to get
out of the Congo war.

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats rallied Wednesday around a
bill that would offer prescription drug benefits as a standard part
of the Medicare program, in contrast to the approach favored by
Republicans, who want to subsidize private insurance to help pay
such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen House and Senate Democrats joined in a display of
unity at the White House, where they said they had agreed on a
proposal to offer coverage of prescription drugs to all Medicare
beneficiaries _ 39 million people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal is similar to a plan offered by
President Clinton, but it is somewhat more generous to
beneficiaries and somewhat more expensive to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and members of Congress appeared in the White House Rose
Garden with Betty Dizik, a 73-year-old widow who said she skips
prescribed medications for diabetes and a heart condition because
she cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking for a handout or charity,'' Dizik said. ``I'm
willing to work and do my part. I'm just asking for a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal is embodied in a bill introduced
Wednesday by the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, with 32 of the 45 Democratic senators as co-sponsors. The
House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said he would
soon introduce a bill nearly identical to the Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
   In a Congress controlled by Republicans, the Democrats have no
chance of seeing their bills enacted. But they hope that by taking
a unified position, they can put pressure on the Republicans to
enter negotiations leading to the enactment of Medicare drug
benefits this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Vice President Al Gore and many
congressional Democrats have denounced the Republicans as slow to
act on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the president sounded more cooperative today. ``We all know
we can't achieve our efforts without bipartisan support in the
Congress,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``That's why, just as we are
trying to do with the patient's bill of rights, we want to reach
across the aisle to encourage Republican support, as well. This can
and should be a truly bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Democrats, like Clinton, say Medicare should
cover half of a person's drug expenses up to certain limits _ half
of the first $2,000 in drug expenses starting in 2002. The ceiling
would rise gradually. By 2009, Medicare would cover half of the
first $5,000 in drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some drugs cost much more than $5,000 a year. The congressional
Democrats would provide assistance for people with very high
expenses; Medicare would pick up all of their drug costs after they
spend $3,000 or $4,000 of their own money.
</P>
<P>
   (NEW MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said his bill ``dedicates $50 billion'' to insurance
covering such catastrophic expenses from 2003 to 2010. By contrast,
the president requested $35 billion for the years from 2006 to
2010.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the congressional Democrats would provide protection
against catastrophic drug costs for three more years, at an
additional cost of $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are developing their own proposals. The chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, William Roth, R-Del., is drafting
legislation but has not given any hint of the details. House
Republicans are fleshing out their proposal, under which the
government would subsidize private insurance to help pay drug costs
for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the administration are both scrutinizing drug
prices. Federal officials said they were investigating several drug
companies to see if they had overcharged Medicaid, Medicare or
other government programs by overstating their wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   The American unit of Bayer A.G., the German drug company, said
it had begun talks with the Justice Department in the hope of
reaching a settlement over drug prices that would avoid costly
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of concern about drug costs, Sen. James
Jeffords, R-Vt., introduced a bill that would make it easier for
Americans to import medications from Canada, where drug prices are
often much lower.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jeffords' bill, Americans could import a limited amount of
prescription drugs, perhaps a three-month supply, for personal use.
In addition, pharmacists and wholesalers could import certain
prescription drugs and pass the discounts on to American consumers.
Co-sponsors of the bill include Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan
Collins, both Republicans from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry opposes the bill, saying it could expose
Americans to adulterated or counterfeit drugs. But the bill
instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to regulate
imports to ensure that drugs are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and congressional Republicans generally say that
Medicare drug benefits should be enacted as part of a more
comprehensive effort to revamp Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator,
Wednesday commended the sponsors of one of the more ambitious
bipartisan proposals to redesign Medicare, Sens. John B. Breaux,
D-La., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn. Jennings said the latest efforts by
the senators were ``quite encouraging.''

JACK IS PUT THROUGH THE WRINGER, SO YOU WON'T BE

 By DANIEL SORID    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 15 years on the job, Jack has been trapped in coal mines
and forced to lift and carry objects that could break his back, and
once while pregnant _ yes, pregnant _ was stuffed into a car to see
if he could fit behind the wheel and reach the pedals.
</P>
<P>
   Jack never complains, however, because Jack is a piece of
software, a virtual reality representation of a person who can take
on various forms _ like a bulky man or a pregnant woman _ then
operate within various environments and sometimes in concert with
other virtual humans.
</P>
<P>
   Developed at the University of Pennsylvania beginning in 1984,
Jack has spent more than a decade in the service of industry and
government, showing car manufacturers whether their designs can
accommodate a person of a certain size, or construction companies
whether a particular task might leave employees injured and
unproductive. He has even helped the U.S. military train soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flesh and blood, Jack is made of computer code and
lives in a virtual world inside a video monitor. Jack _ named for
the child's toy, which resembles the axes of a three-dimensional
computer model _ can walk, avoid obstacles, reach and lift. But if
he cannot perform a certain task _ if an object is too heavy or out
of reach _ an image of the character will signal a problem,
sometimes by turning a body part a different color on a computer
screen. Jack rolls with the punches so that we don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   With a virtual reality helmet or a video screen, users of the
software can also see through Jack's eyes. In one instance, Jack
caused the John Deere tractor company to send a prototype back to
the drawing board after the company found that the design
obstructed Jack's view of the vehicle's blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went back and redesigned those parts of the tractor long
before it went into production and saved them an uncountable number
of dollars,'' said Prof. Norman Badler, director of the Center for
Human Modeling and Simulation at Penn. ``Once there's a production
line, you don't want to change the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many companies have developed human-looking digital
characters with limited capabilities, like the wide-eyed virtual
newscaster Ananova, several companies and universities have
developed ``intelligent'' virtual human beings that are programmed
to move and even respond like people.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual humans like Jack can be placed on a virtual battlefield,
in a simulated car interior or in any other environment that can be
created on a computer. The virtual human is then programmed to
perform a specific act _ like Jack reaching for the car's cigarette
lighter, which causes him to bump his head on the dashboard _ and
the results are displayed on Jack's image on a computer screen and
numerically on a printout. Designers can add realism to the
environment by importing graphics and special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of this type of software are trying to imitate the
complexity of real people as closely as possible. Recently, more
sophisticated virtual humans have been programmed with
psychological traits to study how people might react in an
emergency, like a chemical fire or a riot.
</P>
<P>
   In one situation, a crowd of protesters, waving fists and
holding banners, walks down a city street. Each protester is
programmed with a mood and a personality, which determine reactions
to different events, like a knife being pulled or police firing a
shot. Watching these reactions over the entire crowd would show
authorities how best to maintain safety in various situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate objective in creating realistic and believable
virtual actors is to build intelligent autonomous virtual humans
with adaptation, perception and memory,'' said Prof. Daniel
Thalmann, director of the Computer Graphics Lab at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology, in Lausanne. ``These actors should
be able to act freely and emotionally. Ideally, they should be
conscious and unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest virtual humans were developed in the 1960s. One of
their earliest applications was in testing an aircraft landing
procedure. In 1981 the U.S. government financed a project at the
University of Pennsylvania to develop a virtual human model for
engineering design studies. The software, a precursor to Jack,
demonstrated to NASA that the toilet system on the space shuttle
needed to be redesigned to accommodate larger astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, Jack had become more realistic. ``You don't make
the brain smarter, you make the rest of the body smarter, getting
it to walk properly, use its arms and legs to reach properly at
steering wheels, pedals and knobs, lifting things properly,''
Badler said. ``Within the last 10 years the main emphasis of what
we've done has been on telling the model what to do rather than
showing it in excruciating detail what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A more advanced Jack, for example, could be instructed through a
voice interface to take cover behind a vehicle, rather than have to
be programmed with the specific motions needed for that task. The
University of Pennsylvania's human modeling center, which still
uses the Jack software, is working on expanding Jack's ability to
respond to natural language commands.

   In 1996, Jack was sold to Transom Technologies, which was later
acquired by Engineering Animation, a company that specializes in
visual applications for engineering and manufacturing. Today the
company charges about $25,000 for the Jack software, according to
Ulrich Raschke, Engineering Animation's program manager for virtual
simulation. Developing a cast of characters, placing them in an
environment and assigning them tasks requires hours or days,
depending on complexity, Raschke said. The software, however, does
not require expensive computers and can run on a high-end PC.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have developed software similar to Jack. Boston
Dynamics specializes in virtual humans software for military and
law enforcement use. The software can train soldiers for ground
attacks, urban combat, biological warfare and medical emergencies.
In one application, the motions of a human soldier carrying a mock
weapon and running on a treadmill can be transferred to a virtual
counterpart running along a path, ready to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Training software that relies on virtual reality provides
several advantages over other training methods, including one
called branched video. A video with real actors plays on a screen
in front of a trainee who wields a gunlike device that is connected
to the video system. The actors in the video scene respond to the
actions of the trainee.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual systems provide real-time feedback to the participant
and are cheaper than branched video. And unlike branched video, in
which the number of scenes is limited, a virtual system can relay
specific responses to each of a participant's actions and thereby
introduce more variables into the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In a checkpoint monitoring system being developed for the Navy,
trainees will control Jack with voice commands during
computer-guided emergencies, like a terrorist threat. The
simulation can be run over and over, with different results each
time. ``If you want to train a soldier at a checkpoint, you would
rather they encounter the bad situation in simulation rather than
in real life,'' Badler said.
</P>
<P>
   Although single virtual actors can help train individuals, some
organizations are using virtual humans in groups to try to model
crowd psychology. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Matra
Systemes &AMP; Information of France and Britain's Scotland Yard are
working together on a system to simulate emergencies like a
chemical plant explosion or a riot. Individuals in the crowd are
programmed with personalities and moods, and react in different way
to the emergency. The system can help security agencies understand
how crowds react and how best to use police officers and other
emergency workers to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the members of these virtual crowds would interact the
way humans do. But crude graphics and the limits of artificial
intelligence have kept interactions fairly basic. ``Human
expressions are very, very complicated,'' said Barbara Rothbaum, an
associate professor of psychiatry at the Emory University School of
Medicine, who is working on a project to use virtual reality
simulations to treat phobias in patients. ``We might make a
distinction between a genuine smile, a sinister smile and a
not-so-genuine smile. You're not going to make those distinctions
as a virtual human.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, fairly complicated applications like crowd control are
useful even with the current state of the technology. ``Think about
cartoons,'' Rothbaum said, ``and how they relay a lot of
information in really fairly simple lines: the direction of the
eyebrows, the direction of the shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   While some systems can cost thousands of dollars, spending $50
at the video game store can give regular computer users a chance to
interact with their virtual counterparts. The Sims, a popular game
from Electronic Arts, has impressed the researchers with its
realistic human characters who interact with family and friends.
Badler is purchasing a copy for his lab, to try to link it with his
advanced systems.
</P>
<P>
   That home computer users can interact with believable virtual
humans on their PCs is a testament to how advances in computing
power might propel virtual humans into many more aspects of
production, training and entertainment. The next logical step might
be to find people modeling a whole range of actions _ traveling,
business, sleeping _ with virtual humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine going onto the Web with an avatar that looks
very much like yourself and going into chat rooms and basically
presenting yourself virtually on the Web and controlling
yourself,'' said Raschke of Engineering Animation. ``You can really
expand this out to the whole range of what humans are involved
with. Let your imagination go.''

BUSH PROPOSES TAX BREAKS TO COVER LONG-TERM CARE
</HEADLINE>
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush proposed a set of tax
breaks Wednesday to encourage more people to purchase long-term
care insurance and to ease the financial burden on people looking
after ailing relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, which anticipates the fast-growing number of
older Americans, people of any age who buy insurance for the kind
of extended nursing-home stays not covered by other policies or by
Medicare could fully deduct the annual premium from their taxes,
whether they itemize deductions or not.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, people with aging dependents at home could claim
an extra exemption, which would amount to a nonitemized deduction
of about $2,750.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many of our seniors, illness can be a path to financial
ruin, and this is one of the greatest fears of retirement and our
nation must address it as we head into the 21st century,'' Bush
told a group of about 80 at a nursing home here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cost can undermine the whole idea of security in
retirement,'' he added. ``It's time for many Americans to prepare _
prepare for peace-of-mind insurance. It must become a central part
of retirement planning in America.`
</P>
<P>
   The scope and expense of Bush's proposal was modest _ it would
cost $7.4 billion over five years _ and some critics said it would
make only the smallest of dents in a problem turning ever more
severe. But the plan represented Bush's attempt to demonstrate that
he was paying heed to health care and to senior citizens, an issue
and a voting block that could be decisive in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed to take the dynamics of the electorate into full
account with remarks that aimed for a kind of political trifecta,
singling out and offering reassurances not only to elderly
Americans but also to members of the baby-boom generation and to
women. His message to baby boomers was that their anticipatory
qualms about retirement were foremost in his mind, while his nod to
women voters was his recognition that they typically shoulder most
of the responsibility for older relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the elderly were arguably his most important audience,
because Vice President Al Gore has asserted that he has more
thoughtful and responsible ideas for both health care and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly trying to challenge that claim and intends to
follow Wednesday's proposals with a speech on Monday that will
outline his philosophy on changing Social Security and Medicare and
dealing with the high cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes of the presidential candidates' jostling over
these issues was suggested by the fact the Gore campaign arranged
for reporters to talk on the phone Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of
Health and Human Services Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala did not seem to be fully aware about what, exactly, Bush
was recommending, but she said that the plausibility of any and all
of his proposals was thrown into doubt by his call for a tax cut of
$483 billion over five years, which is much larger than the tax cut
Gore favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way, given the size of his tax cut, that he can pay
for this,'' she said of Bush. ``It's an empty promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said that the Texas governor's financial incentives for
the purchase of long-term care insurance do nothing to address the
flaws of many of the policies on the market and that the exemption
that Bush would grant home caregivers was nowhere near as generous
as the $3,000 tax credit that the Clinton administration has
proposed and that Gore supports. The exemption, for someone in the
15 percent tax bracket, would amount to only a few hundred dollars
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term care insurance, which fills a gap in what is provided
by private and corporate health care policies and Medicare, covers
the cost of an extended stay in a nursing home or assisted-living
center for people whose financial resources have not dwindled to
the point where they qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures provided by the Bush campaign, only about 5
percent of Americans now have such policies.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Bush said that a 39-year-old would pay an annual
premium of about $358 for a policy that guaranteed two years of
nursing-home care and $507 for a policy that guaranteed five years;
a 64-year-old would pay about $1,265 for the two-year guarantee and
$1,709 for the five-year one. The older a person is when he or she
buys the policy, the more it costs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of Americans over the age of 65 have annual
incomes under $20,000, and Joshua M. Wiener, a principal research
associate at the Urban Institute in Washington, noted that these
people would be unable to afford such a policy even after Bush's
deduction, which would shave only a few hundred dollars off the
price.
</P>
<P>
   `This is basically for the upper-middle-class elderly,'' he said
of Bush's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan also sets no income ceiling for eligibility,
so that wealthy Americans in higher tax brackets would actually
save more on the policies than middle-class Americans, because the
tax deduction would be more valuable for them.
</P>
<P>
   But an aide to Bush said that the governor's plan was not
intended primarily for these people, many of whom have jobs that
already offer long-term care as a benefit and would not qualify for
the deduction.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, citing figures for the looming rise in the number of
Americans over the age of 65, said it was important to put
mechanisms into place to encourage their financial security and to
decrease the number of them who will end up needing public money
and help.

COMMENTARY: DEFEND YOUR IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Stevens and his wife, Mary, have been ``going
through hell'' for three years, they testified to the House
subcommittee on social security this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always paid our bills on time and never defaulted on any
obligation,'' the retired Air Force officer, 72, told Congress, but
retirement plans were dashed ``when we discovered that our Social
Security numbers and names had been used to open 33 fraud accounts
with a total value of $113,000. Our credit had been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale of their three-year harassment by credit bureaus and
banks _ primarily because their Social Security numbers had been
stolen _ can be multiplied by thousands. This epidemic of
``identity theft'' is spread by the government's shameful
acquiescence in the use of the Social Security numbers (SSN) held
by 227 million Americans as a kind of national ID card.
</P>
<P>
   It was never so intended. The purpose of the number was to track
earnings so that the Social Security Administration would know who
was entitled to what benefits. But in the late 1930s, Hitler's
Gestapo was demanding that Germans ``show us your papers''; fears
of that totalitarian trend led Americans rightly to insist that the
new cards be clearly marked ``Not for Identification.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from businesses seeking quick credit checks and
bureaucrats who place efficiency above personal freedom, that
prevention of privacy abuse was erased. An unthinking federal
government allowed the citizen's SSN to become the Medicare number,
bandied about doctor's offices and drugstores and insurance
companies, even emblazoned on the envelopes of mailings.
</P>
<P>
   With the onset of e-commerce, pressure on people to reveal their
private Social Security numbers has increased tenfold. Travel
agents coerce it out of customers as hurried ``proof'' of identity.
Banks regularly deny loans to customers who are good credit risks
if they dare to refuse to hand over the number coveted by
practitioners of ``target marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number is not a person. A number, unlike a person, can
easily be kidnapped. When a number is stolen, or when an impostor
purchases your number from an ``information broker'' or the
``personal information industry''(euphemisms for e-snoops), your
life is not only an open book, but it can be made a Kafkaesque
hell, as the Stevenses testified.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that no law prevents anyone from buying or selling
your personal SSN without your consent? Or that discourages any
business from refusing to serve you unless you reveal the SSN that
the government professes ``may not be used for identification
purposes''?
</P>
<P>
   The piracy of our privacy, as well as the protection from the
theft of one's credit reputation, cries out for legislation. The
chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee holding these hearings,
Florida's Clay Shaw, says that no one proposal can stop this theft
of good names, ``but since Social Security numbers often represent
the entry point for ripoff artists and identity thieves, there's no
better place to start.'' The ranking Democrat, Bob Matsui, tells me
he agrees that ``something has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills to do something protective have been introduced by the
House's four horsemen of privacy: Jerry Kleczka, Jim McDermott, Ed
Markey and Ron Paul. In the Senate, Judd Gregg took note of an
Internet stalker's use of an SSN to find and murder a New Hampshire
woman, and put forward a bill to outlaw the sale of an SSN without
the individual's consent. The Social Security inspector general
testified that ``there is no reason'' to allow such trafficking in
private information.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see regular public exposure of businesses that
refuse services solely on the basis of a customer's refusal to
supply the SSN. And I'd close down the federal Parent Locator
Service; that was well intentioned to track down employees evading
child support obligations, but has become a national databank using
SSN's to monitor Americans' movements _ posing a danger to civil
liberty far greater than letting some dads be deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   To vote in Congress to protect the SSN from being used as a
national ID card, representatives must first flash their voting
cards. And what do you suppose appears right beneath their names on
those cards? Their Social Security numbers.

 &HT;    Boeing strike delays delivery to Delta
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Initial delivery of Delta Air Lines' newest model jetliner has
been delayed two months because of the recent engineers' strike at
Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based airline had been scheduled to get its first
767-400 from Boeing by the end of this month. Deliveries now are
expected to begin at the end of July, when two of the planes will
arrive, Delta spokesman John Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The 767-400 is a longer, ``stretched'' version of the 767, an
industry workhorse. Delta, the first airline to order the new
model, will use it mainly to replace aging L-1011s on high-volume
domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
   When 767-400s begin arriving, they'll make training runs for
several weeks. They'll start flying Florida and West Coast routes
this fall and fly to Hawaii by year's end, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries of other models, such as the Boeing 737-800 and 757,
also are being pushed back several weeks by the effects of the
38-day strike, which ended in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Delta will keep flying some of its oldest
L-1011s and 727s a few months longer than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need to hold on to some of these aircraft to fly our
planned schedule,'' Delta's senior vice president-flight
operations, Dave Bushy, said in an update to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, aircraft deliveries will be back on track in the
September-October time frame,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is taking delivery of new planes at a rate of about one a
week under a massive 1997 order that made Boeing its exclusive
supplier. The airline expects to take delivery of 60 over the next
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The 767-400, which Delta chose over the Airbus A330 as its new
domestic widebody, will carry about 287 passengers in a two-class
configuration, versus 252 for the 767-300 Delta now flies.
</P>
<P>
   It is 21 feet longer and has an extended wingspan, new landing
gear and upgraded cockpit instruments, as well as a remodeled cabin
interior based on the Boeing 777 cabin.

 &HT;    Investors feel the heat of Fed's inflation policy
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors can run _ as they did Wednesday _ but they can't hide
from the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has dawned on many investors that the Fed might not be near
the end of the tunnel on potential rate increases,'' said Atlanta
money manager Phillip M. Larkins of Legacy South.
</P>
<P>
   There now are expectations the Fed will raise short-term rates
by another 1 percentage point this year, which would take the prime
rate to 10 percent, what First Union economist Mark Vitner
considers a psychologically important level. The prime, a benchmark
for some business and consumer loans, hasn't been that high since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about how much higher interest rates will go apparently
contributed to Wednesday's slide in the stock market, while bond
prices rose as their appeal increased. Higher rates not only reduce
profits, but they make investors less willing to buy stocks trading
at high prices relative to earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, also hurt again by worries about the
outlook for Cisco Systems, lost 200 points and 5.6 percent. The Dow
Jones industrial average shed almost 170 points, or 1.6 percent.
Investors are not likely to feel any more at ease today, according
to Vitner. He expects the Commerce Department to report
stronger-than-expected retail sales for April. Most analysts are
looking for an increase of about 0.5 percent. Vitner said he
wouldn't be surprised to see a gain of 0.5 percent to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message will be the economy is still way too
strong for the Fed's liking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Better news, however, may come with Friday's Producer Price
Index and Tuesday's Consumer Price Index, due the same day the Fed
meets to consider what to do about interest rates. Economists
expect the producer index to show a decline for April because of
lower energy costs. Vitner anticipates the CPI will be unchanged or
down, while the number excluding energy and food will be up no more
than 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While that's likely to raise questions in some quarters about
how severely the Fed should tighten credit, Vitner said, it
probably won't slow the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fed would like to do a little more than people
think is needed and reinforce the credibility they have built up as
inflation fighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much is starting to be debated outside the Fed.
With the economy as strong as it is, Vitner thinks the Fed would
have time to correct any error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fed has greater risk in not doing enough,'' added
Larkins. ``There are many investors who were not in the market 10
years ago. They don't understand the devastation inflation can do
to the financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The above-average gains of the last five years in the stock
market were due to low inflation, he said. ``We don't want to go
back to a 4 to 6 percent inflation,'' Larkins suggested. With
inflation in that range, investors could probably expect annual
stock market returns ``probably in the single digits.''

CLINTON TRIES TO EXPEDITE AIDS DRUGS INTO AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wis.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in the face of strong opposition
from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, issued an executive order
Wednesday to make AIDS drugs available far more cheaply throughout
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The order declares that the U.S. government will not seek to
interfere with countries in that region that may violate U.S.
patent law in order to provide AIDS drugs at lower prices. The
language of the executive order is nearly identical to an amendment
that was deleted at the behest of the drug industry from an African
trade bill that Congress is considering this week.
</P>
<P>
   The order issued by Clinton essentially extended to most of
Africa a special arrangement provided last year to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``This order is intended to help stop the spread of this
devastating disease by making HIV/AIDS-related drugs and medical
technologies more accessible and affordable in sub-Saharan African
countries,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, on Wednesday. She said she believed it struck a
balance between fighting the disease and maintaining the integrity
of patents.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, officials said, that means that Washington will not
object if African countries move to greatly reduce the price of
AIDS drugs, either by licensing local companies to produce generic
versions or importing the drugs from third countries where they are
available at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   Both practices may be challenged under U.S. patent laws. But
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who had co-sponsored the amendment
that was deleted from the Africa trade bill, said the two practices
were ``fully consistent with World Trade Organization rules, which
allow countries flexibility in addressing public health concerns.''
Feinstein said that the deletion of the amendment she sponsored
with Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., threatened to impede the
fight against AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said that some 34 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have
been infected with the disease since its onset and nearly 12
million have died. ``The fatalities in sub-Saharan Africa represent
83 percent of the world's total HIV/AIDS-related deaths,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, the president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, the principal trade group for the drug
industry, said the executive order set a troubling precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Holmer said that he agreed there was a great need to vigorously
fight the disease and he welcomed the sections of the executive
order that call for increased education and improvement of public
health services. ``However, the approach taken by the president's
executive order sets an undesirable and inappropriate precedent by
adopting a discriminatory approach to intellectual property laws
and focusing exclusively on pharmaceuticals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said that they believed it was wrong to carve
out an exception for one disease and one region. ``If Africa today,
why not Asia tomorrow or even the United States,'' said one
official.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jacobs, the director of government affairs of AIDS Action,
a major lobbying group, Wednesday praised Clinton for his executive
order. ``The best medicines to fight AIDS are outrageously
expensive,'' he said. ``Almost nobody in the developing countries
can afford these therapies, yet that is where the epidemic is
raging. Americans can be proud of their president today.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise version of the trade bill was approved by the
House last week and is expected to win final passage in the Senate,
possibly Thursday. It gives African and Caribbean countries broad
new trading privileges by expanding duty-free access to U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott suggested to reporters on
Tuesday that he disapproved of any plan to substitute the dropped
Feinstein-Feingold amendment with an executive order.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a pattern now of him doing executive orders
that exceed what he should be doing,'' Lott said. ``That should be
done legislatively. He doesn't make the laws. And so I would hope
that he would be careful about doing that.''

UNTANGLING THE LEGAL MAZE BY SURFING THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<P>
   You have had a bad week. Your landlord raised the rent without
notice. You had an accident with your new car just after you drove
it out of the dealership. Your spouse is threatening divorce. In a
wave of desperation and self-pity, you make your way to the
computer and find yourself cruising the Net. Suddenly, hope appears
in the form of a site that may help you learn about all these
troublesome legal issues in your life.
</P>
<P>
   While most of us never face that many disasters at once, we all
encounter times when it would be good to know more about the law _
at least enough to know if it's time to hire a professional. But
with do-it-yourself sites sprouting up as quickly as you can say
``billable hours,'' it's hard to know where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently about a dozen legal Web sites aimed at
nonlawyers and scores more presenting legal resources in a less
consumer-friendly manner. Many of these sites are still in their
infancy, so content and design are improving constantly.
</P>
<P>
   They generally follow a basic model: a legal encyclopedia with a
summary of each area of the law, links for more information and a
lawyer locator, searchable by city and area of practice. As a
lawyer and a consumer, I have looked at several of them and picked
out a few of the most interesting and authoritative sites.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo.com (www.nolo.com) is the online incarnation of Nolo Press,
the scrappy California publishing company dedicated to empowering
the layperson through access to legal information. If you arrive
with a particular query, chances are you will find an answer. If
you can't, pose a question to Auntie Nolo, described as a
``plainspoken, mostly patient soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a legal solution to your problem,'' the site says,
``Auntie will provide it. If what you need is a cup of tea, not a
subpoena duces tecum, she'll tell you whether one lump or two is
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone is characteristic of Nolo.com, which is both
comprehensive and quirky. It is so lighthearted that it makes
learning about the law fun.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a legal encyclopedia, which is perfect for those
times you hear a word like ``estoppel'' on ``Ally McBeal'' and
don't know what it means. Even at its most offbeat, the site keeps
its eye on the practical. (The article ``The Opposite of Marrying a
Millionaire _ Marrying a Debtor,'' in Auntie Nolo's debt and credit
section, may come in handy if the spouse who wants a divorce also
has a bundle of bills.) If you had to choose one site to take to a
desert island, this would be the one _ if you still had any legal
issues once you got there.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer your information with a healthy dose of legal
news, law.com (www.law.com) is the place for you. It has the look
of a newspaper, which shouldn't come as a surprise since it has the
exclusive online rights to digital content from American Lawyer
Media, publisher of 22 legal newspapers and journals. Though
lawyers are the primary audience for law.com, consumers would be
wise to bookmark it to get links to the sites lawyers themselves
use for research. (For example, the site's extensive system of
links will lead you to Tenant.net, where you can review New York's
rent laws to see if your landlord's rent increase is legal).
</P>
<P>
   Interested in live advice? Try FreeAdvice.com
(www.freeadvice.com), where seven days a week (during specified
hours) you can have an online dialogue with a real live lawyer (or
in some instances, a real live recent law school graduate not yet
admitted to the bar). While it is reassuring to know that you are
communicating directly with someone, the answers are filled with
disclaimers and often give only a bit more information than the
site's summaries. If the chat leaves you unsatisfied, some of the
stock answers may meet your needs (in fact, the section Who Do I
Contact After an Auto Accident, under Accident Law, is the ideal
place to help you sort out your next steps in dealing with your
recent fender bender.)
</P>
<P>
   For a thorough introduction to the legal and judicial system and
top-notch advice for choosing, hiring and managing a lawyer
(including questions to ask during an interview), log on to FindLaw
(www.findlaw.com) and read through Courts and Legal Process and
Hiring a Lawyer, in the Consumer Center. The Small Business Center
is also worth a visit for its plain English guidance on everything
from business plans and finance to employment and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   If you know you need a lawyer but don't know where to find one,
look to lawyers.com (www.lawyers.com), the site of
Martindale-Hubbell, publisher of the leading print directory of law
firms and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   As befits its heritage, this site shines in the lawyer-search
area with impressive profiles of firms and practitioners worldwide.
Another strong feature is Ask a Lawyer, where you can pose a
question to one of the site's experts. There is no promise that
your question will be selected (timely, short queries with broad
appeal have the best shot) but even if you don't get an answer,
archived questions like ``Will my used car be covered by the lemon
law?'' make for interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   Also worthwhile for lawyer searching is Lawoffice.com
(www.lawoffice.com), the site of the veteran legal publisher West
Group. With a directory of more than one million legal
professionals, the site's listings are loaded with lawyers'
biographies, published works, representative cases and links to
firms' Web sites and e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   For a distraction from your legal problems, drop in on
TheLAW.com's Strange but True, filled with legal trivia like the
Louisiana law making it illegal to shoot a bank teller with a water
pistol after robbing a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Koch, the former New York City mayor, is a co-founder of the
site; clicking on Ed Koch's Chambers on the home page takes you to
his introduction to the site, where he invites users to send him
e-mail ``to tell me: How'm I doing?'' TheLAW.com offers celebrity
profiles, television and film reviews and an online courtroom. On
the serious side, the site has support groups and live chats with
social workers for those dealing with emotional issues like
adoption and employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   One legal task we all inevitably face is the drafting of a will.
To see how ordinary people and celebrities from Benjamin Franklin
to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis handled theirs, find your way to
Wills on the Web (www.ca-probate.com/wills.htm), which displays
real wills from 1493 to the present. When you are ready to tackle
your own will, EstatePlanningLinks.com
(www.estateplanninglinks.com) answers everything from ``Why Have a
Will?'' to ``What to bring to your first meeting with an estate
planning attorney'' and has links to numerous self-help resources.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you are dissatisfied with Cliff Notes versions of
the law offered at some of the consumer sites, visit the Cornell
Law School's Legal Information Institute (www.law.cornell.edu),
probably the most expansive legal reference tool online. Useful
features include ``Law About ...'' (with links to every legal topic
imaginable), constitutions and codes, court opinions, law by source
or jurisdiction, and the American Legal Ethics Library (it's longer
than you think). The site is popular with lawyers and is equally
accessible to nonlawyers who would rather read statutes and
judicial opinions than simplified summaries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Used properly, legal Web sites can enhance your understanding of
the law and from time to time may even convince you that a legal
issue isn't worth pursuing with a lawyer. When you do need a
lawyer, spending some time at one or more of these sites can help
you choose the right one, manage that person properly and know the
basics about the subject you are discussing.
</P>
<P>
   As to the rules governing online legal advice, there are no laws
that apply specifically to Web sites. The problems that might arise
for lawyers have to do primarily with advertising. If a site is
deemed to be advertising (as opposed to the publishing of free
information), the lawyers involved would be subject to laws
governing false advertising as well as bar association ethics
restrictions on advertising by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In the borderless land of the Web, lawyers could find themselves
in tangles with their bar associations about such things as whether
postings on lawyer referral services constitute advertising in a
state where a lawyer is not admitted to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   Even more delicate is the question of whether lawyers involved
with sites are engaging in the unauthorized practice of law by
offering online advice that is available in states where they are
not admitted to the bar. Though lawyers rely on lengthy
disclaimers, for now this is unchartered territory that is certain
to provide legal ethicists and the courts with ample fodder for a
new breed of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if online advice is deemed to be the practice of law
(an open question and one that all the disclaimers on the sites are
trying to rule out), a lawyer could commit malpractice by giving
advice that turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For the person using the Web sites, reliance on online legal
advice has its dangers. These sites are not substitutes for
lawyers, and they are only as good as the information they contain
_ which could be out of date, oversimplified or just plain wrong.
If you get bad advice, you don't have a bar association available
to handle your complaint, as you would if you had been dealing with
a real lawyer. Above all, keep in mind that in the world of free
counsel, you may just get what you pay for.

 &HT;    Zoo hosts Ford brass
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co.'s Hapeville plant could build about 50,000 more
cars annually when the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable get makeovers
in a few years, said an industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are Ford executives won't talk about plans for its
Atlanta-area plant when the Dearborn, Mich.-based company holds its
annual meeting today at Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk at all about future product,'' said Ford
spokeswoman Della DiPietro, who arrived in Atlanta on Wednesday for
the annual meeting, expected to attract about 500 shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Ford shareholders are expected to re-elect the
company's 13 directors, appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its
accountant and vote on five shareholder proposals that Ford
management said it opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Two shareholder proposals _ one calling for employee directors
and another calling for independent directors on key committees _
appeared at Ford's 1999 annual meeting as well and garnered about 4
percent of shareholders' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is holding its annual meeting in Atlanta this year, company
officials said, because the automaker alternates each year between
locales near its Detroit-area headquarters and cities where it has
assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's plans for the Hapeville plant are ``certainly not
something that the company is ready to talk about,'' said Alan
Baum, an analyst with IRN, an automotive research company in Grand
Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Both Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes and Illinois Gov. George Ryan have
reportedly lobbied Ford in recent months in a competition for new
or expanded auto plants in Chicago and Hapeville _ where Ford now
builds the Taurus and Sable _ to build a new line of sport-utility
vehicles or to consolidate Taurus and Sable production
</P>
<P>
   Based on contacts with Ford's suppliers, Baum said he expects
Ford to consolidate its Taurus production in Hapeville with its
2004 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Baum said he also expects Ford's Chicago plant to produce a
``tall wagon kind of thing'' for its Mercury division to replace
the Sable. Both vehicles will be based on Volvo's ``P2'' chassis to
save costs, he said. Ford bought Volvo's car operations last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of suppliers working on this program''
already, he said. ``Three years is not a long time for this sort of
development.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clayton County Chamber of Commerce official said in December
that a Ford expansion in Hapeville could mean 700 new jobs and $100
million in new investments.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting all Taurus production to the Hapeville plant would mean
Ford will probably have to expand the plant somewhat and cut its
Taurus fleet sales to taxi, rental and corporate customers, said
Baum.
</P>
<P>
   He projected the plant's production will jump from
240,000-250,000 units annually to 290,000. ``I think there would
probably be some brick and mortar'' expansion, he said, but ``not
many'' more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But J.C. Phillips, president of United Auto Workers Local 882 at
the 2,500-employee Hapeville plant, said 500-1,000 new jobs would
probably result from such an expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a product that will sell well, and we are
hoping to get the Taurus and Sable as long at it is made. It's a
good seller,'' he said. ``If we don't get this expansion, we'll get
a new vehicle,'' he added, but that might be the less desirable
outcome because the new vehicle might flop at dealerships.

   RWANDA: BISHOP FACES EXECUTION
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Augustin Misago, on trial on genocide charges, received a
telegram from Pope John Paul II, who said he prayed for him to be
freed soon. Prosecutors asked the death penalty for the bishop, who
is accused of helping to plan the 1994 genocide in which about
800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu died. The church has been
criticized by survivors and rights groups for its silence during
the killings. Bishop Misago, 56, says he is the victim of a
political campaign against the church. A verdict is expected next
week.

   A report by Parliament accused several prominent people, many
with close ties to President Daniel arap Moi, of corruption that
cost the nation hundreds of millions of dollars. Among them were
George Saitoti, whom Moi hand-picked as vice president, and
Nicholas Biwott, a presidential aide. The report also recommended
that Moi's son Philip be investigated for possibly evading taxes on
imported luxury cars. Moi was not named in the report.

   Tens of thousands of workers joined a one-day nationwide strike

   The government passed an emergency decree to eliminate dead or

would weaken the chances of reaching the 51 percent quorum
necessary for a deeply contested referendum set for May 21. But the
decree needs approval from both houses of Parliament within 60
days. Many members oppose the vote, which among other things seeks
to reform electoral laws at the expense of small parties. If either
house fails to support the decree, it would nullify the referendum,
regardless of its results.

FTC ANNOUNCES SETTLEMENT OF ANTITRUST CASE AGAINST 5 RECORD
COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement
of an antitrust case against the nation's five largest music
companies on Wednesday that the commission said should result in
significant price cuts for compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement completed a two-year investigation of the
companies that officials said had uncovered illegal marketing
agreements that the music companies had used to end a price war and
inflate the prices of compact discs. Agency officials estimated
that consumers had been overcharged by about $500 million over the
last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,
said the settlement would enable retailers to once again advertise
deep discounts. He estimated that the savings to consumers could be
as high as $17 million a month, or roughly $2 to $5 on many popular
discs.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said he had based the estimates on the heavy
discounting and price wars that took place before the music
producers wrote the marketing agreements in the mid-1990s, sharply
restricting the ability of retailers to advertise discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing agreements that the FTC said violated federal
antitrust law were between many large and small retailers and the
five music companies, which control 85 percent of the $15 billion
CD market. The companies that settled the case were Time Warner,
which earlier this year announced it had reached an agreement with
the FTC; the Sony Corporation of America; Bertelsmann Music Group;
EMI Music Distribution, and Universal Music and Video Distribution.
All of the companies have denied that the marketing agreements
violated the law, and many of them declined to discuss the FTC's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the agreements, known as ``minimum advertised
price'' programs, or MAP, were implemented in an effort by the
manufacturers to end a price war earlier in the 1990s by such
discounters as Circuit City, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements between the music companies and the retailers
forbade music retailers from advertising discounts on CD's in
newspapers, on television, or even on posters in the stores
themselves. In exchange for those commitments, the music companies
agreed to pay some or all of the advertising costs for the CD's.
</P>
<P>
   After initial agreements failed to curtail the price war,
Pitofsky said, the producers toughened them so that they prohibited
retailers from advertising discount prices even in ads that the
retailers paid for. Pitofsky said the agency had discovered a
memorandum sent by one industry executive describing the more
restrictive program as ``MAP with teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that in the few instances where the
retailers violated the agreements and advertised discounts, the
manufacturers would temporarily stop making promotional payments,
costing the retailers hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was industry-wide vertical price-fixing,'' Pitofsky said
at a news conference, adding that the case was a classic
illustration of the differences in antitrust enforcement between
the Clinton administration and the 1980s, when officials in the
Reagan administration had a different view of antitrust law.
``During the 1980s, retail price maintenance agreements were not
challenged once.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing one of the companies said that the
government had not presented a fair or complete picture of the
marketing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that many
specialty music stores had wanted the marketing agreements because
they stopped discount stores from undercutting them by using CD's
as a loss leader to attract customers. According to industry
analysts, many music stores were driven into bankruptcy because of
the earlier competition on CD prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specialty stores were being very badly hurt,'' the lawyer
said. ``These agreements were intended to assist those specialty
stores maintain a wide selection of offerings, and as such, they
were actually very pro-consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that the companies had decided to settle the
case because the marketing agreements were becoming outdated since
they were not applicable to sales of CD's on the Internet, where CD
sales have been growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives from the music companies said their profit
margins were the same regardless of the wholesale prices charged by
the retailers and therefore they would not have gained any money by
curtailing discounting. But government officials disputed that
contention, saying that the manufacturers stood to gain
substantially from helping the specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   The consent order settling the investigation was approved on
Wednesday by a 5-0 vote of the commission. The order prohibits the
five companies from linking any future financing of advertising
with pricing of CD's for a period of seven years. For 13 years
after that, the companies would be prohibited from imposing pricing
conditions in advertisements that are purchased by the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that, although they had concluded that
the agreements were unreasonable restraints of trade in violation
of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, they had decided
not to seek fines. A variety of private lawsuits have been filed
seeking financial penalties against the five music companies.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the investigation into the marketing
agreements has had no bearing on the agency's review of a variety
of industry-related mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said that Time Warner and EMI nonetheless felt
compelled to settle the case at this time because of two deals that
are before the FTC. The agency is considering whether to approve
Time Warner's merger with America Online. And Warner has announced
its intention to merge its music division with that of rival EMI.

CHINA SAYS U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM COULD ACCELERATE ARMS RACE
 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's chief arms negotiator said Wednesday that the
U.S. proposal to build an anti-missile defensive shield posed an
unacceptable threat to China's security and could force it to
significantly expand its own nuclear forces in response.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese find it hard to believe U.S. claims that the
proposed ``national missile defense'' is only intended to counter
threats from small rogue states like North Korea, the official, Sha
Zukang, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the intention, he said, the systems under
discussion would destroy China's ability to deter nuclear attack by
neutralizing its relatively small force of nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your system would be good enough to neutralize whatever
offensive capacity we now have,'' Sha said, leaving China
dangerously vulnerable to bullying or attack. If that appears
likely, he added, ``We will not sit on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we base our own national security on your assurances
of good will?'' asked Sha, director-general of arms control in the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Sha said a ``balance of terror'' had kept nuclear peace for
decades and remained the only realistic course until such weapons
are phased out. The U.S. missile defense proposal, he said, would
spark a new global arms race and possibly what he called a
``nightmare scenario'' of weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the feasibility of a missile defense shield is not yet
proved, President Clinton is under pressure to decide soon whether
to embark on a crash program costing tens of billions of dollars to
develop and deploy a system of sensors, missiles and futuristic
weapons that could destroy a small number of incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has been vehemently opposed by Russia, which like
China fears the system would blunt its power and, like China, wants
to avoid a costly arms race. In the debate in Washington, the
Russian objections have received far greater attention than those
from China, in part because deploying the defensive system would
violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed by the United
States and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried to persuade Russia to
accept changes in the treaty that would permit a limited missile
defense even as the two countries negotiate deeper, money-saving
cuts in their huge nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have also sought to convince Russian military
planners that the contemplated defensive system, while adequate to
stop a few missiles from countries like Iraq or North Korea, could
quickly be overwhelmed by Russia's missile forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans cannot make that argument convincingly to
China. Since China developed nuclear weapons in the 1960s, it has
avoided trying to match U.S. and Soviet arsenals, instead keeping a
small fleet of missiles as a minimal deterrent, able to retaliate
in the event of attack. Western experts believe that at present
China has no more than about two dozen land-based missiles, with
one warhead each, capable of reaching the continental United
States, compared with the thousands of warheads the United States
could deliver by land- or sea-based missiles or bombers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not said how, in the event the missile
defense plan goes ahead, they will deal with Beijing's objections
or any major changes in its nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence agencies say that China is already
developing newer, mobile ballistic missiles and improved warheads,
but that they do not know whether it already has plans for a major
expansion of forces.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Wednesday at the Foreign Ministry, Sha gave the
most detailed public description yet of China's possible responses
to the proposed missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to do something'' if the plan proceeds, he said.
The options, he said, include a significant increase in the number
of nuclear warheads that China would field, improvements in the
accuracy and other traits of warheads and the development of
methods to destroy or frustrate the antimissile shield.
</P>
<P>
   He said that China and Russia were discussing possible
cooperation in developing techniques ``to restore strategic
stability,'' including methods ``to defeat your system,'' but he
declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``To defeat your defenses we'll have to spend a lot of money,
and we don't want to do this,'' Sha said, describing China's
greater priority as economic development. ``But otherwise, the
United States will feel it can attack anyone at any time, and that
isn't tolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   China's equally fervent opposition to U.S. and Japanese research
on a ``theater missile defense'' for East Asia, which China fears
might be extended to protect Taiwan, the island it views as a
breakaway province, has received considerable attention among
Western military experts.
</P>
<P>
   Less widely understood, Sha said, is that an advanced missile
defense in Asia would also serve as a forward line for the
continental defensive shield. Putting long-range radars and other
advanced devices in East Asia would give the United States the
ability to detect and destroy Russian or Chinese missiles as they
were launched, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this theater missile defense could be even more dangerous
for Russia and China than the national missile defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sha described U.S. fears of nuclear attack from countries like
North Korea or Iraq as ``ridiculous.'' He said that China estimates
that it will be at least 15 years before North Korea can develop a
missile able to reach the United States. He said that North Korea
has no nuclear weapons and that strong diplomatic efforts can keep
it that way, and that in any case North Korea would never launch an
attack while it faces the certainty of massive retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is a huge super-power and you're afraid of little
North Korea?'' he said. ``Is it convincing?'' What is more
plausible , he said, is that ``American strategic thinkers may have
China in mind'' as they promote the missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you'll give this up,'' Sha said of the antimissile
proposals. ``If not, we'll be ready.''

 &HT;    Offer goes to coach of NCAA champion
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hawks have offered their head coaching position to Tom Izzo
of NCAA champion Michigan State and expect a decision before the
end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo, 45, received an offer thought to be worth more than $15
million over five years to replace Lenny Wilkens, who resigned
April 24 after seven years as Hawks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Hawks general
manager Pete Babcock said the team would not comment ``on any phase
of our coaching search.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have, however, backed away from Isiah Thomas, who has
been informed of the offer to Izzo. Thomas is now interviewing with
another team, possibly the New Jersey Nets, who might be willing to
make him head coach and director of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo is thought to be considering the offer after getting his
third raise in as many years from Michigan State, where his new
deal is estimated to be as much as $1.1 million a year. Taking the
Hawks job make Izzo the second college coach _ former Kansas coach
Larry Brown is the other _ to win an NCAA title and leave the next
season for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo led Michigan State to a 32-7 record and the school's first
national title in 21 years last season and compiled a 120-48 record
in five seasons as head coach. And it's his loyalty to Michigan
State, where he has worked as an assistant and head coach since
1983, and the fact that all but three players return from the
national championship team that could make the decision to leave
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   If he accepted the job, however, he would inherit a team with a
young talent base - next season's team could have as many as seven
players 24 or younger - and a lottery pick in next month's NBA
draft. The fact that the Hawks have a youthful roster led team
management to search the college ranks for a replacement for
Wilkens, but several college coaches who have made the leap to the
NBA in recent years have not had much success.
</P>
<P>
   Former UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian lasted 20 games before being
fired in San Antonio, ex-Massachusetts coach John Calipari was
72-112 in New Jersey before he was terminated, Rick Pitino is only
90-124 since leaving Kentucky to become president and coach of the
Boston Celtics and Tim Floyd is 30-102 in two seasons with the
Chicago Bulls after leaving Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock, however, has been intrigued with college coaches. He
talked to Pitino in 1993 before hiring Lenny Wilkens. And in his
search for Wilkens' replacement he said he is looking for a
teacher, ``someone who enjoys working with young players, in
bringing them along.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo apparently fits that description. His teams are tenacious
defenders, remarkably adaptable at a level where players are asked
to fit a system rather than having a system developed for the
talent on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Izzo, senior guard Mateen Cleaves said recently,
``A guy like myself, I fell in love with him. You could tell he was
a very hard worker and he really meant what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, injured much of last season, and swing man Morris
Peterson were the stars of the Michigan State's championship drive
and are projected as first-round picks in the June NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo is a native of Iron Mountain, Michigan, a high school
teammate and at Northern Michigan a roommate of four years with San
Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci, who is his closest friend.
``We went through everything together,'' Mariucci has said. ``The
good times, the bad times. We know each other's secrets.''

<P>
   Susan MacTavish Best, a Webmaster in San Francisco, had a
routine for paying her bills. She let them collect in piles, then
dealt with them when the spirit moved her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am incredibly unorganized and always pay my bills late,''
MacTavish Best said. But she knew that she could not indulge her
penchant for disorganization and procrastination during a
three-month trek to India that began last September.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard a radio advertisement promoting a bill
aggregater, a term that is coming into use to describe services
that receive customers' bills, display them online for their
customers to view and pay them from the customers' bank, savings or
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   MacTavish Best used the advertised service, Paytrust, while she
was away and continues to use it now, receiving an e-mail message
when each bill comes in. She can look at any bill online, but she
has told the service to pay some of them whether she looks at them
or not, provided they are below a figure she has set for each.
Other bills she reviews, then pays according to her old routine:
when the spirit moves her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send reminders, `Bill due in three days,' `Bill due in
two days,' `Bill due today,''' MacTavish Best said. ``Then _ I am
so lazy _ I figure I'd better take care of it. I hit the link, and
it's paid.'' Despite toying with fate, she said, she has not
incurred a late fee since joining.
</P>
<P>
   Bill-paying services are a step toward the day when everyone
will receive and pay all their bills electronically. That day once
seemed a long way off, when the concept of electronic billing was
caught in a kind of economic Catch 22. Companies did not offer it
because they did not see customers lining up to sign on. Customers
did not sign on because there were no services offered. While
online banks and other Web-based services developed to offer bill
payments, most just write and mail checks in response to a
customer's request that a payment be sent to a particular place.
Few actually receive the bills for the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Aggregaters are taking the risk to develop the market. Firms
like Paytrust (www.paytrust.com), PayMyBills (www.paymybills.com)
and Cyberbills (www.statusfactory.com) arrange to receive a
client's bills, which they scan so clients can see them on the Web.
They then organize the bills and pay them as directed. The
companies charge users a monthly fee that ranges from $3.95 to
$29.95, depending upon the number of bills paid.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the fees, the companies are not yet making money.
Handling people's bills is expensive; an army of employees opens
envelopes by hand, puts the bills on a scanner and converts them
into digital images. The companies are calculating that if they can
deliver the customers, more merchants will automate the way they
send out bills and collect payments, and the cost to provide the
service will come down.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility is enticing enough that online financial
service providers like Quicken and portals like AOL say they plan
to offer bill aggregation before the end of the summer. Others,
like Spectrum EBP, a joint venture of Chase Manhattan, First Union
and Wells Fargo, are working to develop a closely related service
called bill presentment. In bill aggregation, paper bills are
mailed to agencies; in bill presentment, everything, even incoming
bills, is handled electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Bill services' customers, like MacTavish Best, can pay any bill
at any time from anywhere. ``I was in Delhi, and I couldn't
remember my password,'' MacTavish Best said, ``so I sent an e-mail
and got an immediate response. I was sitting there in the cafe and
we were e-mailing back and forth, having a conversation. There is a
12-hour difference so I was thinking, `It's like 4 in the
morning.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bill-paying services do have their critics. Because the services
need access to users' bank accounts, banks have raised privacy
concerns. Union Trust once filed suit against an aggregater,
Paytrust, to keep it from asking bank clients to share their online
identification and passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have an unscrupulous employee, they could execute a
trade, move your money, they could wipe you out,'' said Kellie
Scott, senior vice president and director of eChannels, the
e-commerce division of Union Trust. The suit was dropped, and now
many banks and aggregators are working together to establish safe
procedures for sharing information.
</P>
<P>
   As with any new technology service, there are glitches. When a
San Francisco public relations firm, pr(at)paiz.com, failed to put
the proper code on a bill a client wanted to pay through
PayMyBills, the firm never received the money. ``We called over
there, and the bill was just sitting there,'' said Damon Paiz, a
part-owner of the agency. ``They didn't try to call us to say our
bill was just sitting there. It was just very unprofessional.''
Since then, Paiz said, there have been no problems. A PayMyBills
spokesman said the company had added a research team to handle
payments for bills with incorrect codes.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are not completely seamless for consumers. There are
only about 30 companies _ most of them utilities and phone
companies _ that accept electronic payments, so to pay any other
bill, the user must authorize the aggregater to make the payment at
least five days in advance to give it time to go through the mail.

SIERRA LEONE STRESSING UN ROLE, US POLICY IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY AND JOE LAURIA AND  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crisis in Sierra Leone is testing the
credibility of United Nations peacekeeping operations as well as
the Clinton administration's oft-expressed desire to more actively
help African nations, officials and analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, angry at the lack of help from
Western countries, said it was time for the more powerful nations
to assist the embattled UN force and help bring to safety 500 UN
peacekeepers held hostage in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped that some of those with the capacity would go to
the assistance of those who are in there doing the bidding of the
Security Council and the UN,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   But several US officials said Wednesday that the Clinton
administration would not budge from offering only logistical and
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   British officials also said they would not provide combat
troops, although 800 paratroopers who have arrived in Sierra Leone
have provided some assistance to UN troops as they help evacuate
British citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the British troops were ``helpful,'' adding, ``at
least they have moved, they have done something, even though the
initial objective was to evacuate British and other nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   UN senior officials had low expectations that the United States
would risk the lives of American troops in Sierra Leone, based on
the 1993 peacekeeping fiasco in Somalia that resulted in the deaths
of 18 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Clinton administration putting much greater
emphasis on Africa in the past two years _ President Clinton cited
what he saw as an ``African renaissance,'' several special envoys
have been shuttling to defuse conflicts and a new $260 million
effort has begun to fight the devastating spread of AIDS _ Annan
and other UN officials had expected a more invigorated US response
to the Sierra Leone crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to see some of the governments with
capacity, with good armies and well-trained soldiers, to
participate,'' Annan said. ``But they are not running to forward to
contribute to this force. We have to take the forces we get.''
</P>
<P>
   But US officials said Wednesday that they did not want to risk
the lives of troops in an area of the world where America has few
national security interests. While intervention on humanitarian,
moral and ethical grounds could be argued, those officials said,
national security interests overrode all other considerations.
Wednesday, UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke wrapped up an
unsuccessful attempt to quell tensions in two other African
hotspots: Congo and along the Ethiopia-Eritrea border.
</P>
<P>
   Of Sierra Leone, one US senior official said on condition of
anonymity: ``We want to make sure this stays a UN challenge and not
a US national challenge. We will be supportive diplomatically and
help airlift other troops, but we have to be very sensitive to what
we are already doing in Bosnia and Kosovo and not overstretch
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraging allies to help, especially allies who used
to colonial masters in these places, like the British,'' the US
official said.
</P>
<P>
   British troops had begun ferrying UN peacekeepers to dug-in
positions at the entrances to the capital of Freetown, ``where they
are anticipating the worst,'' said UN spokesman Fred Eckhard.
Rebels were advancing toward the capital as night fell.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general still holds some hope that the British
troops will remain after the evacuations of British and European
nationals are completed. ``They are saying they will leave after
the evacuation is over, but let's see,'' said a UN official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A British official in New York acknowledged that his country is
sensitive to the appearance of soldiers leaving while Freetown was
under attack. ``People in London do fully understand the importance
of signals which is why they are deliberately leaving that question
open,'' said the diplomat. ``No one is saying, coming next weekend
we are all out, fend for yourselves boys.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, additional reinforcements may not arrive until
late this month. UN officials are trying to get 3,000 additional UN
peacekeepers from Bangladesh, Jordan and India to Sierra Leone, but
the earliest possible arrival is May 21 and could be much later, a
UN official said.
</P>
<P>
   And regional West African defense ministers will meet on May 17
to decide whether to send a force of 1,600 Nigerian combat troops.
But Annan does not believe that force would be able to defend the
capital from rebel forces because of its lack of experience and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict worsens, more questions have arisen on the
future of UN peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   David Welsh, a senior State Department official, told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday the Sierra Leone disaster has
shaken the confidence of such UN missions. He believed it would
cause ``more introspection about what these missions are designed
to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The UN's credibility is right on the line now,'' said Carol J.
Lancaster, a Georgetown University professor and former Clinton
administration official. ``This whole incident in Sierra Leone
makes the UN look not just powerless but a victim as well.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Clinton administration's decision not to become
more involved in the crisis shows there are ``limits to their
interests in Africa, an unwillingness to apply a rhetorical policy
of greater engagement to situations involving conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   A second UN official, also asking not to be identified, said
that the blame should not rest with his organization, but rather on
member states that are unwilling to fund peacekeeping operations.
He said the Sierra Leone operation, for instance, was only at 8,000
troops instead a planned 11,000 because of a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said that the UN force had made much progress
until the rebel offensive. ``We managed to get UN troops in every
part of Sierra Leone except the heartland of the diamond mining
area in eastern Sierra Leone, which is controlled by rebel
elements. When they saw that, and they new disarmament camps coming
and soldiers turning in their weapons, they decided to try to
derail the whole process,'' he said.

 UNDATED: the mail.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And although banks and bill-paying services are working on ways
to share information, few arrangements have been set up. Most
people who use an aggregater's services still have to visit their
banks' Web sites if they want to check their balances before they
approve a payment. ``I can't check my balances real time,'' said
Brad Winney, who banks with Citibank and pays bills through
Paytrust. ``I have to go to my banking application.'' Winney said
he was satisfied over all because he estimated that the service was
saving him more than $1,000 in late fees each year.
</P>
<P>
   Aggregaters and banks say they are trying to make it easier for
people to use bill-paying services. ``This is taking off faster
than anyone expected,'' said Scott, of Union Trust. ``I think it
will all be pretty seamless by the end of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing up with a service is fairly simple and takes about an
hour overall. Most require a user to fill out an online form with
information like the billing address, the bank account number and a
password. Most then send a package in the mail with a form to sign
that will allow the aggregater to take money from an account at a
bank, savings and loan or brokerage. Most services allow multiple
accounts, and payments can be drawn from any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Paytrust has an accelerated sign-up system that lets users
download a permission form and fax it back. In a test, the form was
processed and the account activated online in about four hours.
Users can determine which bills are to be paid through the site.
The companies say they have a similar automated system to change
the address back if a client wants to go back to receiving bills at
home.
</P>
<P>
   To save the user keystrokes, sites have compiled lists with the
addresses and payment information for many banks and savings and
loans, credit card companies and insurance and mortgage companies;
those names can be added to a consumer's list with a few mouse
clicks.
</P>
<P>
   Paytrust notifies the companies sending bills that they should
send them directly to the site. Some sites require users to mail
change-of-address notices to billers, using stickers and envelopes
included in the sign-up packages, to tell them to send bills to the
aggregaters.
</P>
<P>
   The sites let users set up rules for paying each bill. For
instance, a user can tell the site to pay the phone bill
automatically on the 25th of each month if the amount due is less
than $100. If it is more, the system will alert the user, who will
then manually authorize a payment.
</P>
<P>
   Check writing is not limited to financial companies. People can
have checks sent to anyone by typing in the relevant information,
just as they would for online banking. ``That lets us be the 100
percent solution for your monthly bills,'' said Tom Lazaroff,
marketing director for PayMyBills.com. ``You can pay your gardener,
your dry cleaner, or send a check to Aunt Sally in Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   When a bill arrives, the user gets an e-mail notice. Reminders
are sent by e-mail for unpaid bills that nearing their due date. A
confirmation is sent by e-mail when a payment has been made. Check
information can be exported from the Web site into financial
management programs like Quicken and Microsoft Money, as well as
directly to spread sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The sites also archive payment information. Most said they would
keep two years' worth of records on hand. And at the end of each
year, the sites offer to sell clients their records on a CD. The
CDs have scans of all the bills, a summary of billing categories
and in some cases, feature a rudimentary ability to search for
specific bills or information. The CDs are usually priced at $15 to
$30.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are sometimes a little quirky. The Paytrust site could
not find an address for USAA Savings Bank, with USAA capitalized,
but it found the name when it was lowercased. Also, the site would
not allow two transactions in which the same amount was to go to
the same biller on the same day so a user could not make two car
payments with separate checks in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The services are popular with technophile ``early adopters,''
but they are still far from ubiquitous. Paytrust, which says it is
the largest of the aggregators, said it had 30,000 active members.
PayMyBills and Status Factory declined to cite customer numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential customers may be concerned about security. ``I
was leery of Paytrust because you have to send to the bank letting
Paytrust take out money,'' Winney said. To calm those qualms,
Paytrust and PayMyBills are both insured by the Travellers
Insurance Group Safeweb program, which protects users against
unauthorized transactions up to $100,000. Status Factory, the
retail Web site of CyberBills, promises to refund twice the amount
of any loss to any customer using a 128-bit encrypted Web browser,
like recent versions of Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's
Internet Explorer. The sites will also take care of any bills, and
any late fees, that are not paid on time because of their errors.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the sites offer one attractive and unadvertised
bonus: they handle those advertisements that are sent along with
your bills. ``They are shredded,'' Lazaroff said, ``and you don't
have to look at junk mail.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Users like to say that bill aggregation services cost less than
the stamps they used to mail out payments each month. That is not
quite true _ but it is close. Here is what some services charge:
</P>
<P>
   PAYTRUST: www.PayTrust.com
</P>
<P>
   Users can get started within hours. The cost is $8.95 a month
for 25 transactions, 50 cents for each additional transaction, and
an optional $14.95 for a year's financial records on a CD.
</P>
<P>
   PAYMYBILLS: www.PayMyBills.com
</P>
<P>
   Users not only pay their bills, they can also analyze their
spending habits, a big help when budgeting. PayMyBills charges
$8.95 for 25 transactions a month, 50 cents for each additional
transaction, and $24.95 for a year's financial records on a CD.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERBILLS: www.StatusFactory.com
</P>
<P>
   CyberBills offers double your money back for an unauthorized
transaction, provided you use a secure browser. It offers three
levels of service, starting at $3.50 a month for five transactions.
The mid-level service costs $8.95 for 30 transactions and 75 cents
for each additional transaction. Basic plan users who exceed five
transactions are automatically switched to the mid-level service.
The premium service is $29.95 a month for unlimited transactions. A
year-end CD is $49.50 for the low- and mid-level service, and free
with the premium service.

   NEW YORK _ Isaac Stern has coached budding violin virtuosos for
decades, but the students he took on Wednesday were a different
breed altogether: New York City's 43 school superintendents, most
of whom had never touched a violin before.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson took place at Carnegie Hall, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just put the violin on the shoulder, voomp!'' Stern said,
lifting his own delicate instrument to the proper position as the
school administrators looked on.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a problem!'' one superintendent exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard!'' chimed in another.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who is 79 and all of five feet tall, was undeterred. He
gazed around the room and shouted advice. ``You've got it on the
wrong shoulder, darling,'' he told one bewildered student.
</P>
<P>
   Harold O. Levy, the interim chancellor, had persuaded Stern to
give the superintendents a lesson in hopes that they would place a
higher priority on music instruction for students. The lesson was
part of a broader plan to raise the level of intellectual debate
among the school system's leaders and make them more culturally
attuned.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson came directly after the superintendents' monthly
meeting with Levy, at which they started off the day hashing out
plans for summer school. After lunch, they filed into a practice
room at Carnegie Hall and listened nervously as Stern told them
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Levy himself did not take part in the lesson _ he recently
injured one of his hands and was wearing a soft cast Wednesday. He
left the meeting early, aides said, to accompany his son Noah's
class at the Dalton School on a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Levi, one of Levy's top aides and his cultural
impresario, was on hand to make sure the lesson went semi-smoothly.
Levi, an accomplished violinist, adjusted people's fingers, tucked
instruments more firmly under chins and practically pulsed with
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac Stern has been a hero of mine since I was a little
kid,'' said Levi, whose musical claim to fame is having taught the
actress Jennifer Aniston how to play the violin when she was
growing up in New York City. ``If only we could get him certified,
we'd have him teaching in the schools.''

SIERRA LEONE STRESSING UN ROLE, US POLICY IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY AND JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crisis in Sierra Leone is testing the
credibility of United Nations peacekeeping operations as well as
the Clinton administration's oft-expressed desire to more actively
help African nations, officials and analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, angry at the lack of help from
Western countries, said it was time for the more powerful nations
to assist the embattled UN force and help bring to safety 500 UN
peacekeepers held hostage in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped that some of those with the capacity would go to
the assistance of those who are in there doing the bidding of the
Security Council and the UN,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   But several US officials said Wednesday that the Clinton
administration would not budge from offering only logistical and
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   British officials also said they would not provide combat
troops, although 800 paratroopers who have arrived in Sierra Leone
have provided some assistance to UN troops as they help evacuate
British citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the British troops were ``helpful,'' adding, ``at
least they have moved, they have done something, even though the
initial objective was to evacuate British and other nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   UN senior officials had low expectations that the United States
would risk the lives of American troops in Sierra Leone, based on
the 1993 peacekeeping fiasco in Somalia that resulted in the deaths
of 18 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Clinton administration putting much greater
emphasis on Africa in the past two years _ President Clinton cited
what he saw as an ``African renaissance,'' several special envoys
have been shuttling to defuse conflicts and a new $260 million
effort has begun to fight the devastating spread of AIDS _ Annan
and other UN officials had expected a more invigorated US response
to the Sierra Leone crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to see some of the governments with
capacity, with good armies and well-trained soldiers, to
participate,'' Annan said. ``But they are not running to forward to
contribute to this force. We have to take the forces we get.''
</P>
<P>
   But US officials said Wednesday that they did not want to risk
the lives of troops in an area of the world where America has few
national security interests. While intervention on humanitarian,
moral and ethical grounds could be argued, those officials said,
national security interests overrode all other considerations.
Wednesday, UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke wrapped up an
unsuccessful attempt to quell tensions in two other African
hotspots: Congo and along the Ethiopia-Eritrea border.
</P>
<P>
   Of Sierra Leone, one US senior official said on condition of
anonymity: ``We want to make sure this stays a UN challenge and not
a US national challenge. We will be supportive diplomatically and
help airlift other troops, but we have to be very sensitive to what
we are already doing in Bosnia and Kosovo and not overstretch
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraging allies to help, especially allies who used
to colonial masters in these places, like the British,'' the US
official said.
</P>
<P>
   British troops had begun ferrying UN peacekeepers to dug-in
positions at the entrances to the capital of Freetown, ``where they
are anticipating the worst,'' said UN spokesman Fred Eckhard.
Rebels were advancing toward the capital as night fell.

   The secretary-general still holds some hope that the British
troops will remain after the evacuations of British and European

the evacuation is over, but let's see,'' said a UN official, who

late this month. UN officials are trying to get 3,000 additional UN
peacekeepers from Bangladesh, Jordan and India to Sierra Leone, but
the earliest possible arrival is May 21 and could be much later, a
UN official said.
</P>
<P>
   And regional West African defense ministers will meet on May 17
to decide whether to send a force of 1,600 Nigerian combat troops.
But Annan does not believe that force would be able to defend the
capital from rebel forces because of its lack of experience and

SOME CONGRESSMAN LOOK FOR `POLITICAL COVER' ON CHINA TRADE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Minn., Ill., Texas, Calif.)   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are 10,000 miles and not much trade between
China and the anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania, but
for Paul Kanjorski, a House Democrat, the two are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Kanjorski said he told President Clinton and House Republican
leaders that he would support extending permanent trading rights to
China if they would offer ``assurances'' that his proposed tax
breaks to encourage investment in Pennsylvania's distressed coal
region will become law before Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough vote for me and these issues must come
together,'' Kanjorski said flatly this week. ``It's not a vote I'm
just going to throw away.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stressed for months that Congress must grant China
permanent trading rights or risk damaging the competitiveness of
U.S. companies and relations with the world's most populous
country. But not unlike other high-profile trade votes, this one
also involves a host of issues that are purely local, like job
retraining and development aid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials warned early this spring that
they could not dole out favors for votes, not at the end of
Clinton's term and with Republicans in control of Congress.
Commerce Secretary William Daley, who is leading the
administration's lobbying effort, said lawmakers must make a
straight choice or, as he put it, ``walk the plank.''
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped members of Congress from demanding life
preservers. With the Clinton administration still short of the 218
votes it needs in the House and with just two weeks left before the
scheduled vote, at least some of the Democrats and Republicans who
remain officially uncommitted want pet projects funded.
</P>
<P>
   The requests may be one reason that 30 lawmakers on both sides
of the aisle have been coy about how they will vote, a remarkably
large number of undecided members given that Congress has had to
choose whether to renew China's trade privileges annually for two
decades. The administration is now asking Congress to give up that
annual review, fulfilling a promise it made to Beijing last year
when it negotiated China's accession to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats who represent districts with a heavy trade
union presence have been especially demanding. They argue that they
need some political cover to vote for a measure unions steadfastly
oppose. The administration, if not yet making firm commitments, is
at least listening, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industrial unions are vehement about this. They say
they'll picket me,'' said Rep. James Oberstar, a senior Minnesota
Democrat. ``I'll take the heat if I can get something done for the
people I represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Oberstar says he wants the administration to amend the Trade Act
of 1974 so that imports of steel slabs could be treated as a direct
threat to the taconite miners of northern Minnesota. With Russian
and Brazilian slabs flooding the market, Oberstar said, U.S. blast
furnaces no longer use as much taconite, a low-grade iron-ore, to
produce raw steel. Several thousands jobs are threatened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they have something they really want,'' he says, referring
to the China trade bill. ``What I'm saying is that they bend the
damn law to serve the needs of these people who are hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The requests for aid come as the administration and Republican
leaders in Congress are locked in a furious battle with opponents
of the China trade measure, including senior congressional
Democrats and politically powerful labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority whip, Tom DeLay, R- Texas, warned Wednesday
that he would have to engage in ``traditional hand-to-hand combat''
to round up enough Republican votes to pass the measure, dismissing
reports that his party already had 150 secure votes. Another
Republican leader said that a recent head count of House
Republicans found only 120 solid supporters, though administration
officials said they still expect at least another 20 Republicans to
vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The pendulum swung slightly in favor of opponents Wednesday when
Reps. David Phelps of Illinois and Gene Green of Texas, both
Democrats, declared they would vote no. The administration says
that it needs a minimum of 70 House Democrats to vote in favor and
that it remains 10 to 15 votes shy of that mark.
</P>
<P>
   Whips on both sides of the aisles have been publicly
discouraging their caucuses from using the close vote as a chance
to extract benefits for their home districts. Asked about
Republican pork barreling Wednesday, DeLay said sharply, ``We don't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., and his party's chief supporter of
the bill in the House, also urged lawmakers to make their decision
on the bill's merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get cover from labor from a bridge project,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Clinton major trade priorities, the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which Congress approved in 1993, became a
political pinata when scores of lawmakers on both sides of the isle
demanded _ and often received _ benefits in exchange for their
votes, administration officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade measure is not NAFTA. It does not require that
the United States open its markets wider to imported goods, as
NAFTA did, and the congressional demands for district-by-district
benefits are much less intense this time, many people involved in
lobbying process said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lobbying, if less high profile, is hardly invisible.
Daley flew to Texas late last week to hear more about Rep. Ruben
Hinojosa's proposed Cross-Border Institute for Regional
Development, a business plan to create a Silicon Valley in
southeastern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Daley and Hinojosa, a Democrat who has yet to say which way he
is voting on China trade, declined to comment on the trip. But a
congressional aide said that Hinojosa hopes that a public-private
partnership could bring high-tech businesses and jobs to the area.

 &HT;    Investors feel the heat of Fed's inflation policy
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors can run _ as they did Wednesday _ but they can't hide
from the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has dawned on many investors that the Fed might not be near
the end of the tunnel on potential rate increases,'' said Atlanta
money manager Phillip M. Larkins of Legacy South.
</P>
<P>
   There now are expectations the Fed will raise short-term rates
by another 1 percentage point this year, which would take the prime
rate to 10 percent, what First Union economist Mark Vitner
considers a psychologically important level. The prime, a benchmark
for some business and consumer loans, hasn't been that high since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about how much higher interest rates will go apparently
contributed to Wednesday's slide in the stock market, while bond
prices rose as their appeal increased. Higher rates not only reduce
profits, but they make investors less willing to buy stocks trading
at high prices relative to earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, also hurt again by worries about the
outlook for Cisco Systems, lost 200 points and 5.6 percent. The Dow
Jones industrial average shed almost 170 points, or 1.6 percent.
Investors are not likely to feel any more at ease today, according
to Vitner. He expects the Commerce Department to report
stronger-than-expected retail sales for April. Most analysts are
looking for an increase of about 0.5 percent. Vitner said he
wouldn't be surprised to see a gain of 0.5 percent to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message will be the economy is still way too
strong for the Fed's liking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Better news, however, may come with Friday's Producer Price
Index and Tuesday's Consumer Price Index, due the same day the Fed
meets to consider what to do about interest rates. Economists
expect the producer index to show a decline for April because of
lower energy costs. Vitner anticipates the CPI will be unchanged or
down, while the number excluding energy and food will be up no more
than 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While that's likely to raise questions in some quarters about
how severely the Fed should tighten credit, Vitner said, it
probably won't slow the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fed would like to do a little more than people
think is needed and reinforce the credibility they have built up as
inflation fighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much is starting to be debated outside the Fed.
With the economy as strong as it is, Vitner thinks the Fed would
have time to correct any error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fed has greater risk in not doing enough,'' added
Larkins. ``There are many investors who were not in the market 10
years ago. They don't understand the devastation inflation can do
to the financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The above-average gains of the last five years in the stock
market were due to low inflation, he said. ``We don't want to go
back to a 4 to 6 percent inflation,'' Larkins suggested. With
inflation in that range, investors could probably expect annual
stock market returns ``probably in the single digits.''

MAN WHO KILLED BEST FRIEND GETS TWO YEARS IN JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. _ Calling Raffi Kodikian a person of good
character but bowing to his responsibility to the law, a judge
Wednesday decided that even a mercy killing does not excuse
Kodikian from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year sentence Chief District Judge J.W. Forbes imposed
on Kodikian, 26, is far less than the 20-year term he could have
ordered for the murder of David Coughlin in Carlsbad Caverns
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   And although Kodikian will leave state prison a young man, the
questions and skepticism about what happened on the parched floor
of Rattlesnake Canyon during a four-day ordeal last August will
remain with him a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions from the Coughlin family, skepticism from
the park supervisor, even doubts from Kodikian himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of us should have come out of that canyon, both of us
should have,'' Kodikian, of Boston, said at a press conference
after sentencing. ``I'll be spending the rest of my life trying to
justify what happened, and chances are I won't be able to.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in retrospect, Kodikian said, he believes he did the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that anybody in my position who would turn their back
on their friend wouldn't have been deserving of coming out of that
canyon,'' Kodikian said.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, who accepted the sentence stoically, entered custody
at 5 p.m. after an emotional afternoon with family and friends.
Kodikian has said he stabbed Coughlin after his friend, dehydrated
and in severe pain, begged him for death.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian ``does not pose a threat or danger to society,'' Forbes
said from the bench. But, he added, punishment ``serves the very
important purpose of preserving the rule of law that we all need to
have for an orderly society.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes imposed a sentence of 15 years with 13 years suspended.
With good behavior, Kodikian can reduce his sentence for
second-degree murder to 20 months, followed by five years'
probation.
</P>
<P>
   The Coughlin family, of Wellesley, Mass., did not attend the
three-day hearing. A family statement read Wednesday by prosecutor
Les Williams did not mention what punishment the Coughlins deemed
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can think of no reason why Raffi would have wished David
any harm or pain,'' wrote Robert P. Coughlin, the victim's father.
``Moreover, we cannot presume to know what transpired, or the
thoughts and emotions the two experienced during the days before
David's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, we have questions. However, we find it difficult
to believe there was any malicious intent.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what message he wished to send the Coughlin family,
Kodikian replied: ``They know how I feel about David, and how I
feel about them. I still love him _ always will.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian and Coughlin, 26, of Millis, Mass., had detoured to
Carlsbad Caverns National Park en route to California where
Coughlin had planned to persue graduate studies.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, who called the tragedy a ``lifelong sentence,'' said
he has often regretted being rescued.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kodikian said he is not troubled by lingering
skepticism over what happened in Rattlesnake Canyon. ``In America,
they're entitled to their opinion, but their opinion doesn't
concern me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the prosecution and the defense pronounced themselves
satisfied with the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Forbes ``couldn't have picked a fairer sentence to all
concerned,'' said Kodikian's attorney, Gary C. Mitchell, who urged
the court to spare his client any prison time. ``I think it shows a
great deal of mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the chief deputy district attorney, asked Forbes to
give Kodikian a severe sentence, but later said the judge's
decision was satisfactory. ``I can't say it was unjust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a longtime skeptic of Kodikian's version of events, Sheriff
A.M. ``Chunky'' Click, called the decision a fair one. ``I think it
was (just), with the mitigating circumstances in this case and the
testimony that came out,'' Click said.
</P>
<P>
   That testimony _ particularly Kodikian's gripping, emotional
account of the tragedy on the witness stand _ softened some of the
disbelief in this frontier city that two young, healthy men could
become hopelessly lost and driven to suicide while camping an
hour's hike from safety.
</P>
<P>
   But questions linger.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsbad Caverns park supervisor Mark Maciha, who tended to
Kodikian after his rescue, said Wednesday that Kodikian's account
will remain forever uncontradicted because the only other witness _
Coughlin _ is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Maciha has said he is baffled by, among several factors,
Kodikian's mental alertness when rescued and the campsite's
proximity to safety.
</P>
<P>
   In final arguments Wednesday, prosecutor Williams emphasized
that, even given the extreme conditions, taking Coughlin's life was
unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is life, there is hope,'' Williams said slowly.
``David Coughlin would be alive today if Raffi Kodikian had not
killed him. . . . The law says you may not murder another person
just because you think it's in their best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell, the defense attorney, argued that another person's
best interest sometimes leads to drastic measures. Coughlin's death
was not a ``Kevorkian-like'' mercy killing, Mitchell said, but an
act of humanity akin to battlefield choices in which a comrade who
cannot be treated, or saved from the enemy, is sometimes killed to
end his pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice can say to us that when there is no evil in the case _
none whatsover, none _ that we should seek mercy from the criminal
justice system,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Kodikian would not comment about the
sentence. But before he left a makeshift press room and prepared to
make a prison cell his home, he looked back _ and ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of lessons in this, but they are too
numerous to list here,'' he said. ``But I'll be spending the next
two years thinking about it.''

STOCK PRICES DECLINE DEEPLY AMID INTEREST-RATE JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks dropped sharply Wednesday, led by a continued
sell-off in technology shares, as investors seemed to grow
increasingly worried about how high the Federal Reserve will raise
short-term interest rates to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index suffered the biggest of three
consecutive losses _ and its 11th biggest on record _ as the
technology-heavy gauge dropped 200.28 points, or 5.59 percent, to
3,384.73. The last time it closed lower was on April 14, when the
Nasdaq plummeted 9.7 percent to end its worst week ever.
</P>
<P>
   Issues like Intel, Cisco and Motorola were among the biggest
casualties but the latest downdraft, the sixth in seven sessions
for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, spared almost no sector
of the market except for some household-name consumer stocks, a
handful of mining companies and the utility sector, a traditional
bear-market haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot more selling pressure in this market than is
generally perceived,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ``It's not just
that buyers are staying away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 168.97 points, or 1.6
percent, to 10,367.78, with Intel, down 10 7/8, to 106 1/16,
accounting for about one-third of the slide. The company said 1
million of its computer motherboards are defective, and analysts
said the replacement cost could run into the hundreds of millions
of dollars. Hewlett-Packard, the second-biggest drag, shed 6 9/16,
to 126\.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Cisco Systems, which reported slightly better than
expected quarterly results after the close of the market on
Tuesday, slumped 4\, to 58{, as investors focused on the company's
doubts about being able to get all the components it needs to set
up networks. And Motorola lost 18, to 86{, after a Salomon Smith
Barney analyst cut his rating, noting difficulties in getting
components for its cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 fell 29.09 points, or 2.06 percent, to 1,383.05. It
is now down 5.9 percent this year compared with losses of 9.8
percent for the Dow and 16.8 percent for Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has dramatically changed'' in recent weeks, said
Ronald Shear, chief executive of the Carlin Equities Group, a
trading-oriented firm heavily involved with Nasdaq stocks. ``The
market's very much afraid of several more rate increases'' by the
Fed, whose policy-making committee is to meet on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shear said investors were also getting a whiff of inflation,
which implied at least modest doubt about the effectiveness of Fed
policy. Gold stocks did nothing, but some lesser metal companies
moved up. For example, Inco, the giant nickel producer, jumped 1
5/8, to 18 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main gauges finished above their lowest levels of
the day, an afternoon comeback largely evaporated and the Nasdaq,
which had cut a 6.08 percent dive in half, retreated again toward
the close.
</P>
<P>
   And few seemed optimistic that the skid, which has lopped 33
percent off the Nasdaq since its high of 5,048.62 on March 10 has
run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisors in
Pittsburgh, said that he thought the Dow could decline an
additional 2 percent to 3 percent, the S&AMP;P 500 another 6 percent to
8 percent and that the Nasdaq could slide to 3,000 before the
market steadied and liquidity improved.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was preparing for a resumption of rising prices
during the summer after the Fed has finished raising rates,
probably at its June 27 meeting. ``We're advising getting ready for
the second half, getting ready to buy'' stocks like regional banks,
Berdine said. He added that he would retain technology shares,
concentrating on infrastructure companies and avoiding those that
are purely Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks were among the session's big losers, with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter down 5, to 66[, Lehman Brothers and
Goldman Sachs down more than 4 each, to 78 and 81 7/16
respectively, and Merrill Lynch down 3\, to 100\.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors slumped 4 9/64, to 81 15/16, after a Merrill
Lynch analyst downgraded it, and AT&AMP;T Wireless eased 7/16, to 28
9/16, nearly a point below its initial offering price late last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the general gloom, some investors returned to such
brand-name standbys as Wal-Mart, up 3 11/16, to 56 11/16; SBC
Communications, up 2 13/16, to 45[; Coke, up 2 5/16, to 52 13/16,
and Exxon Mobil, up 2 1/16, to 81{. &QL;

MOMS ARE MARCHING TO TRANSFORM POLITICS OF GUN CONTROL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Organizers of the Million Mom March for ``sensible
gun control'' predicted Wednesday that at least 150,000 mothers and
their allies would descend on the nation's capital on Sunday, with
many others at similar rallies in 67 towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees-Thomases, the main organizer of the march, said the
message to Congress was simple: ``We have had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pertschuk, legislative director for the Coalition to Stop
Gun Violence, said at a news conference previewing the march that
the event could be a transforming moment in the politics of gun
control, comparable to the civil rights movement that spurred
Congress to act after years of intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Million Mom March is demanding licensing and registration,
and the National Rifle Association says it can't happen here, it
won't work,'' said Pertschuk. ``But Donna and the thousands of moms
supporting her won't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The march is committed to several gun control measures,
including mandatory safety locks, the licensing of all handgun
owners and the registering of all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the potential power of the march on Mother's Day, the
NRA has mounted a television advertising campaign around the
country expressing the association's commitment to ``safe kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, the actress Susan Howard says: ``Can we talk woman
to woman? This week you'll hear lots of disagreement about gun
politics. But I think we can all agree on gun safety. We all want
safe kids.'' The commercial goes on to tout the association's gun
safety education program and offers $1 million to put the program
``in every classroom in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases dismissed the association's advertisements as a
``smoke screen,'' adding, ``I think the mothers of this country are
smart enough to recognize a gimmick when they see one.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA opposes licensing and registration, saying it is an
undue burden on law-abiding citizens and unlikely to affect the
criminals with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Several march organizers spoke at the news conference about how
they came to this movement. Rachel Smith, the march coordinator for
North Carolina, said her moment came after the shootings last year
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., which left 15 dead
and prompted an anxious request from her 11-year-old daughter:
``Promise nobody will get shot at my school.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she had no previous political involvement beyond
voting and ``ranting and raving around the dinner table,'' but was
now working 40 to 50 hours a week on this march. ``We have promised
our children we'll do all we can to keep them safe,'' she said.
``It is time for Congress to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbye Kelley-Watson of Washington, D.C., said she would be
marching in memory of her son, gunned down three years ago at the
age of 19. ``Enough is enough,'' Kelley-Watson said. ``This
Mother's Day I'm turning tears into action.''
</P>
<P>
   The roster of speakers on Sunday will include mothers whose
children have been victims of gun violence, from Columbine to the
Michigan elementary school where a 6-year-old was killed by a
classmate earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to speak are Sarah and James Brady, who was
severely wounded in the assassination attempt on President Ronald
Reagan; Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights
leader; and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland,
daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said the march has depended on its grass-roots
volunteers and contributions from corporate sponsors like Dannon
Yogurt and Parents Magazine, as well as allied groups like Handgun
Control and donors like Irene Diamond, an arts patron, and George
Soros, the financier.

 &HT;    More hurricanes enter state from south, west, study finds
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Despite the traditional imagery of hurricanes
marching across the Atlantic Ocean, a new report shows more storms
have entered the Florida peninsula from the south and west than the
southeast,
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to looking to the east,'' James Lushine,
warning-coordination meteorologist for the National Weather
Service's Miami office, told Wednesday's meeting of the Local
Emergency Management Network, a group of local emergency and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lushine said his study found that storms from the south and west
were weaker but often provide no more than three days of lead time
before landfall, forcing a mad scramble to prepare and, if
necessary, evacuate. That was the case in 1999 with Irene, which
caught South Floridians off guard with near-hurricane force winds
and more than a foot of rain in places.
</P>
<P>
   Storms that cross the Atlantic usually provide up to 10 days of
lead time.
</P>
<P>
   Lushine said he found that 87 percent of storms from the south
and west were minimal to moderate storms, with top sustained winds
of up to 110 mph, while more than a third of the southeast storms
were major storms.
</P>
<P>
   He also found that the south and west storms usually occurred
early or late in the season, which runs from June 1 to November 30,
while southeastern storms historically came at the heart of the
season _ late August to mid-September _ and that the south and west
storms usually brought twice as much rain and spawned more
tornadoes but had lower storm surges than the southeast storms.
</P>
<P>
   Lushine's comments came the same day his bosses called for an
above-average season with the potential for stronger,
longer-lasting storms. At a Washington news briefing, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials predicted at least
11 storms of at least tropical storm strength, with seven or more
becoming hurricanes and three or more of those becoming major
hurricanes. The historical average is 9.3 storms, 5.8 hurricanes
and 2.2 major hurricanes. Last year's hurricane season brought 12
storms, with five of them striking the U.S. mainland, killing at
least 60.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA Administrator D. James Baker cited the lingering effects of
the fading La Nina event, which cools surface temperatures in the
Pacific Ocean and increases the potential for storms; it is not
expected to vanish until August. He also cited a global circulation
pattern which reduces the wind shear that kills hurricanes as well
as a strong jet stream from Africa and warmer temperatures in the
Atlantic, both of which favor stronger storms.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA also formally announced that Max Mayfield, deputy director
of the National Hurricane Center and acting director since January,
will now head the center.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``It's just as splendid as Sotheby's or Christie's,''
said Dan Klein, the international executive director of Phillips
auction house, exuding an air of proprietary triumph last week as
he toured the American Craft Museum at 40 W. 53rd St.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 days earlier, the galleries were earthy shades of
orange, yellow and green. But the designer Bill Katz has
transformed the museum into a gleaming white showcase for artworks
from Phillips' spring sales.
</P>
<P>
   Passing multimillion-dollar canvases, Klein stopped to pose
before an Andy Warhol silkscreen that seemed prophetic: a giant
dollar sign.
</P>
<P>
   Long a distant third in the world auction stakes, Phillips has
rented the museum for three weeks, and lavished $1.3 million in
construction costs, sources said _ not counting design fees _ as
part of an ambitious attempt to give the company's fusty reputation
a swift, elegant facelift.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, in a setting newly glamorous with helium-filled
lanterns and Sharon Stone (supplying the celebrity quotient), Klein
will conduct the biggest sale in Phillips' 206-year history, an
auction of 31 Impressionist and modern works that may bring $80
million _ quite a leap from its total record sale of $3.6 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a time when the world's two leading auction houses,
Sotheby's and Christie's, are embroiled in an embarrassing
price-fixing scandal, Phillips, which is based in London, is
causing a considerable stir with its conspicuous and costly effort
to reinvent itself as an important player in New York. Richard
Feigen, a prominent New York art dealer, said: ``I think it's fine
to have a third force in the auction world. I just don't see how
they're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One way is to create a couture image, which Phillips has done by
luring the art world's equivalent of beautiful models _ from
Cezanne, Renoir and Picasso to Damien Hirst; by making substantial
guarantees to sellers; and by buying at least 8 of 31 works
outright for resale, which is raising eyebrows. ``Spending so much
money, I can't see how they'd recoup it,'' Feigen said. ``Not even
if they had an impressive permanent space.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramped and rundown, Phillips' existing New York headquarters at
406 E. 79th St. has a single salesroom-cum-gallery that resembles
the auditorium of a cruelly underfinanced high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can see why we had to get out of here to have an
Impressionist sale,'' Klein said, as he led this reporter on a
swift tour.
</P>
<P>
   The American Craft Museum's location gives Phillips a
sophisticated new image _ at least until the auction house leaves
on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smart what they did, to rent this space and show these
paintings,'' said Laszlo von Vertes, a collector and former art
dealer visiting from Zurich, who was among the first to stop by
last Friday for a look at Phillips' wares before heading four
blocks south to do the same at Christie's. ``It's big competition
for Sotheby's and Christie's, which is good for the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for Phillips' chance for success are fueled by the
formidable resources of the man bankrolling it: Bernard Arnault,
the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a $40 billion
behemoth. He bought Phillips last November for a bargain price of
$121.5 million and hopes to seize a chunk of Sotheby's and
Christie's turf. Together, Sotheby's and Christie's control most of
the $5 billion global fine art auction business. Igniting Arnault's
efforts is his noted rivalry with Francois Pinault, a French
department store magnate who triumphed over Arnault last year for
control of Gucci and who bought Christie's in 1998 for $1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Apsis, a partner in the gallery C&AMP;M Arts on East 78th
Street and the former head of the Impressionist and modern art
department at Sotheby's, believes it is possible for Phillips to
claim some of Christie's and Sotheby's business. ``This is the
perfect time, because the market is in a state of flux,'' he said.
``And a lot of new collectors are entering the market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, I don't think anyone would have predicted that
Phillips would be this far along,'' he went on. ``They've made big
strides.''
</P>
<P>
   But such strides come at a price; many in the art world
commented on Phillips' recent tactics of promising the seller a
large fixed sum, no matter what the outcome at auction, just to get
the firepower to make the five coming sales seem impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault, in town for the auctions, said, referring to his
rivals, ``We made some guarantees, as everyone did. ``It's a normal
game. I understand they're not happy to have lost these paintings,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the cost of fixing up the museum, ``the premises needed
it,'' he said. ``And I think it's beautiful. Bill Katz did a
wonderful job. You know, we're used to this. It's what we do when
we have a fashion show in the group. We think it's important to
show the public the products we're going to sell in a nice way.''
</P>
<P>
   If the strategy works, noted Joe Helman, a well-known 57th
Street dealer, ``it's an inexpensive way to buy into the art
market.'' Spiffing up a museum and guaranteeing paintings is ``a
lot cheaper,'' he said, than buying Christie's or Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault tried that, too, last December, when he entered
negotiations with Alfred A. Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman and
still the controlling stockholder. But talks fell through, a former
Sotheby's executive close to Taubman said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Phillips venture, Klein admitted, ``is a leap of faith
by Arnault, and we've jumped off the cliff with him.''
</P>
<P>
   By a peculiar twist of fate, the star item in Thursday evening's
sale is Kasimir Malevich's ``Suprematist Composition,'' a rare
abstract geometric painting in black, red and white that until last
year had hung for 63 years at the Museum of Modern Art across the
street. Important Suprematist oil paintings by Malevich have been
virtually absent from the auction market since his death in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Phillips' prize pony being offered up Thursday night
as the final lot of the evening, some observers sounded a note of
concern. ``There are very few buyers out there for a Malevich,''
Feigen observed, though Apsis noted that this particular painting
``is exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz emphasized the painting's importance by allotting it a wall
of its own that was immediately visible as visitors entered from
the lobby. To alert passers-by, an enormous blown-up photograph of
the painting was placed in the museum's 53rd Street window, to the
chagrin of the Museum of Modern Art, which gave the painting back
to Malevich's 31 descendants last year in an amicable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is reported to have guaranteed $15 million to the
heirs, after a five-day negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Kaye, a lawyer for the heirs, said, ``The family was
very impressed by the enthusiasm that Phillips showed.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Phillips has declined to set an official
estimate on the painting, but art experts think it could fetch at
least $10 million, making it the most valuable work ever offered by
the auctioneer. (A Monet seascape, the previous record, sold in
1998 for $2.5 million.)

MICROSOFT MAKES COUNTEROFFER TO STAVE OFF DIVISION OF COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. urged a judge Wednesday to reject
the government plan to break the software giant into two pieces,
saying a far more moderate solution was appropriate for the
antitrust violations the judge said it had committed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled last month
that Microsoft competed unfairly in the software market, and he
asked the company and the government to suggest remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In its proposal Wednesday, Microsoft strongly opposed a proposal
from the US Justice Department and 17 states to sever Microsoft
into two companies: one that would make the Windows operating
system and one that would include Microsoft's Internet business and
its word-processing, spreadsheet and other so-called applications
software.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company said, Jackson should bar Microsoft from
using its Windows monopoly as a cudgel to bully other companies.
For example, during a lengthy antitrust trial Microsoft was accused
of withholding technical information and rights to Windows from
companies that wanted to promote a Web browser made by Netscape
Communications Corp., rather than Microsoft's own Web browser.
Without the information and rights to Windows, most computer makers
cannot sell computers.
</P>
<P>
   The government said behavior like that allowed Microsoft to
crush rivals and dampen innovation in the software market, harming
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Microsoft's plan, computer makers would have more control
over the look of the Windows screen and the Internet sign-on
sequence. They could feature non-Microsoft products on the screen,
and even delete the icon that leads users to Microsoft's Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft did not endorse a variety of other government
proposals, such as forcing it to charge a uniform price for
Windows. And it vigorously attacked the idea of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is no basis in this case for the government's
unprecedented breakup proposal, and we are hopeful that the Court
will dismiss this excessive demand immediately,'' Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   A breakup and other government proposals ``would have an
enormous and horrendous effect on every part of the mission of this
enterprise,'' Microsoft legal chief Bill Neukom told reporters.
``They would have a dramatic effect on other companies in this
industry and have a huge and negative effect on consumers... and I
think it's perfectly fair to say would have a very negative effect
on the economy of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department called Microsoft's proposal ``ineffective
and filled with loopholes,'' and said it would not prevent the
company from ``using its monopoly power in the future to engage in
the same kind of illegal behavior to crush new innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   Having overtaken the Netscape Web browser, critics say,
Microsoft now aims to use its Windows monopoly to push into the
market for Internet audio and video software, as well as the
software market for servers, or powerful computers that businesses
commonly use to run computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has to look around the corner and see where they're
going to go next, and cut them off at the pass,'' said Mike Pettit,
president of a group of Microsoft rivals called Procomp. He called
Microsoft's proposal ``meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Microsoft's plan:
</P>
<P>
   -- Computer makers could promote and feature software made by
Microsoft rivals, such as the Netscape Web browser. The computer
makers also could display icons for non-Microsoft products on the
initial screen that computer-users first see, and they could delete
the icon for Microsoft's Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would be barred from withholding its Windows operating
system from companies that took advantage of these freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Jackson has already found that Microsoft induced
computer makers to distribute Microsoft's Web browser rather than
the browser made by rival Netscape, which has been acquired by
America Online Inc. Jackson also found that Microsoft illegally
``tied'' its Web browser to Windows, when the two should be
separate products. Microsoft said its proposal addresses that
concern.
</P>
<P>
   -- Microsoft could not induce any company to limit its support
for Microsoft competitors in return for giving that company a
favored place on the Windows desktop screen, or otherwise using
Windows to promote the company. Jackson has already ruled that
Microsoft engaged in this kind of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   -- Microsoft would agree to give all software developers
``timely and complete access'' to technical information about
Windows upgrades, which is crucial for independent companies to
make Windows-compatible products.
</P>
<P>
   Other restrictions would address the charge that Microsoft tried
to hurt Apple Computer Corp. by threatening to drop its support for
Apple-compatible products unless Apple took actions favorable to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions would stay in effect until 2004, Microsoft
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're proposing is pretty bland,'' said Thane Scott, an
antitrust specialist with the Boston law firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge, who
does not take sides in the case. ``This is a proposal to impose
very loose oversight over Microsoft. ... It's the minimum of what
any court would absolutely impose, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that the government's breakup proposal was too
broad, and that it aimed to help Netscape's Web browser and Java,
made by Sun Microsystems, become rivals to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft argued, the court never ruled that the
Netscape and Sun products would have successfully competed with
Windows even if Microsoft had not engaged in its anticompetitive
behavior. Therefore, the company said, the government was incorrect
in trying to create competition to Windows that might never have
existed under any circumstances.

NEW YORK: for $2.5 million.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declining to discuss the heft of Phillips' guarantees and other
financial arrangements with consignors, Klein was more than eager
to show off the American Craft Museum, in its current, spiffed-up
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the entrance, where giant canvases by Andy Warhol and
David Salle now hang in isolated splendor, the lobby was formerly
filled with a warren of counters and merchandise as part of the
museum's gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spatially, the museum is very beautiful, but like everyone's
life, it gets cluttered up after a while,'' said Katz, the
designer, who is known for the spare refinement of his work and for
his well-cultivated friendships with artists, including Jasper
Johns, Cy Twombly and Ellsworth Kelly, for whom he has designed
exhibitions. ``My goal always is to simplify and clarify,'' Katz
said. ``The idea is to draw attention to the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz was hired by Phillips in February, shortly after returning
from the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, where he installed Francesco
Clemente's current exhibition. ``It was all very quick,'' he said.
Lamps previously suspended at just-above-hairdo level in the lobby
were removed. Katz designed simple, interconnected white walls to
create intimately scaled spaces for viewing. He also lowered each
entryway and painted the recessed spaces dark gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, your eye is not distracted from the experience of
viewing the paintings,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Plans called for installing 480 artworks for the separate shows,
each of which required new walls to be put in place overnight. Five
snappy catalogs, designed by Richard Pandiscio, celebrate the new
level of work Phillips is representing. Abigail Asher, a partner at
Guggenheim &AMP; Asher, art consultants, noted, ``They've certainly put
together catalogs unlike any other Phillips catalogs we've ever
seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to upgrade Phillips' image, Klein has been
searching for a new Manhattan headquarters. Until he finds
something, Klein said that Phillips may continue to hold auctions
twice a year at the American Craft Museum. ``It's all been very
wild and exciting,'' Klein said. ``Now we just have to sell the
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's auction will begin to tell the tale. Tobias
Meyer, head of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide, threw down
the gauntlet. ``The question is,'' he said, ``how much is Arnault
prepared to lose?''

 &HT;    Amtrak offering new routes
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Amtrak is proposing to connect Florida's
cities like never before with greatly expanded passenger train
service and new stations over the next three to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Four trains would run a four-hour leg daily between West Palm
Beach and Orlando, compared to two trains now. More trains would
carry travelers along two other corridors _ Miami to Tampa and
Tampa to Orlando. And new stations would pop up in Daytona Beach,
Stuart and other towns between Jacksonville and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's plan, submitted at the request of the state Department
of Transportation, would cost an estimated $354 million to $485
million by 2005. The rail agency wants the state to split that bill
for track, station and crossing improvements and extra locomotives
and coach cars. DOT administrators are expected to review the plan
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The intercity passenger rail proposal comes a year after Gov.
Job Bush derailed a proposed $6.3 billion bullet train connecting
Miami, West Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The extra service depends on Amtrak negotiating agreements with
the state and freight carriers CSX Transportation and Florida East
Coast Railway, and commuter rail agency Tri-Rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doable,'' Amtrak spokesman Kevin Johnson said. ``It's
going to take a lot of work, especially with getting the equipment
to provide additional service, but we feel we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has already struck partnerships with nine other states,
including New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois, to expand passenger
rail service as a way to reduce highway congestion, increase
economic development and provide another alternative for commuters.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Florida outlines improvements in four phases.
</P>
<P>
   In the next three years, Amtrak will restructure its
long-distance passenger service to the Northeast. Three Silver line
trains now run once a day between New York and Miami. Between West
Palm Beach and Jacksonville, the trains travel through Orlando and
Ocala and bypass some cities along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, one of the trains would switch to the FEC
rail in Jacksonville and continue south along the east coast to
South Florida. The train would make six or seven stops, including
St. Augustine, Daytona Beach and Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has been negotiating for years with the FEC Railway about
sharing its line with freight carriers. FEC officials said
Wednesday they remain hopeful an agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   According to FEC spokeswoman Jane Covington, the negotiations
center on three issues _ safety, capacity and compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you mix passenger trains and freight trains, that has
to be an area of concern. And we want to ensure we have the
capacity to grow our own business,'' Covington said. ``We've made
significant progress in working through these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, set for 2005, would increase daily service on
the Miami to Orlando, Miami to Tampa and Tampa to Orlando routes.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak projects 625,000 passengers would ride the Miami to
Orlando train in the first year. This is about 7.2 percent of the
11.5 million people that, according to DOT estimates, will make the
trip this year by car or plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hear and see is congestion on the highway is getting
to the point where people are fed up,'' Johnson said. ``Using the
airlines often is no better.''
</P>
<P>
   After 2005, Amtrak would make improvements to the three rail
corridors to add more daily round trips and new stations. The
improvements would allow trains to increase the maximum speed from
79 miles an hour to 110 miles an hour, cutting travel times.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, several new routes would be added, including Orlando to
Port Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale to Naples and Jacksonville to
Pensacola. No cost estimates, travel times or ridership projections
have been developed for these projects.

DRIVING FEES TO SUPPORT `BIG DIG' COST OVERRUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All Massachusetts motorists will have to pay for the
``Big Dig's'' $2 billion cost overrun, as lawmakers agree to
maintain driving license and vehicle registration fees that had
once been scheduled to be phased out permanently, Beacon Hill
sources say.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators believe the Registry fees are more
fair and less politically explosive than new bridge and
Massachusetts Turnpike tolls that were considered earlier this year
to cover the soaring costs of the $13.6 billion project. They have
agreed in principle to the plan after weeks of closed-door
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which is still being drafted, could be announced
Thursday, and is expected to pass the Legislature as soon as
Tuesday, just days before a May 19 federally imposed deadline. The
Federal Highway Administration has threatened to cut off financing
for the Central Artery renovation project by that date if
Massachusetts does not craft a sound financial scheme to cover the
overrun.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also uses this year's budget surplus, estimated at $650
million, to pay down high-interest debt, generating $690 million in
savings over the next five years that would go toward funding the
Central Artery/Tunnel project.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also sets aside cash for the statewide road and
bridge program, which federal transportation officials have
insisted is necessary for Massachusetts to receieve money already
earmarked for the Central Artery.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joseph C. Sullivan, a Democrat and co-chairman of
the Joint Committee on Transportation, declined to comment on
details of the plan, but said lawmakers do not want to test the
Congressional threats and are rushing to put the proposal into
legislative form so it could be voted on quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at closure by week's end,'' Sullivan said
``We're sensitive to the May 19 time frame. There would have to be
action next week in both branches. . . . We're working extra hard
at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's Senate counterpart, Robert A. Havern III, a Democrat,
did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The registration fees would generate $55 million in annual
revenue, while license fees would produce about $45 million a year.
Combined, those funds could leverage $1.4 billion, enough to cover
most of what federal officials say is a $2 billion overrun.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the budget gap would be paid for through the $690
million savings reaped by using surplus funds to pay down
high-interest debt. It was unclear whether lawmakers would apply
that money directly toward construction or use it to borrow money
to cover the difference, although the latter option appeared the
most likely scenario, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   While federal authorities are insisting the Big Dig cannot
siphon funds from other highway projects in the state, using some
of the surplus for road and bridge repairs would help lawmakers
sell the license and registration fee plan to the public by arguing
that motorists will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, then-Governor William F. Weld issued an executive order
that provided for a one-time $30 ``lifetime'' fee to register a
car, with two-year renewals but no further charges. Previously, car
owners had to pay $30 every two years for a registration _ and will
again under this legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Weld also ordered that driving license renewal fees be lowered
from $33.75 to $2. That order was due to take effect this month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will also include about $250 million combined from the
Turnpike Authority, which oversees the Big Dig, and Massport, which
controls Logan International Airport where access is being improved
by the addition of the project's Ted Williams Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The overrun package, including contingencies and funding for
other road and bridge work, could total more than $2 billion,
sources familiar with the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate plans to pay for the overrun differed in
several ways. While both chambers called for keeping driver's
license fees, the Senate did not propose reinstating registration
fees but conceded the idea to the House under this compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and Governor Paul Cellucci wanted to use the surplus
to pay down debt and reap savings that could be used to leverage
lower-rate borrowing or be applied as cash. The House conceded this
idea to the Senate and governor.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the state is expected to receive about $500 million in
Federal Highway money for next fiscal year, which begins in
October. About $175 million of that would be earmarked for the Big
Dig.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved $8.55 billion, of which about $5 billion
has already been spent.

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI'S DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You could tell from the headlines, especially in the
tabloids, that something had to happen _ that, as Donna Hanover
said last week in an emotional appearance outside St. Patrick's
Cathedral, ``decisions'' had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, his own voice halting and at times trembling, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani told reporters that he and Hanover were
considering a formal separation.
</P>
<P>
   That's one decision. Soon, I think, will come the decision to
abandon the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In disclosing his plans to separate from Hanover, the mayor
said, ``I'm motivated by all the tremendous invasion of privacy
that's taken place in everyone's life _ my family, Judith Nathan's
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan has been described by Giuliani as his ``very good
friend,'' and Wednesday he said, ``I'm going to need her more now
than maybe I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   I rooted for the longest time for a Senate race between Rudolph
Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton. This was purely out of
self-interest. I make my living running around with a pocketful of
paper and a Bic pen, chasing stories. And I couldn't imagine a
story that would be more fun than all-out warfare between these two
huge, aggressive and controversial personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Way back in November 1998 I wrote: ``I have found nothing to
substantiate the rumors that Hillary Rodham Clinton is interested
in running for Moynihan's seat. But the idea of a Senate race
between Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani is such a splendid one that it
must be kept alive at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the story has certainly been incredible. The real events
have trumped anything I might have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not been fun.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be very twisted indeed to get a kick out of public
figures coming down with cancer and the very public disintegration
of a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The combat I imagined was of the political variety, Hillary
against Rudy, Democrat against Republican, one narcissist against
another.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics changed radically two weeks ago when Giuliani
announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Just days later came stories in the tabloids about the mayor's
relationship with Nathan. The mayor acknowledged they were friends,
and that has been the hot topic ever since. The tabloids went into
overdrive. There were daily stories, with photos, about Nathan. The
history of the relationship was chronicled. Her wardrobe was
analyzed and re-analyzed. A media encampment was set up outside her
East Side high-rise. Other reporters and photographers were
dispatched to Hazleton, Pa., to get reactions from Nathan's
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday it was clear that the frenzy wasn't about to abate,
and top Republican officials were openly concerned about the effect
it was having on the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's response was to announce that he and Hanover would
pursue a formal separation. And Hanover called reporters to Gracie
Mansion where she spoke tearfully about problems that went back
several years.
</P>
<P>
   For these and other reasons, I don't see how Giuliani stays in
the Senate race. And I would expect his exit to come sooner rather
than later. Like most other observers, I doubt that he ever really
wanted to go to the Senate. He's a guy who likes to command.
</P>
<P>
   And while he has tried mightily to seem otherwise, he's also
human. And that means he is laboring beneath an almost unimaginable
load of physical and emotional stress. He is the mayor of the
nation's largest city. He is fighting the disease that killed his
father. His marriage has unraveled. The person he seems closest to
is being hounded day and night by the media, and that will only
grow worse. The prognosis he has received from his doctors is very
good, but the treatment is rough nevertheless, and it is likely, at
least to some extent, to be debilitating. And after going through
that, his immediate task would be to engage in a titanic, historic
battle for the Senate against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   I expect Giuliani to bow out of this race, regain his health,
settle the difficulties in his personal life and then come back,
renewed, to run in some future campaign.

   JUI JUNCTION, Sierra Leone _ Thousands of panicky men, women and
children fled toward the capital on Wednesday, carrying loads on
their heads or scrambling to board jammed buses, as fighting edged
closer to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   This junction, about 10 miles east of the center of the capital,
Freetown, was the scene of intense confusion on Wednesday morning.
As civilians streamed toward the capital, which remained under the
control of an embattled U.N. force, vehicles filled with
pro-government militiamen rumbled away from town, toward the
fighting with the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting the rebels to come from the Waterloo
direction _ there is only one route,'' said Lt. Joseph Jalloh of
the Sierra Leone army. Waterloo is five miles away. ``We are trying
to stop them from coming to Freetown.''
</P>
<P>
   As the confusion intensified, the whereabouts of Foday Sankoh,
the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, remained unclear. His
absence complicates efforts to negotiate the release of 500 U.N.
peacekeepers and civilians being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have rapidly advanced westward toward the capital in
recent days. And the U.N. mission, whose mandate had been to keep
the peace as a neutral force, has essentially become allied with
the Sierra Leonean army and a militia known as the Kamajors to
stave off a rebel assault on Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now the goal of our force to preserve the stability and
peace in Freetown,'' said Bernard Miyet, the U.N. undersecretary
general for peacekeeping, at the end of a two-day visit to Sierra
Leone. ``It is our immediate priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyet said the United Nations was committed to staying in Sierra
Leone. ``I have not come here to shut down this operation,'' he
said. ``I have come to see how we can preserve peace for a
population that deserves peace.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time since the beginning of last year that
Freetown, at the western end of a peninsula in the Atlantic Ocean,
has faced a possible invasion. In a fierce attack in January 1999,
the Revolutionary United Front, then allied with ex-government
soldiers, pushed into the center of town, burning houses, raping
women and girls, killings thousands and hacking off the hands and
arms of hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The advance of rebels with a brutal past has caused panic among
Sierra Leoneans. Since Tuesday, when U.N. peacekeepers abandoned
Masiaka, a junction town about 25 miles east of here, civilians
have been fleeing westward.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of thousands traveling by foot, bicycle and vehicle,
carrying clothes, gasoline containers, mattresses, and pots and
pans, appeared to have heightened fears in villages and towns as
they made their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people from Waterloo are leaving,'' said Samuel
Fofanah, 25, a teacher at Peninsula Secondary School who left
Waterloo on his bicycle early on Wednesday morning. ``We heard
gunshots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those passing through Jui Junction included Abraham, 9, who was
as old as Sierra Leone's war. Abraham, whose hands were hacked off
by the Revolutionary United Front during an attack on Waterloo in
January 1999, was carrying a large nylon bag on his head, steadying
it with the stumps of his arms. He and his father had walked from
Waterloo on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   James Kargbo, a 26-year-old high school student in Waterloo, had
fled to Freetown on Monday with most of his belongings. He was
trying to return on Wednesday to Waterloo, but then learned that
soldiers were no longer permitting civilians to travel east of
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left behind many important items, like my books,'' Kargbo
said, as he sat on a flatbed pickup truck with a small radio glued
to his left ear. ``I am a student.''
</P>
<P>
   People who could afford it spent 500 Leones, or 25 cents, to buy
a seat in a bus or station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, the head of a junta that toppled
the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in 1997 but who is
now allied with him, claimed on a Freetown radio station that his
men had taken back Masiaka. The news, though, could not be
confirmed and did not halt the exodus toward the capital.

 &HT;    UNITED METHODIST GENERAL CONFERENCE
 &HT;    Gay rights demonstrators are arrested before vote
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ More than 180 gay rights protesters, including at
least one United Methodist bishop, were arrested outside the
convention center here Wednesday in a carefully choreographed
demonstration aimed at delegates to the United Methodist General
Conference inside.
</P>
<P>
   The conference faces a vote later this week on whether to keep
church bans against ordaining sexually active gays and lesbians to
the ministry and performing same-sex unions. The conference
committee handling those issues has recommended that the
denomination maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Ten United Methodist bishops and several veterans of the civil
rights movement were among the 300-or-so who began to assemble at
dawn on a plaza above the entrance to the center. They marched
around the building, and then about half of them, in groups of 10
to 30, blocked the driveway leading from the main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   As each small band lined up across the roadway, Commander Jim
Davidson of the Cleveland police stepped forward, identified
himself and said, ``I am asking you to please disperse and allow
access to this facility.''
</P>
<P>
   When they did not move, he called up uniformed police officers
lining the driveway, in pairs of two, to lead them away. Many of
those arrested had already filled out sheets with their names,
addresses and Social Security numbers to speed up the process. As
each group moved away, another group quickly re-formed the human
blockade.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of counter-protesters not affiliated with the United
Methodist Church positioned themselves on a wall overlooking the
arrests. Chuck Spingola of Newark, Ohio, was one of them. In a
baseball cap and ``Thank God for AIDS'' T-shirt, he dangled a toy
made of two male dolls on an elastic band and yelled at the
protesters, ``The Bible says sodomizers should be stoned to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a group of people supporting the gay rights
demonstration sang ``Joy to the World'' and ``This Little Light of
Mine'' and cheered on each group who was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the floor of the conference inside, about 50
visitors in the balcony stood to sing ``We Are Marching in the
Light of God,'' a Christian gay rights anthem. A few dozen
delegates sympathetic with the gay rights cause also stood beside
their tables on the floor where the conference was in session.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Whittemore, the certified public accountant from Hartwell,
Ga., who heads the North Georgia delegation said he and some other
Georgians knew little of what occurred outside. They came into the
convention center at 6:30 a.m. to meet with candidates for bishop
from the Southeast, ``and we've been working ever since,'' he said
late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Whittemore said the United Methodist Church does not shut out
homosexuals. ``Our stance is that all people are of sacred worth
and all people are welcome at United Methodist Churches,'' he said.
``At the same time, we say a number of things are not acceptable.
We say homosexual practice is incompatible with our view.''
</P>
<P>
   As of late afternoon, many of the demonstrators who were
arrested remained in jail awaiting processing, according to Lt.
Sharon MacKay of the Cleveland Police Department. Those arrested
were charged with aggravated disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, and
were fined about $180.
</P>
<P>
   United Methodist Bishop Joseph Sprague of northern Illinois was
one of those arrested. Before the demonstration, he said he had
asked himself, ``Where would Jesus Christ be today? Where would
Martin Luther King be today? Where would Mohandas Gandhi be
today?''
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi's grandson, Arun Gandhi, was in the first line of
protesters arrested. He is the founder of a center for nonviolence
in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   King's daughter Yolanda, an actress living in Los Angeles,
marched but chose not to block the drive and be arrested because
she was hurrying back to Los Angeles for the premiere of
``Odessa,'' a film in which she stars.
</P>
<P>
   Although her father never specifically addressed the question of
homosexual rights, ``the fact is my father talked about the beloved
community, where all people receive respect and dignity,'' she said
before the march. ``That includes homosexuals.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When I was a child, adults never asked girls what
they wanted to be when they grew up,'' Betty Friedan, 79, said.
``Only boys. With girls they would say, `You're such a pretty
little girl _ you'll grow up, get married and have children just
like your mommy.' Well, I sure as hell didn't want to be a mommy
like my mommy. On the other hand, I wanted to be a mother and wife
and have a family and do it better than she did _ have it warmer,
more real. My mother was sort of hypocritical. She would say, `Oh,
darling,' on the phone to her friends, then hang up and make bitchy
comments. As a result, I err in the other direction. I'm too
brutally frank.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``I think I don't have enough hypocritical graces,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. In 1963, Friedan, the combative writer and
activist, inspired a social revolution for women with ``The
Feminine Mystique,'' in which she debunked the myth of the postwar
woman, that docile soul who tended home and hearth while happily
forgoing her own ambitions and interests. It sold more than 3
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   In her sixth book and first memoir, ``Life So Far'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $26), she recounts a turbulent personal history in which
she accuses her former husband, Carl Friedan, an advertising
executive, of physical abuse during their 22-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A founding mother of the women's movement getting black eyes
from her husband?
</P>
<P>
   Friedan grimaced and waved her hand dismissively, perched on an
overstuffed chair in her home here in Adams-Morgan. ``Well, don't
make too much of that,'' she said. ``He was no wife beater, and I
was no passive victim. We were both hot-tempered people.'' Her
voice grew louder as she continued, establishing her pattern of
speaking in italics. ``Unfortunately, he was bigger than me,'' she
said. ``So even if I started it, I ended up with the bruises. My
daughter the doctor does not think I should make statements on
domestic violence because I don't know the literature, but in my
instance, it's all wrong to characterize our stormy marriage as any
business of beating and victim. And I certainly am a stormy
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. When it came to organizing and inciting, Friedan was a
champion. She became the founding president of NOW, the National
Organization for Women; a co-founder of the organization that
became NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League); and a co-founder of the National Women's Political Caucus.
But when it came to details like cooperation, she was a disaster,
the Larry Kramer of the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone, Patricia Ireland, the current president of
NOW, was respectful, if somewhat obtuse about Friedan's outsize
personality. ``The '60s and '70s were a time when everything was
black and white, good and bad,'' she said. ``Looking now at someone
like Betty Friedan, you see sometimes that people are more complex
than the movement gave them credit for. I think we've seen a whole
lot more women moving inside institutions that shape our culture,
and you can trace a fair amount of progress to the insights Betty
had. Her personal experience had a great resonance.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it's hard to imagine Friedan as much of a homebody.
Here in her spacious, three-bedroom apartment, she seems oddly
diminished. Long before 24-hour news channels and the proliferation
of the sound bite, Friedan was synonymous with microphones and
podiums. Alone in her home, with just a housekeeper running a
vacuum cleaner, she seems a bit lost, like a candidate without a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's isolated. She is still employed, as a visiting
distinguished professor by Cornell University, where she is
conducting a three-year study on women, men, work, family and
public policy, financed by a $1 million Ford Foundation grant.
</P>
<P>
   Though her assistant keeps an office in one of the bedrooms, old
habits die hard among working women of a certain age: Friedan's
desk is in the dining room, where she can spread out onto the
dining-room table. Much of her furniture is from the early days of
her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chair I'm sitting in cost 10 or 12 bucks,'' she
proclaimed proudly. ``See that love seat? I bought it for $35 at
auction, and that chair that goes with it for $7.50. As you can
see, I don't care which period is who. I certainly never used a
decorator. When I was beginning to have some money I called one,
but she wanted everything in beige. I am not a beige person. I like
color. So that was the end of the decorator.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her feistiness, Friedan seemed a bit frail. She was
sometimes hard of hearing, and her breathing was labored when she
walked. A lifelong asthmatic, she claims not to have had an attack
since she had a heart valve replaced _ twice _ seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her trademark voice, authoritative and strong, seems to be her
motor. Speaking one on one doesn't energize or reassure her as much
as when she projects, as if to an audience. Her concentration was
spotty; sometimes she spoke in full, eloquent paragraphs, sometimes
she repeated things she had just said. She recovered one of two
ways: either gruffly shouting ``What?'' which seems her
time-honored way of making timid souls jump, or by continuing a
thought she had left off previously, completing sentences with an
acuity that would make a copy editor cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women today have lots of opportunities I envy,'' she said.
``If I was young today I might become an anthropologist, or go to
law school and aim for the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young women today take for granted opportunities that my
generation never dreamed of,'' she went on.``I hear them say, `I'm
not a feminist, but I'm going to law school.' `I'm not a feminist
but I'll get married when I choose, if I choose.''' She smiled
wryly. ``She's not a feminist, but choice, autonomy, ambition and
opportunity are her subtext.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Friedan always split from more radical members of the
women's movement was in her insistence that women not isolate
themselves from men, that women's liberation and men's liberation
were intertwined. Of her study for Cornell, she said: ``We need a
values revolution in this culture. We need quality of life to be
more important than the bottom line. We need a new definition of
the bottom line, a purpose larger than the self. For me, the
women's movement provided such a purpose. To realize you were
making a difference, changing history. It was exciting. Fun.''' Her
face softened. ``Fun,'' she repeated quietly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She realized early on, she said, that she operated better solo
than as part of a committee. ``I started a number of terrific
organizations,'' she said, ``but I quickly saw that somehow it was
not my thing to try to get, keep or hold on to power in those
organizations. I could do best as a writer and lecturer. I didn't
need those organizations for my own ability to make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   She seems to have always made one naturally. Born Betty
Goldstein in Peoria, Ill., in 1921, she was the oldest of three
children. Her father, Harry, owned an upscale jewelry store; her
mother, Miriam, was a housewife whose colitis disappeared after her
husband became ill and she took over his business. Being Jewish,
their daughter found herself something of a social outcast at
school.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to Smith College and the University of California at
Berkeley for graduate work in psychology, which she abandoned after
deciding not to pursue a life in academia. She moved to New York
City and became a reporter for labor news agencies, married Carl
Friedan and worked as a free-lance writer in order to stay home
with her three children. She began researching what became ``The
Feminine Mystique'' when she composed a questionnaire for a Smith
reunion and discovered she was not the only one who, as she writes
in ``Life So Far,'' ``was not having orgasms waxing the family room
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father died after she graduated from Smith, and mention of
him now is the only time tears threaten. ``He would have been so
proud of me,'' she said, averting her eyes. Her mother died at 90,
having married twice more and become a bridge champion. Her doctor
decided the stress of the tournaments was too much for her; she
stopped and died soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan remains close to her children and nine grandchildren.
Her son Daniel is a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University and
a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant; Jonathan is
an engineer in Philadelphia; Emily is a pediatrician in Buffalo.
None of her children will comment on their mother's book, with its
revelations of abuse. ``They're not ecstatic,'' Friedan said
bluntly. ``But they support both me and their father.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan even sees her former husband on occasion. ``We had some
good times, and we made a wonderful family,'' she said. Carl
Friedan could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about getting married again, but it would be
nice to share your life,'' Friedan said. After her divorce, she had
a 10-year affair with a married man, who, unfortunately, stayed
married. He died in 1993. She shrugged. ``It's not very good for
that kind of relationship,'' she said, ``if five people stop you
when you're walking down the street and say, `You changed my life.'
So having been married to somebody who was pretty threatened when I
began to get famous, I'm leery of subjecting someone to that.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at the floor. ``The hardest thing I ever did was get
divorced,'' she said. ``It was much harder than starting the
women's movement. I was terrified of being alone. Families are so
important, keeping them intact. I don't think I had any choice by
the time I did it. Now, it's not a fate worse than death if a woman
makes more money than the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to her desk, she pulled out a file with her book tour
itinerary. As she started reviewing the grueling schedule, day by
day, her voice grew stronger and her back grew straighter. She's
experienced in the vagaries of the book business. When ``The
Feminine Mystique'' started selling like mad, her publisher assumed
that her husband had bought them all.
</P>
<P>
   These days, is there anyone who calls her Mrs. anymore?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms.,'' she said loudly, looking up from her chair and squaring
her shoulders. ``Or just Betty Friedan.''

ANALYSIS: NEED FOR BREAKUP OF MICROSOFT STILL UNPROVEN TO MANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legal protest that Microsoft filed Wednesday in reply to the
government's plan to break up the company is an essay of grim
futurism.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls the government plan a ``draconian'' and
``speculative'' proposal that would bring ``uncertainty and
chaos.'' Employees, the company says, would leave in droves. Its
business would be destroyed, and the industry and consumers would
``suffer enormous harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The apocalyptic passages seem intended to warn Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft would be a dangerous
gamble to take with a company that is a pillar of the nation's
high-technology economy. Such a step would be particularly risky,
Microsoft insists, because it is ``legally baseless'' _ out of all
proportion with the evidence in the antitrust trial and even with
Jackson's ruling that Microsoft is a monopoly that illegally used
its market power.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy phase of a federal antitrust trial is far more art
than science. The enforcement provisions say simply that the
sanctions should ``prevent and restrain'' the monopolist from
violating the law. The court's first task is to restore
competition, but the remedies should not entail unacceptable costs.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, lawyers and technical experts can all offer their
views. But in the end, the court must make a difficult judgment _
both about what may happen in the future and about the corporate
character of Microsoft. What will it take to restrain the
monopolist? Slice it up? Shackle it with harsh curbs on its
conduct? Mandate more modest conduct remedies?
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has to make an informed hunch about how things are
likely to play out,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the
University of Iowa law school. ``It's not really some exact
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's filing, in a sense, is the latest salvo in its
long-running legal battle with the government to define the scope
of the antitrust case. Much of Microsoft's future will hinge on
whether the courts eventually lean toward the software maker's
narrower definition of the case or the government's broader one.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's view, the case against it is quite limited. The
suit, as the company sees it, centers on its product-design
decision to fold Internet-browsing software into its Windows
operating system, and on some of its contracts with industry
partners and rivals. Jackson ruled that Microsoft illegally tied
its browser to its monopoly product, its Windows operating system,
and that some of its contracts were an illegal use of its monopoly
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to appeal Jackson's ruling against it.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's view, the so-called browser war that pitted
Microsoft against Netscape Communications Corp., an Internet
pioneer now part of America Online, is a central portion of the
case, yet one episode among many. When the suit was filed by the
Justice Department and state attorneys general in May 1998, it
spoke of Microsoft's tactics against Netscape as part of a
``pattern of practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the case went to trial in October 1998, the government
added evidence involving dealings with Intel, Apple, Sun
Microsystems and others. Microsoft protested that the new evidence
should not be admitted, but Jackson allowed it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the government asserted, was a repeat offender of the
nation's antitrust laws. When the government submitted its proposed
remedies two weeks ago, it warned that Microsoft was again on the
march. The government said Microsoft was trying to use its monopoly
in personal computer desktop operating systems to unfairly gain an
advantage in the markets for handheld devices like Palm digital
assistants and for big server machines that power computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's main argument for a breakup,'' said Eleanor
Fox, a professor at New York University law school, ``is that we
can't trust Microsoft _ that it has squeezed out competitors in the
past and it will continue to squeeze out competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cried foul again Wednesday, saying the government's
comments on handheld devices and server computers were beyond the
scope of the trial. If the court was going to consider a breakup or
severe sanctions on its conduct, the company said it would need
months to gather new evidence and testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Wednesday, Microsoft warned that consumers and the
software industry would suffer if the company was split up and its
programmers from various product groups could no longer collaborate
freely. The government has proposed breaking Microsoft into two
companies _ one with the Windows operating-system business, while
the other would get the Office application programs like Word and
the Excel spreadsheet software, as well as most other operations
including the MSN Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives describe a series of examples of teamwork
across the Office and Windows divide. The Office group first
developed the ``tool bar'' feature _ the bar at the bottom of the
Windows desktop with icons for starting different software
applications _ in 1991, but the company's executives decided that
feature should be on all Windows machines. So the group was
transferred to the Windows side of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, 25 programmers from the Office group were moved
over the Windows 2000 development team, after they came up with a
technology codenamed ``Darwin.'' The technology reduced the cost of
installing and managing software across networks of desktop PC's in
corporations and business. ``That sort of cooperation would be
impossible if the government got its way,'' said a senior Microsoft
official. ``The result is that the cost to users would be higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Some benefits of being an integrated software company, computer
experts say, might be lost if Microsoft was split up. But they also
note that Microsoft's Windows business has also bought and borrowed
freely from non-Microsoft software developers.
</P>
<P>
   From Internet software to data compression to multimedia, the
computer experts note, Microsoft has acquired the basic
intellectual property from outside the company and then refined and
improved it. Each of the two companies proposed by the government
would certainly have ample resources to continue acquire new
technology, as they would split Microsoft's $21 billion nestegg of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Office and Windows were separate companies, it's not
obvious that there would be huge efficiency losses,'' said Scott
Winkler, an independent technology consultant in Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts also question the government argument _ that a
breakup is needed because Microsoft, left unchecked, threatens to
use its desktop monopoly to capture the markets for servers and
handheld devices. Microsoft, they note, has made some inroads in
the server market, but it has been unable to compete effectively
against Sun Microsoft, Oracle and IBM, whose industrial-strength
software is the preferred choice of large companies. Similarly,
they add, Microsoft has been unable to dent Palm's dominance in
handhelds, even though those machines must work smoothly with
Windows PC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has proven over and over that owning the desktop
does not guarantee success in adjacent markets,'' said Winkler, the
technology consultant. ``Palm, Sun and Oracle are crushing
Microsoft in other markets.''

VERDICT SHAKES LOUISIANA'S CYNICISM A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
  By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Political corruption in Louisiana did not begin
with Edwin W. Edwards, and it presumably will not end with his
conviction Tuesday on federal racketeering, conspiracy and
extortion charges. But many Louisianians said Wednesday that they
took a certain measure of hope from the jury's firm declaration
that malfeasance would not be tolerated here the way it has been
since the era of Huey Long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good old boy mentality has probably stuck here more than
in any other state,'' said Walt L. Nixon, a 46-year-old Website
designer who was taking a morning cigarette break outside the
Texaco building in downtown New Orleans. ``It's good to see that
things are being exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, a New Orleans native, said that the jury in the former
governor's case sent a clear message, and he predicted that some
Louisiana politicians might actually hear it. ``It'll be very slow
to come around,'' he said, ``but it is a start.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet there was a certain ambivalence in the reaction of many
here Wednesday. Some still expressed a measure of fondness for
Edwards because the four-term governor had done good things for the
state, they said, or simply because he had entertained them for so
long. Some squirmed at the notion that the government might put a
72-year-old man in jail for what could be the rest of his life. And
many said a single conviction, even of such a prominent defendant,
could not erode a wall of cynicism that has been built over
generations. (Even now, Edwards faces a second trial on unrelated
charges and the state's election commissioner and insurance
commissioner are under indictment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' said Paul A. Gauthreaux
Jr., a shipping company manager who was eating lunch on the New
Orleans Riverwalk along the Mississippi, ``but whether or not it'll
change anything, I doubt it. It's been going on for hundreds of
years and one little conviction's not going to make much of a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   One day after the jury in Baton Rouge convicted him on 17 of the
26 counts in his indictment, Edwards was back in court Wednesday as
it considered whether he and three co-defendants would have to
forfeit illicitly gained assets. After several hours of
deliberation, the jury declared that the defendants would forfeit
$2.56 million of the $3.1 million sought by the government. U.S.
District Judge Frank Polozola will determine each defendant's
portion of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, the jury found Edwards, his son Stephen,
and three associates guilty of multiple counts related to the
bidding for coveted state riverboat casino licenses, both during
Edwards' last term in office and after his departure in 1996. He
could receive a total of more than 200 years in prison and be fined
millions of dollars. Using evidence gleaned from wiretaps and
cooperating witnesses, prosecutors in the 17-week trial depicted a
criminal enterprise in which Edwards and his co-defendants demanded
payoffs from businessmen in exchange for the licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards had evaded conviction twice in the 1980s, when he was
twice tried on charges of taking payoffs to help associates win
state hospital licenses. A first trial ended in a mistrial, a
second in acquittal. Those trials helped cement Louisiana's image
as a place where a certain level of corruption would be forgiven,
particularly if the offender was as charming as Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie J. Jordan Jr., the U.S. attorney who oversaw Edwards'
prosecution, took pains Wednesday to declare those days over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we begin the process of reclaiming our state's great
name,'' he said in a news conference in Baton Rouge, after Polozola
lifted a ban on public comments by lawyers in the case. ``Today we
begin the process of restoring confidence in our state's democratic
institutions. Today we begin the process of removing the stain of
corruption that has ruined our state's ability and our state's
reputation as a great place to conduct business.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury's verdict, Jordan concluded, sent the message that
``corruption is not the Louisiana way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Edwards seemed to make that point, saying his convictions
should be ``a reflection on me, not on the people of Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Without making an explicit confession, he also contended that
his crimes bore no financial cost for the state. ``There isn't a
penny missing from the state treasury,'' he said. ``There are no
allegations and certainly no evidence that I at any time took
anything voluntarily from the people of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had a ready response. ``Never is it a victimless crime
when you have a person who has a reputation in state government for
being corrupt because the price we pay is an absence of business
opportunity in this state,'' he said. ``Businesses in their right
mind do not want to come to a state where they know that they will
be shaken down.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Louisiana residents said that the state's reputation would
change only if a steady federal vigilance was maintained.
``Obviously the federal government is not in a position to mount
that kind of prosecution year after year,'' said Richard Ford, the
novelist, who has lived in New Orleans for 10 years. ``There has to
be a `no tolerance' rule.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the verdicts should send a strong signal that
Louisiana politicians can no longer charm their way out of trouble.
``Hopefully, this will send the message that it's not funny
anymore,'' said Jim Brandt, president of the Public Affairs
Research Council of Louisiana.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is a measure of this state's cynicism that many here
expressed surprise at the convictions even as they expressed
certainty about Edwards' guilt. Many also questioned whether he
would spend a day in jail, despite the toughness of the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the convictions wiped away the disillusionment felt by
John Volz, the former U.S. attorney who failed twice to convict
Edwards in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has sort of restored my faith in the ability of
Louisiana citizens to recognize outrageous conduct on the part of
its public officials,'' he said. ``It took 15 years, but justice
has been done.''

FILM DOGGED BY LINKS TO SCIENTOLOGY FOUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LLYWOOD _ The anticult networks are kicking up a fuss.
Discussion on Internet movie sites is picking over the potentially
sinister implications. Anonymous e-mails are whizzing around the
country charging that, among other things, subliminal messages are
being used to recruit unsuspecting moviegoers. Big summer action
movies, filled with stars and special effects, don't often come
with such fascinating accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth,'' starring John Travolta as a 9-foot alien
with talons for fingers, will open in more than 2,000 theaters
nationwide on Friday. As directed by Roger Christian, who most
recently had been the assistant director of ``Star Wars: Episode I
_ The Phantom Menace,'' ``Battlefield Earth'' is set in the year
3000 and follows the adventures of enslaved earthlings, led by
Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (played by Barry Pepper, the sharpshooting
redneck in ``Saving Private Ryan''), trying to break free of the
tyrannical Psychlos (led by Travolta's character).
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has swirled around the film because it is based on
the 1982 novel by L. Ron Hubbard, who founded the Church of
Scientology, and because the film was the pet project of Travolta,
who has made no secret of his dedication to Scientology. Could this
be a sneaky attempt to lure unsuspecting moviegoers into
Scientology?
</P>
<P>
   The makers of the film and its distributors maintain that
``Battlefield Earth'' has nothing whatever to do with the Church of
Scientology and that it is intended to be nothing more than a big
summer adventure, devoid of subterfuge.
</P>
<P>
   But several anticult Web sites have posted warnings about the
film in recent months that contain numerous charges. For example
Cultwatch and Factnet say that the film carries subliminal messages
meant to lure people into Scientology, that the film was secretly
financed by Scientology, and that Scientology plans recruiting
efforts to coincide with the movi's release.
</P>
<P>
   Scientology has been a flashpoint for controversy almost since
its founding in 1954, but particularly in the last quarter-century
as some former members charged that they had been bilked and
sometimes mistreated by officials of what many refer to as a
moneymaking cult. Scientology, which says it is a nondenominational
religious organization that helps its members reach a state of
mental and spiritual clarity, has vigorously denied all such
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers will distribute the film in the United States in
an arrangement with Franchise Pictures, an independent production
company. Franchise had its first major release earlier this year,
the mob comedy ``The Whole Nine Yards.'' There have been no charges
that Franchise is affiliated with Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have licensed the book as one would license any property,
but there is no financial connection with the church,'' said Lora
Drazen, a Franchise spokeswoman. No money made from the film would
go to the Church of Scientology, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the film seems to have come about because of Travolta's
dedication to the story and because it meshed with Franchise's
strategy of attracting top stars by offering them a chance to make
their dream projects.
</P>
<P>
   Scientology officials maintain that they have nothing to do with
the making of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things I know about the movie are what I read in the
media,'' said Marty Rathbun, a Scientology spokesman in Los
Angeles. He added that the Church of Scientology has no financial
interest in the movie and had nothing to do with how it was made.
</P>
<P>
   Are there subliminal messages in the movie? ``There are none,''
Drazen said.
</P>
<P>
   Subliminal messages, visual or audio snippets inserted into a
film so rapidly that the mind does not consciously register them,
are believed by some to create a kind of hypnotic suggestion.
Research, however, has repeatedly failed to show that subliminal
messages have any such effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth'' is not a Scientology text, the filmmakers
say, but an adventure that just happened to be written by the man
who founded Scientology. Though some of Scientology's teachings
revolve around space aliens, they bear no resemblance to the story
of the evil Psychlos.
</P>
<P>
   James Richardson, a professor of sociology and law at the
University of Nevada at Reno who studies new religions, said
Hubbard's novel had little bearing on the organization's teachings.
``I read it and thought it was a pretty good yarn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement accompanying the film's production notes Travolta
said: ``People have asked me if there is a connection between
`Battlefield Earth' and Scientology. There is no connection. L. Ron
Hubbard wrote numerous science-fiction epics, which created the
same kind of excitement amid sci-fi circles as such classics as
Robert Heinlein's `Stranger in a Strange Land' and Frank Herbert's
`Dune.' Other than being created by the same person, the two have
virtually nothing to do with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Krane, who has been producing Travolta's films for 15
years, was also one of the producers on ``Battlefield Earth,''
describes the film's genesis in a sample chapter for a book he is
writing about filmmaking. The 20-page entry on the making of
``Battlefield Earth'' is meant to be the book's final chapter,
using a case study of the film to illustrate all the points made in
the preceding chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta had wanted to make a film based on Hubbard's book since
its publication, when the actor hoped to play the young human hero.
But it was not until three years ago, Krane writes, that the actor
believed that it was time to use his box-office clout to bring the
project to fruition. So many years had passed, though, that an
aging Travolta felt he needed to play the villain instead.
</P>
<P>
   Krane, who noted that he was not a member of Scientology, said
that he respected Travolta's devotion to the group but believed it
had nothing to do with the decision to make the movie.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged when asked whether a controversy might distract from
the movie's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said. ``The only time it comes up is
when the media asks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few weeks will tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine the movie will rise or fall based on how good a yarn
it is,'' said Richardson, the professor. ``I seriously doubt that
someone is going to go out and join Scientology just because they
see this movie.''

`NINE INCH NAILS': STILL DRAWING POWER FROM DESPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man looks within himself and finds he has lost his
soul. He feels pointless, disgusted with his animal impulses,
bitter, furious. He turns to others, but they abuse him or betray
him. He examines authority and sees only cruelty and corruption; he
cannot feel any faith. He lashes out, but that brings no
satisfaction. He seeks oblivion, but stops short of suicide. In the
end he decides simply to endure. If life is purgatory, at least the
pain is real.
</P>
<P>
   No one is better than Trent Reznor at turning such desolate
nihilism into arena rock. Leading his band, Nine Inch Nails, at
Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night, Reznor used both brute
force and finesse to bring out the shadings of torment in his
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Inch Nails became one of the most influential bands of the
1990s by adding melody to the jackbooted beat, dance-music
synthesizers and hard-rock guitars of industrial rock, while the
words shouted the secrets of adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor's persona was a sympathetic character at the center of
the onslaught, trying to stay honest even when the whole world was
lined up against him. While pop's mainstream is too busy boasting
and flirting to admit any insecurities, Reznor still knows where
they hide.
</P>
<P>
   His 1999 album, ``The Fragile'' (Nothing/Interscope), is a
meticulously arranged studio creation, and he did not try to
reproduce it from the stage. Instead he pared down most songs to
their blunt essentials: beats, keyboard riffs, power chords and his
voice, howling or gasping its bleak insights. Drum machines or
human muscle stomped a beat; synthesizers zapped out riffs; guitars
played power chords as unswerving as granite cliffs. There were
sudden, explosive crescendos and pockets of silence that were just
as startling.
</P>
<P>
   To reflect the stark power of the music, the musicians were
small figures in semidarkness, dwarfed by video screens and
scaffolding and surrounded by white lights that repeatedly blasted
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor has enough hard-riffing singalongs to fill an entire set.
But he also chose to play some of the more elaborate songs on ``The
Fragile,'' including ``La Mer'' and ``The Great Below,'' with a
long instrumental section. As majestic images of water and then
flames (by the video artist Bill Viola) played above the band, the
music built inexorably from a modest piano ostinato to a quiet
march, without the album's effects but with its suspense; a simple
drumbeat, long absent, entered like a thunderclap. It was art-rock
to rival Pink Floyd or the Cure.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor has not entirely given up on human fellowship.
Introducing the viciously mocking song that has been retitled
``Starsuckers Inc.'' for its release as a single, he said it was
about ``a friend,'' and then the friend it denounced, Marilyn
Manson, joined him onstage, publicly ending a long feud. ( Manson
has also directed the video clip for the song.) Nine Inch Nails
then backed Manson singing his own song, ``The Beautiful People'';
his growl and rasp sounded crude after Reznor's finely modulated
despair.
</P>
<P>
   But Reznor retained the last word, and it was solitary. Lighted
from below to make his eye sockets look hollow, he intoned
``Hurt,'' a catalog of self-loathing. But the song ended with a
quiet vow: ``If I could start again, I would find a way.''

HOUSE BILL WOULD PREVENT STATES FROM TAXING INTERNET USE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a Republican bid to woo the high-technology
industry and please taxpayers, the House on Wednesday rushed to the
floor and then handily passed a bill to extend the current
moratorium on new Internet taxes until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium, which is due to expire in October 2001, forbids
states from trying to find new ways of taxing Internet use, like
imposing taxes on monthly access charges for Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed Wednesday, which faces an uncertain
future in the Senate, does not directly address the question of
sales taxes; it would not stop states from trying to collect taxes
for goods sold on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By failing to address sales taxes, however, the measure alarmed
some state governments and traditional retailers, who say they have
found it nearly impossible to collect taxes for goods sold online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single largest contributor to our economic prosperity has
been the growth of information technology _ the Internet,'' said
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``Why would we try to tax something, why
would we try to abuse something, why would we try to limit
something that generates unprecedented growth, wealth, opportunity
and unprecedented individual power?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill say the moratorium, while seemingly benign,
ignores the thorny question of how state and local governments can
best collect taxes on the billions of dollars of merchandise sold
over the Internet each year. These taxes are expected to provide a
crucial future source of revenue for states, especially as more
consumers buy goods online.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents _ a consortium of retailers, small-business
groups and governors _ say that consumers who buy merchandise over
the Internet can easily circumvent the patchwork of sales and
``use'' taxes that would be collected automatically if the same
merchandise were bought at a bricks-and-mortar retail store.
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association is working on the best way
to collect electronic sales tax. Some estimates have put the loss
in sales tax revenue to the states at $8 billion a year by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and small businesses have complained that the current
system unfairly places at a disadvantage traditional retailers that
do not sell their wares online and must charge sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to imagine how these kinds of losses can affect
state and local governments' ability to provide essential
services,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., citing the
concerns of many Republican governors. ``They will be compelled to
cut back local services or raise income taxes or property taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill even drew criticism from a few Republicans. Rep. Ernest
Istook of Oklahoma circulated a letter stating, ``The Internet
should not be singled out to be taxed, nor to be freed from tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the House voted overwhelmingly, 352 to 75, to pass the
bill. A number of Democrats approved the measure after they
received assurance that Congress would hold hearings on the
question of sales taxes and would try to come up with a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium ``has absolutely nothing to do with the sales tax
_ we will have the opportunity to have that debate,'' said Rep.
Robert Goodlatte, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill faces a murkier future in the Senate. Sen. John
McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee, who advocates a
permanent tax moratorium, canceled a hearing on the bill last month
after Republican senators, some of them former governors, expressed
reservations about the extension of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also faces opposition from the Clinton
administration, which signaled support Wednesday for a two-year
moratorium. The full House Wednesday rejected a two-year extension
in a separate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee,
has said he would support an extension of the moratorium. But the
governor must tread carefully around the issue because Texas, which
does not have a state income tax, would stand to lose substantial
revenue if sales taxes are not made workable on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Al Gore said the vice president supported a
two-year extension of the moratorium ``at a minimum.'' If a
five-year moratorium is put into place, ``it should include
flexibility'' to adjust federal policies on Internet taxation ``to
take into account the fast-paced change in the Internet world.''

INTRODUCING MONGOLIA TO MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mongolians are coming.
</P>
<P>
   OK, some of them are already here: in the 1950s, thousands who
fled Communist persecution sought refuge in the New York
metropolitan area, making it the largest Mongolian community
outside Asia.
</P>
<P>
   So, here come the reinforcements. Beginning on May 19, New York
will be host to the first Festival of Mongolia in the United
States. The citywide celebration is seemingly as vast as the
Mongolian steppes, offering more than 21 events and programs over
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities will encompass everything from Mongolia's
greatest paleontological treasures _ its fighting Gobi Desert
dinosaur fossils _ to archery, wrestling and steppe dancing. The
participants range from the American Museum of Natural History to
the Metropolitan Museum, from the Children's Museum of Manhattan to
the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   But why Mongolia? Why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here for 40 years, and we thought it was about time
for us to introduce ourselves,'' said Enkhsaikhan Jargalsaikhany,
Mongolia's ambassador to the United Nations, whose mission
organized the events. His father, Bayar, established Mongolia's
mission to the United Nations in the early 1960s. ``With this
festival we hope to start a dialogue with the Western world.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival is an announcement to the world that Mongolia has
declared its independence and is fighting to create a democracy.
For New Yorkers, it is a chance to discover Mongolian dumplings,
Mongolian vodka, Mongolian beer and Mongolian fashion. For the
region's Mongolian-Americans, the festival is a chance for
reconnection with the ancestral homeland after seven decades of
Russian-dominated Cold War isolation.
</P>
<P>
   For its first two days the festival will occupy the East Meadow
in Central Park where Mongolian professional wrestlers will
grapple, and archers with traditional short bows will exhibit their
time-honored skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parks Department is happy to facilitate Mongolia's first
coming-out party since Genghis Khan,'' said Henry J. Stern, the
parks commissioner, who has not ruled out a sartorial encounter
with the del (pronounced ``daill''), the Mongolian long robe
fastened with buttons at the neck and accented with a bright waist
sash.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the festival's centerpiece exhibition will be
``Fighting Dinosaurs: New Discoveries from Mongolia,'' opening May
19 in the third-floor galleries of the American Museum of Natural
History. Displayed for the first time in North America will be one
of the world's most famous fossil finds: two dinosaurs interlocked
in mortal combat, thought to have been preserved in their dying
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil, a designated national treasure of Mongolia, depicts
an 80-million-year-old feather-covered Velociraptor (the predator
made famous in ``Jurassic Park'') battling a shield-headed, pebbly
skinned Protoceratops. ``It is likely that both were buried alive
in a collapsing sand dune,'' said Michael J. Novacek, senior vice
president and provost of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Novacek said that last spring, Enkhsaikhan offered to make a
five-month loan of the fighting dinosaurs to the museum. The museum
seized on this opportunity to create what he said was the most
elaborate presentation of dinosaur behavior ever mounted, including
50 other new fossils from Mongolia, most never shown before to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Across the park, the Metropolitan Museum is offering ``Images of
the Mongolian Horse in Islamic Art,'' an exhibition that continues
through Sept. 24. The 25 works of art focus on the now nearly
extinct Mongolian horse, a small, tireless, rugged steed that
furthered Genghis Khan's conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Uptown, the Children's Museum of Manhattan will be host to a
series of cultural programs, its Mongolia Festival Weekend, on May
26 and 27. Across the river, the Bronx Zoo will highlight the
Wildlife Conservation Society's efforts to preserve endangered
species in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to put Mongolia on the map,'' said Enkhsaikhan, a
49-year-old veteran diplomat and former international lawyer.
Mongolia has, of course, been very much on the map _ in the 13th
century, Mongolians ruled the largest land empire in history _ but
some New Yorkers tend to be more than a bit hazy about it all, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolia is a country nearly three times the size of France,
with a population of 2.4 million, half of whom are nomads who herd
goats, sheep, camels, yaks and horses in a way that has not changed
all that much since the time of Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador added that Mongolia is not only a land of harsh
deserts, but also a country of conifer forests and teeming
wildlife, one of the few places left in the world where visitors
can still view 30,000 gazelles gathering on a hillside. About 12
percent of the land is environmentally protected in a national
park, and Mongolia has the largest surviving population of snow
leopards, some 600.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is trying to overcome the effects of seven decades of
Communist rule. More urgently, Mongolia is still recovering from
the effects of a devastatingly cold storm that killed more than a
million head of livestock this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolia has also suffered from nearly a millennium of bad
press, because since the 13th century Genghis Khan ``has been
demonized,'' said Dr. Robert D. McChesney, professor of Middle
Eastern studies and history at New York University, ``and his name
is now synonymous with conqueror and oppressor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Genghis Khan, who dominated a third of the known world, also
created a postal system like the pony express, and he left a system
of consultative government. McChesney said he is now viewed by
Mongolians as both their George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

A YIDDISH FESTIVAL STAKES A CLAIM IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Conn., Mass., Neb., Canada, Argentina, Germany,
Israel, Mexico, France, Poland)   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly eight years ago, Aaron Paley and several
friends began a reading group in Yiddish, a language that he
learned from his parents while growing up in the San Fernando
Valley. By 1995 Paley, an arts festival organizer, decided to
create a daylong event celebrating Yiddish at a Jewish community
center in suburban Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected a few hundred people, and 6,000 showed up,'' said
Paley, 42. ``It was a wake-up call to all of us that there was a
huge interest in Yiddish that had not been tapped. The language had
been marginalized. It wasn't taught. It was seen as kind of
nostalgic. There was no serious approach to Yiddish or Yiddish
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to look back, we wanted to look forward. There
was something important to say today.''
</P>
<P>
   From those beginnings Paley helped create the largest festival
in the nation honoring Yiddish, the 1,000-year-old language of the
Jews of Eastern Europe. It is a language and, perhaps more
important, a culture that is viewed at the festival as
unsentimental, vibrant, emotional and alive.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, called ``Yiddishkayt Los Angeles,'' takes place
this year from Sunday to May 21 at theaters, museums and
synagogues. Its partners and sponsors range from the City of Los
Angeles and the Los Angeles Arts Commission to theaters and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is part of what seems to be a general resurgent
interest in Yiddish. In New Haven, Conn., the Yale Repertory Co. is
staging a student project, ``The People Versus `The God of
Vengeance,''' by Rebecca Taichman, who attends Yale Drama School.
The play is about a 1923 obscenity trial involving a Yiddish drama,
``The God of Vengeance,'' by Sholem Asch.
</P>
<P>
   Like Los Angeles, New York seems to be witnessing a Yiddish
revival. Pearl Gluck, director of literary programs at the Jewish
Community Center in Manhattan, said that summer programs and
Yiddish classes were proliferating around the city, and that poetry
readings, film series and music festivals involving Jewish culture
were now taking place, especially on the Lower East Side. ``There's
definitely a reattention to Yiddish and the culture around it,''
said Gluck, who will show parts of her film, ``Divan, (The
Couch),'' about her own Hasidic history, at the Los Angeles
festival.
</P>
<P>
   This festival is unusual for its Los Angeles-style blend of
tradition and artiness, including experimental dances with Yiddish
themes, klezmer music with modernist influences, and a performance
by a satirical comedian and juggler, Sara Felder, who grew up in
Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, without knowing too much Yiddish but who
took a crash course at Columbia University four years ago to
immerse herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't learn Yiddish, who will?'' asked Felder, 41, who
lives in San Francisco. ``If I don't preserve this culture, who
will do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Felder described herself, as she does in her act, as a
contemporary lesbian American Jewish juggler. ``It's my own niche,
and I'm proud of it,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly John Malashock, a choreographer who spent years
dancing with the Twyla Tharp Dance troupe in New York and has
worked with Lar Lubovitch, Anna Sokolow and Donald McKayle, has
created a dance called ``Blessings and Curses.'' The dance, about a
weaver, uses Yiddish and Sephardic folk songs, cantorial music and
contemporary classics. (Karen Hartman, a playwright, wrote the
story.)
</P>
<P>
   Malashock, who was raised in San Diego and Omaha, Neb., said
that he had grown up knowing only a handful of Yiddish words, but
that he deeply immersed himself in Jewish culture when his son,
Duncan, was studying for his bar mitzvah four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work I'm now doing is rooted in Jewish culture, some of it
Yiddish culture, some of it Hebrew culture,'' said Malashock, 49.
``I grew up in a fairly secular atmosphere. Honestly, it wasn't hip
to identify yourself by religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet I have a longing _ and I think a lot of artists are the
same _ to go back and explore your background.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Nobel Prize-winning author who wrote
in Yiddish, once described it as perhaps the only language never
spoken by men in power. Once the lingua franca of Jews over most
parts of the world, Yiddish arose from a number of German dialects
in the ghettoes of Central Europe. Its essentially German
vocabulary has been broadened over the centuries with traces of
Hebrew, Slavic, Romanian and French.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Eli Katz, who teaches Yiddish at the University of
California at Berkeley, said there had been a distinct revival of
interest in the language in recent years, and perhaps greater
interest in the culture of Eastern European Jews before the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of Yiddish, he said, occurred ironically and
tragically on the eve of the Holocaust, when it was spoken by
millions. At the same time a significant literature was being
created in cities like Warsaw, Vilnius and New York. Before
Germany's annihilation of 6 million Jews, Yiddish was the tongue of
more than 11 million people. Today, by to several accounts, Yiddish
is spoken by perhaps 4 million Jews, mostly in the United States,
Canada, Argentina, Israel, Mexico, France and several countries in
Eastern Europe. Many more understand words and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Katz and several artists connected to the Los Angeles festival
said the revival of interest stemmed from such factors as nostalgia
and an effort to reclaim ethnic heritage often overlooked in past
generations' rush to assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles festival takes place in a polyglot city that
has, in comparison to New York, a smaller, although pronounced,
Jewish influence. There are 519,000 Jews in the Los Angeles area,
and 1.45 million Jews in New York, according to the 1999 American
Jewish Yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Paley, who has worked in New York, and is founder and executive
director of Community Arts Resources, probably the pre-eminent
festival organizer in Los Angeles, said putting on such a festival
in New York would prove difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the center of the Jewish world in this country,'' he
said. ``New York is.'' As a result, various old-line organizations
that have sought to perpetuate Yiddish, like the Workmen's Circle,
Yivo (the Yiddish Institute for Jewish Research) and The Forward, a
weekly newspaper, might want to involve themselves in such a
festival, he said. ``But there are issues of turf and issues of
politics, which we don't have in Los Angeles,'' said Paley.
``Sometimes it's more difficult to pull things off in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The interplay of music is a dominant theme of the festival. One
klezmer group, Brave Old World, which has generated strong reviews
in recent years, mixes the traditional dance and wedding music of
Eastern European Jews with modern and original compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Alpert, a vocalist and violinist with the group, grew up
in Los Angeles and Boston. He said the klezmer revival in the 1970s
and '80s came about after several decades in which it was simply
too painful for younger American-Jewish artists to explore their
European heritage because of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a deliberate attempt to replace Yiddish identity in
particular with an identification with Israel and Israeli
culture,'' Alpert said. Perhaps Alex Haley's book ``Roots'' as well
as the movement among blacks seeking a national identity led Jews
in some ways to do the same, Alpert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, ethnicity and one's ethnic identity has become
hip,'' he said. ``Yiddish has become hip.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Wednesday that he
was separating from his wife, Donna Hanover. He said that as he
battles prostate cancer he will need Judith Nathan, the woman he
describes as a ``very good'' friend, ``more now than maybe I did
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not say whether he would continue his race for the
U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but he did say that his
political career was not at the moment his first concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about politics right now,'' Giuliani said.
``I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and what can
be done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best.
I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second,
maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself
out some way politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary news conference in Bryant Park, Giuliani
spoke at length to reporters about his relationships with his wife
and Nathan. He spoke in a soft voice with downcast eyes as he
tightly gripped both sides of the lectern. The mayor described his
emotional state as ``sad'' and then added, ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Hanover appeared outside the gates of Gracie
Mansion and, with a wavering voice and tears in her eyes, said:
``Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to
keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary, said that Hanover
was referring to Cristyne F. Lategano, Giuliani's former
communications director who is now president of NYC &AMP; Company, the
city's tourism bureau. Friends of Hanover said on Wednesday that
she had described the relationship between her husband and Lategano
as ``intimate'' while Lategano worked at City Hall. The mayor has
denied having had a romantic relationship with Lategano, who left
City Hall last May and married Nicholas Nicholas, a sports writer,
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover also said that ``beginning last May, I made a major
effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of
our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose
another path. Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a
legal separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover added that she and the couple's children, Andrew, 14,
and Caroline, 10, will continue to live at Gracie Mansion, the
mayor's official residence, ``for at least the next few months''
because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano issued this statement on Wednesday: ``I have no desire
to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the statement that
she did. Understandably, this is a difficult time. I wish both the
mayor and Donna Hanover a successful resolution.'' Lategano added
that she was ``proud'' to have worked for Giuliani, and that he
``is and will continue to be one of the greatest mayors in our
city's history.''

   DETROIT _ The odds were impossibly high, but the jackpot was
higher. Even so, two winners, one in Michigan and one in Illinois,
beat the odds and will share the biggest lottery jackpot ever in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said neither winner of the $366 million,
seven-state drawing, called the Big Game, came forward Wednesday
after Tuesday night's drawing. They have a year to do so.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks the race to capture the surging jackpot sent people in
Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey
and Virginia rushing to liquor stores and gas stations, all with
the hope of becoming the 1 out of 76 million lucky enough to match
all six numbers and win the record prize.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and Big Money Ball 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping I would be the one,'' said George Kassab, the
owner of Mr. K's Party Shoppe near Utica, about 20 miles north of
Detroit, where the winning Michigan ticket was bought. Kassab
bought 20 tickets himself. But he will have to settle for a $2,000
bonus check from lottery officials for selling more than 5,000 Big
Game tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan lottery officials said that they received a call from a
man who appeared to have the winning ticket, but that he would not
give details about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Kattola, a clerk at Mr. K's , said the store also received
a call from a man identifying himself as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he only spent $100 and it was his first time playing
ever,'' Kattola said, adding, ``I hope he gives us a big tip.''
</P>
<P>
   While Illinois lottery officials were also trying to determine
the identity of the winner there, they were able to award one prize
Wednesday: a $1.8 million check to John Sweeney, the owner of a gas
station in the Chicago suburb of Lake Zurich, where the other
winning ticket was bought.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois awards 1 percent of the jackpot to the store owner who
sells the winning ticket; other states, like Michigan, give only
nominal bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always joked that it's been one of my dreams to sell a
winning lottery ticket,'' said Ginny Gallagher, the assistant
manager who sold the winning ticket and spent most of Wednesday
talking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said officials had determined that the ticket was sold
between 1 and 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business here has always been good,'' she said. ``Now it's
just going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, probably, will life for the anonymous millionaire ticket
holders. The winners will probably take home about $7 million a
year for the next 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the nation was gripped by such record lottery
frenzy was two years ago, when 13 Ohio machinists shared a $295.7
million Powerball jackpot. In December the Spanish lottery El
Gordo, or the Fat One, set a world lottery record of $1.2 billion.
But unlike the Big Game jackpot, El Gordo spreads the jackpot out
among thousands of winners.

   NEW YORK _ Isaac Stern has coached budding violin virtuosos for
decades, but the students he took on Wednesday were a different
breed altogether: New York City's 43 school superintendents, most
of whom had never touched a violin before.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson took place at Carnegie Hall, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just put the violin on the shoulder, voomp!'' Stern said,
lifting his own delicate instrument to the proper position as the
school administrators looked on.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a problem!'' one superintendent exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard!'' chimed in another.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who is 79 and all of five feet tall, was undeterred. He
gazed around the room and shouted advice. ``You've got it on the
wrong shoulder, darling,'' he told one bewildered student.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Levy, the interim chancellor, had persuaded Stern to give
the superintendents a lesson in hopes that they would place a
higher priority on music instruction for students. The lesson was
part of a broader plan to raise the level of intellectual debate
among the school system's leaders and make them more culturally
attuned.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson came directly after the superintendents' monthly
meeting with Levy, at which they started off the day hashing out
plans for summer school. After lunch, they filed into a practice
room at Carnegie Hall and listened nervously as Stern told them
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Levy himself did not take part in the lesson _ he recently
injured one of his hands and was wearing a soft cast Wednesday. He
left the meeting early, aides said, to accompany his son Noah's
class at the Dalton School on a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Levi, one of Levy's top aides, was on hand to make
sure the lesson went semi-smoothly. Levi, an accomplished
violinist, adjusted people's fingers, tucked instruments more
firmly under chins and practically pulsed with delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac Stern has been a hero of mine since I was a little
kid,'' said Levi, whose musical claim to fame is having taught the
actress Jennifer Aniston how to play the violin when she was
growing up in New York City. ``If only we could get him certified,
we'd have him teaching in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the half-hour lesson, the superintendents had
participated in several rounds of ``Ach, du Lieber Augustin'' _ a
German folk song, better known in this country as ``Did You Ever
See a Lassie?'' Stern played most of the song, and the
superintendents joined in on the last two notes of each line.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the superintendents initially seemed less than
happy to be taking part in the musical exercise, by the end of the
lesson they were begging to play the song one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Paula LeCompte Speed, whose finger position was so contorted
that Stern hopped off his conductor's platform to give her some
personal attention, said after the lesson that she wanted to keep
her violin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited to be in his presence,'' she said of Stern.
``And I thought I did pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Board of Education has worked hard to increase arts
instruction in city schools in recent years, many still lack
full-time music teachers and instruments for students to play. Levy
has put his friend Levi to work raising money for school music
programs and increasing the number of partnerships between schools
and cultural organizations like Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said Wednesday that he was thrilled to contribute, adding
that music ``is the biggest key I know to a truly educated life.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to the superintendents about the importance of music
education before and after the lesson, exhorting them to make it a
priority at all 1,100 of the city's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't start with you, who the hell will it start
with?'' he said. ``I would like this to be the beginning of us
talking together on a regular basis.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While continuing to reject the antitrust findings
against it, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday offered a series of narrow
restrictions on its behavior that it said would be more appropriate
remedies than breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also asked the judge to throw out the government's
breakup proposal immediately, arguing that ``the laws and the facts
do not support such a radical step.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's counterproposal is a four-year plan largely
governing its relations with computer makers and software
developers.
</P>
<P>
   In its court filing, Microsoft said that if the government's
breakup plan were adopted, its employees might ``leave the company
in droves.'' In that were to happen, Microsoft continued, ``the
company's entire business would be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such passages seemed clearly intended to warn U.S. District
Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft
would be a dangerous gamble to take with a pillar of the nation's
high-technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is no basis for the government's
unprecedented breakup proposal,'' said Bill Gates, the company's
chairman, ``and we are hopeful that the court will dismiss this
excessive demand immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion for summary rejection was added unexpectedly to the
company's formal response to the remedy proposal offered last month
by the Justice Department and 17 states. In the motion, Microsoft
argued that since the company achieved its monopoly position by
legal means, the government has no right ``to dismember
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   After four years of investigation and 19 months of litigation,
the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed on
April 28 that Microsoft be broken into two companies. One would
hold the Windows operating system, the other everything else,
including the Office suite of application programs like Word and
Excel. Two of the 19 states joining in the suit _ Ohio and Illinois
_ advocated steps short of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled on April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of
the nation's antitrust laws. But if he chose to break up the
company, it would be one of only a few instances the last hundred
years when a major national company was broken apart as a result of
an antitrust case _ and the only one resulting from court order
rather than a consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, the federal and state governments are entitled to
reply to Wednesday's filing from Microsoft. And then during a
remedies hearing on May 24, both the government and Microsoft will
offer arguments in support of their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, the Justice Department said that
``Microsoft's proposal is ineffective and filled with loopholes.''
Among the loopholes, the department added, the proposal would not
prevent ``attempts to divide markets with competitors; retaliation
against personal computer manufacturers and software developers
that support non-Microsoft technologies; or tying to require PC
manufacturers to ship other Microsoft products with Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who leads the states that
are joining in the suit, said: ``The remedies proposed are
inadequate. These measures would not have prevented the serious
violations of law found by Judge Jackson, and they are not adequate
remedies to assure that the law is not broken in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Microsoft's leaders have repeatedly said there
there was a ``church and state'' separation within the company
between the Windows group and the others that develop applications
programs like Office.
</P>
<P>
   But in Wednesday's filing, Microsoft said: ``Cross pollination
between engineers working on different products such as Windows and
Office has led to numerous innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that the company's success and attendant benefits for
consumers ``would not have been possible but for Microsoft's
unified structure, which enables Microsoft to conceive and
implement new ideas that span operating systems and applications.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday's filing, Microsoft offered its own
proposed remedies, a collection of rules that would modify the
company's conduct, while reiterating its conviction to appeal the
case, even if its remedy proposal were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's proposals are similar to those in the
government plan, though they are more narrowly focused on specific
complaints raised in the trial. Along with the breakup plan, the
government wants to impose about a dozen rules intended to moderate
Microsoft's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's proposed conduct restrictions fall far short of the
government's, and the company explained: ``Courts are not
authorized in civil enforcement proceedings to punish antitrust
defendants. Instead, relief must extend no farther than is
necessary to redress the conduct found to be unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposals included several significant concessions.
Among them, Microsoft would have to take these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree not to discriminate in the release of technical
information about Windows to outside software developers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow computer manufacturers to make ``non-Microsoft Web
browsing software the default browser on a new personal computer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree not to threaten to withhold a license for Windows from a
computer maker featuring products by a Microsoft competitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enter into no exclusive deals that offer other companies
favored treatment in Windows in exchange for agreements to feature
only Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree not to condition the release of its software intended
for non-Microsoft operating systems, like Apple Computer's, on the
other company's agreement not to distribute or promote competitors'
software.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department complained in its statement that
Microsoft's remedies would not ``prevent the company from using its
monopoly power in the future to engage in the same kind of illegal
behavior to crush new innovations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the department promoted its own plan, saying it would
``address the serious violations found by the court'' by
``stimulating competition and innovation, leading to better
products and lower prices for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the government's additional remedy proposals are a
requirement that Microsoft, if it adds certain new programs or
features to Windows, sell a version of Windows at a discount with
that new feature hidden or removed; a requirement that Microsoft
publish a uniform price list for Windows; and a ban on design
strategies that are intended to compromise or disable other
programs that run on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also offered a proposed schedule for remedy hearings,
a sliding scale that calls for longer proceedings if the judge
chooses to consider the government remedy proposals that Microsoft
considers most onerous.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson chooses to consider the government's plan to break up
the company, Microsoft said it would need six months to prepare for
an extensive remedies trial that would begin in early December.
</P>
<P>
   Other options _ accepting some parts of the government plan but
not others _ would bring delays of weeks or months, under the
Microsoft plan.
</P>
<P>
   While attending a convention in New Orleans on Wednesday, Steven
A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said flatly: ``Our company
will not be broken up. It will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has said he wants to complete the remedy phase by the
end of May. But Microsoft lawyers made clear when Jackson proposed
his fast-track timetable in April that the company could not agree
until it had seen the government plan.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cited one government demand as one justification for
its proposed delays: a proposal requiring Microsoft to share
technical information about Windows with other software companies
that is far more sweeping than Microsoft's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for deliberate procedures is especially strong
because much of the intellectual property the government seeks to
confiscate relates to products and technologies, such as Windows
2000, that were not even mentioned at trial,'' one of the company's
briefs says. ``If the company intends to consider such draconian
relief, Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said, ``The government's proposal would take away
Microsoft's property'' even though ``Microsoft spent millions of
dollars to develop these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Microsoft documents, the company makes the case
that it is a national asset, central to the nation's economy, so
that disturbing Microsoft would be unfortunate for both the
American people and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has reaped substantial benefits from Microsoft's
development of Windows and other software products,'' the company
said. ``Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that they entire
United States economy has benefited from Microsoft's efforts. Such
benefits would be put at risk were this court to order that
Microsoft be broken up into separate companies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the filing, Microsoft fell $1.625 to $66.1875 on the
Nasdaq market. In after-hours trading, the shares dipped as low as
$65, reaching the company's 52-week low, before rising slightly to
$65.50.

ATTENTION GROWS ON INTERNET FRAUD AS ONLINE AUCTION SITE CANCELS
PAINTING SALE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By SAUL HANSELL and JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EBay, the online auction house, Wednesday canceled the sale of
an abstract painting to a Dutch computer executive for $135,805,
contending that the seller, Kenneth A. Walton, who listed the item
under the name ``golfpoorly,'' had violated its rules in a way that
artificially inflated the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   The company also suspended three accounts that Walton used to
trade art, accusing him of ``shill bidding,'' meaning that he
entered bids on his own sales. In a phone interview, Walton, a
Sacramento lawyer, acknowledged placing bids on his own objects,
but said he had done so for friends and hadn't realized he had
violated the site's rules.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episode, in which bidding started at a quarter and
was propelled by hints that the painting was by the modern master
Richard Diebenkorn, sheds light on the exponential growth of
chicanery and fraud in Internet auctions, where tens of millions of
people spend billions of dollars a year for everything from modern
art to stuffed zebras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet auctions remains the number one source of consumer
complaints related to their problems online and they vie with
sweepstakes for the top source of fraud overall,'' said Paul Luehr,
the supervisor of the Federal Trade Commission's Internet marketing
unit. Complaints about Internet auctions increased hundred-fold in
the last two years to 10,700 cases in 1999, outstripping even the
rapid growth of the auctions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That represents 15 percent of all complaints the FTC has
compiled from a network of 240 law enforcement and consumer
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The open nature of auction sites like eBay, which let anyone
list an item for a fee of 25 cents to $2, has spawned a wide range
of scams. The most common involve ``sellers'' who receive payments
and never ship the promised goods. In other cases, the items sold
are damaged or otherwise not as described.
</P>
<P>
   But Luehr said a growing number of cases involve rare
collectible items, from baseball cards to photographs, that are
outright forgeries. The items most often are priced at a few
hundred dollars each, although there are dozens of cases where
sellers have defrauded dozens of buyers and made off with $10,000
to $75,000, said Robert Chesnut, eBay's associate general counsel
and a former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Both Luehr and Chesnut say they have seen few formal complaints
about fine art. But many art dealers say that cases of fake art in
online auctions are multiplying, and that most of the sellers have
avoided prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay is one of the greatest avenues for selling questionable
merchandise that's ever been invented,'' said Alan Bamberger, a
private dealer in books and art. ``I go on eBay from time to time
and it only takes me 20 minutes to a half hour to find a scammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing others who have followed the sales, he said that when
someone gets caught, ``they say, `I'm so sorry and return the
money.'' Most likely, he added, they put the item back up for sale
until they find an a buyer who doesn't check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction sites say that fraud represents a tiny fraction of
their sales. EBay, the largest auction site, says that one-tenth of
1 percent of its auctions involve fraud. But in the first three
months of the year, eBay held 53.6 million auctions on which $1.15
billion worth of goods were sold. That implies that some 50,000
eBay auctions involved fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it and say there were 50,000 cases of fraud,''
said Chesnut, ``but there are a lot of companies that would love to
have only one-tenth of 1 percent of their customers to have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and Amazon.com, which run the second and third largest
auction sites, don't release figures but they each handle millions
of auctions a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blackburn, the general manager of Amazon's auctions, said
the total cases of fraud have been ``minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   For inexpensive items, which represent the vast bulk of the
online auction sales, the buyers are only modestly at risk. EBay
offers an insurance policy covering $200 in fraud loss with a $25
deductible. Amazon offers up to $1,000 in fraud coverage with no
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Chesnut also said that big ticket fraud was a relatively small
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see much fraud on the larger dollar items because
people are more careful,'' he said. ``You're not going to send a
check for $130,000 and wait for a painting to appear in the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, stories of fake art for sale online are widespread
</P>
<P>
   Edan Hughes, a California dealer who buys and sells artwork on
the web, said he recently bought what was described as an oil
painting for $9,000. But he received a print instead. ``I fought
them and they gave me my money back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Valiquette, spokesman for the New York office of the FB
I, said that its art theft squad is investigating a handful of
cases involving the use of Internet auction sites as a forum to
sell items that turn out to be fake paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Such activity would violate federal statutes prohibiting mail
fraud, wire fraud and transportation of stolen property across
state lines.

TYLER BAZE CONTINUES FAMILY TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Generally, teen-agers and race tracks don't
make a good mix.
</P>
<P>
   But, then there is Tyler Baze, a 17-year-old Monrovia resident,
who is making quite a name for himself at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Baze, an apprentice rider, entered the week with seven wins,
just one behind leading rider Victor Espinoza. Needless to say for
a guy who won his first race just seven months ago, Baze is riding
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working at it,'' he said. ``But this is a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is with all aprentice jockeys, Baze is known in the jock's
room as the ``bug boy.'' And, while he takes his share of ribbing,
he also is getting some great advice from the nation's top jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn by watching different riders and listening to what the
older riders have to say,'' Baze said. ``Since i've only been
working at this for about a year, it's nice to be able to talk to
them too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, a native of Washington state, isn't the first member of
the Baze family to take to racing. His uncle Gary Baze, was the
all-time leading jockey at now-defunct Longacres; second cousin
Russell baze is a member of the Hall of Fame and the top rider on
the Northern California circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. His grandfather Carl Baze was a longtime
trainer in Washington. And, his great-grandmother was one of the
nation's first-ever female jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in my family is in racing,'' Tyler Baze said. ``I
always thought I be small enough to carry on that tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of Baze's seven wins have come in the saddle for trainer
John Sadler, who first used him in October at Oak Tree. After that
if was off to Turf Pasadise for some needed experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent Tyler down to the minor leagues to get a little
seasoning,'' Sadler said. ``Now, he's a polished act.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler also praised the young man's professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler's a throwback,'' Sadler said. ``He calls people sir and
madam and he is very respectful. He's a terrific hard-working kid.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Triple Crown season is a unique time at Hollywood Park.
Last year, jockey Chris Antley won the Kentucky Derby and was
beseiged with requests for interviews, autographs and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Things were no different for Sierra Madre resident Kent
Desormeaux Wednesday. The jockey, who had a beautiful ride aboard
Fusaichi Pegasus, was the center of attention every time he stepped
out of the jock's room.
</P>
<P>
   How long it will last is anybody's guess. But as long as
Fusaichi Pegasus wins, Desormeaux will be the man of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Tout Charmant will make her 2000 debut Sunday in the
Wilshire Handicap. Formerly trained by Bob Baffert, the filly is
now in the hands of Ron McAnally.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's working good, she looks good and she acts good,''
McAnally said. ``You'll never know if she's as good as she was when
Baffert had her, but this is a good place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Other probables for the $100,000 Grade III Wilshire Handicap
include Penny Marie, Perfect Copy and Finally.

GALAXY STADIUM PROPOSAL APPROVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH -- A proposal that would allow the Los Angeles Galaxy
soccer team to move from Pasadena to Cal State Dominguez Hills,
Wednesday earned approval from the California State University
Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which paves the way for a Galaxy move from the Rose
Bowl to a soccer complex in the South Bay, had been approved by the
board's committee on finance after a hearing Tuesday. The full
board accepted that approval.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Galaxy would develop a portion of the
campus, adding a 30,000 seat soccer stadium, a smaller tenis
stadium and a myriad of other improvements. The project is expected
to cost in the neighborhood of $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy hopes to take Wednesday's approval of the proposal to
attract the United States Soccer Federation. The Chicago-based
group is seeking bids on its plan to build a new soccer academy for
the United States men's and women's national soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Leiweke, president of the Galaxy, said the state University
Board of Trustees' aproval was necessary before the Galaxy could
make their bid.

MISTRUST FOILS SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE'S EFFORT TO REMOVE DIVISIVE
BATTLE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In a flurry of horse trading, members of the
South Carolina House of Representatives spent Wednesday desperately
searching for a plan that would move the Confederate battle flag
from atop the Statehouse and satisfy both flag supporters and their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the profound mistrust and animosity between the two sides
kept any plan from mustering a majority, though by Wednesday
evening the House appeared to be moving toward a settlement on the
issue, though on a path with many turns.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising proposal, which seemed to have bipartisan
support at idday but later died on a vote of 82-35, would move the
flag from the dome to a Confederate memorial in front of the
Capitol and would also erect flagpoles bearing military banners to
honor soldiers who fell in four 20th-century wars. The plan called
for the Confederate flag to fly from the dome one day a year, on
Confederate Memorial Day, which by coincidence was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of the plan illustrated the body's desperation to
placate all sides in the debate. For those who consider the flag an
offensive symbol of white supremacy and a reminder of slavery, the
plan would have diluted the impact of having a single Confederate
battle flag at the entrance to the Capitol by putting it in a
historical context of honoring the soldiers of many other wars.
</P>
<P>
   For those who revere the flag as an emblem of honor to their
slain Confederate ancestors, the plan would confer at least a day's
worth of official legitimacy to the flag on Confederate Memorial
Day, which observes the date when Gen. Stonewall Jackson died.
</P>
<P>
   But hardliners on each side found those aspects unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fly that flag for a day, even for an hour, even for a
minute, is unacceptable to us,'' said Joseph Neal, a black Democrat
from Chester, who would have supported the plan if not for the
one-day-a-year provision. ``It is not a sovereign flag, and it is
an insult to people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   White Republicans who want to keep the flag on the dome picked
apart the plan from the other end of the spectrum, criticizing it
for not honoring soldiers in the Revolutionary War, or for being
vague on which flags symbolize certain wars. The Republican
majority leader, Rick Quinn, who supported the proposal, said it
had been hurt when black members compared the Confederate flag to a
swastika, and when demonstrators burned the flag in front of the
Capitol shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be about 5 or 6 black members who supported
the plan out of 26 in the House, along with the prominent local
bishop of the AME Church. But white moderates who were pushing the
plan were astonished that most black representatives objected to
the plan because of the single day a year the flag would spend on
the dome, particularly when most black officials supported the
circle of military flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get 364 days, and they get one,'' said Bob Sheheen, the
former Democratic speaker who is retiring later this year. ``I'm
asking them to give up all their days, and I'm asking you to make
that commitment for only one day. This amendment changes the
emphasis this state puts on the flag, and it says to our citizens
of color that we are going to view it more like you view it.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the plan left the House facing the compromise
reached by the State Senate, which appears unacceptable to the
black members. It would remove the flag from the dome and the two
chambers and put a smaller version in front of the Capitol on a
30-foot pole, the only flag in front of the building. Opponents
said the plan left the flag in far too prominent a position.
</P>
<P>
   The flag has been flying from the dome since 1962, and has
severely tainted the state's reputation for racial tolerance. A
national economic boycott of the state, being conducted by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has has
hurt the state's tourism industry.

GULF COAST WARNED TO BRACE FOR MORE HURRICANES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By J.R. GONZALES 
and PHILIP CAUTHON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A major hurricane with 155 mph winds could leave 1,400
dead and 125,000 homeless along the Texas Gulf Coast, Harris County
Judge Robert Eckels said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eckels, also the county's director of emergency management, said
115-mph winds could be felt as far north as Conroe, Texas _ about
100 miles from the coast. The area surrounding the Clear Creek area
of Houston, near the coast, would be under 22 feet of water, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates are part of a county study simulating what would
happen if a category-five hurricane passed through Houston. No such
hurricane has made landfall here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big concern that when a big hurricane comes toward
this community, people will not take it seriously and will not
understand the impact,'' Eckels said at the 2000 Houston/Galveston
Hurricane Workshop in Pasadena, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, experts in Washington said Gulf Coast residents
should brace for more hurricanes than the average season, possibly
seven or more.
</P>
<P>
   The average season brings 9.3 tropical storms, 5.8 of hurricane
strength and 2.1 of intense hurricane strength.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storms form and receive names when their circulating
winds reach 39 mph. They become hurricanes when their winds reach
74 mph and major hurricanes when winds reach 111 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane season, which begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30,
likely will bring stronger and longer-lasting storms than usual,
including three or more ``major'' hurricanes with sustained winds
over 110 mph, said scientists at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about the number'' of storms, said Max Mayfield,
director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center. ``What really counts
is where they make landfall and how strong they are. Just one
hurricane over your community makes it a very bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Weather Research Center in Houston and hurricane
expert William Gray at Colorado State University predicted a quiet
season.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pasadena workshop, experts addressed the possibility of a
storm similar to the 1900 Galveston hurricane, which killed an
estimated 8,000 people and remains the deadliest natural disaster
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Since that storm, Galveston has constructed a seawall and raised
the grade of the island. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Think about all the people that have moved here,'' said Bill
Read, meteorologist in charge at the Houston-Galveston National
Weather Service. Read estimated as much as 30 percent of the
Houston area's population did not live here when Hurricane Alicia
made landfall in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, no hurricanes and only three tropical
storms have affected the upper Texas coast. Many believe this
relative quiet will cause people to become more relaxed in their
hurricane preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Landsea, meteorologist at the NOAA's Hurricane Research
Division, said in Pasadena that fault for much of the damage will
fall on residents instead of Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to call it a natural disaster,'' Landsea said.
``We help make them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, NOAA officials expressed concern about a survey
that shows people in hurricane-prone regions are largely
ill-informed on the basics of hurricane preparation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most people do not know that flooding causes the
majority of deaths during hurricanes and nearly half are unaware
that homeowner's insurance does not cover flood damage, according
to the May telephone survey of 1,037 people in several southern
states, including Texas.

BUSH PROPOSES TAX BREAKS TO COVER LONG-TERM CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush proposed a set of tax
breaks Wednesday to encourage more people to purchase long-term
care insurance and to ease the financial burden on people looking
after ailing relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, which anticipates the fast-growing number of
older Americans, people of any age who buy insurance for the kind
of extended nursing-home stays not covered by other policies or by
Medicare could fully deduct the annual premium from their taxes,
whether they itemize deductions or not.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, people with aging dependents at home could claim
an extra exemption, which would amount to a nonitemized deduction
of about $2,750.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many of our seniors, illness can be a path to financial
ruin, and this is one of the greatest fears of retirement, and our
nation must address it as we head into the 21st century,'' Bush
told a group of about 80 at a nursing home here.
</P>
<P>
   The scope and expense of Bush's proposal was modest _ it would
cost $7.4 billion over five years _ and some critics said it would
make only the smallest of dents in a problem turning ever more
severe. But the plan represented Bush's attempt to demonstrate that
he was paying heed to health care and to senior citizens, an issue
and a voting block that could be decisive in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Gore campaign arranged for reporters to talk on
the phone Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the plausibility of any and all of the governor's
proposals was thrown into doubt by his call for a tax cut of $483
billion over five years, which is much larger than the tax cut Gore
favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way, given the size of his tax cut, that he can pay
for this,'' she said of Bush. ``It's an empty promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-term care insurance, which fills a gap in what is provided
by private and corporate health care policies and Medicare, covers
the cost of an extended stay in a nursing home or assisted-living
center for people whose financial resources have not dwindled to
the point where they qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures provided by the Bush campaign, only about 5
percent of Americans now have such policies.

IN GERMAN COURT: DOPING, GOLD MEDALS AND HUMAN PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ He is a shrunken man these days, his eyes evasive
behind glasses. But for more than a quarter-century, Manfred Ewald
was little short of a demigod, the undisputed ``Sportfuehrer''
presiding over Communist East Germany's extraordinary gold-medal
machine.
</P>
<P>
   That success, out of proportion with what was a country of 17
million people, has brought Ewald, 75, to a Berlin court. He is
charged with administering anabolic steroids to 142 female
athletes, who were not told what they were taking and have since
suffered symptoms ranging from infertility to a deepening of their
voices.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began last week, is not the first attempt to
judge what the German singer and anti-Communist dissident Wolf
Biermann once called ``a large-scale animal experiment on living
people.'' But it is the first time that the question of the overall
political responsibility for a human experiment that produced 160
gold medals as it severely damaged the bodies of young athletes has
come before a court.
</P>
<P>
   Ewald was, over a period of 26 years, a member of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party and the man with the political
responsibility to produce the Olympic and other medals that would
burnish Communism's image in the world. His title was anodyne _
President of the East German Gymnastic and Sport Association _ but
his power enormous.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment _ prepared over the past three years by
Klaus-Heinrich Debes, a state prosecutor _ chronicling how, from
1974, Ewald pursued a program of doping with what the testimony of
one Leipzig doctor, Lothar Pickenhain, called ``an unbelievable
brutality and a merciless heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, during three sessions of the trial, Ewald has
declined to testify, and his lawyers have argued that his
psychological state is now too fragile for him to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   But he has in the past been robust in his dismissal of the
accusations and is well-known for a blunt, if not quite relevant
and plainly questionable, assertion: ``Communists do not murder
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial will resume next week after Ewald undergoes
psychological tests at a Berlin hospital. Already, his
co-defendant, Manfred Hoeppner, 66, a doctor who headed the
so-called ``Working Group on Supporting Means,'' has been more
forthcoming. ``Supporting Means'' was the official East German
euphemism for doping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not deny that I promoted the application of supporting
drugs,'' Hoeppner said in a prepared statement. But he added, ``The
promotion and medical support of competitive sport did not
contradict the laws of East Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   The courts of a united Germany have tended to show little
sympathy for such pleadings: the exaltation of obedience and duty
over conscience and humanity has already brought too much ruin on
this country during its modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it seems clear that, far from being against the law,
the doping for which Ewald was politically responsible was actively
supported by the state. The indictment describes how some 30,000
people worked under him and how scarce hard currency was made
available to support the program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he was given $159,000 in 1976 to secure a retreat
at the Montreal Olympics that was deemed remote enough to lessen
the chances of doping checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely sure that as far as the majority of athletes
was concerned, the proper use of supporting drugs proved
worthwhile,'' Hoeppner argued in court. ``As for the athletes who
suffered disastrous consequences, I ask them to accept my
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little hint of charity from those whose lives were
permanently changed. Of the 142 women named, 40 developed deeper
voices, 21 suffered an excessive growth of bodily hair, 15 incurred
gynecological problems including infertility or miscarriages, six
saw their breasts disappear, and others suffered symptoms including
the development of outsized muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were vehicles chosen to prove that socialism was better
than capitalism,'' said Carola Beraktschjan, 38, a former gold
medalist in the 1977 European swimming championships. ``What
happened to our bodies was entirely secondary to that political
mission led by Ewald.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the 142 people named in the case, Beraktschjan recalled
how she was 13 years old when officials started giving her pills in
1975 that were described as ``vitamins'' and ``minerals.'' Her
first suspicion arose a year later, just before the Montreal
Olympics, when she became ill with a liver complaint.
</P>
<P>
   But the following year, she agreed to injections of further
``vitamins'' and ``minerals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very young,'' she said, ``and you have to understand
how helpless we felt.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 15, the program bore fruit when she secured her
European title in the 100-meter breast-stroke _ a medal she has
since returned because she can no longer accept how it was won.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, as her muscles suddenly swelled and she began to
rapidly put on weight, Beraktschjan rebelled and refused to take
any more of the substances. She now credits this decision with
saving her from the more extreme problems suffered by other women.
She has a healthy 13-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, however, Beraktschjan had recurrent nightmares
about swimming, usually about drowning or being unable to reach the
side of the pool. ``They were dreams of fear, the fear I carried in
me then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The dreams stopped two years ago after she sought psychological
help and witnessed the trial of her former swimming coach, Rolf
Gleser, who was fined and given a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when I see Mr. Ewald, I feel anger,'' she said. ``But
it's not the same direct anger as with my trainer. It's subtler
than that, a satisfaction that the mastermind of it all will at
last get his due.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what, if anything, that due will be remains unclear for
now. Sentences in previous doping trials have been light with a
15-month suspended jail sentence among the most severe punishments.
But the prosecution is arguing that the responsibility of the
``Sportfuerher'' for medal production is of a different nature from
men like Gleser. A verdict is expected later this month.

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Wednesday that he
was separating from his wife, Donna Hanover. He said that as he
battles prostate cancer he will need Judith Nathan, the woman he
describes as a ``very good'' friend, ``more now than maybe I did
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not say whether he would continue his race for the
U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but he did say that his
political career was not at the moment his first concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about politics right now,'' Giuliani said.
``I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and what can
be done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best.
I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second,
maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself
out some way politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary news conference in Bryant Park, Giuliani
spoke at length to reporters about his relationships with his wife
and Nathan. He spoke in a soft voice with downcast eyes as he
tightly gripped both sides of the lectern. The mayor described his
emotional state as ``sad'' and then added, ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Hanover appeared outside the gates of Gracie
Mansion and, with a wavering voice and tears in her eyes, said:
``Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to
keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary, said that Hanover
was referring to Cristyne F. Lategano, Giuliani's former
communications director who is now president of NYC &AMP; Company, the
city's tourism bureau. Friends of Hanover said on Wednesday that
she had described the relationship between her husband and Lategano
as ``intimate'' while Lategano worked at City Hall. The mayor has
denied having had a romantic relationship with Lategano, who left
City Hall last May and married Nicholas Nicholas, a sports writer,
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover also said that ``beginning last May, I made a major
effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of
our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose
another path. Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a
legal separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover added that she and the couple's children, Andrew, 14,
and Caroline, 10, will continue to live at Gracie Mansion, the
mayor's official residence, ``for at least the next few months''
because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano issued this statement on Wednesday: ``I have no desire
to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the statement that
she did. Understandably, this is a difficult time. I wish both the
mayor and Donna Hanover a successful resolution.'' Lategano added
that she was ``proud'' to have worked for Giuliani, and that he
``is and will continue to be one of the greatest mayors in our
city's history.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had no reaction to the statements of his wife and his
former aide as he left City Hall at 7:20 on Wednesday night for a
Senate fund-raiser in Westchester County. He also refused to answer
a question about whether he would withdraw from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Hanover said that although she and her husband had
talked in recent days about ending their 16-year marriage, Hanover
did not know that Giuliani was going to announce their planned
separation at his news conference. Friends said she learned of her
husband's remarks immediately after the conclusion of the news
conference, which was held on the outdoor balcony of The Bryant
Park Grill in midtown Manhattan. The friends described Hanover as
``distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's senior advisers said on Wednesday that the
mayor's announcement caught them by surprise, too, even though
Giuliani had made no secret of his estrangement from his wife over
the past few years and had announced last week that Nathan, 45, a
single mother and registered nurse who works for a pharmaceutical
company, was a ``very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Giuliani and Nathan leaving a restaurant together
were first published on May 3 by The New York Post. Giuliani
announced that he had prostate cancer in an early, treatable form
on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Giuliani had planned beforehand to
announce the possible separation at the news conference, or whether
he wandered into the remarks as reporters questioned him. Since the
mayor learned he has prostate cancer, he has become increasingly
personal and introspective in his news briefings.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Giuliani had no official statement, and only began
to talk about his marriage after a reporter asked him for a
reaction to comments made on Tuesday by Joseph L. Bruno, the state
Senate majority leader. In a radio interview in Albany, Bruno urged
Giuliani to resolve his differences with Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   She first publicly addressed the issue in a hastily arranged
news conference outside St. Patrick's Cathedral last weekend,
saying that her husband and her marriage ``have been very precious
to me.'' Bruno added that he was concerned that Giuliani's personal
life would distract him from the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the question about Bruno, Giuliani never did
say what he thought of the majority leader's remarks. Instead, he
said: ``This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's
probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways
independent and separate lives. It's been a very painful road and
I'm hopeful that we'll be able to formalize that in an agreement
that protects our children, gives them all the security and all the
protection they deserve, and protects Donna.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by reporters about whether he meant a legal
separation, the mayor at first said he did not want to give
details. But when asked if his wife would move out of Gracie
Mansion, Giuliani at last used the word ``separation'' by
responding haltingly: ``Nobody, nobody, nobody is moving anywhere.
Everybody is secure and safe. What I said is that we should try to
work out a separation agreement. That's different.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were only a small group of reporters and television
cameras present in a small space, and many were only a few feet
from the mayor. As Giuliani continued to talk at length about his
relationships with the two women, the briefing became an unusually
intimate confessional for a man who has until recently guarded most
aspects of his private life. At one point, Giuliani was asked if
the media had caused the damage in his public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' responded Giuliani, who has often blamed the media in
the past. ``The media makes the damage worse, it didn't cause the
damage. I take responsibility for everything that I've done. And
you have a right to ask me and then I have a right to answer or not
answer. And that's the way I think we can have a respectful
relationship with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also spoke warmly of both Nathan and Hanover. ``Judith
_ Judith Nathan is a very, very fine person,'' the mayor said.
``She's been a very good friend to me, before I had to deal with
the decisions that I have to make about my illness and what to do
about it, and I rely on her, and she helps me a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his comments to his wife. ``Donna Hanover is a
wonderful woman,'' Giuliani said. ``And she's a wonderful mother.
She's someone that I respect tremendously. The fact that we've
grown independent, we've grown more separate over the years, who
knows why those things happen? But she is a very, very fine,
wonderful person, and she's an extraordinary mother and I have
tremendous respect for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his emotional state was at that moment, Giuliani
responded: ``My emotional state is I'm very sad. And I feel
terrible.''

A WELL-RESTED TIGER WOODS RETURNS TO ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Tex. _ A little rest usually does Tiger Woods a lot of
good. In the past nine months, Woods has taken at least two weeks
off on five different occasions. Each time, Woods returned to
action by winning his next tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So after a four-week break, excuse Woods for feeling confident
about the GTE Byron Nelson Classic that begins here Thursday. Woods
has not competed since the Masters, spending his idle time fishing,
resting and preparing for an upcoming busy stretch that will lead
him into next month's U.S. Open. Feeling rejuvenated and
well-rested after Thursday's pro-am at the TPC of Las Colinas,
Woods said he was over the disappointment of finishing fifth in
last month's Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the Masters as a positive, actually,'' said Woods,
who has three victories and three second-place finishes in eight
starts this year. ``If you take away two bad holes on Thursday, I
had a pretty good tournament. To get myself back in contention at
the Masters with a chance to win Sunday, I'm pretty proud of that.
I shot the lowest score on the weekend, but I put myself behind on
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, who won the Masters, will be playing at the Byron
Nelson, part of a world-class field that will also include David
Duval, Hal Sutton, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson, Nick Price, Jim
Furyk, Jesper Parnevik, Sergio Garcia and Justin Leonard. Loren
Roberts is the defending champion, winning last year after beating
Steve Pate in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Nelson, one of golf's greatest players who is
now 88, helps to make this tournament one of the most popular on
the PGA Tour. Nelson is still giving back to the game, and last
week he shared some of his wisdom with Leonard, who has been mired
in a yearlong slump.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is still ranked No. 18 in the world, Leonard does
not have a top 10 finish this year, and he has not won in more than
two years. Nelson noticed a flaw in Leonard's take-away, so Nelson
visited Leonard at his Dallas home and offered some technical
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been playing well enough to suit him, and rightly
so, because he has a lot of talent,'' Nelson said. ``I'd been
wanting to talk to him about it for quite a while. Whether or not
he plays worse or better, that's to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament is played on two courses Thursday and Friday _
Las Colinas and Cottonwood Valley, before plays shifts exclusively
to Las Colinas on the weekend. Cottonwood Valley is the easier of
the two courses, so any player who struggles there probably will
not win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot 70 at Cottonwood, and you're putting yourself behind the
8-ball pretty good,'' said Woods, who won the Byron Nelson in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With a strong breeze of 15 to 20 miles an hour expected for
Thursday, it could be a difficult day for scoring. But Woods was
eager to end his vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I haven't played a tournament in four weeks,'' said
Woods, who will play in Germany next week, then compete in the
Memorial Tournament the following week. ``I'm pretty excited about
getting out there tomorrow. It's nice to hit a shot that really
matters. When you're home playing with your boys, you hit a bad
shot, it's not a big deal. Pick it up, go on to the next. This is a
little different.''

DEEP SECURITY FLAWS SEEN AT STATE DEPT. 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department suffers from a systemic
failure to protect secrets that is longstanding and far broader
than the recent series of lapses publicly denounced by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, a range of administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with State Department officials, intelligence experts
and lawmakers monitoring the department's security _ as well as a
recent audit by the department's inspector general _ depict an
agency where small violations are frequent, few are punished and
many employees do not take basic precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FBI reported that a suspected spy roamed the
halls of the department unattended. Many of the department's
office-cleaners and maintenance staff work unsupervised, though
most lack security clearances. Officials responsible for security
admit they have no reliable way of tracking who enters or leaves
the department's Foggy Bottom headquarters and lack the staff to
inspect outgoing cars or briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   More than four security breaches are reported on an average day,
for a total of 1,673 incidents in 1998, the latest year for which
such statistics were available. The vast majority of these were
minor incidents, and only four were viewed as egregious, according
to the inspector general's September 1999 audit, which did not
detail those incidents. From 1995 to 1998, the department referred
53 cases to the FBI, the audit said. None resulted in prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The reports and interviews do not shed light on any new
instances in which secrets were lost. Rather, they depict a lax and
even careless bureaucracy that resists the kinds of stringent
precautions that critics say are necessary in the world of national
security. For example, employees sometimes leave confidential
documents unattended on their desks, fail to change safe
combinations frequently enough, and lose track of agency computers,
the reports say.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in and out of the State Department, including one who
is to testify before a House hearing on Thursday about security
breaches, point to these areas as leaving the department
particularly vulnerable:
</P>
<P>
   _ Employees and regular visitors are issued photo ID cards that
open turnstiles at the building's entrance when swiped through a
slot. But no one checks to make sure a card is carried by the right
person. A stolen or borrowed card can be used by an unauthorized
person to gain entry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since a new policy was instituted in August, all visitors who
are not government employees must have escorts. But the policy does
not apply to accredited reporters, leaving foreign intelligence
services a loophole they can exploit. Timothy D. Bereznay, an FBI
section chief, will testify on Thursday that his agency has
identified more than one spy among accredited foreign journalists,
according to a draft of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   _ None of the 140 offices handling classified materials had been
inspected for listening devices or cameras. And, although the
department distributes about 3,500 pages of secret documents
throughout the building on a given day, there is no record showing
whether the papers were ever received or returned.
</P>
<P>
   Some security experts say the department's culture resists
security measures. While officials at the Pentagon or the CIA see
secrecy as a paramount value, diplomats embrace openness and depend
on foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Marine guards practice for overseas postings by conducting
surprise inspections of the department's offices. During eight
inspections in 1998, the guards turned up an average of 63 problems
each time. A diplomat said the Marine sweeps have been cut back
because they resulted in too much paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   While many infractions may be relatively minor, the stakes are
high. Spilled secrets may lead to ``serious damage'' to American
ties with other governments, the audit warned, or even to the
``arrest, torture or death of sources'' working for the United
States. The CIA is so troubled by the department's record that it
routinely withholds classified information, diplomats and lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence, said recent security breaches
involving a missing laptop computer and an eavesdropping device
implanted in a department conference room were part of a longtime
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their access controls are primitive and not well enforced,''
Goss said. ``Their escort policies are bizarre and not well
enforced. Their document control is between deficient and
nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's security adviser is already tightening some
procedures. David G. Carpenter, the assistant secretary of state
for diplomatic security and a former Secret Service agent, is
leading a sweeping review of how the department handles classified
materials and protects against espionage, with assistance from the
FBI and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Albright announced the security shake-up last month, more than
two months after a laptop computer containing highly sensitive
files about weapons proliferation disappeared from the department's
Bureau of Intelligence and Research. In December, federal
authorities discovered an eavesdropping device in a department
conference room and swiftly expelled a Russian diplomat from the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Albright summoned nearly 800 employees for a public excoriation
in which she asserted that they were all failures unless they
protected government secrets. In remarks to newspaper publishers on
Tuesday, Albright referred to the recent lapses. ``I was both
angered and embarrassed,'' she said. ``On behalf of all employees
of the State Department, I'm humiliated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the department allowed foreign officials,
journalists and other visitors to wander on their own throughout
the building. Of roughly 1,000 visitors a day, about one in seven
is a foreign government official. The FBI reported last year that
``suspected foreign intelligence personnel'' had the opportunity to
plant listening devices or steal documents as they moved unescorted
through the halls.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Carpenter tightened the policy to require escorts of
all visitors without permanent passes, except other government
employees. But Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., the chairman of the
International Relations Committee, is not satisfied. Foreign
reporters are on the honor system to remain in areas designated for
the press, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, the new escort policy has a hole you could
lead an elephant through,'' Gilman said. ``Past reports indicate
that foreign intelligence services, particularly Russia's and
China's, have used reporters' credentials as cover for their
spies.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's reliance on contract workers for security
guards, maintenance and food service poses other problems. Most
contract employees are subjected only to cursory police checks.
Only 15 out of 100 janitors have security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Goss, a former CIA agent, ascribes the department's problems to
``partially arrogance and disdain for security.'' But defenders of
the diplomats note that more serious breaches of security occurred
at the CIA, where Aldrich Ames, who was convicted of spying for the
Soviet Union, worked. They view department officials as struggling
under a unique mandate that simply will not let them retreat behind
walls and security fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they making too many mistakes? As far as I can tell from
the public record, the answer is yes,'' said Steven Aftergood,
senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists.
But statecraft requires a trade-off, he added. ``Your security
can't be so overwhelming that you're unable to perform the task of
diplomacy.''

SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS WIN U.S APPROVAL AFTER STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven years after it first questioned the safety of
saline breast implants, the Food and Drug Administration decided
Wednesday to permit two largest makers of implants to continue
marketing the devices, despite new scientific evidence that they
pose a significant risk of infection, tissue hardening and pain in
the breast, as well as repeat surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The government's approval of implants made by McGhan Medical
Corp. and Mentor Corp., both of Santa Barbara, Calif., came after
five studies of more than 9,000 women documented what the drug
agency described as relatively high rates of complications and
rupture. The agency said it would require the companies to inform
women of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there is benefit to some women from having breast
implants available, there is now a much clearer understanding of
the risks involved,'' said Dr. Jane E. Henney, commissioner of food
and drugs, in a statement announcing the agency's decision. ``With
the data that has been presented, women and their physicians will
be able to make informed decisions about whether the benefits are
worth the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants have been sold in this country without Food and
Drug Administration approval for more than three decades, long
before the passage of a 1976 law that gave the agency authority to
regulate medical devices. They have been the only type of implant
commercially available since 1992, when the agency took silicone
implants off the market amid great controversy about whether they
caused autoimmune disorders. (An Institute of Medicine study
concluded last year that they did not.)
</P>
<P>
   The saline implants were generally presumed safer than silicone
implants, because they leak only salt water, as opposed to silicone
gel, when they rupture. But while there has been an abundance of
anecdotal evidence that all breast implants can cause hardening of
breast tissue and other problems, until now there has been little
scientific data about the extent of the risk from saline implants.
So in 1993, amid questions about their safety, the drug agency
announced it would require the companies to study the implants and
apply for government approval.
</P>
<P>
   The studies by McGhan and Mentor made clear that many women who
have saline implants will have to undergo additional surgeries
because of rupture or other complications. McGhan's primary study
involved 901 women who received saline-filled implants for cosmetic
reasons, and, like all the studies, looked at the various
short-term or ``local'' complications that have long been known to
be associated with breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, 689 women were still in the study. About
one-fifth, or 21 percent, required additional surgeries; 9 percent
suffered a hardening of the tissue around the implant (a condition
known as capsular contracture); 16 percent experienced breast pain;
8 percent asked for their implants to be removed and 5 percent
experienced leakage or deflation of the device. The rates of
complications were roughly the same in a study of 1,264 women who
received Mentor implants.
</P>
<P>
   But the risks of complications were higher for women who
received implants for reconstruction after breast cancer surgery or
other medical problems, in part because the lack of an intact
breast makes it difficult for doctors to put the implants in. Among
416 women receiving Mentor implants for breast reconstruction, 40
percent needed additional surgeries, 27 percent asked that the
implants be removed and 9 percent experienced leakage and
deflation. In all the studies, some women experienced more than one
complication.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 150,000 women obtained saline implants last year;
McGhan, a subsidiary of Inamed Corp., and Mentor, sold the vast
majority of the devices. Three smaller implant manufacturers are
also seeking agency approval.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Mentor declined comment on the agency's action
Wednesday. But Scott Eschbach, the president and chief executive of
McGhan, said he was pleased with the agency's decision, and
characterized it as a determination by the government that the
implants are ``safe and effective.'' Eschbach said, ``I think they
made a wise decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, a Washington advocacy organization that had

   ``This is a product that there is a strong consumer interest
in,'' Feigal said. ``If you look at the kinds of problems that we
have characterized as complications, they are cosmetic
complications. That's not to say that they aren't important or
distressing. But now we have the ability for people to actually see
what they are getting into, and make the choice in that light.''

   Antitrust Case Settlement Could Lower Prices of CDs
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission settled an antitrust case against
the nation's five largest music companies that could result in
significant price cuts for compact discs. Officials said the
settlement completed a two-year investigation that found the
companies used illegal marketing agreements to end a price war,
inflate the prices of compact discs and sharply restrict the
ability of retailers to offer discounts. Agency officials estimated
that consumers were overcharged by $500 million over the last four
years.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ZACATECAS, Mexico _ Waiting for a presidential candidate to
arrive at the airport in the central Mexican city of Zacatecas,
Gilberto Macias and Julio Cruz review the problems facing Mexico.
 &HT;    Macias, a light-skinned man in a cowboy hat, is a doctor and a
small farmer who grows beans _ the state of Zacatecas is Mexico's
leading bean producer. ``Seven years ago, beans were at 5 pesos a
kilo,'' he says. ``Today they're at 2.5 (pesos) and production
costs have gone through the roof.''
 &HT;    Cruz works as a systems engineer but, to make ends meet, he runs
a fruit and vegetable stand in a market. ``There's no chance to
work full time as a systems engineer,'' he explains.
 &HT;    The men relate their problems to the country's political system
and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has ruled
since 1929. ``A few people ran this country for 70 years and now
we've had enough,'' says Macias.
 &HT;    Whether a majority of Mexicans share his feelings about the PRI
will become clear on July 2, when voters elect a president to a
six-year term starting in December.
 &HT;    At the airport, Macias and Cruz are waiting for the man they
believe will upset the ruling party and change Mexican politics
forever. In many ways, he is a man like them.
 &HT;    ``He's a businessman and he's a farmer,'' said Macias. ``He's
the first candidate to come from agriculture. He speaks the
language of common Mexicans.''
 &HT;    He is Vicente Fox, the 57-year-old National Action Party (PAN)
presidential candidate. A former president of Coca-Cola for Mexico
and Central America, he quit Coke in 1978 to run his family's
boot-making concern and ranch in his home state of Guanajuato.
 &HT;    Fox stepped into politics in 1988 when he joined the campaign of
the late Manuel Clouthier, presidential candidate of the National
Action Party. Clouthier revived the old rightist party by
attracting young, less ideological businessmen. Those neopanistas
included Vicente Fox, who won a congressional seat that year. In
1995, he was elected governor of Guanajuato, an experience that
turned into a testing ground for much of what he now proposes
regarding agriculture, government reform and economic development.
 &HT;    As a presidential hopeful, Fox has broken all of Mexico's
unwritten rules for politicians.
 &HT;    He is divorced, seldom wears a tie and has a blunt style, rare
for Mexico, which has caused him trouble on numerous occasions.
Although Catholic, he once compared the Catholic Church with the
PRI because both hold monopolies in Mexico. Polls reveal that half
of the population considers him ``impulsive.''
 &HT;    These same polls in February also showed Fox pulling even with
PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, who held an eight-point lead a
month earlier. The center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD) candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, trailed far behind.
 &HT;    To find out what is attracting people like Macias and Cruz to
the Fox campaign, Latin Trade contributor Sam Quinones followed the
candidate on a three-day campaign tour starting in Zacatecas and
moving south to the states of Aguascalientes and Queretaro.
Highlights:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Day 1: Zacatecas
 &HT;    11:45 a.m. Dressed in his trademark open-collar, light blue
shirt and dark blue pants, black cowboy boots and silver FOX belt
buckle, Fox steps from the large royal blue bus bearing his smiling
visage. At 6-foot-5, he towers over the crowd in Zacatecas'
gorgeous colonial center.
 &HT;    ``Hola. Que tal? Echale ganas,'' he says in a deep baritone as
he shakes hands, kisses babies and flashes the V sign that stands
for victory, or Vicente, or both. He walks over to a group of
children in the plaza and tousles the hair of some, bending over to
listen to them. A group of rambunctious 6-year-olds calls out:
``Hey, Fox!'' ``Hey, president!'' He smiles and flashes the V sign
again.
 &HT;    At a press conference, two longtime Zacatecas priistas, Alberto
Rodriguez and Jose Maria Pino, throw their support to Fox. They
areformer backers of Roberto Madrazo, the governor of the
southeastern state of Tabasco who waged a strong but unsuccessful
campaign to become the PRI's candidate. Fox aides believe the
Madrazo candidacy, playing on many priistas' discontent with their
party's hierarchy, created an opening for their man among these
same folks. Actress Irma Dorantes, widow of the late Mexican film
idol Pedro Infante, is also here to endorse Fox.
 &HT;    1:05 p.m. Some 500 students fill the gym at the Instituto
Tecnologico de Zacatecas. On stage, Fox stands with his hands on
his hips, smiling, as their applause washes over him. Javier
Alatorre, the heartthrob TV Azteca anchor, is accompanying the
candidate for a few hours today and his presence creates a stir
among the young women in the gym. The students whistle in fun at
their cohorts who speak from the podium.
 &HT;    Finally, things turn serious. ``Only 10 out of every 100 young
people can go to college today,'' Fox tells the students. He says
education is essential to Mexico's economic and democratic
development. ``We don't aspire to be a country of maquiladoras
(assembly plants).''
 &HT;    Fox disagrees with a student speaker who has called for taking
money from the National University (UNAM), where a nine-month
student strike just ended, and giving it to the technical schools.
Instead, the candidate advocates doubling the education budget and
using the additional money for the technological modernization of
the universities. ``Our real bottleneck is in our lack of highly
trained and educated people,'' he says.
 &HT;    Above all, he says, Mexico and its young people need economic
growth. ``We haven't grown in 30 years,'' he says. ``We have one of
the worst income distributions in the world. We need to grow at 7
percent a year.'' According to Fox, this will create 1.35 million
jobs a year. He says his administration will fuel that growth by
bringing in foreign investment, making it easier for working class
people to save and for ``micro, small and mid-sized businesses'' to
form.
 &HT;    These notions are the core of his economic platform and he will
touch on them in the afternoon at a public housing development,
again at a grilled chicken lunch in a small nearby restaurant and
in almost every other stump speech.
 &HT;    By dusk, the campaign is streaking across a hundred miles of
flat Zacatecas desert, with earth the color of cayenne pepper, in a
state where most towns tell a tale of economic ruin. Zacatecas
state ranks fourth in the number of emigrants it sends to the
United States, but is highest in emigrants per capita. Los Angeles,
California, is home to more Zacatecans than any city in the world.
 &HT;    We are heading to Pinos, a town subsisting on agriculture and
the dollars its errant families send home.
 &HT;    7:40 p.m. The campaign buses roll into the central plaza in
Pinos for an old-fashioned small-town rally. A mariachi band is
here. So are local politicians. The crowd is made up of women in
shawls, young boys in baseball caps and boots and wizened, leathery
men in white straw cowboy hats.
 &HT;    Fox is at home with crowds like these, people to whom he can
talk like ranchers. ``I know your dreams, of how many hopes you sow
when you plant the ground,'' he tells them.
 &HT;    His speeches are extemporaneous. They usually address the
economy, education, the environment, ending Mexico's corruption and
throwing out the party that has ruled the country for so long. He
often details his proposals, a rarity among politicians in Mexico.
Yet at times, as tonight in Pinos, he overdoes it. The crowds lose
their way in his statistics, talk of municipal reform, explanations
of inflation reduction and outlines of loan programs for small
business.
 &HT;    There are other times, though, when he is succinct. ``We're not
just going to elect a president in this election,'' he says.
``We're going to elect the Mexico we want for this century.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Day 2: Aguascalientes
 &HT;    10:15 a.m. A meeting is held with ranchers in Rincon de Romos at
a convention hall. Aguascalientes is a thriving industrial state,
but its large agricultural sector is suffering like elsewhere in
Mexico. So today's themes echo those of Zacatecas: the economy,
reviving agriculture, sustainable development.
 &HT;    Outside the hall, ranchers have parked a line of John Deere
tractors. Farmworker Mauricio Ortega stands beside one. Ortega
supports Fox because he heard what the candidate did as governor of
Guanajuato. ``He's a man who knows about necessities and a man who
knows the hunger of farmworkers,'' Ortega says.
 &HT;    6:45 p.m. Returning to the city of Aguascalientes, a local
reporter interviews Fox like a movie star.
 &HT;    ``Do you cry?''
 &HT;    ``When I see a father who can't buy his children an ice cream,''
Fox says.
 &HT;    ``Do you have a romantic relationship?''
 &HT;    ``No.''
 &HT;    ``Will you reunite with your ex-wife?''
 &HT;    ``I don't know. No.''
 &HT;    After 15 minutes of this, he orders the campaign bus stopped and
transfers to the press bus for the rest of the trip to
Aguascalientes. Surrounded by 20 reporters, he launches into an
off-the-record political chat that takes some bizarre turns. It
ends with reporters offering to take him to a strip club some day,
which he politely turns down.
 &HT;    8 p.m. More than 4,000 people squeeze into Hermanos Carreon
Arena, a basketball gym in the city of Aguascalientes. In
Aguascalientes state, the PAN presence is strong; its governor and
capital city mayor _ both panistas _ warm up the crowd, which
explodes as Fox enters. For several minutes, they applaud him like
a rock star, lighting hundreds of candles in the arena's darkness.
This speech has less policy, more inspiration. ``Our country is
going to change,'' he says. ``The Fox team is 100 million Mexicans
who are working to create a great country.''
 &HT;    It is a solid end to a day that featured five events in three
cities.
 &HT;    Fox flies on to Queretaro. At 11:30 p.m., the press bus departs
for the four-hour trip south. Someone has purchased a sizable
amount of tequila and beer. Before long, reporters stand in the
aisle warbling the songs of Los Tigres del Norte and Jose Alfredo
Jimenez.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Day 3: Queretaro
 &HT;    10:15 a.m. This campaign swing is becoming a Zen-like exercise
of endurance, with each evenresembling the others before it. Fox
stops for another meeting with ranchers in straw cowboy hats in a
region of dry grass. This gathering takes place at a winery near
the town of Ezekiel Montes. It will be followed by a radio
interview, a lunch with supporters and a meeting with a group of
motorcyclists _ the latter produces a photo of Fox, in a helmet and
leather jacket, riding a Harley. Later that same day the candidate
attends a ``lienzo charro'' _ a Mexican rodeo.
 &HT;    On the campaign trail, Fox has many opportunities to play the
populist. Yet he frequently challenges his crowd in a way
uncharacteristic of a politician on the stump.
 &HT;    Consider what he says about bankers, a well-hated group in
Mexico these days. He told the ranchers at Rincon de Romos: ``Many
of us have the idea that the bankers are corrupt, useless, that
they have us under their thumbs. This isn't true. A country needs
banks and bankers. A country needs credit, financing, a savings
system. We need decent, productive and clean bankers.''
 &HT;    He tells fruit growers in Aguascalientes that they will have to
use water more efficiently, that their well pumps will need to be
inspected to make sure they're not wasting electricity.
 &HT;    Today, before these salt-of-the-earth ranchers in Ezekiel
Montes, he discusses the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), which in Mexico has become a code word for increasingly
unpopular free-trade policies.
 &HT;    ``The free-trade agreement isn't bad. It's good. We were right
to sign it,'' he tells them. He explains his agriculture policy,
which includes subsidies to farmers, decentralizing federal
agriculture agencies and transferring many of their
responsibilities and their budgets to the states.
 &HT;    Agriculture's real problem, he says, is that ``the economy
hasn't grown.'' Once the economy grows, it will provide better
domestic markets for what farmers and ranchers produce, as well as
stable prices for seed, fertilizer and farm equipment.
 &HT;    6:10 p.m. The campaign swing comes to an end in the plaza of the
bustling panista city of San Juan del Rio, Queretaro.
 &HT;    Fox arrives in the cab of one the big rigs that joined his
caravan a few miles out of town. A twin-engine plane buzzes over
the crowd of 3,000. Tonight, Fox reiterates the themes and images
that will likely stay with him throughout the campaign. The economy
needs to grow at 7 percent a year to absorb all the young people
entering the job market. The creation of 1.35 million jobs a year.
He dwells again on the pain it causes him to see a father who can't
buy his children an ice cream. To help women, the group with which
he still has the most work to do, he promises laws outlawing wage
and sex discrimination.
 &HT;    ``We need to bring our country up to date,'' he says before
ending the speech and leaving the stage. As families peel away
across the plaza, a group of supporters chants: ``Ya llego! Ya esta
aqui! El que va a sacar al PRI!'' (``He has arrived! He's here! The
one who'll get rid of the PRI!'')
 &HT;    Tomorrow Fox will rest. Then, next week, another trip. Acapulco,
Merida, and the state of Mexico.

   For more expensive items, auction sites take no responsibility
and buyers take the risk of fraud. One potential source of
protection for buyers is that the auction sites let their members
rate the performance of both buyers and sellers, creating a
self-policing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   But there are flaws in this approach, art dealers say. For
example, many users say they live in a tit-for-tat culture, that
leads some Web site members who have received negative ratings to
retaliate by placing negative reviews on their detractors.
Sometimes, good reviews are posted by friends, and in any case, by
people who may not be able to spot fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a good rating, all a seller has to do is respond on
time, pack the goods on time and ship on time,'' Bamberger said.
``Then you get good feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to combat fraud for more expensive items,
several of the online auction sites have high-end sections that
guarantee the authenticity of the items sold. EBay has a service
called Great Collections it operates in conjuction with
Butterfield, the San Francisco auction house it bought. And Amazon
has a similar service in conjuction with Sotheby's and a network of
art dealers approved by Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn of Amazon said that the majority of the high-end art
on its site is sold through the Sotheby's section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our users feel more comfortable buying art vetted by
a dealer,'' he said. Buyers on that portion of the site, however,
must pay a 10 percent fee in return for the guarantee. On Amazon's
regular auctions, as on eBay's, the seller pays a fee of between 1
and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sites say they fight fraud in other ways. EBay, for example,
keeps a list of people it has suspended and tries to keep them from
coming back onto the site using new names. A spokesman for the
company refused to say how many people have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, a 32-year-old bachelor, attracted attention through a
provocative listing in which he falsely portrayed himself as a
married man who was offering a painting that had been damaged by
his son's plastic tricycle and that his wife banished to the
garage. While never portraying it as a Diebenkorn, the listing
provoked speculation by displaying the signature ``R.D. '52'' in a
photograph of a part of the painting, which used the same palette
that Diebenkorn employed in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was won by Rob Keereweer of the Netherlands. On
Tuesday, he and Walton agreed to void the sale if an expert
determined the painting was by someone other than Diebenkorn and
Keereweer did not want it anymore. Because of eBay's actions
Wednesday, Keereweer has no obligation to go through with the
purchase. Keereweer could not be reached for comment Wednesday
night.

<P>
   But some eBay-watchers say eBay does not take reports of fakes
seriously enough. David Carlson, of the Carlson Gallery in Carmel.,
Calif., said he called eBay on Monday before the auction for
Walton's painting closed. ``I asked for the fraud division a half
dozen times,'' he said. ``The girl on the switchboard refused to
put me through. Instead, she went to golfpoorly's offer. She read
it and said, `I don't see any fraud here.' She made the decision
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Purslove, an eBay spokesman, said that in general eBay
would not remove an item unless the complainant could offer solid
proof. ``Then we contact the seller and raise the question,'' he
said. ``We don't remove something on someone's word.''
</P>
<P>
   Many art dealers say such cases will continue, even if the sites
and law enforcement officials pay more attention to online art
fraud. That is because there is a growing group of art buyers who
want to use the Internet to build their collections on their own,
bypassing art dealers, just as many online day traders are avoiding
stock brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These collectors think they can be one-up on the auction
houses and dealers and they want to buy first and not pay for the
expertise,'' said Joel Garzoli, who owns the Garzoli Gallery in San
Rafael, Calif., with his father John Garzoli. ``They are paying
substantial sums for paintings that have no value.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ZACATECAS, Mexico _ Waiting for a presidential candidate to
arrive at the airport in the central Mexican city of Zacatecas,
Gilberto Macias and Julio Cruz review the problems facing Mexico.
 &HT;    Macias, a light-skinned man in a cowboy hat, is a doctor and a
small farmer who grows beans _ the state of Zacatecas is Mexico's
leading bean producer. ``Seven years ago, beans were at 5 pesos a
kilo,'' he says. ``Today they're at 2.5 (pesos) and production
costs have gone through the roof.''
 &HT;    Cruz works as a systems engineer but, to make ends meet, he runs
a fruit and vegetable stand in a market. ``There's no chance to
work full time as a systems engineer,'' he explains.
 &HT;    The men relate their problems to the country's political system
and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has ruled
since 1929. ``A few people ran this country for 70 years and now
we've had enough,'' says Macias.
 &HT;    Whether a majority of Mexicans share his feelings about the PRI
will become clear on July 2, when voters elect a president to a
six-year term starting in December.
 &HT;    At the airport, Macias and Cruz are waiting for the man they
believe will upset the ruling party and change Mexican politics
forever. In many ways, he is a man like them.
 &HT;    ``He's a businessman and he's a farmer,'' said Macias. ``He's
the first candidate to come from agriculture. He speaks the
language of common Mexicans.''
 &HT;    He is Vicente Fox, the 57-year-old National Action Party (PAN)
presidential candidate. A former president of Coca-Cola for Mexico
and Central America, he quit Coke in 1978 to run his family's
boot-making concern and ranch in his home state of Guanajuato.
 &HT;    Fox stepped into politics in 1988 when he joined the campaign of
the late Manuel Clouthier, presidential candidate of the National
Action Party. Clouthier revived the old rightist party by
attracting young, less ideological businessmen. Those neopanistas
included Vicente Fox, who won a congressional seat that year. In
1995, he was elected governor of Guanajuato, an experience that
turned into a testing ground for much of what he now proposes
regarding agriculture, government reform and economic development.
 &HT;    As a presidential hopeful, Fox has broken all of Mexico's
unwritten rules for politicians.
 &HT;    He is divorced, seldom wears a tie and has a blunt style, rare
for Mexico, which has caused him trouble on numerous occasions.
Although Catholic, he once compared the Catholic Church with the
PRI because both hold monopolies in Mexico. Polls reveal that half
of the population considers him ``impulsive.''
 &HT;    These same polls in February also showed Fox pulling even with
PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, who held an eight-point lead a
month earlier. The center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD) candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, trailed far behind.
 &HT;    To find out what is attracting people like Macias and Cruz to
the Fox campaign, Latin Trade contributor Sam Quinones followed the
candidate on a three-day campaign tour starting in Zacatecas and
moving south to the states of Aguascalientes and Queretaro.
Highlights:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Day 1: Zacatecas
 &HT;    11:45 a.m. Dressed in his trademark open-collar, light blue
shirt and dark blue pants, black cowboy boots and silver FOX belt
buckle, Fox steps from the large royal blue bus bearing his smiling
visage. At 6-foot-5, he towers over the crowd in Zacatecas'
gorgeous colonial center.
 &HT;    ``Hola. Que tal? Echale ganas,'' he says in a deep baritone as
he shakes hands, kisses babies and flashes the V sign that stands
for victory, or Vicente, or both. He walks over to a group of
children in the plaza and tousles the hair of some, bending over to
listen to them. A group of rambunctious 6-year-olds calls out:
``Hey, Fox!'' ``Hey, president!'' He smiles and flashes the V sign
again.
 &HT;    At a press conference, two longtime Zacatecas priistas, Alberto
Rodriguez and Jose Maria Pino, throw their support to Fox. They
areformer backers of Roberto Madrazo, the governor of the
southeastern state of Tabasco who waged a strong but unsuccessful
campaign to become the PRI's candidate. Fox aides believe the
Madrazo candidacy, playing on many priistas' discontent with their
party's hierarchy, created an opening for their man among these
same folks. Actress Irma Dorantes, widow of the late Mexican film
idol Pedro Infante, is also here to endorse Fox.
 &HT;    1:05 p.m. Some 500 students fill the gym at the Instituto
Tecnologico de Zacatecas. On stage, Fox stands with his hands on
his hips, smiling, as their applause washes over him. Javier
Alatorre, the heartthrob TV Azteca anchor, is accompanying the
candidate for a few hours today and his presence creates a stir
among the young women in the gym. The students whistle in fun at
their cohorts who speak from the podium.
 &HT;    Finally, things turn serious. ``Only 10 out of every 100 young
people can go to college today,'' Fox tells the students. He says
education is essential to Mexico's economic and democratic
development. ``We don't aspire to be a country of maquiladoras
(assembly plants).''
 &HT;    Fox disagrees with a student speaker who has called for taking
money from the National University (UNAM), where a nine-month
student strike just ended, and giving it to the technical schools.
Instead, the candidate advocates doubling the education budget and
using the additional money for the technological modernization of
the universities. ``Our real bottleneck is in our lack of highly
trained and educated people,'' he says.
 &HT;    Above all, he says, Mexico and its young people need economic
growth. ``We haven't grown in 30 years,'' he says. ``We have one of
the worst income distributions in the world. We need to grow at 7
percent a year.'' According to Fox, this will create 1.35 million
jobs a year. He says his administration will fuel that growth by
bringing in foreign investment, making it easier for working class
people to save and for ``micro, small and mid-sized businesses'' to
form.
 &HT;    These notions are the core of his economic platform and he will
touch on them in the afternoon at a public housing development,
again at a grilled chicken lunch in a small nearby restaurant and
in almost every other stump speech.
 &HT;    By dusk, the campaign is streaking across a hundred miles of
flat Zacatecas desert, with earth the color of cayenne pepper, in a
state where most towns tell a tale of economic ruin. Zacatecas
state ranks fourth in the number of emigrants it sends to the
United States, but is highest in emigrants per capita. Los Angeles,
California, is home to more Zacatecans than any city in the world.
 &HT;    We are heading to Pinos, a town subsisting on agriculture and
the dollars its errant families send home.
 &HT;    7:40 p.m. The campaign buses roll into the central plaza in
Pinos for an old-fashioned small-town rally. A mariachi band is
here. So are local politicians. The crowd is made up of women in
shawls, young boys in baseball caps and boots and wizened, leathery
men in white straw cowboy hats.
 &HT;    Fox is at home with crowds like these, people to whom he can
talk like ranchers. ``I know your dreams, of how many hopes you sow
when you plant the ground,'' he tells them.
 &HT;    His speeches are extemporaneous. They usually address the
economy, education, the environment, ending Mexico's corruption and
throwing out the party that has ruled the country for so long. He
often details his proposals, a rarity among politicians in Mexico.
Yet at times, as tonight in Pinos, he overdoes it. The crowds lose
their way in his statistics, talk of municipal reform, explanations
of inflation reduction and outlines of loan programs for small
business.
 &HT;    There are other times, though, when he is succinct. ``We're not
just going to elect a president in this election,'' he says.
``We're going to elect the Mexico we want for this century.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Day 2: Aguascalientes
 &HT;    10:15 a.m. A meeting is held with ranchers in Rincon de Romos at
a convention hall. Aguascalientes is a thriving industrial state,
but its large agricultural sector is suffering like elsewhere in
Mexico. So today's themes echo those of Zacatecas: the economy,
reviving agriculture, sustainable development.
 &HT;    Outside the hall, ranchers have parked a line of John Deere
tractors. Farmworker Mauricio Ortega stands beside one. Ortega
supports Fox because he heard what the candidate did as governor of
Guanajuato. ``He's a man who knows about necessities and a man who
knows the hunger of farmworkers,'' Ortega says.
 &HT;    6:45 p.m. Returning to the city of Aguascalientes, a local
reporter interviews Fox like a movie star.
 &HT;    ``Do you cry?''
 &HT;    ``When I see a father who can't buy his children an ice cream,''
Fox says.
 &HT;    ``Do you have a romantic relationship?''
 &HT;    ``No.''
 &HT;    ``Will you reunite with your ex-wife?''
 &HT;    ``I don't know. No.''
 &HT;    After 15 minutes of this, he orders the campaign bus stopped and
transfers to the press bus for the rest of the trip to
Aguascalientes. Surrounded by 20 reporters, he launches into an
off-the-record political chat that takes some bizarre turns. It
ends with reporters offering to take him to a strip club some day,
which he politely turns down.
 &HT;    8 p.m. More than 4,000 people squeeze into Hermanos Carreon
Arena, a basketball gym in the city of Aguascalientes. In
Aguascalientes state, the PAN presence is strong; its governor and
capital city mayor _ both panistas _ warm up the crowd, which
explodes as Fox enters. For several minutes, they applaud him like
a rock star, lighting hundreds of candles in the arena's darkness.
This speech has less policy, more inspiration. ``Our country is
going to change,'' he says. ``The Fox team is 100 million Mexicans
who are working to create a great country.''
 &HT;    It is a solid end to a day that featured five events in three
cities.
 &HT;    Fox flies on to Queretaro. At 11:30 p.m., the press bus departs
for the four-hour trip south. Someone has purchased a sizable
amount of tequila and beer. Before long, reporters stand in the
aisle warbling the songs of Los Tigres del Norte and Jose Alfredo
Jimenez.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Day 3: Queretaro
 &HT;    10:15 a.m. This campaign swing is becoming a Zen-like exercise
of endurance, with each evenresembling the others before it. Fox
stops for another meeting with ranchers in straw cowboy hats in a
region of dry grass. This gathering takes place at a winery near
the town of Ezekiel Montes. It will be followed by a radio
interview, a lunch with supporters and a meeting with a group of
motorcyclists _ the latter produces a photo of Fox, in a helmet and
leather jacket, riding a Harley. Later that same day the candidate
attends a ``lienzo charro'' _ a Mexican rodeo.
 &HT;    On the campaign trail, Fox has many opportunities to play the
populist. Yet he frequently challenges his crowd in a way
uncharacteristic of a politician on the stump.
 &HT;    Consider what he says about bankers, a well-hated group in
Mexico these days. He told the ranchers at Rincon de Romos: ``Many
of us have the idea that the bankers are corrupt, useless, that
they have us under their thumbs. This isn't true. A country needs
banks and bankers. A country needs credit, financing, a savings
system. We need decent, productive and clean bankers.''
 &HT;    He tells fruit growers in Aguascalientes that they will have to
use water more efficiently, that their well pumps will need to be
inspected to make sure they're not wasting electricity.
 &HT;    Today, before these salt-of-the-earth ranchers in Ezekiel
Montes, he discusses the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), which in Mexico has become a code word for increasingly
unpopular free-trade policies.
 &HT;    ``The free-trade agreement isn't bad. It's good. We were right
to sign it,'' he tells them. He explains his agriculture policy,
which includes subsidies to farmers, decentralizing federal
agriculture agencies and transferring many of their
responsibilities and their budgets to the states.
 &HT;    Agriculture's real problem, he says, is that ``the economy
hasn't grown.'' Once the economy grows, it will provide better
domestic markets for what farmers and ranchers produce, as well as
stable prices for seed, fertilizer and farm equipment.
 &HT;    6:10 p.m. The campaign swing comes to an end in the plaza of the
bustling panista city of San Juan del Rio, Queretaro.
 &HT;    Fox arrives in the cab of one the big rigs that joined his
caravan a few miles out of town. A twin-engine plane buzzes over
the crowd of 3,000. Tonight, Fox reiterates the themes and images
that will likely stay with him throughout the campaign. The economy
needs to grow at 7 percent a year to absorb all the young people
entering the job market. The creation of 1.35 million jobs a year.
He dwells again on the pain it causes him to see a father who can't
buy his children an ice cream. To help women, the group with which
he still has the most work to do, he promises laws outlawing wage
and sex discrimination.
 &HT;    ``We need to bring our country up to date,'' he says before
ending the speech and leaving the stage. As families peel away
across the plaza, a group of supporters chants: ``Ya llego! Ya esta
aqui! El que va a sacar al PRI!'' (``He has arrived! He's here! The
one who'll get rid of the PRI!'')
 &HT;    Tomorrow Fox will rest. Then, next week, another trip. Acapulco,
Merida, and the state of Mexico.

180 GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARRESTED AT METHODIST CONFERENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ More than 180 gay rights activists, including a
bishop, were arrested Wednesday protesting the United Methodist
Church's view that homosexual behavior is contrary to Christian
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the national church's General Conference will
consider several gay-related petitions, including one asking for
church blessings for same-sex unions and another allowing gays to
be ordained.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists have been lobbying and demonstrating at the
national legislative assembly since it began May 2, hoping to
change the 8.5-million-member denomination's position defining
homosexual practices as ``incompatible with Christian teaching.''
The church also bans church blessing for gay unions and prohibits
practicing gays from ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists ratcheted up the pressure against church
policy Wednesday morning by holding a rally and march that resulted
in police arrests when protesters blocked a Cleveland Convention
Center roadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to call the United Methodist Church to repentance,
to come away from its sin of bigotry, from its sin of exclusion and
injustice,'' said Jimmy Creech, a former minister who was defrocked
by the denomination last year for blessing a gay couple's union.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mel White, a gay pastor who is a member of the
Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, asked
Methodists to withhold donations from churches that exclude gays
and contribute only to gay-friendly congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those churches that refuse us admission or that punish us when
we come must be shown lovingly that we love the United Methodist
Church,'' White said during the rally.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 protesters supported the demonstration, including
Yolanda King, eldest daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr.,
Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mohandas Gandhi, and the Rev. James
Lawson, a former King colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi and Lawson, along with United Methodist Bishop C. Joseph
Sprague of Chicago, were arrested by Cleveland police after they
refused police orders to move from the roadway. King did not
participate in the blockage because she had to fly to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, singing hymns as they took turns blocking the
roadway, politely complied with police arrest and were led away to
be booked and fined $100 each. Other demonstrators cheered and
applauded as each group of protesters was led away.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention center, about 100 gay rights protesters
stood in the balcony overlooking the conference floor and sang a
hymn prior to the start of delegates' worship. Several delegates
also stood in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But few delegates expect the church to change its stance
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Scott Field of Chicago, who is coordinating lobbying
efforts of several United Methodist evangelical and conservative
groups and churches, said conservatives have been winning several
other issues and elections, indicating strong support for
traditional sex morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a strong vote Thursday, I suspect the numbers of
those seeking change will decline over the next four years,'' Field
said. ``We view (the demonstration) as a last push at this General
Conference. For those who are activists for the gay and lesbian
agenda, they probably will have to make some decision about their
future within the denomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration overshadowed the appearance of Archbishop
George Carey, titular head of the world's 70-million Anglicans. He
was the first Anglican head to ever address the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Methodism was founded by John Wesley, an Anglican priest in
Great Britain. But Anglican officials in the 18th century did not
approve of Wesley or his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Carey told delegates that church unity does not require
``uniformity and sameness.'' Delegates applauded when he stated
that he opposed it when ``one part of the (church) family believes
that they hold the truth and nobody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican Church worldwide is also debating gay rights and
Carey has been trying to keep the denomination from splitting over
the issue of blessing of same-sex unions and ordination of gays.
</P>
<P>
   He urged that Christians unite in evangelism, social ministry
and other activities.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Growth, jobs and tax cuts _ too good to be true? LATIN TRADE
contributor Sam Quinones talks with National Action Party
presidential candidate Vicente Fox about his promises for Mexico.
Excerpts:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: You speak of the need to grow 7 percent annually in
order to create 1.35 million jobs a year. President Ernesto Zedillo
promised something similar and failed. How would you succeed?
 &HT;    FOX: We're going to work intensely to bring investment in from
abroad. In Guanajuato, we brought investment from more than 30
countries. To do this you need confidence and the rule of law.
Zedillo doesn't have that. There's corruption and impunity.
 &HT;    You have to give fiscal incentives to investors. We'll exempt
all new companies investing in the southeast, the most
underdeveloped part of Mexico, from paying property taxes for
between five and 10 years.
 &HT;    We also need to stimulate our own savings. We're going to
achieve a budget surplus by my fourth year as president, something
that's never happened in this country. So the government itself
will be a saver. Today, only 25 percent of the working population
is in a savings or retirement plan. We're going to extend these
plans to the rest of the population.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What are your proposals with regard to rehabilitating
agriculture?
 &HT;    First, decentralization of all the government agencies that have
to do with agriculture. We want the states to take the
responsibility and the budget to resolve agricultural problems.
 &HT;    Second, an intense effort to modernize and bring technology to
agriculture. All countries subsidize and support their own
agriculture. We have to support and subsidize agriculture by paying
farmers when the prices for their produce don't reach a price
that's profitable.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What reforms to local government would you make?
 &HT;    I'd make two. First, that a mayor could be re-elected to a
second three-year term. Second, that there's the possibility of
installing professional city administrators. This will help create
a civil service, so that he who specializes in garbage disposal
becomes an expert in garbage disposal. Meanwhile, the mayor will be
dedicated to political aspects of the city, public relations and
attracting investment to town.
 &HT;    We also need to decentralize the budget. Today, 20 percent of
all taxes are returned to states and cities (from the federal
government). We're going to raise that to 45 percent, in order to
develop local infrastructure, local necessities for the development
of rural areas and working-class neighborhoods.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    You advocate doubling education spending and increasing money
for the states and cities. Where will you get the funds?
 &HT;    Through fiscal reform. This will bring in additional income
without increasing taxes.
 &HT;    We're going to make the economy grow. That growth will bring in
more revenue. We'll save on expenses, by building a government that
costs less and produces more. In Guanajuato we reduced by 30
percent the cost of government. We'll do this at the federal level.
We'll get rid of red tape. We're going to eliminate taxes, such as
the tax on new cars.
 &HT;    We'll make sure we comply with discipline on the economy's
fundamentals so that we can bring investment to Mexico. We're going
to avoid fiscal deficits. We're going to make sure that the Central
Bank is absolutely independent and responsible for monetary and
exchange-rate policies and committed by law to reduce inflation of
2 percent or 3 percent.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) says it guarantees
stability in Mexico. Why would a change be better for Mexico?
 &HT;    The PRI claims stability, but what it's built in Mexico is
poverty. Forty million poor people. We have guerrillas in Chiapas.
The country grows for one or two years, and then we go backward for
another two years. We get political crimes, like (the 1994
assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo) Colosio.
We have problems like the UNAM student strike. All are products of
the political incapacity to resolve problems.
 &HT;    The governments of (Carlos) Salinas and Zedillo have always been
praised from abroad for their macroeconomic results. That's totally
unfair. They've deceived everybody abroad. We've been losing
purchasing power for 18 years in a row. We have the same per capita
income we had 30 years ago _ US$4,000 _ and it's one of the most
unevenly distributed incomes in the world.
 &HT;    Corruption and drug smuggling are all over the country. (The
PRI) generated that problem. It is not the solution.

SPORTS COLUMN: DON'T WORRY 'BOUT A THING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Knicks fans worry. They like to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Correction: Knicks fans love to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Worry is the nature of the city. Worry defines every crevice of
city life where people's lives rest on such a fragile precipice
from the stock market to the Mets. Worry gives the city its pulse.
</P>
<P>
   When Knicks fans worry, the group neurosis starts at the top of
Manhattan and works its way down to the tip; it extends from
borough to borough.
</P>
<P>
   The fans come out of an enthralling come-from-behind victory
delightedly drained. They come out of a loss steaming, ready to
trade whoever the goat was in that particular game _ usually the
Ward-Childs backcourt. They groan whenever Patrick Ewing gets the
ball in the low post; erupt in cheers when he scores; throw up
their hands when he misses. All the time loving every minute.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks fans never did warm up to Pat Riley, although they
certainly appreciated his style. But Riley didn't worry, even at
times like this, when as Heat coach he has had good reason to worry
after his team squandered its home court advantage by losing Game 2
on Tuesday night. Riley never did worry. Not outwardly.
</P>
<P>
   Now Knicks fans like Jeff Van Gundy. He worries and wears worry
on his sleeve. Van Gundy seems to agonize over everything from a
sloppy possession to the fans' treatment of Charlie Ward, Chris
Childs and especially Ewing. But he realizes that the outbursts are
a manifestation of the fans' need to fret.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got rid of everybody after Game 1 who people criticized
and had an opinion about, we'd have trotted out with three guys for
Game 2,'' Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Worry may be the pastime of Knicks fans. But this will be a
different kind of playoff spring for them: worry free.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 12 days _ from the end of the Miami series to the
conference championship _ most likely with Indiana _ Knicks fans
won't have a lot to worry about. For all the game-to-game
hand-wringing and analysis, the Knicks are better than the
one-dimensional, muscle-bound Heat, better than the aging Pacers.
Blasphemous, I know. But true.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are better: better than the Heat, better than the
Pacers or the Sixers, better than last year's Knicks, who reached
the finals. These Knicks are balanced, rich in depth, rich in
scorers. This is a team that can have Sprewell and Houston mired in
shooting slumps simultaneously and still beat Miami in Miami _
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   After practice Wednesday, Van Gundy said he told Houston and
Sprewell at halftime Tuesday night not to worry: They didn't have
to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. Childs and
Ward could outplay Miami's backcourt with Tim Hardaway hobbled, the
Heat still doesn't have an answer for Marcus Camby and, at the
moment of truth, Ewing always seems good for a couple fools' points
against his protege, Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two shouldn't feel the burden of `If I don't get going,
we're not going to win,''' Van Gundy said. ``Lattrell is what _ 6
for 27? I don't want him to be worried so that it takes away from
the other parts of his game. He and Allan have to do the best
possible job they can, play the best possible basketball they can
and then deal with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about how to get them going. If a team
wants to commit two guys to one person, then that's going to open
up other things for other people, so other people are going to have
to step forward like Charlie did last night. Kurt did a good job,
and Marcus did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what does Van Gundy worry about? ``The overall mentality.
How we approach Game 3, corrections we need to make to give us a
chance to play better in Game 3. A writer will deal with an
individual story line; for me, the team is the story line: `How can
we win?'''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson and Ewing spent the off day taking extra practice.
Johnson was at one end shooting free throws. Ewing was at the other
end shooting jumpers, flexing his knee, loosening his back. After
the workout, Ewing said wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about my back,'' he said. ``I'm able to play,
that's the bottom line. I'm not limping around like last year.'' Is
he hurting more than he's revealing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even worried about that, I'm ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the back? ``I'm tired of answering that _ don't
ask no more about my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficult as this may be, Knicks fans should not worry about
this series and the next. Relax. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty to worry about when the finals begin, come
June 2.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Growth, jobs and tax cuts _ too good to be true? LATIN TRADE
contributor Sam Quinones talks with National Action Party
presidential candidate Vicente Fox about his promises for Mexico.
Excerpts:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: You speak of the need to grow 7 percent annually in
order to create 1.35 million jobs a year. President Ernesto Zedillo
promised something similar and failed. How would you succeed?
 &HT;    FOX: We're going to work intensely to bring investment in from
abroad. In Guanajuato, we brought investment from more than 30
countries. To do this you need confidence and the rule of law.
Zedillo doesn't have that. There's corruption and impunity.
 &HT;    You have to give fiscal incentives to investors. We'll exempt
all new companies investing in the southeast, the most
underdeveloped part of Mexico, from paying property taxes for
between five and 10 years.
 &HT;    We also need to stimulate our own savings. We're going to
achieve a budget surplus by my fourth year as president, something
that's never happened in this country. So the government itself
will be a saver. Today, only 25 percent of the working population
is in a savings or retirement plan. We're going to extend these
plans to the rest of the population.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What are your proposals with regard to rehabilitating
agriculture?
 &HT;    First, decentralization of all the government agencies that have
to do with agriculture. We want the states to take the
responsibility and the budget to resolve agricultural problems.
 &HT;    Second, an intense effort to modernize and bring technology to
agriculture. All countries subsidize and support their own
agriculture. We have to support and subsidize agriculture by paying
farmers when the prices for their produce don't reach a price
that's profitable.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What reforms to local government would you make?
 &HT;    I'd make two. First, that a mayor could be re-elected to a
second three-year term. Second, that there's the possibility of
installing professional city administrators. This will help create
a civil service, so that he who specializes in garbage disposal
becomes an expert in garbage disposal. Meanwhile, the mayor will be
dedicated to political aspects of the city, public relations and
attracting investment to town.
 &HT;    We also need to decentralize the budget. Today, 20 percent of
all taxes are returned to states and cities (from the federal
government). We're going to raise that to 45 percent, in order to
develop local infrastructure, local necessities for the development
of rural areas and working-class neighborhoods.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    You advocate doubling education spending and increasing money
for the states and cities. Where will you get the funds?
 &HT;    Through fiscal reform. This will bring in additional income
without increasing taxes.
 &HT;    We're going to make the economy grow. That growth will bring in
more revenue. We'll save on expenses, by building a government that
costs less and produces more. In Guanajuato we reduced by 30
percent the cost of government. We'll do this at the federal level.
We'll get rid of red tape. We're going to eliminate taxes, such as
the tax on new cars.
 &HT;    We'll make sure we comply with discipline on the economy's
fundamentals so that we can bring investment to Mexico. We're going
to avoid fiscal deficits. We're going to make sure that the Central
Bank is absolutely independent and responsible for monetary and
exchange-rate policies and committed by law to reduce inflation of
2 percent or 3 percent.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) says it guarantees
stability in Mexico. Why would a change be better for Mexico?
 &HT;    The PRI claims stability, but what it's built in Mexico is
poverty. Forty million poor people. We have guerrillas in Chiapas.
The country grows for one or two years, and then we go backward for
another two years. We get political crimes, like (the 1994
assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo) Colosio.
We have problems like the UNAM student strike. All are products of
the political incapacity to resolve problems.
 &HT;    The governments of (Carlos) Salinas and Zedillo have always been
praised from abroad for their macroeconomic results. That's totally
unfair. They've deceived everybody abroad. We've been losing
purchasing power for 18 years in a row. We have the same per capita
income we had 30 years ago _ US$4,000 _ and it's one of the most
unevenly distributed incomes in the world.
 &HT;    Corruption and drug smuggling are all over the country. (The
PRI) generated that problem. It is not the solution.

PENTAGON ASSESSES RISKS OF REDUCING NUCLEAR ARSENAL IN PACT WITH
RUSSIA

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is assessing the risk to national
security of cutting its nuclear arsenal to 2,000 warheads under an
arms-reduction treaty with Russia, a step that could help President
Clinton broker a missile-defense deal with Moscow before he leaves
office, administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The highly classified review has been under way for months, but
it has intensified in recent weeks in advance of Clinton's
scheduled summit meeting with President Vladimir Putin early next
month in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and the commander of the strategic arsenal, Adm.
Richard W. Mies, will hold the latest in a series of meetings in
the ``tank,'' a supersecure conference room in the Pentagon, to
gauge the effects of deeper cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, the findings and recommendations are expected to
be sent to Cohen and to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, for final approval before the assessment is
delivered to Clinton in preparation for the Moscow meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a better understanding of the risk at the
lower numbers and whether we can still meet the deterrent
strategy,'' said a senior Pentagon official involved in the study.
``It's a prudent thing to do with the summit coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal includes 7,200 warheads.
Russia has 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Helsinki three years ago, Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, who was
then president of Russia, agreed to cut the number of long-range
warheads on each side to no more than 2,000 to 2,500 by the end of
2007 by negotiating a third strategic arms reduction treaty, Start
III. The two leaders reaffirmed their pledge in June in Cologne,
Germany, although Russia is pushing for both countries to go even
lower, to 1,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the official U.S. negotiating position that Start III
levels range from 2,000 to 2,500 warheads, the Joint Chiefs have
always said they would need at least 2,500 warheads to carry out
the nation's nuclear war plan, which is thought to include
thousands of individual targets on potentially hostile territory.
The new review is testing whether that assumption continues to
hold.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Start III has become a bargaining chip for the administration,
which has offered to carry it out if Moscow agrees to what U.S.
officials describe as modest changes to the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty of 1972. Those changes would allow the United States to
field a limited missile defense system that administration
officials say is intended to protect the United States against
missile strikes from countries like Iran, Iraq and North Korea or
an accidental launching from a superpower.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia opposes such a defense, leaving administration
officials searching for ways to enhance the incentives for Moscow
to change its mind. Part of the solution may lie in lower Start III
force levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall purpose is to take stock of how it all plays out,
and if there is any chance of potentially lower numbers,'' said a
second senior Defense Department official involved in the
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, the review is confined to examining the risks
at various levels in the 2,000-to-2,500 range, administration
officials said. ``We are not looking outside the range, and no one
has come to us yet with pressure to say, we need to go below those
numbers,'' said a third senior Pentagon official familiar with the
review.
</P>
<P>
   But some White House and State Department officials are asking
what military officials consider leading questions going down to
2,000 and slightly below what Pentagon officials call ``the red
line.'' Some U.S. arms negotiators believe that if the review finds
that the military could fulfill its strategic deterrent mission
with 2,000 warheads, then diplomats could finesse the differences
with Russia and propose a range of 1,500 to 2,000 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is an attempt on the part of the
administration to accommodate the Russians without having to change
the definition of deterrence,'' said one former top military
officer who is wary of deeper reductions. ``Two thousand warheads
was the absolute most painful level for the military. Now they're
going back, I'm afraid, and taking the floor and using it to make a
new ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The assessment and its potential implications have divided the
government. Some civilian experts in the Defense Department, State
Department and National Security Council are open to deeper cuts.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff is opposed to reductions that they
believe could hurt national security and set off _ not discourage _
a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chiefs are concerned about arms reductions that reduce the
flexibility in the strategic deterrence and put at risk maintaining
all three legs of the triad,'' said Capt. Steven R. Pietropaoli, a
spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The triad is the fleet of submarines, bombers and long-range
missiles that carry nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One way that the Pentagon is considering reducing the Start III
levels, at least on paper, is through the arcane counting rules for
nuclear weapons. At any given moment, not all submarines are at sea
or bombers on alert. Military officials are considering whether to
count, at least in one measure, only those nuclear weapons that are
ready to perform the mission. That could reduce the Start III
levels by 200 to 300 so-called ``phantom'' warheads, administration
officials said, and approach the 2,000 figure at the lower end of
the range.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff are also weighing various combinations
of submarines, bombers and long-range missiles _ called the force
structure _ to see if the nuclear deterrent can be maintained at
lower overall numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. military officials argue that for cost reasons, Russia
is reducing its strategic forces. Alexei Arbatov, deputy chairman
of the Russian Parliament Defense Committee, said at a conference
here this week that if Russia were forced to keep Start I levels
(6,000 warheads), it would cost $33 billion over 10 years; at Start
II levels (3,000 to 3,500 warheads), $26 billion over 10 years; and
at Start III levels, $14 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been involved in discussions with the Joint Staff about
various alternatives, none of which I'm permitted to talk about,''
said Capt. Ron Morse, a spokesman for the U.S. Strategic Command,
which Mies heads.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the United States is required to maintain at least the
levels of Start, signed in 1991, until Start II goes into effect.
Start II was approved by the Senate in 1995, but it was not until
last month that the Russian Parliament gave its own backing to the
accord. And the Senate still has to vote on ratifying several
protocols to Start II before it goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats are sharply divided
over the proposed deeper reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., accused the administration Wednesday of
considering unilateral cuts down to 1,500 warheads, a position that
the White House denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all part of a rush to have Bill Clinton do something
that he hopes will capture the imagination of the American
people,'' Weldon said in an interview, ``but it's not rooted in
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday rejected, 40-17,
a proposal by Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, to permit the Pentagon to
reduce unilaterally its strategic forces to Start II levels before
the treaty actually enters into force.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon supports such a measure. The military estimates,
for example, that maintaining the 50 Peacekeeper missiles that are
retired under Start II will cost $1 billion through 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Democrats, including Carl Levin of Michigan and Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, say the country can maintain a nuclear
deterrent with far fewer than 2,000 to 2,500 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sustain a lower number politically, provided that
number is viewed not as a political number, but as a security
number coming from the people responsible for security planning,''
Levin recently told the Arms Control Association. ``But if it is
done as something that is done politically, it will not have the
kind of support that it should.''

 &HT;    ZACATECAS, Mexico _ Mientras esperan la llegada de un candidato
presidencial al aeropuerto de Zacatecas, en la region central de
Mexico, Gilberto Macias y Julio Cruz pasan revista a los problemas
que encara el pais.
 &HT;    Macias, un hombre de tez clara con un sombrero de vaquero, es
medico y ademas cultiva frijoles (el estado de Zacatecas es el
principal productor de frijoles de Mexico). ``Hace siete anos, los
frijoles se vendian a cinco pesos el kilo,'' dice. ``Hoy se venden
a 2,5 pesos y el costo de produccion esta por las nubes.''
 &HT;    Cruz trabaja de ingeniero de sistemas, pero para redondear sus
ingresos tambien tiene un puesto de verduras y frutas en un
mercado. ``Es imposible trabajar como ingeniero de sistemas a
jornada completa,'' explica.
 &HT;    Los dos hombres dicen que sus problemas se deben al sistema
politico y al Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), en el
poder desde 1929. ``Este pais ha estado gobernado por un grupo de
individuos durante 70 anos y ya es demasiado,'' dice Macias.
 &HT;    El 2 de julio, cuando el electorado elija a un presidente que
comenzara su mandato de seis anos en diciembre, se sabra si la
mayoria de los mexicanos piensa lo mismo que Macias.
 &HT;    En el aeropuerto, Macias y Cruz esperan al hombre que, segun
creen, sacara del poder al partido gobernante y cambiara la
politica mexicana para siempre. En muchos sentidos, es un hombre
como ellos.
 &HT;    ``Es un hombre de negocios y un agricultor,'' dijo Macias. ``Es
el primer candidato que viene del agro. Habla el lenguaje del
mexicano comun.''
 &HT;    Es Vicente Fox, candidato presidencial por el Partido Accion
Nacional (PAN). Fox fue presidente de la division mexicana y
centroamericana de Coca-Cola, y renuncio en 1978 para dirigir el
rancho y la fabrica de botas de su familia en su estado natal de
Guanajuato.
 &HT;    Fox entro en la politica en 1988, cuando se unio a la campana de
Manuel Clouthier, candidato presidencial por el PAN. Clouthier
revivio al viejo partido derechista atrayendo a empresarios jovenes
y menos ideologicos.
 &HT;    Entre esos neopanistas estaba Vicente Fox, que gano un escano en
el Congreso ese ano. En 1995, lo eligieron gobernador de
Guanajuato, y ese periodo le sirvio para probar gran parte de las
ideas que ahora propone con respecto a la agricultura, la reforma
del gobierno y el desarrollo economico.
 &HT;    Como aspirante a la presidencia, Fox ha roto todas las reglas no
escritas para los politicos mexicanos.
 &HT;    Es divorciado, rara vez usa corbata y tiene un estilo directo,
algo muy poco comun en Mexico, que le ha causado problemas en
muchas ocasiones.
 &HT;    Aunque es catolico, una vez comparo a la Iglesia Catolica con el
PRI porque ambos son monopolios en Mexico. Las encuestas revelan
que la mitad de la poblacion lo considera ``impulsivo.''
 &HT;    En febrero, esas mismas encuestas tambien indicaron un empate de
Fox con Francisco Labastida, el candidato del PRI, que tenia una
ventaja de ocho puntos un mes antes. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidato
por el Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), de
centroizquierda, estaba muy a la zaga.
 &HT;    Para descubrir que es lo que atrae a individuos como Macias y
Cruz a la campana de Fox, Sam Quinones, colaborador de Latin Trade,
siguio al candidato en una gira de tres dias que comenzo en
Zacatecas y continuo rumbo sur a los estados de Aguascalientes y
Queretaro.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PRIMER DIA: Zacatecas
 &HT;    11:45 a.m. Vestido con pantalones azul oscuro, camisa azul claro
con el cuello abierto, como lo lleva casi siempre, botas negras de
vaquero y un cinturon con hebilla de plata que lleva grabado su
apellido, Fox se baja del enorme autobus azul con una ancha
sonrisa. Con sus 1,95 metros de estatura, se destaca sobre la
multitud reunida en el centro colonial de Zacatecas.
 &HT;    ``Hola, que tal? Echale ganas,'' dice con una profunda voz de
baritono mientras estrecha manos, besa a bebes y hace la senal de
la V, que significa victoria, o Vicente, o ambas cosas. Avanza
hacia un grupo de ninos en medio de la plaza, les revuelve el pelo,
se inclina para escucharlos. Varios ninos le gritan: ``Fox!
Presidente!'' Fox sonrie y hace otra vez la senal de la victoria.
 &HT;    En una conferencia de prensa, dos viejos priistas de Zacatecas,
Alberto Rodriguez y Jose Maria Pino, le dan su respaldo a Fox.
Ambos apoyaron a Roberto Madrazo, elgobernador del estado de
Tabasco que lanzo una campana fuerte pero infructuosa por la
candidatura del PRI. Los asesores de Fox piensan que la candidatura
de Madrazo, que se basaba en el descontento de muchos priistas con
la jerarquia del partido, creo un espacio para Fox entre los
seguidores de Madrazo. La actriz Irma Dorantes, viuda del difunto
idolo Pedro Infante, tambien acudio a manifestar su apoyo a Fox.
 &HT;    1:05 p.m. Unos 500 estudiantes llenan el gimnasio en el
Instituto Tecnologico de Zacatecas. En la tribuna, Fox se para con
las manos en las caderas, sonriente, mientras lo aclaman con una
lluvia de aplausos. Javier Alatorre, el apuesto presentador de TV
Azteca, acompana al candidato por unas horas y su presencia crea
una conmocion entre las jovenes presentes en el gimnasio. Los
estudiantes silban y ovacionan a sus companeros que hablan en el
podio.
 &HT;    Luego llega la seriedad. ``Solo 10 de cada 100 jovenes puede ir
a la universidad,'' dice Fox a los estudiantes. Subraya que la
educacion es esencial para el desarrollo economico y democratico de
Mexico. ``No aspiramos a ser un pais de maquiladoras.''
 &HT;    Fox no esta de acuerdo con un estudiante que ha pedido que se le
quite dinero a la Universidad Nacional Autonoma (UNAM), donde una
huelga estudiantil de nueve meses termino hace poco, para darselo a
las escuelas tecnicas. Pero en su lugar el candidato propone
duplicar el presupuesto de educacion y usar los fondos adicionales
para la modernizacion tecnologica de las universidades. ``Donde
tenemos el cuello de botella es en la falta de individuos
instruidos y bien capacitados,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Fox dice que Mexico y su gente joven necesitan sobre todo
crecimiento economico. ``No hemos crecido en 30 anos,'' senala.
``Tenemos una de las peores distribuciones de ingresos del mundo.
Necesitamos crecer un 7 por ciento anual.'' Segun Fox, ese
crecimiento creara 1,35 millones de empleos al ano. Tambien dice
que su gobierno estimularia el crecimiento con la captacion de
inversion extranjera, lo que facilitaria a la clase trabajadora
ahorrar para poner ``negocios pequenos y medianos y
microempresas.''
 &HT;    Estas nociones son el fundamento de su plataforma economica.
Vuelve a tratarlas al mediodia, en un proyecto de vivienda publica;
despues durante un almuerzo en un pequeno restaurante cercano y
practicamente en todos los discursos del dia.
 &HT;    Al atardecer, la campana ya ha recorrido mas de 250 kilometros
por el desierto de Zacatecas, por vastas tierras del color de la
pimienta en un estado donde la mayoria de los pueblos sufren la
ruina economica. Zacatecas es el cuarto estado en cantidad de
emigrantes a Estados Unidos, pero el de mas emigrantes per capita.
En Los Angeles hay mas oriundos de Zacatecas que en cualquier lugar
del mundo.
 &HT;    7:40 p.m. Los autobuses de la campana entran en la plaza de
Pinos y se celebra un acto a la usanza antigua, con la presencia de
politicos locales, una banda de mariachis y una muchedumbre
compuesta por mujeres con chales, ninos con gorras de pelotero y
botas y hombres enjutos con sombreros blancos de vaquero.
 &HT;    Fox se siente a sus anchas en reuniones como esta, entre
personas con las que puede hablar como un ranchero. ``Conozco sus
suenos, las esperanzas que siembran cuando plantan el terreno,''
les dice.
 &HT;    Sus discursos son improvisados y generalmente tratan de la
economia, la educacion, el medio ambiente, el fin de la corrupcion
y la salida de un partido que gobierna desde hace demasiado tiempo.
Muchas veces detalla sus propuestas, cosa rara entre los politicos
de Mexico. Pero a veces, como esta noche en Pinos, se excede. La
multitud se pierde en la marana de estadisticas, planes de reforma
municipal, explicaciones de la reduccion de la inflacion y el
bosquejo de programas de prestamo para los pequenos negocios.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, en otras ocasiones es escueto. ``No vamos a elegir
solamente a un presidente,'' dice. ``Vamos a elegir al Mexico que
queremos para este siglo.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SEGUNDO DIA: Aguascalientes
 &HT;    10:15 a.m. Se celebra una reunion con rancheros en Rincon de
Romos. Aguascalientes es un prospero estado industrial, pero su
gran sector agricola sufre una crisis como en las demas regiones de
Mexico. De modo que los temas de hoy repiten los de Zacatecas: la
economia, la reanimacion de la agricultura, el desarrollo
sostenible.
 &HT;    Afuera, los rancheros han estacionado sus tractores John Deere.
El trabajador agricola Mauricio Ortega esta de pie junto a un
tractor. Ortega apoya a Fox porque ha oido hablar de lo que hizo el
candidato como gobernador de Guanajuato. ``Es un hombre que sabe lo
que es la necesidad y que conoce el hambre de los obreros
agricolas,'' dice Ortega.
 &HT;    6:45 p.m. De regreso a la ciudad de Aguascalientes, un reportero
local entrevista a Fox como si fuera una estrella de cine.
 &HT;    ``Llora?''
 &HT;    ``Cuando veo a un padre que no les puede comprar un helado a sus
hijos,'' dice Fox.
 &HT;    ``Tiene una relacion sentimental?''
 &HT;    ``No.''
 &HT;    ``Volvera con su ex esposa?''
 &HT;    ``No lo se. No.''
 &HT;    Despues de 15 minutos de este tipo de preguntas, Fox ordena que
su autobus se detenga y se pasa al autobus de la prensa por el
resto del viaje a Aguascalientes. Rodeado por 20 reporteros, se
lanza a una conversacion privada sobre politica que de momento
tiene giros insolitos. Al terminar la charla, los reporteros le
ofrecen llevarlo algun dia a un club de bailarinas desnudas.
 &HT;    8 p.m. Mas de 4.000 personas se congregan en la instalacion
deportiva Hermanos Carreon en Aguascalientes. La presencia del PAN
es fuerte en Aguascalientes: su gobernador y el alcalde de la
capital, ambos panistas, saludan a la muchedumbre, que se desborda
de entusiasmo cuando entra Fox. Lo aplauden durante varios minutos
como si fuera un astro y encienden cientos de velas en medio de la
oscuridad. El discurso tiene menos politica y mas inspiracion.
``Nuestro pais va a cambiar,'' dice. ``El equipo de Fox esta
formado por 100 millones de mexicanos que trabajan para crear un
gran pais.''
 &HT;    Es un final solido a una jornada de cinco actividades en tres
ciudades.
 &HT;    Fox se traslada por avion Queretaro. A las 11:30 p.m., el
autobus de la prensa sale en viaje de cuatro horas al sur. Alguien
ha comprado una cantidad enorme de tequila y cerveza. Poco despues,
los reporteros estan de pie en el pasillo del bus, cantando las
melodias de Los Tigres del Norte y de Jose Alfredo Jimenez.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TERCER DIA: Queretaro
 &HT;    10:15 a.m. Esta campana se esta convirtiendo en un ejercicio de
paciencia: cada evento es practicamente igual a los anteriores. Fox
sostiene otra reunion con rancheros que lucen sombreros de vaquero,
en una vineria cerca del pueblo de Ezekiel Montes. Siguio una
entrevista radial, un almuerzo con partidarios y una reunion con un
grupo de motociclistas en la que le tomaron una foto a Fox, con
casco y chaqueta de cuero, encima de una Harley. Ese mismo dia, el
candidato asistio a un lienzo charro, un rodeo mexicano.
 &HT;    Fox tiene muchas oportunidades de hacerse el populista, pero
prefiere debatir con la muchedumbre de una forma poco comun entre
los politicos en campana.
 &HT;    Sobre los banqueros, grupo odiado en Mexico en estos tiempos,
expreso a los rancheros en Rincon de Romos: ``Muchos pensamos que
los banqueros son corruptos, inutiles, que nos tienen bajo su bota.
Eso no es cierto. Los paises necesitan bancos y banqueros. Los
paises necesitan credito, financiamiento, un sistema de ahorros.
Necesitamos banqueros decentes, productivos y honestos.''
 &HT;    Les dice a los cultivadores de frutas de Aguascalientes que
tendran que usar el agua con mas eficiencia, que hay que
inspeccionar las bombas de los pozos para comprobar que funcionan
bien.
 &HT;    Hoy, ante estos rancheros de Ezekiel Montes, habla del Tratado
de Libre Comercio (TLC/NAFTA), que en Mexico se ha convertido en
sinonimo de impopulares practicas de libre comercio.
 &HT;    ``El acuerdo de libre comercio no es malo. Es bueno. Tuvimos
razon al firmarlo.'' Explica su politica agricola, que comprende
subsidios a los agricultores, la descentralizacion de entes
federales y el traspaso de muchas de sus responsabilidades y
presupuestos a los estados.
 &HT;    El verdadero problema de la agricultura, dice, es que ``la
economia no ha crecido.'' Cuando la economia crezca, generara
mejores mercados internos para los productos del campo, asi como
una estabilidad en el precio de las semillas, los fertilizantes y
los implementos agricolas.
 &HT;    6:10 p.m. San Juan del Rio, Queretaro: La gira llega a su fin en
la plaza de esta animada ciudad panista.
 &HT;    Fox llega en uno de los enormes remolques que se unieron a su
caravana. Un bimotor vuela sobre la muchedumbre de 3.000 personas.
 &HT;    Esta noche Fox reitera los temas y las imagenes que lo
caracterizaran durante toda la campana. La economia necesita crecer
el 7 por ciento anual para absorber a todos los jovenes que entran
en el mercado laboral. La creacion de 1,35 millones de empleos al
ano. Vuelve a expresar el dolor que siente cuando ve a un padre que
no puede comprar helado a sus hijos. Promete leyes para prohibir la
discriminacion sexual y laboral.
 &HT;    ``Necesitamos modernizar nuestro pais,'' dice antes de concluir
el discurso y bajar de la tribuna. Mientras las familias se van
retirando de la plaza, un grupo de partidarios corea: ``Ya llego!
Ya esta aqui! El que va a sacar al PRI!''
 &HT;    Manana Fox descansara. Luego vendra otra semana, otro viaje.
Acapulco, Merida y el estado de Mexico.

ANALYSIS: SENATE RACE THROWN INTO CONFUSION BY GIULIANI'S
ANNOUNCEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-GIULIANI) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was still the Republican
candidate for Senate on Wednesday night, even after Wednesday's
tumultuous turn of events. But state Republican leaders were
already turning their sights on two Republicans _ a Long Island
congressman and a wealthy Wall Street philanthropist _ to step into
the race in case Giuliani drops out of the contest with Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the potential candidates, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island,
spoke by telephone Wednesday evening with William Powers, the state
Republican chairman, to review the prospects of his entering the
race should Giuliani not run, Republican officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The second, Theodore J. Forstmann, a Wall Street investor who
personally financed a program to allow poor children to attend
private schools, was moving to set up meetings with Republican
leaders next week to discuss his own prospective candidacy, his
associates said.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden flurry of activity in what has until now been seen as
Giuliani's uncontested bid for the nomination came amid signs of
confusion and concern among party leaders struggling to keep
abreast of a rapid day of revelations about Giuliani and his
marriage to Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Republicans offered public support for Giuliani,
insisting that the disclosures would not hurt his standing with
voters, there was clear evidence of concern over whether the mayor
would stay in the race and, if he did, whether he would be a
seriously weakened opponent to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after Giuliani announced that he and Donna Hanover were
seeking a separation, a senior New York Republican described it as
a favorable development, contending that it would put an end to
intensive coverage in the New York tabloids about his close
friendship with Judith Nathan, a pharmaceuticals executive. But 20
minutes after Hanover held her own news conference to say that
Giuliani had had ``a relationship'' with a staff member, the same
Republican called back to retract the statement: ``My quote no
longer stands _ even on an anonymous basis.''
</P>
<P>
   And Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and
typically one of Giuliani's most loyal defenders, declined a
request for an interview on Wednesday to discuss this latest
episode in the mayor's political life.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of almost unheard-of turmoil in the New York Republican
Party, Lazio and Forstmann moved gingerly to position themselves in
the event that Giuliani dropped out, without, their aides said,
doing anything to appear as if they were taking ungraceful
advantage of Giuliani's difficulties. Aides to both men said they
would enter the race only if Giuliani dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides said that Giuliani had not made a final
decision about his future, though his own associates _ who were
caught off guard by Giuliani's announcement _ described themselves
as increasingly pessimistic that Giuliani would make the race.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani announced last week that he had prostate cancer,
he said that he hoped to make a decision about whether he would
stay in the race, based on his treatment, by the middle of May.
Some Republicans, concerned that the disclosures about Giuliani's
personal life could make him a weaker candidate, said on Wednesday
that they hoped Giuliani would not drag out his decision if he
intended to abandon the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention is May 30. But time is pressing for
the Republican Party, because Lazio and Forstmann are both unknown
and inexperienced candidates, and thus could find themselves
disadvantaged in a race with Clinton, who has spent nearly a year
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio would also have to move to raise money to finance the
campaign, a particularly urgent need in order to pay for television
advertisements to present himself to voters.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Forstmann said he was prepared to finance his own
race. One senior Republican said that Forstmann's wealth, and his
asserted interest in paying for his own campaign, was one of his
great potential assets. That said, there is an established history
of wealthy people's running for office for the first time and
failing.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had, with the tacit support of Gov. George Pataki,
threatened to run a primary against Giuliani for the Republican
nomination last fall. He backed off, reluctantly, in response to
pressure from Republicans who saw Giuliani as the party's strongest
candidate. Through a spokesman, Lazio clearly signaled his
continuing interest in the race on Wednesday night, but said, ``I
shall take no action regarding the U.S. Senate race until the mayor
announces his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has been mentioned by Republicans as the strongest
potential replacement, given his statewide recognition, popularity
and fund-raising ability. But his advisers repeated on Wednesday
that the two-term governor had no interest in serving in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of dark humor at Giuliani's campaign headquarters,
where aides, at once giddy and gloomy, relied on television and
newspaper reporters to track developments in their candidate's
life. Across the state, Republican supporters of Giuliani argued
that developments in the mayor's personal life would have no
bearing on the campaign, and that the announcement of the
separation would remove the issue of Giuliani's marriage from the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should go full steam ahead,'' said State Sen. Roy Goodman,
the Manhattan Republican leader. ``I do not think it will affect
the political picture at all. It's strictly a personal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans warned that the disclosures about
Giuliani's personal life would raise questions about him among
conservative, upstate and female voters, doubts that he could not
afford in a race that polls show to be very close.
</P>
<P>
   One of Giuliani's advisers said on Wednesday night that the
latest news could be an advantage, by presenting the mayor as human
and candid. But many Republicans described that argument as wishful
thinking at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this helps,'' said Nelson Warfield, who was the
spokesman for Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996, and who has
has been a frequent critic of Giuliani. ``It's mere happy talk to
suggest it humanizes him. Nobody needs to be humanized this way.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Crecimiento, empleos y reduccion fiscal ... Sera demasiado bueno
para ser cierto? Sam Quinones, colaborador de LATIN TRADE, habla
con el candidato presidencial del Partido Accion Nacional, Vicente
Fox, sobre sus promesas. Estos son extractos de la entrevista:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: Usted se refiere a la necesidad de crecer el 7 por
ciento anual con vistas a crear 1,35 millones de empleos al ano. El
presidente Zedillo prometio algo similar y fracaso. Como lo
conseguira usted?
 &HT;    FOX: Vamos a esforzarnos por traer inversion extranjera. En
Guanajuato, trajimos inversion de mas de 30 paises. Para lograr
esto hace falta un clima de confianza y de observancia de la ley.
Zedillo no tiene ese clima. Hay corrupcion e impunidad.
 &HT;    A los inversionistas hay que darles incentivos fiscales.
Libraremos a las companias que inviertan en el sureste, la region
mas subdesarrollada de Mexico, de pagar impuestos a la propiedad
por un plazo entre cinco y 10 anos.
 &HT;    Tambien necesitamos estimular nuestros ahorros. Vamos a lograr
un superavit del presupuesto en mi cuarto ano como presidente, cosa
que nunca ha sucedido en este pais. De modo que el gobierno
ahorrara. Hoy, solo el 25 por ciento de la poblacion trabajadora
tiene un plan de ahorros o de retiro. Vamos a extender esos planes
al resto de la poblacion.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cuales son sus propuestas con respecto a la rehabilitacion de la
agricultura?
 &HT;    Primero, descentralizacion de todos los organismos
gubernamentales que tengan que ver con la agricultura. Queremos que
los estados tengan la responsabilidad y el presupuesto para
resolver los problemas agricolas.
 &HT;    Segundo, un esfuerzo intenso para modernizar y llevar la
tecnologia a la agricultura. Tenemos que respaldar y subsidiar la
agricultura pagando a los agricultores cuando el precio de sus
productos baje a un nivel que no sea rentable.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Que reformas hara al gobierno local?
 &HT;    Haria dos. La primera, que se pueda reelegir a los alcaldes a un
segundo termino de tres anos. Y la segunda, que exista la
posibilidad de colocar a administradores municipales profesionales.
Esto ayudara a crear un servicio civil, de modo que el que se
dedique a la recogida de basura llegue a ser un experto en recogida
de basura. Entretanto, el alcalde se dedicara a la politica
municipal, a las relaciones publicas y a captar inversiones.
 &HT;    Tambien necesitamos descentralizar el presupuesto. Hoy, el 20
por ciento de los impuestos se devuelve a los estados y los
municipios. Vamos a elevar esa cifra al 45 por ciento para
desarrollar la infraestructura local, el desarrollo de zonas
rurales y los vecindarios de clase trabajadora.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Usted esta a favor de duplicar el gasto en la educacion y de
aumentar los fondos para los estados y las municipalidades. De
donde sacara el dinero?
 &HT;    A traves de la reforma fiscal, que generara un ingreso adicional
sin incrementar los impuestos.
 &HT;    Vamos a hacer crecer la economia. Ese crecimiento aportara mas
ingresos. Ahorraremos gastos con un gobierno que cueste menos y
produzca mas. En Guanajuato logramos reducir el costo del gobierno
en el 30 por ciento. Haremos lo mismo a nivel federal. Nos
libraremos del exceso de burocracia. Vamos a eliminar impuestos,
como el impuesto a los autos nuevos.
 &HT;    Cumpliremos con los requisitos economicos fundamentales para
traer inversiones a Mexico. Vamos a evitar los deficit fiscales.
Vamos a garantizar que el banco central sea completamente
independiente y responsable de las politicas monetarias y de tipo
de cambio y que este obligado por ley a reducir la inflacion al 2 o
al 3 por ciento.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    El PRI dice que garantiza la estabilidad en Mexico. Por que un
cambio seria mejor para el pais?
 &HT;    El PRI afirma que crea estabilidad, pero lo que ha creado en
Mexico es pobreza. Cuarenta millones de pobres. Tenemos guerrillas
en Chiapas. El pais crece durante uno o dos anos, y luego da marcha
atras otros dos anos. Tenemos crimenes politicos, como el de Luis
Donaldo Colosio (el candidato presidencial del PRI asesinado en
1994). Tenemos problemas como el de la huelga estudiantil de la
UNAM. Todos son producto de la incapacidad politica de solucionar
los problemas.
 &HT;    A los gobiernos de (Carlos) Salinas y Zedillo siempre los han
elogiado desde el exterior por sus resultados macroeconomicos. Eso
es completamente injusto. Enganaron a todo el mundo en el
extranjero. Hemos estado perdiendo poder adquisitivo durante 18
anos seguidos. Tenemos el mismo ingreso per capita que hace 30 anos
_ US$4.000 _ y eso es una de las peores distribuciones de ingresos
del mundo.
 &HT;    La corrupcion y el narcotrafico se extienden por todo el pais.
(El PRI) genero ese problema. No es la solucion.

LITTLE PLANS SPINOFF OF TECH UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur D. Little Inc., the 114-year-old management consulting
pioneer, stepped squarely into the Internet age Wednesday as it
announced plans to spin off its technology-based divisions into a
publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Named C-Quential Inc., the new firm consists of Arthur D.
Little's telecommunications, information technology, media and
electronics units, which the parent company refers to as its TIME
group.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Little
said it hopes to raise up to $150 million in an initial public
offering. Part of the proceeds would be used to retire $70 million
in debt, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the four existing technology consulting units
had combined net income of $10.8 million last year on $106.6
million in revenues. C-Quential's headquarters will remain in
Cambridge, Mass., but about 90 percent of its more than 250
employees work in offices in 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
   With its move, Little joins scores of other companies that have
spun off technology-based units of their organizations in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   According to Securities Data Publishing Co. of New York, 39
technology-based initial public offerings have raised a total of
$11 billion for their sponsors since the beginning of 1999. Several
of those proved lucrative for investors, but others were a flop,
with shares later tumbling below initial prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Holmes, founder of IPOpros.com Inc. of Boulder, Colo., said
recent market volatility makes it difficult to predict investor
interest in C-Quential, which probably won't be able to begin
offering shares for at least 60 days while the SEC reviews its
prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   A Little spokesman said the company was advised by lawyers to
not elaborate on its filings because such comments could be seen as
improper promotion of the upcoming offering.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Fischer, 43, a Little vice president since 1995 and
formerly an executive with telecommunications companies in Europe,
was identified as C-Quential's president and chief executive.
Lorenzo C. Madrid, 49, president and chief executive of Little
since last July, is C-Quential's board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and electronics clients that C-Quential is
inheriting from its parent include KPN Telecom, Mannesmann AG,
Orange PLC, Samsung Group, and Siemns AG. Sixty percent of the TIME
group's revenues last year were from European clients.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur D. Little was founded in 1886 and, while once publicly
traded, has been privately held since 1988, following an aborted
hostile takeover bid.

   Public safety officials ordered everyone out of Los Alamos,
N.M., Wednesday as intensifying winds sent a week-old fire into the
town of 11,000. But officials at the Los Alamos National Laboratory
said they were confident that the nuclear material and chemical
explosives were protected, even if the laboratory itself started
burning.
</P>
<P>
   Police, sheriff's and fire department officials went door to
door urging people to pack up and get out as quickly as possible.
No injuries were reported, but about 200 homes were near the fire
or already burning early Wednesday evening. The fire command post
itself was forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared New Mexico a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of smoke 17,000 to 20,000 feet high was covering all of
northern New Mexico and moving into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be in Houston by tomorrow,'' said Jim Paxon, a fire
spokesman with the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire blew up, basically,'' Paxon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe and there are constant winds,'' he said, `` so
all air operations have been grounded and all hand crews have
pulled back into safe zones.'' He said crews could not fight the
blaze at the line of fire, but will continue to work on its
periphery.
</P>
<P>
   The fire is ``pretty close to the lab, and it may be on it right
now,'' Paxon said Wednesday afternoon, but the fire remained
several miles from the laboratory's main buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts up to 41 miles per hour pushed the fire to the east
and southeast, toward the town of the laboratory. Winds were
expected to die down somewhat overnight, then kick up to 50 miles
per hour Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad fire,'' said Jim Danneskiold, a Los Alamos
laboratory spokesman. ``The wind situation is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire was set a week ago by the National Park Service in the
northwest corner of nearby Bandelier National Monument to clear
brush, but flared out of control over the weekend.

<P>
   Fire is always a worry in the dry pine forests that surround the
town of Los Alamos and Los Alamos National Laboratory, whose
thousands of buildings _ most modern, but a few wooden structures
date to the Manhattan Project of the 1940s _ occupy 43 square miles
of canyons and mesas. In 1977, the La Mesa fire burned part of the
laboratory grounds, and a 1996 fire, accidentally ignited by
campers, devastated some 15,000 acres of nearby forest.
</P>
<P>
   A main area of public concern was Technical Area 55, where the
laboratory keeps most of its nuclear materials. The surrounding
area was virtually free of trees and other burnable fuel,
Danneskiold said, and was about five or six miles from the nearest
firefighting line, and even further from any blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a building built to nuclear standards, virtually
bomb proof,'' he said. ``It supposedly can survive earthquakes,
huge fires, airplane crashes and disasters in general.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there have been no intact nuclear weapons at the
laboratory for 15 years. Non-nuclear explosives are stored in
concrete bunkers buried under a couple feet of earth. ``We're
pretty confident in those bunkers,'' Danneskiold said. ``The La
Mesa fire burned over the same bunkers and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook was critical for the town itself, where
residents continued to stream out tonight. The western end of town,
evacuated initially Sunday, included 500 homes. A northern section
evacuated Wednesday moments before the blowup also contained 500
homes, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, upscale hotels where rooms often go for $300 a
night, were offering evacuees rooms for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Siegfried Hecker, a former director at the Los Alamos
Laboratory who now leads Russian cooperative studies there, was
packing his car late Wednesday to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's serious for the town,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the people, but I think we have everything
else in good shape. At this point, the lab looks in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, an
environmental group in Santa Fe, worried that toxic and radioactive
fumes could be released into the air if the fire spread to drums of
waste stored at the laboratory. ``We are concerned the lab is not
fully knowledgeable of what is in each drum,'' said Suzanne
Westerly, the group's acting executive director.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that plants around the laboratory have absorbed
radioactive contaminants over the years, which are now being
released into the air as the plants burn.
</P>
<P>
   But Danneskiold said that the laboratory continually monitored
the air around it and ``there was no evidence of airborne
contamination'' after the last major fire, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory's radioactive-contaminated waste is stored on a
barren area eight to nine miles from the from the fire, Danneskiold
said. ``There's no vegetation in the area to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Danneskiold said that while the laboratory has been closed
because of the fire since Monday, power was on at the labs, and
guards and emergency personnel remained on duty. Security in
top-secret areas was being maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that there was an old lab dump site known as
Acid Canyon near a part of town that was evacuated on Sunday, but
said he had no idea of conditions there. He said environmental
restorations had removed from the canyon old wastes dating from the
1940s and 1950s.

<P>
   Two days after the Sri Lankan government rejected a cease-fire
offer, separatist rebels went back on the offensive Wednesday in an
early morning assault, striving to take back the Jaffna peninsula
at the northern tip of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   After a week's lull in fighting, the rebels said in a statement
from their London office that their latest assault had brought them
within two miles of city of Jaffna, the cultural capital of the
Tamil-dominated north.
</P>
<P>
   The government confirmed that the rebels began a strong assault
at 3 a.m. and broke through ``a few gaps in the army defenses.''
But it spoke of ``a large number of casualties among the
attackers.'' The rebels are known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam. They have been fighting for a separate homeland for the
Hindu Tamil minority since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels controlled Jaffna from 1990 to 1995, but the
government reclaimed it in December 1995 and has held it since.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Tigers have scored a series of gains. They
have taken control of large chunks of territory in the sparsely
populated, jungle area of Wanni south of the Jaffna peninsula. And
on April 22, they overran the government's heavily fortified
military base at Elephant Pass, which connects Jaffna to the
mainland, and another base a week later.

PAIR'S DNA DYE WINS PRESIGIOUS MIT AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Toiling in MIT's labs, two students created a
dye that makes DNA visible to the naked eye. And Wednesday night
they took a step onto center stage, winning the sought-after $50K
MIT Entrepreneurship Competition.
</P>
<P>
   Held by MIT's Sloan School of Management, the contest helps
teaches students about creating a successful business. In the
process, it also has helped launchseveral hot start-ups, including
Akamai Technologies Inc. and Direct Hit Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, a finalist in 1998, saw its shares soar after its
initial public offering last fall. The Cambridge company, which
transmits Internet content and analyzes online traffic, now boasts
a market capitalization of $7.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Search software developed by Direct Hit, a cowinner two years
ago, turned out to be another company's desire. Earlier this year,
Ask Jeeves Inc. paid more than $500 million for the Wellesley firm.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winners were two Massachusetts Institute of
Technology biochemistry students, Zoran Zdraveski and Susan Bevers,
and an entrepreneur named Kiril Alexandrov. Their team, called
EyeGen, was among 206 groups competing for the award.
</P>
<P>
   EyeGen's products, EyeGenRad, is described as a safer, less
costly means of viewing DNA for scientific analysis. EyeGen
estimates its market at more than $15 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since DNA manipulation is at the core of most genomic,
medical, and biotech research _ EyeGenRad has broad application,''
the team said in a description.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up included Centrata, a developer of software allowing
computer owners to sell their unused computer resources to create a
large network. Another winner was Mazu Networks, which hopes to
provide customer management and billing for application service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   EyeGen will pocket $30,000, and the two runners-up will each
receive cash prizes of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Participants know how crucial the recognition is to their
business plans. The MIT awards have become known as one of the best
campus-generated launching pads for businesses, and venture
capitalists watch it closely. At a time when start-ups are
desperate for attention, the contest's winners can bask in the the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday evening, I call the finalists,'' said lead organizer
and business school student Heather Wilding. ``The first reaction
is silence. And then they say, `Oh my God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Leighton, cofounder of Akamai, says the critiques during the
long awards process, which takes several months, helped the company
fine-tune its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were noticing where we were deficient,'' Leighton said.
``It was a learning experience for us.''

CANCER DRUG FALLS BELOW EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Endostatin, the highly touted potential cancer treatment whose
first human trials are being avidly followed by thousands of
hopeful cancer patients, has yet to show dramatic benefits after
seven months of safety testing, according to a senior government
research official.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin, discovered by Dr. Judah Folkman and colleagues at
Children's Hospital in Boston, is one of the most talked-about
potential cancer treatments in years. It has been hailed as a
possible cure by no less a luminary than James Watson, who won a
Nobel Prize for his pioneering genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   While endostatin may yet prove effective, the official's
statement contradicts persistent Internet rumors that the drug has
made impressive gains against tumors in one or more of about 45
patients in the three Phase I trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any major clinical response to date,'' said
Dr. James Pluda, a senior investigator at the National Cancer
Institute, which is overseeing two of the three trials, one of them
in Boston at Dana-Farber Partners Cancer Care.
</P>
<P>
   Pluda's comments followed other disappointing news for the
research, as word leaked out that one patient had to be dropped
from the endostatin trial because his tumor had continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Killian, a robust and optimistic Chicagoan with advanced
colon cancer, suffered a setback this week when tests at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison showed that his liver cancer had
enlarged by 70 percent while on the drug. Under the research rules,
a cancer that has grown by 50 percent or more makes the patient no
longer eligible for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other patients have dropped out of the trials, but
researchers will not say how many.
</P>
<P>
   Killian said in a telephone interview that he felt well, and
that believes the drug was keeping the cancer at bay, but Dr. James
Thomas, the head of the Wisconsin trials, told Killian that he had
no choice but to stop the endostatin treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of tears,'' said Killian. ``I`m 42 years old,
and I have an 8-year-old daughter who's crying at school because
her dad's out of the endostatin trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that a higher dose of endostatin might save his life,
Killian, his wife, Lori, and dozens of supporters who have followed
his case on the Internet have launched a campaign to have him
reinstated at a higher dose. Killian appealed directly to Folkman,
in whose laboratory at Children's Hospital the tumor-killing
protein was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   However, Folkman could not help Killian; he instead advised him
on what other regimens he could try. Folkman has no direct control
over the trials, which are being sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute in Wisconsin and by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute in
Houston, and in Boston by EntreMed Inc., which developed the drug.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs are tested in three phases, the earliest of which is
solely to determine whether they are safe. In Phase 1, the initial
doses are very conservative and often too low to be effective; the
doses are increased in successive small groups of patients until
the side effects become intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Phase 1 trials are far from conclusive, rumors have
abounded on Internet bulletin boards, particularly among investors
in EntreMed, that endostatin was working. And even though no
results have been published yet, seemingly positive comments by
researchers in the trial have fueled the belief that the trials are
going well.
</P>
<P>
   Killian, one of the few patients to speak publicly about the
trials, was a true believer in the drug. Nearly every day, he drove
four hours to and from Madison to receive the one-hour infusion of
endostatin, which is known as an angiogenesis inhibitor. It is a
natural protein made in the body that, when tested in animals,
destroyed the blood supply of growing tumors and shrank them until
they were invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the cancer had spread from his colon to his liver
and lungs, Killian said that since he started taking endostatin in
January he has felt better than he had in two years. He continued
to golf and play with a rock band, and came to believe the drug was
working.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers for the endostatin trial are assigned at random to
the varying dose levels: Killian's supporters say that because he
was assigned to a relatively low dose, he should have a chance to
try a higher dose, on the assumption that it would be more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But Pluda of the cancer institute threw cold water on the
assumption that Killian's tumor might shrink if he got a higher
dose. He said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had evidence at this point that we were having a
significant clinical effect'' at higher doses, ``and that the
higher doses were safe to give to someone who had received a
substantial amount of drug already, I'd feel bad and we would
probably try to do something. But I don't have any such evidence as
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioethicists said that volunteers for Phase I trials must
understand that the tests are only for safety and are not supposed
to be therapeutic. But one expert, Dr. David Rothman of the
Columbia University School of Medicine, sympathized with Killian,
arguing that Phase 1 trials are increasingly seen by patients as a
long-shot chance for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman added that some ethicists have become increasingly
uncomfortable with the very low doses of drugs given volunteers in
Phase I trials. He said the patient do not always understand that
they're getting too little of the drug to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understandably,'' Rothman said, ``the patient would like to
have access to an increased dose.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the research trial say it's too early to make any
official report. Until now, they have only said informally that
endostatin appears to have little toxicity and has shown some
``biological activity.'' That suggests that the drug is working as
it is supposed to on molecules and cells in the body, but it does
not mean it is halting the cancer.

 &HT;    Marlins outlast Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami _ The Marlins came after Tom Glavine at Pro Player Stadium
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They welcomed him to South Florida and, ignoring the fact that
he is riding one of the best runs of his career, beat him 5-3 with
some help from poor Braves defense, poor Braves baserunning and
decent hitting of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who's been the best pitcher in baseball this side of
Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez this season, lost for the first
time since last September against the Giants. He gave up a
season-high five runs and a season-high nine hits to fall to 6-11
against the Marlins in his career, 2-8 at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He has not won in Miam since May 3, 1995, dating back six
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Not Glavine's new cut fastball, his 5-0 record, his sterling
1.73 ERA or his own RBI hit seemed to bother the Marlins. Certainly
the usual suspect, Marlins catcher Mike Redmond, wasn't bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond entered the game hitting .750 against Glavine (9-for-12)
in his career and went to work raising the average with a pair of
infield hits in his first two at-bats. His hit in the third inning,
which should have been ruled an error on Chipper Jones, started a
two-run rally where the Braves defense hurt Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla misplayed a Cliff Floyd liner to left which should
have ended the inning but instead was ruled a two-run double and
gave the Marlins their first lead at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine could only smile in the fourth inning when Redmond
grounded a ball off Glavine's foot for another hit. But by the
sixth inning, he wasn't laughing anymore. By then, the Braves'
offense was letting him down.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had the bases loaded with nobody out and the heart of
the order due up in Chipper Jones, Andres Galarraga and Brian
Jordan on a rally Glavine started with a walk. But Jones sent a
first-pitch fly ball to former Brave Danny Bautista in right field,
which wasn't deep enough to prompt Glavine to take off from third
base. That didn't stop Andruw Jones from taking off from second,
which sent the Braves baserunners into confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, Glavine had gotten thrown out on his way
home for a double play, and Andres Galarraga followed with an
inning-ending groundout to short.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine proceeded to surrender his second home run of the game _
to Preston Wilson, who's leading baseball in strikeouts _ in the
bottom of the sixth inning, allowing the Marlins to take a 4-2
lead. Glavine allowed two home runs in his seven innings after
allowing only one in the first 52 innings of his 2000 season.

IT'S SHOWTIME FOR PORN BROTHERS' SLEAZY TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Step right into the Showtime tent and see movie star Charlie
Sheen snort coke, grope naked women and abuse firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, these forbidden sights have been restricted to
Sheen's closest associates in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   But ``No Limits'' is the Showtime mantra, and Showtime delivers
the sordid goods in ``Rated X,'' a movie about San Francisco porn
princes Jim and Artie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen plays younger brother Artie, shot dead by Jim nine years
ago in Artie's home in Corte Madera, Calif., north of San
Francisco. The movie's extra hook is that Sheen's older brother,
Emilio Estevez, co-stars as Jim Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Estevez directed Saturday's cable movie, too, helping to ensure
that ``Rated X'' is a voyeur's delight all around. It's also
violent, depressing and ultimately pointless.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let that get in the way of a bad time.
</P>
<P>
   The boys learn from their father (Terry O'Quinn) that a gun is
useful in settling disputes and later manage to learn for
themselves that sex sells. A potent combo.
</P>
<P>
   Still another element in the Mitchell brothers' lifestyle is a
shared fondness for drugs, starting with pot and moving along to
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Party Artie, snorting yet another line of white powder:
``Just say `Yes!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a book by David McCumber, the movie presents Artie as
the creative half of the team and Jim as the saner businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Artie dreams up ``Behind the Green Door'' but is incapable of
directing the skin flick that clinches the brothers' porn
reputation. Artie foresees the home video porn revolution. Artie
concocts the idea of converting the O'Farrell Theatre into a sex
emporium with live performers.
</P>
<P>
   Artie has other artieful ideas: ``Let's make a flick about a
jail. It's just for girls. Now the lady that runs the joint is
nasty, a real maniac. She doesn't let the girls wear any clothes.
We'll set it against the Roman Empire ...''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure, but I think I might have seen the expurgated
version late one night. On Showtime, probably.
</P>
<P>
   And it's Artie who rips into the deepest, darkest paranoia as
his wives leave him and the trail of coke extends for miles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a real contest, though. Jim gives him a run for it, until
he jets to Cape Cod for a little self-detox under the care of
Artie's ex-wife Meredith (Megan Ward). Then he comes back to San
Francisco to try to clean up Artie _ a battle to the bloody finish.
</P>
<P>
   The least convincing part of the film is the bald pates of Sheen
and Estevez _ they say they shaved their heads for the roles. The
rest of it rings pretty much true, though as a director Estevez
seems unsure what he wants us to feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rated X'' is either an unamusing satire or a predictable Cain
and Abel tale with a particularly tawdry backdrop. The film seems
to waver uncomfortably and indecisively between the two before its
descent into tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen's own experience with most of the vices in the film is a
dark inducement, and there's a kind of a slugger's punch behind his
more explosive scenes. You can't help but wonder how, or if,
Estevez tried to intervene with his own brother as Jim Mitchell
does here. In any case, Sheen now purports to be straight if not
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   The movie abounds with bare flesh _ none of it belonging to
Martin Sheen's boys _ and simulated sex, along with raw language
and ultimately violence.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't exactly live down to its name. ``Rated X''
carries an ``R'' rating from the Motion Picture Association of
America, not an ``X.'' They'd yawn at the O'Farrell Theatre.

CALIFORNIA IS CRUCIAL TO GORE'S WHITE HOUSE HOPES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   (Undated) For decades Americans have headed to California to
seek their fame and fortune. So it's not surprising that the
presidential candidates have been traveling west in their quest to
win the top political prize.
</P>
<P>
   For Democratic contender Al Gore, who was scheduled to fly to
Los Angeles late Wednesday evening after attending a party
fund-raiser in Dallas, the need to do well in the Golden State is
paramount if he hopes to occupy the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say that it will be virtually impossible for Gore
to win the presidency without capturing the most populous state,
since his Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, almost
certainly will take his home state and will likely win Florida and
most other southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's planned daylong visit to the Elizabeth Learning Center, a
predominantly Hispanic school in Cudahy, Calif., is intended to
underscore his interest in education, a top voter priority, as well
as help him with one of the state's fastest growing ethnic
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Later he will tap the state's wealth at a Democratic party
fund-raiser, before flying to Oregon on Friday to hold a town hall
meeting with undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   While California has increasingly trended Democratic over the
past decade and handed President Clinton victories in his two
successful presidential bids, the vice president cannot take the
diverse state for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has so far indicated that he is not ready to concede
this fertile electoral vote ground, has visited the state
frequently to woo the high tech millionaires of Silicon Valley in
the north as well as the Hispanic community in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say they are unsure whether Bush really
intends to devote the enormous sums of money needed to win a
sprawling state where expensive television ads are often the only
way to reach large groups of voters.
</P>
<P>
   They speculate that the governor's strategy may be to spend
enough time in California to force Gore to spend more of his
limited resources in the state rather than in more competitive
battleground states such as Michigan or Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can keep Gore in California protecting his base and
not spending resources in the Midwest, that could be a strategic
move,'' said Michael Latner, a project manager at the Field Poll,
which conducts statewide surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said that Gore's frequent
trips to California were not in response to Bush's forays into the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane noted that Gore has visited the state more than 70 times
in his 7{ years as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gauge how the candidates are doing in
California since the state's most respected independent polling
organizations, such as the Field Poll, have not conducted surveys
since the March primary. However, on Wednesday the New Hampshire
based-American Research Group released a poll of likely California
voters that showed Gore leading Bush 50 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Poll's Latner said his analysis of the primary results
showed that Bush has made inroads among white women, who slightly
favored the Texas governor over Gore. But despite his persistent
effort to woo Hispanic voters, Bush still garnered only 17 percent
of that group's vote compared to 58 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush has the difficult task of overcoming the Hispanic
distrust of Republicans that stems from the anti-immigrant campaign
waged by former GOP Gov. Pete Wilson. Bush has tried to distance
himself from the former governor and stressed his amiable
relationship with Hispanics in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is doing some stuff right. But I think there is still
some skepticism that must be overcome,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe,
a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate Schools in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with six months until the November election, Jeffe
and others say that it is too early to get accurate readings of the
state's political temperature.

BUSH PROPOSES TAX BREAKS FOR LONG-TERM CARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa _ Highlighting an issue of increasing importance
to his own generation, the baby boomers, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
on Wednesday proposed new tax breaks to ease the cost of long-term
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Republican presidential nominee proposed that
private insurance premiums for long-term care be fully deductible
on federal income taxes, and he advocated personal tax exemptions
for people who care for relatives in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign estimated that the new breaks, which would be
available to people of all income levels, would cost $7.4 billion
over five years. The changes are designed, the campaign said, to
help address a growing health-care need for older Americans that
will become even more critical as large numbers of baby boomers
start retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too many seniors, illness can be the path to financial
ruin,'' Bush said during a visit to the Ridgecrest Village
retirement center in Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bush campaign, the number of Americans age 65
or older is expected to reach nearly 70 million by 2030, when the
last of the baby boomers reach retirement. Meanwhile, life
expectancy and health-care costs are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush staffers said most Americans mistakenly believe that their
long-term care needs are covered by their existing health insurance
plans or by Medicare. But most private health insurance policies
don't cover long-term care, and Medicare covers only short-term,
skilled nursing home care following hospitalization. Medicare also
limits home-care coverage to those needing rehabilitative services
or physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 percent of long-term-care costs are paid from private
insurance, according to Bush staffers. Most of the costs are borne
by Medicaid program, which finances care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he would encourage more people to purchase the
necessary insurance _ and relieve a growing burden on Medicaid _
with the new deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, the full cost of the premiums would be
deductible from taxable income, even for taxpayers who don't
itemize. Taxpayers who itemize could also claim the deduction even
if their medical expenses didn't total more than 7.5 percent of
adjusted gross income, as required under current law.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who would be ineligible for the deduction would
be those who already receive employer-subsidized long-term-care
coverage. The deduction would cost $5.1 billion over five years,
the Bush campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   At an additional estimated cost of $2.3 billion over five years,
Bush would give personal exemptions to people who care for their
elderly parents or other relatives at home. Each exemption is now
worth $2,750 against taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a growing number of Americans are caring for elderly
relatives in their homes, a practice that he wants to encourage.
</P>
<P>
   Although relatively few people have private long-term health
care coverage, the Bush campaign said those policies, even without
the governor's proposed tax deduction, already cost much less than
a nursing home stay.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Bush didn't put income limits on his proposed tax
breaks, spokeswoman Karen Hughes replied that the long-term
health-care burden ``affects a lot of higher income people as well
as lower income.``
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala responded to
the Bush proposal for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major disagreement is that it's not paid for,'' Shalala
said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, issued a ``fact sheet'' charging that Bush has
not made health care a priority during his tenure as governor of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And the Gore campaign touted the administration's own plan,
which includes a $3,000 tax credit to assist individuals with
long-term care needs or their families.

ROCKY START STUNS AVENGERS' BROCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Avengers' season is rapidly deteriorating and
no one is more surprised than coach Stan Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it. In my wildest dreams I never thought we'd
be 0-4,'' Brock said. ``I'm not happy about it, but I understand
where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The misery figures to continue tonight at 6, when the winless
Avengers face the Arizona Rattlers (3-1) at America West Arena in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in a sign of the team's spiraling fortunes, Brock will
give former Raiders and USC quarterback Todd Marinovich his first
start of the season over Scott Semptimphelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd's going to start for me. Just for a changeup,'' Brock
said. ``It's nothing Scott has or has not done. We just need a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be Marinovich's first start in professional football
since Nov. 8, 1992, when he started for the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich made his first appearance of the season last week,
completing 15 of 30 passes for 168 yards, three touchdowns and one
interception in a 65-44 loss to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've played a full game,''
Marinovich said. ``I'm looking forward to getting into a rhythm out
there. It's tough to do when you just play a quarter here and a
quarter there.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Semptimphelter has completed 67 of 126 passes for
806 yards with 13 touchdowns and four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if we were 4-0, I wouldn't be making any changes,''
Brock said. ``I've already changed the wide receivers, the
offensive line and defensive specialists. I'm trying to make
changes to make us a better football team. We're building. That's
what I'm here for.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to say the Avengers are the worst team in the
league, although they seem headed in that direction. Under the
Arena Football League's own power rankings, the Avengers are the
third-worst team, ahead of the Houston ThunderBears and the Buffalo
Destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who we play. Our opponent is the situation
we're in right now,'' Brock said. ``It's not going to happen
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   AVENGERS vs. ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff: 6 p.m., America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: The Nashville Network (delayed, 9 p.m.); KMPC-AM
(1540).
</P>
<P>
   Avengers (0-4) update: The Avengers will make a quarterback
change, inserting Todd Marinovich in place of Scott Semptimphelter,
but L.A. has a lot of other problems to correct before earning the
franchise's first victory. The Avengers have the second-worst
scoring defense in the league, allowing 58.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (3-1) update: The Rattlers are led by former Cal State
Northridge quarterback Sherdrick Bonner, who has thrown 24
touchdown passes with just four interceptions. The Rattlers have
won two Arena Football championships.

IT'S A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I don't even pretend to know what it takes
to be the best coach in the NHL. What I do know is that Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock never deserved the award more than he does this
season. And in the infinite wisdom of those who decide these
things, he's not even among the league's three finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Makes me wonder _ and not for the first time _ what it is the
NHL has against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   They wear these nice snazzy uniforms. For two years running they
owned the President's Trophy. They have a rich owner who doesn't
mind spending money and who will soon move his team into a
state-of-the-art arena. They won ``the most coveted trophy in
sports,'' the Stanley Cup (hmmm, maybe it's that dent they put in
it).
</P>
<P>
   So seriously, what does it take to get a little respect around
here, for crying out loud?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure. Go ahead and shrug this off as the ignorant whining of
a provincial sportswriter who still thinks icing is what you put on
a birthday cake. But I'm telling you, there's a conspiracy going on
here and I, for one, am sick and tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   The only place the Stars seem to be getting respect for winning
the Stanley Cup last season is in the list of finalists for most of
the league's esteemed award categories. None are included, which
can lead to only one conclusion: they have reached the enviable
level of being completely taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   There's no Mike Modano among the finalists for the Hart Trophy
as the league MVP, though he may well be on his way to the Conn
Smythe Trophy in the playoffs. No Derian Hatcher or Richard
Matvichuk on the list for the Norris Memorial Trophy, honoring the
best defenseman, though Colorado coach Bob Hartley has already
nominated Matvichuk for the Jack Ripper Award, given to the player
who ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   No Modano among the finalists for the Selke Trophy. No Ed
Belfour competing for the Vezina Trophy (what, no jailbirds
allowed?) as the league's best goalie, though you'll have to look
long and hard to find a better one in these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So if the Stars don't have any individual stars worthy of a
junior partnership in the law firm of Hart, Norris, Selke and
Vezina, that must mean the system is the answer, right? It's a
``team'' thing.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets me back to coaching.
</P>
<P>
   How in the name of Jack Adams _ the guy the award is named after
_ can Hitchcock not be among the three finalists as coach of the
year? He doesn't have a single player good enough, according to the
league, to make the list of finalists for individual awards yet _
knock, knock _ here the Stars are again, in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock didn't win the award last year, despite taking his
team to the Cup, and he won't win it this year, though he has never
coached better than he did this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spend two years playing pretty much maxed out, like
we did the last two years, and you get everything out of every
player and everything out of your group, and you're dominating at
times, then suddenly you get challenged with all the things we got
challenged with this year, it really makes you decide whether you
like just winning or whether you really enjoy coaching,'' Hitchcock
said yesterday after a light Stars practice in preparation for
Saturday night's playoff series opener with the Avalanche.
``Everybody assumes that the two are connected, but they're really
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go back and teach and you have to make
consequences a new factor; you have to develop a new level of
patience; you have to maneuver around to win games rather than
dominate; you have to be willing to get your team back on the horse
and fly again. There are a lot of things you have to do that are
pure coaching and teaching as opposed to saying, `Well, we're going
to win today; I just want to win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This, by far, was Hitchcock's most difficult season as the
Stars' coach, perhaps his most challenging season in coaching,
period. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he had no idea how rocky
it would get at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside of winning came flying out about a month into the
season,'' Hitchcock said. ``Lost friends, the route's too long, the
mountain's too high ... you name it. I found we were carrying so
much baggage with us and we had to eliminate it. We had to narrow
our focus and stop looking any more than 24 hours ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the real challenge. We had to find a way as a group,
the players and coaches and everybody, to enjoy the daily struggle
and not worry about the end of the road or how we were going to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   As often happens, challenge became a voyage of discovery. The
coach and the players learned more about themselves and what they
could not only endure, but overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself again, `Do you really like coaching?
Do you really like what you wanted to do when you first started
out?' Because, guess what, things aren't going to be easy this
year, and it's not going to be the smooth ride that you had the
last couple of years. You're not going to have all of these nice,
easy situations that have been there for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock reacted to his team's struggles by becoming a
stronger, better coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found what frustrated me early in the season invigorated me
later on,'' he said. ``I learned why I liked coaching. I learned
again that I love to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been more pure coaching. There hasn't been the garbage
that goes with proving anything. It's been pure. It's why you get
in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the greatest coaching performance seen around here since,
well, one Jimmy Johnson left town.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the NHL didn't notice.

EAGER STARS HAVE NO LOVE FOR LENGTHY LAYOFFS IN PLAYOFFS

   IRVING _ Tina Turner had a hit with ``What's Love Got To Do With
It?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, a better question is what's Turner got to do with the
Western Conference finals? The answer is everything, and there
certainly wasn't a lot of love in the Stars' locker room yesterday
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely stupid,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said of
the playoff schedule that has Game 2 between the Stars and Colorado
Avalanche scheduled for Monday in Dallas while Game 3 isn't until
Friday in Denver. ``It's a country club. You get five days between
games now so you can rest. You don't need depth anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If Carbonneau, who at 40 wants all the rest he can get, didn't
like it, you can imagine what the rest of the Stars were saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think it's stupid,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said,
repeating the phrase of the day. ``Why can't we play? Why can't we
start the series \Rtoday\S? I didn't even ask, to be honest. I just
want to know who set it up ... It doesn't make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has questions. We have answers.
</P>
<P>
   The layoff between Games 2 and 3 is because Turner has a concert
scheduled for Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. They
wouldn't be able to get the ice ready for a game on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't they start the series on Friday with Game 2 on
Sunday? The answer is television. ABC wanted to show both the
Eastern and Western Conference finals in their Sunday afternoon
slot. When the Philadelphia Flyers won on Tuesday, setting up a
matchup between them and the New Jersey Devils, the network decided
to begin with that TV-wealthy matchup for their first Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what we were delivered and that's what we'll
do,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it two ways, either the break between series
is too long or not long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars wrapped up their second-round series against San Jose
Sunday, meaning they will play two games in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite the long, grueling NHL playoffs we so often hear
about. Grueling? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Long? Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the talk about trying to make it shorter? Right.'' Hatcher
said. ``It seems like they are trying to stretch it out as long as
possible. Instead of trying to make it shorter, they are doing the
opposite.''

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rick Helling was able to do his side work
yesterday despite a swollen right hand, and he should be able to
make his scheduled start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw all my pitches,'' Helling said. ``It wasn't like
pinpoint control, but I was able to throw them all. It felt kind of
funny, because my fingers are still swollen.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling was hit on the hand by a line drive off the bat of
Seattle catcher Tom Lampkin in the second inning Monday and had to
leave the game by the sixth. Although the hand was still swollen
yesterday, the injury had improved enough to allow him to flex his
fingers and do his side work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very surprised if I couldn't go Saturday,'' Helling
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Helling needs an extra day, he could switch places in the
rotation with Esteban Loaiza. The Mariners knocked Loaiza out in
the third inning after 62 pitches Tuesday, and manager Johnny Oates
said he could come back a day early because of the low pitch count.
 &QL; 
Ready for rehab
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Frank Catalanotto, on the disabled list since
April 22 because of a pulled left groin muscle, is ready to begin a
rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to get going,'' said Catalanotto, who has played
only nine games. ``I've been pulling my hair out. I'm bored
stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto plans to work out with the RedHawks today, when the
Rangers leave for a four-game road trip to Anaheim. He said he will
be the designated hitter tomorrow and play the field Saturday and
Sunday. Barring setbacks, he would be ready to be activated when
the Rangers return home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to make sure everything's OK,'' he said. ``I don't
care if I go 0-for-12 with 12 strikeouts, just as long as my
groin's OK.''  &QL; 
Venafro improving
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed reliever Mike Venafro's shutout inning against the
Mariners on Tuesday extended his scoreless streak to four innings
over six appearances. His ERA is down to 4.22.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting there,'' Johnny Oates said. ``There's a little
more movement on the ball, a little more life to it.''
\Nsubheds:Mateo extends streak With a fourth-inning single, center
fielder Ruben Mateo extended his hitting streak to 14 games, the
longest by a Ranger this season and the third-longest streak ever
by a Rangers rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Browne (1987) and George Wright (1982) had 15-game streaks
as rookies. Browne hit .317 in his streak, and Wright hit .367.
Mateo is batting .431 in his.  &QL; 
Rangers vs. Angels
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers conclude their first round of games against AL West
opponents with a four-game series at Anaheim beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 6-6 against the Angels last season, going 3-3
at The Ballpark and Edison Field. Each team scored 74 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Angels pitcher Ken Hill went on the disabled list after
straining a muscle in the right side of his rib cage Tuesday. Mike
Fyhrie was promoted from the minors, and is scheduled to pitch
against the Rangers on Sunday. Rookie Ramon Ortiz, who had been
scheduled to pitch Saturday, was demoted to Triple-A Edmonton
yesterday and replaced by Jarrod Washburn.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez's day off lasted 71/2 innings, until he hit for
Scarborough Green with two outs in the eighth inning. He doubled,
improving to 2-for-2 with a homer and double as a pinch hitter this
season. He has a career .414 average (14-for-34) as a pinch hitter.
Rangers pinch hitters are 6-for-9 with three walks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates showed confidence in rookie third baseman Mike
Lamb, allowing the left-handed batter to hit against lefty reliever
Arthur Rhodes in the eighth inning. Lamb singled, his second hit of
the game, and improved his average to .288.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Sierra is making the most of his opportunity with Triple-A
Oklahoma, batting .382 with two home runs and 12 runs batted in. He
drove in the winning run in the ninth inning of the RedHawks' 3-2
victory against Omaha on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league catcher Cesar King, who was designated for
assignment when the Rangers added Scarborough Green to the 40-man
roster, was claimed by the Philadelphia Phillies and optioned to
their Triple-A club.

<P>
   The Texas Motorplex in Ennis and Houston Raceway Park in Baytown
both would lose one of their two NHRA events in 2001, according to
one Silly Season version of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   An industry source said the Motorplex would lose its spring race
and HRP would surrender its fall date to allow the National Hot Rod
Association to book second events at the state-of-the-art Route 66
Raceway in Joliet, Ill., and The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Elon Werner, general manager of the Motorplex, said he has
received no indication from NHRA president Tom Compton that the
fourth annual Castrol Nationals scheduled for the first time on
Memorial Day weekend (May 25-28) will be the event's last hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard that at all,'' Werner said. ``And I would be
very surprised, in that the Castrol Nationals is a growing event.
First, our ticket sales are up almost 10 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, our sponsors _ Castrol and O'Reilly Auto Parts _ the
Dallas-Fort Worth market is huge for them. NHRA is very concerned
about branding and strengthening their sponsor position, so that
would go against their philosophy. Third, this event makes NHRA a
lot of money. I'm very confident we'll continue to have two NHRA
events at the Motorplex.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton could not be reached for comment yesterday on a schedule
the NHRA reportedly plans to unveil around June 1.  &QL; 
Night race preferred
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage is lobbying for the next NASCAR race at Texas
Motor Speedway to be a nighttime event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's preferably a Winston Cup race,'' said
Gossage, TMS executive vice president and general manager. ``But if
it's a Busch race or whatever ... my preference is a night race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he pitched the idea of a stand-alone Busch night
race to Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief
operating officer, during the race weekend here in April. Helton
announced on Monday that new tracks in the Kansas City and Chicago
markets would be added to the Cup schedule in 2001, again denying
TMS of a coveted second race in NASCAR's premier series.
</P>
<P>
   That suddenly has made the idea of a second Busch race here even
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desire there is that it be a night race,'' Gossage said,
``and we talked about how much fun that would be and how big a
crowd we could draw. I think it could be something NASCAR could
point towards _ a stand-alone Busch Series event, and they draw a
monster crowd in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he prefers a late-summer or early fall date for a
second BGN race. Unless, of course, NASCAR decides to grant TMS a
second Cup race at night.  &QL; 
F1 tickets sell well
</P>
<P>
   Reserved seats in all grandstand areas for the inaugural U.S.
Grand Prix at Indianapolis Formula One race have been sold. But
general admission tickets remain available for all three days of
the event (Sept. 22-24) at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. For
ticket information, call (317) 484-6700.
</P>
<P>
   The race's start has been moved up an hour, to 1 p.m. CDT.

U.N. PEACEKEEPERS PREPARE FOR CLASHES WITH REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Complete writethru for updates, revisions; ADDS 600 words; Now
moving in 2 takes) 
By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With its political options in Sierra Leone all
but exhausted, the United Nations reluctantly ordered peacekeeping
troops there Wednesday to take up defensive positions and prepare
to fight rebels advancing toward the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what we have to do to defend ourselves and the
government,'' the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said here
Wednesday. ``We hope it won't come to a pitched battle, but we are
preparing for one.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peacekeepers, who number more than 8,000, had been
consolidated around Freetown and were digging in at the entrances
to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The lightly armed soldiers, who came to Sierra Leone to help the
United Nations carry out a peace agreement signed last July between
the government and the Revolutionary United Front, are not
configured or equipped for conventional combat. Now the
peacekeepers have been told to assume a role they did not expect to
take on, lacking tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they still know little or nothing about the
whereabouts and condition of about 500 peacekeeping troops who were
taken hostage by the rebels early last week _ the incident that
precipitated the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One detachment of 208 Zambian soldiers, who were captured
together with their armored personnel carriers, was reported to
have been taken to Koidu, a rebel stronghold in eastern Sierra
Leone. There was no word on the fate of another contingent of 200
Zambians who disappeared later. Attempts to deliver food and other
supplies to the captured peacekeepers have largely been thwarted.
The United Nations has not specified the nationalities of the other
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   President Charles Taylor of Liberia, who is close to the Sierra
Leone rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, has been asked to win the
peacekeepers' freedom, but so far has won only the release of a
Russian helicopter crew and two passengers. Sankoh himself has been
missing since protests outside his home in Freetown erupted into
gunfire on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations does not know the size or exact locations of
the rebel force, which are thought to control about half the
countryside. The rebels are armed with assault rifles and side
arms. When the peace accord was reached last year, there were some
45,000 combatants, on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that a handful of peacekeepers have been
killed and others have been wounded. The dead include Nigerian
troops caught in a cross-fire between government troops and rebels
at Rogberi last weekend, when a government helicopter accidentally
fired rockets at the Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front, Sankoh's rebel organization, has
set no conditions for freeing the captured peacekeepers. Sankoh has
denied that his forces held any peacekeepers, and his disappearance
has left the United Nations with no one to approach directly for
their release.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 armored personnel carriers that the rebels took from the
Zambians have been painted black and have been seen moving with the
rebels, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With Sierra Leone sliding back into war, Eckhard said the United
Nations would no longer report the movements of its troops or
clashes with the rebels, who are already engaged against government
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's strategy has been to shore up the
U.N. military presence in Sierra Leone sufficiently to deter the
rebels while he seeks a political solution salvaging the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.N. headquarters, where the mood was somber Wednesday,
officials met with diplomats from Jordan, India and Bangladesh to
discuss how to speed up the arrival in Sierra Leone of three
infantry battalions that these countries had pledged for next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Russia, Canada and the Netherlands have
offered to supply aircraft to ferry the new troops into Sierra
Leone. But the United States is limiting the carrying capacity of
its transport planes and proposes charging the United Nations as
much as or more than commercial air carriers would charge,
diplomats complained. The other countries are considering carrying
the troops for nothing or at cost.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of new troops would lift the U.N. mission's military
strength in Sierra Leone close to the authorized ceiling of 11,700,
from the 8,936 reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that airlifts could not begin for at least 10
days and would not be completed before the end of May. It was
unclear how much equipment the new soldiers would bring with them.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has received no response to his appeal for a well-equipped
rapid reaction force. The mission has been criticized for the ease
with which the rebels were able to overwhelm and detain U.N.
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best peacekeeper is a well-trained soldier,'' Annan said
Wednesday when asked about the quality of troops sent to Sierra
Leone. ``And we would have liked to see some of the governments
with capacity _ with good armies and well-trained soldiers _ to
participate. But they are not running forward to contribute to this
force. So we have to take the forces we get.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general seemed to allude to the United States and
European powers when he said he hoped that strong countries ``would
go to the assistance of those who are in there doing their bidding
for the Security Council and the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has ruled out putting U.S. troops on
the ground in Sierra Leone. But Wednesday, Annan expressed thanks
for a British force of more than 800 paratroopers, which has
secured the airport at Lungi, outside Freetown, freeing up U.N.
soldiers to help defend the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British presence has been helpful,'' Annan said. ``They
have done something, even though the initial objective was to
evacuate British and other nationals.''

 UNITED NATIONS: other nationals. '' 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the setbacks, the United Nations refused to say that its
faltering mission to Sierra Leone had failed. ``For as long as it's
possible, we're going to hang in there and try to revive this peace
process,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had hoped that the meeting of nine regional African
leaders Tuesday in the Nigerian capital Abuja might find a
political way out of the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the regional leaders condemned the
Revolutionary United Front for taking the peacekeepers hostage and
called for their immediate release. They also warned that the
amnesty granted the rebel leader, Sankoh, and others last July
could be revoked. The rebels became notorious during the civil war
for mutilating civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The regional leaders promised to use ``all means at their
disposal, including the military option,'' to prevent the rebels
from taking over Sierra Leone. But they stopped short of offering
immediate help, saying that their defense ministers and chiefs of
staff would meet next Wednesday to consider reviving a Nigerian-led
intervention force that defended Freetown against the rebels before
the peace treaty was signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.N. officials were dubious about bringing in new Nigerian
troops, a proposal espoused by the United States, because the
veterans who fought the rebels had been sent home and demobilized,
and their replacements would probably be new and untested recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Annan found the Abuja communique ``useful and positive,''
Eckhard said. But he and other officials would not comment on its
details.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, which authorized the peacekeeping mission
last Oct. 22, was briefed Wednesday on the situation by Hedi
Annabi, the assistant secretary general for peacekeeping
operations. But it decided to put off decisions about what to do
next until it hears from Bernard Miyet, the under secretary for
peacekeeping, who is heading back from a visit to Sierra Leone,
according to a diplomat at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Children's Fund expressed concern Wednesday that the
fighting would lead to the recruitment of child soldiers. The
rebels used about 5,000 children to fight in Sierra Leone's
nine-year civil war. ``The very high level of instability could
lead us back into the vicious cycle where children are used as
tools of war,'' Joanna Van Gerpen, the head of the agency's office
in Freetown, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The children's agency said it had to postpone the third round of
its polio immunization campaign in Sierra Leone because of the
deterioration in security.

RAY'S RADAR GUN LOCKED IN ON INDY 500
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The most unforgettable mile of Greg Ray's
1999 championship season was not completed during the Indianapolis
500.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it recorded at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, where
Ray clinched the Indy Racing League driver's title in the
season-ending Mall.com 500 on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, after a long day made even longer by a rain
delay and a full race and a championship celebration with his
hometown fans, Ray climbed into his Corvette and began the drive
home to Plano. Working his way through traffic in Trophy Club, Ray
was pulled over by a policeman on a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer asked me if I was in a hurry,'' Ray recounted
yesterday afternoon in The Speedway Club at TMS. ``I said no, but I
had had a long day at the Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Oh, what do you do out there?' I said, `I race
Indy-cars,' and he acted like he didn't understand. I had a big
stack of autograph cards with my race car on it next to me, and I
showed it to him. And he kinda looked at it and goes, `I'm a NASCAR
fan.' And he gave me a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that was funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It got even funnier for Ray later during his now annual Indy 500
sendoff luncheon yesterday. Ray was working his way through another
memoir when Trophy Club-Westlake motorcycle patrolman Larry Fischer
fired up his Harley-Davidson Road King ``cop bike'' at the back of
the elaborate ballroom and drove up to the dais being shared by Ray
and Eddie Gossage, TMS executive vice president and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolman Fischer _ who made it clear to the audience that he
was not the officer who had ticketed Ray last fall _ nevertheless
reminded Ray to obey the speed limits around here. But in case he
ever got into a jam again, Fischer presented Ray with a genuine
plastic Junior Patrolman Badge _ guaranteed to give the next
officer who pulls him over a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   And another ticket for Ray.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a lot of fun living down the incident, which Ray said
received play as a ``brite'' in newspapers around the country and,
of course, was aired with fanfare on ``RPM 2Night''.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can see, it was a pretty good piece of media,''
Ray said. ``And it was one of my competitors, Sam Schmidt, who
said: `I'm sure Greg didn't get a speeding ticket. He's just really
good at working PR.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 33, is even better at standing on the accelerator of his
race car, which is the game plan when practice for the 84th Indy
500 begins on Saturday. Pole qualifications are scheduled May 20
for a race that will be run on May 28. Each of those days has been
circled on the Team Menard-Conseco calendar in Gasoline Alley.
Ray's best result in the season's first three races has been his
ninth-place run at Las Vegas Motor Speedway last month.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time winner in 1999, Ray started out 1999 in a similar
funk before showing up at the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway
with the Dallara-Aurora to beat. Ray was, in fact, leading the race
past halfway when his in-car radio failed, and he collided with the
car driven by Mark Dismore on pit road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that has never been funny, although Ray has learned to deal
with the disappointment during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't haunt me,'' Ray said, ``but it's very bizarre to
watch a video clip of the Indy 500 and see Kenny Brack win. We were
the team. We had the car, all month long and during the race, to
win that race. And that's really our mental state now. I mean, we
expect to go there and _ not to be taken the wrong way _ but we'll
be disappointed if we're not on pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll disappointed if we don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Ray plans to leave for Indy tonight in his
Corvette. The trip is approximately 850 miles and will require two
pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you how long it's going to take me,''
Ray said, after Patrolman Fischer and his Harley had split. ``But
it'll take me a little less than the average driver.''

GOLFER HOPING FOR COTTONWOOD BINGE

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Based on feedback from players, the jury is out
on whether scores will soar at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic because
of off-season course changes on the TPC at Las Colinas layout.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials, including the event's namesake, have
predicted a bump of anywhere from 0.30 to a full stroke per day in
the TPC scoring average by the time the final putt falls in the
final round Sunday. If so, several golfers agree they'll need to
make more than their usual allotment of birdies during their lone
trip around Cottonwood Valley Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the easier of the two courses used during Nelson
week, the Cottonwood course will be played by half the golfers in
the 156-player field today in the opening round. The ones who
emerge on Sunday's leader board, said defending champ Loren
Roberts, will be the ones who make the most of their opportunity at
Cottonwood, which statistically plays a stroke easier than TPC.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the TPC course, where touring pros will be greeted by
longer tees, more bunkers, 781 new trees and enlarged greens, there
were no course tweaks at Cottonwood during the off-season. If
scores rise as expected on the TPC course, Roberts said that places
a greater premium on shattering par at Cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does,'' Roberts said. ``You need to put up a good
score over there if you're going to challenge, especially if it's
windy. That's a golf course that's very playable in the wind.
Effectively, the par over there is 3- or 4-under.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, the 1991 Nelson champ, goes even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel if you don't shoot 5- or 6-under at
Cottonwood, you're giving up strokes to the field,'' said Price,
who blitzed the course with an opening 63 last year en route to a
12th-place finish. ``You can't win the tournament there. But you
can sure lose it, if you don't shoot a really good round. You can't
shoot a 70 and expect to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years the Nelson has used its two-course system, no
winner has shot worse than 68 _ 2-under par _ in his lone round at
Cottonwood. Three of the five champions (Tiger Woods, Phil
Mickelson, Ernie Els) posted their lowest scores of the tournament
at Cottonwood. When Els won in 1995, his cumulative score on the
TPC course was only third-best among Nelson competitors. But he won
by three strokes on the strength of a course-record 61 fired at
Cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and John Cook, the past two Nelson winners, actually
fared better during rounds at TPC. But Roberts said the key to
contending, especially in windy conditions, remains making the most
of the time spent at Cottonwood. Harrison Frazar, a Dallas native,
concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you happen to catch TPC on a windy day, and Cottonwood on a
calm day, you've got a huge advantage over the person who has it
reversed,'' Frazar said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less convinced. Mickelson, the 1996 Nelson champ,
said the bulk of a player's work during Nelson week still must be
done at TPC.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where you get 75 percent of your score,'' Mickelson
said. ``It's important to have a good round at Cottonwood, but I
don't think it's imperative that you go extremely low. I do agree
you can shoot yourself out of this tournament with a bad round at
Cottonwood. Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the course changes, players remain curious about what
awaits them at TPC. Most point to longer tee boxes at No. 6 and No.
15, as well as a reconfigured 10th hole _ which features a larger
green and new greenside bunkers _ as the places where scores will
climb, as tournament officials envision.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said yesterday that he expects scoring to be affected by
roughly three-fourths of a stroke per day on the TPC layout. Frazar
pointed to the additional length at No. 15, which creates a
475-yard par-4 that usually plays into the wind, as ``a big
change'' in the estimation of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the 1997 champ, identified No. 10 as the revamped hole
that caught his eye. The tee box has been shifted 50 yards to the
left, forcing players to drive over a canal. In addition, four new
fairway bunkers have been added. Woods said a playing partner found
one during yesterday's pro-am round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a guy almost bury a ball in the bunker with a driver.
That's not easy to do,'' Woods said. ``Obviously, they didn't pack
it down. You hit the ball in one of those bunkers, it's a true
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But not as damaging, in the overall scheme of Nelson week, as a
poor round at Cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out there and shoot a 70 at Cottonwood, you're
putting yourself behind the 8-ball pretty good,'' Woods said. ``If
you don't play well there, you're going to get left behind.''

OLIVER IMPROVING, BUT WINLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATHAN SANDERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Good outing, bad outing ... for Darren
Oliver, it doesn't seem to make a difference. The outcome usually
winds up the same:
</P>
<P>
   No decision.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver made his seventh start of the season for the Rangers
yesterday afternoon, pitching seven strong innings before leaving
with a 5-3 lead. His reward was his fifth no-decision of the year
as reliever Tim Crabtree failed to hold the lead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui's two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth turned
a 6-5 deficit into a 7-6 victory against Seattle, but it came too
late to give Oliver his first victory. The left-hander is 0-2 with
a 5.19 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you go out there and pitch well you would like
to get something to show for it,'' Oliver said. ``But we won as a
team, so that's the bottom line. It would be different if we lost
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has made progress in spite of his winless record. Since
opening the season with a 7.45 ERA in his first two games, Oliver
has recorded a 4.54 ERA in his past five outings. The pendulum has
swung both ways in that span, but it never stops in his victory
column.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17 against the New York Yankees, he took a no-hitter
into the seventh inning ... and had a no-decision in a 5-4 loss. On
Friday, he allowed five runs against Oakland and lasted only five
innings ... and had a no-decision in a 17-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Oliver allowed three earned runs _ two of which came
on solo home runs by Edgar Martinez and Alex Rodriguez _ and showed
good command of his changeup, slider and fastball. But it wasn't
enough to bring him his first victory since he beat San Diego while
with the St. Louis Cardinals on Sept. 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think about it,'' Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman
said. ``You get frustrated, I know, and he's pitching pretty darn
good; but you can't carry that frustration with you the next time.
Frustration only leads to trying to overdo things, and overdoing
things only leads to less consistency. ... It's a battle within
more than anything else; it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver is still fighting that battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really out of my control,'' Oliver said. ``All I can do
is go out there and keep pitching and keep grinding and hopefully
when the wins come, they will come in bunches.''

JUSTICE DEPT. REPLACES TOP PROSECUTOR IN NUCLEAR SECRETS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a sign of possible turmoil in a highly
sensitive criminal case, the Justice Department has decided to
replace at a critical moment the top prosecutor in its case against
a scientist charged with mishandling nuclear weapon secrets at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Chavez, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Albuquerque, N.M., where the case is being handled, said the
Justice Department had decided to send a prosecutor from Washington
to take control of the case from Bob Gorence, an assistant U.S.
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said Gorence, an experienced prosecutor who has pursued
the case aggressively from its start last year, would remain ``a
key member of the team'' handling the case against Wen Ho Lee, who
was charged with illegally downloading top secret data on nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the computer tapes on which Lee downloaded the data
have disappeared, and the government has charged that he intended
to provide the information to a foreign government, China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has vigorously denied the charges and has said he believes
he was unfairly singled out for prosecution because he is
Chinese-American. Asian-Americans have come together to offer
support, and have contended that he is a victim of racial
discrimination. Although Lee has not been charged with espionage,
he is being held under extraordinarily tight security and was twice
denied bail.
</P>
<P>
   The change in prosecutors is surprising, in part, because it
comes at a particularly sensitive time, when the defense and the
government are expected to battle over how much nuclear weapon
information can be submitted in the trial. The timing of the change
heartened the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news for Dr. Lee, as Mr. Gorence was an
experienced prosecutor,'' said Mark Holscher, one of Lee's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gorence would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is not scheduled until November, but the defense has
already filed motions to introduce at trial all of the information
Lee is said to have downloaded, and the request is expected to be
argued in court in the next couple of months. The judge's decision
could be pivotal to the outcome of the trial, and the government's
argument now might be handled by someone relatively new to a case
that involves abstruse issues of nuclear technology as well as
national security.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules that the information should be admitted, the
government must decide whether to comply. The government has
already argued that the information contains ``the crown jewels''
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and that releasing it would compromise
the country's national security. But if it refuses to release the
information, it will probably have to drop the charges against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rejects Lee's request, it could weaken his defense,
which his lawyers have said rests on his claims that most of the
data was already in the public realm, that by itself it was not
enough to design a bomb and that it was not that useful without a
variety of manuals and other tools not generally available.
</P>
<P>
   Gorence has worked in the U.S. attorney's office for 14 years.
Six years ago he handed in his resignation with plans to start a
criminal defense practice. But he withdrew the letter after John
Kelly, who was then the U.S. attorney, made him his first
assistant, the person who effectively runs the office.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly left to run for Congress several months ago and Gorence
was named the acting U.S. attorney. But he was ultimately passed
over and the Justice Department nominated another attorney in the
office, Norman Bay, for the top job. Bay then replaced Gorence as
first assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether any of these factors came to play in the
decision to replace Gorence as the lead prosecutor, or even whether
Gorence will remain with the U.S. attorney's office. But the
defense lawyers made it clear that they would not tolerate any
delays in the proceedings, and that they would fight for the
ability to use at his trial all the data Lee is accused of
illegally downloading.

ARMY INQUIRY SUBSTANTIATES GENERAL'S HARASSMENT CLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is an added starter on Page 1)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army's inspector general has concluded
that the service's highest-ranking female officer was a victim of
inappropriate sexual advances from another Army general, Defense
Department officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry substantiated the claim of Lt. Gen. Claudia J.
Kennedy, whose career is often cited as an example of the
opportunities for women in uniform, that Gen. Larry G. Smith
touched her inappropriately and tried to kiss her in her office at
the Pentagon in 1996, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The case, the first instance of a sexual harassment case lodged
against one Army general by another, is a serious embarrassment for
the Army, which like the other armed services has been roiled by
sexual scandals. Kennedy's allegation proved explosive among senior
Army officers and resulted in a charge against her _ later
dismissed _ of personal misconduct. The conclusions in the
inspector general's report were first reported in The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy filed a formal complaint last August after the Army
announced that Smith had been appointed deputy inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy, the Army's first woman to earn three stars,
did not formally report the 1996 incident for nearly three years,
investigators validated her claim through interviews with friends
and peers with whom she spoke after the event.
</P>
<P>
   An Army spokesman had no immediate comment on the results of the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cautioned that the disciplinary process against Smith
is far from over. The Army inspector general is preparing to send
his findings to the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John Keane,
who must then issue his own finding. Smith then has a right to
rebuttal before the vice chief makes his conclusive finding.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who never took over the post as deputy inspector general,
is expected to be forced to retire soon. He is not expected to face
a court-martial because Army officials do not consider that the
incident merits prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Smith could not be reached for comment late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael W.
Ackerman, has led the inquiry, the clash between two generals was
deemed sufficiently high-profile to invite oversight by the
Pentagon's inspector general, who may ultimately be called upon to
determine any actions taken against Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 52, is one of only three women in the military who are
three-star officers, out of a total of 116 officers who hold the
rank in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who recently announced that she would retire later this
year, had been deputy chief of staff for intelligence before her
promotion to lieutenant general in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She has refused to discuss publicly her allegations of sexual
harassment. In interviews after her promotion to lieutenant
general, however, she said she had experienced sexual harassment in
her career. In an interview with ABC News in 1997, she said she had
dealt with the incident ``individually.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing about it is that early in my
career, what I did was I dealt with it individually,'' she said.
``My approach was to turn it over to my boss. And I was very
impressed with the way it was handled.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Pentagon officers have sought to portray the
overwhelmingly male-dominated military as more open than ever to
women, even at the highest ranks, while insisting that sexual
harassment would never be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's case obviously undercut that impression, as did
investigations of two other male generals who were demoted for
having had adulterous affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. John J. Maher 3rd was demoted two ranks and forced to
retire last November after having affairs with the wives of two
subordinate officers. Maj. Gen. David Hale was demoted one rank and
fined after pleading guilty to eight counts of misconduct stemming
from affairs he had with the wives of four subordinate officers.

TURKEY'S VILLAGE GUARDS WORRY ABOUT THEIR FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADEN, Turkey _ Sipping tea in the sun and looking down from
their clay bunker at a placid field full of wildflowers, Irfan Ozay
and his cousin Remzi should be happy. With their help and that of
95,000 other village guards, the Turkish army has finally won its
war against Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But like many other village guards, the Ozay cousins are worried
and becoming angry. They fear they will soon be demobilized and
find themselves without jobs or prospects. What to do with these
village guards is one of the most urgent questions that suddenly
confront Turkey now that peace has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured last
year and remains in a Turkish prison under sentence of death. At
his trial he said he now favors peaceful change, and asked his
guerrillas to stop fighting. Nearly all have done so.
</P>
<P>
   With no war, there is no need for village guards. Yet these
guards, who served as the first line of defense against the
guerrillas, have spent years carrying rifles. Many have become
accustomed to rough lives. Some have even been convicted of using
their quasi-military authority to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The village guards around here will be peaceful, but I can
think of other places where they might start trouble or form
gangs,'' Irfan Ozay mused from his hilltop perch near Maden, which
overlooks a strategic highway 765 miles east of Istanbul. ``The
state needs to come up with a solution for us. Otherwise a lot of
people will be upset, and that's dangerous for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked in hard conditions for years,'' Ozay said. ``Now it
turns out we don't have any insurance or pension or any other kind
of rights. That's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ozay is a veteran of eight years as a village guard, he
is just 26 years old and still has a few sheep from which he might
build up a herd. His cousin, though, is 40 and has nowhere to
start. ``I realize they don't need us any more, but I don't have
any business or land to go back to,'' Remzi Ozay said. ``What do
they expect me to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The village guard system was conceived more than a decade ago as
the Kurdish rebellion was intensifying. Many of its members
rendered invaluable service because they knew this region and its
people far more intimately than the army.
</P>
<P>
   This system also became a source of bitterness. Some village
guards drifted into corruption, others abused civilians. In some
villages the army forced men to become guards, imprisoning those
who refused.
</P>
<P>
   But no one doubts that village guards played a significant role
in the army's 15-year campaign to assert control of Turkey's rugged
eastern mountains. Now they want their government to show its
gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Families in this part of Turkey are large, and by one estimate a
total of one million people here rely on salaries paid to the
95,000 village guards. The base salary is the equivalent of just
$115 per month, but in a region where war has brought almost all
productive activity to a halt, that is a valuable sum.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials and foreign diplomats have begun to worry that
if these salaries are suddenly cut off and nothing replaces them,
some unhappy veterans might grab their weapons and take to the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   One senior member of Parliament, Salih Yildirim, has proposed
that village guards over the age of 55 be allowed to retire with
benefits. Younger ones, he said, should either be offered jobs as
security guards or helped to find work as farmers or herders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem involves a great number of people,'' Yildirim
said. ``We must integrate these people into the region's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately no real economy exists in eastern Turkey.
Before the war most people here used to herd livestock on remote
mountains, but for years the army has forbidden them to enter the
highlands. Many live as impoverished refugees in swollen cities.
</P>
<P>
   All of this strikes hard at men like the two cousins who have
spent years standing watch outside their lonesome bunker here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hired to help the state destroy an enemy and win a
war,'' Remzi Ozay reasoned. ``We succeeded. So why are we being
thrown away like this?''
</P>
<P>
   His younger cousin, however, believes things will work out in
the end. ``They'll find a solution for us,'' he said. ``If no one
else does, the army will. They have to. They know the danger if
they just cut us off.''

SEX, LUST, DRUGS: YOUNG WOMAN'S NOVEL IS TOO MUCH FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 3rd graf to clarify that bureau is local not national; 5th
graf to change `on the Internet' to `to read on the Internet', as
opposed to buying-selling on Internet; 11th graf to describe sexual
taboos in more detail) 
 By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Zhou Weihui, dressed in a traditional black
silk Chinese dress slit to mid-thigh, had gathered her friends and
acquaintances on a veranda overlooking this city's famous 1930s-era
waterfront, ostensibly to say goodbye to society for a while. She
wanted to drop out of sight, she said, because she was under too
much pressure from China's propaganda machine, which was busy
trashing her best-selling novel, ``Shanghai Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Zhou's publisher had destroyed the page proofs and all
of the books in stock, arguing _ after having sold at least 80,000
copies _ that the novel was in poor taste and that Zhou, 27, was
too outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Beijing's city Press and Publication Bureau raided a
book fair in the capital and confiscated dozens of copies. And tens
of thousands more copies are being destroyed around the country
while the state media denounce Zhou as ``decadent, debauched and a
slave of foreign culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Baby'' tells the story of Coco, a 25-year-old
waitress who falls in love with a tall and handsome but impotent
and drug-addicted man named Tian Tian. She moves in with him, and
later begins an affair with a married German. ``One is for love,
the other is for lust,'' Zhou explained on the Shanghai veranda, a
cigarette fixed between her silver-nailed fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of young
Chinese have bought the book, making Weihui, as she prefers to be
called, a national phenomenon. She is the country's most popular
writer since Wang Shuo, whose late-1980s writings about Beijing's
disaffected youth became so popular that the books are now
available to read on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Few other contemporary Chinese writers come close. ``Shanghai
Baby'' has gone through six printings since it was first published
last September, and several pirated editions are circulating around
China. A newspaper in Guangzhou even serialized the book, but
published only half before it was forced to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right to hold some book signings and other
promotional activities, but things should be done to a moderate and
proper degree,'' said An Boshun, Zhou's editor at Chunfeng
Literature and Art Publishing House, in a state-run newspaper last
week. In other words, Weihui has become too popular _ a strange
thing for a publisher to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   An, who has published a series of novels by the country's ``new,
new generation'' of writers, was slightly more forthcoming in a
phone call. ``It's an ideological matter,'' he said, declining to
discuss the matter further.

   Weihui's writing, and that of a handful of similar women of her
generation, has set off a debate about what is literature in a
country with a literary tradition stretching back thousands of
years and where belles-lettres have often been considered
politically suspect. Destroying books that challenge the state's
worldview occurred as early as 213 B.C., when Emperor Qin Shi
Huangdi burned all the books in the realm in an attempt to unify
people's thought. China's current government has periodically
resorted to similar, if less thorough, acts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a People's Daily editorial reminded readers that
literature ``is a temple of holiness,'' and said that ``these
pretty women writers, who have split from the solid foundation of
Chinese creative writing and the rich historic and cultural
background of Chinese literature, who know a smattering of
Marguerite Duras and Henry Miller and dare jump onto the stage to
do a striptease, will eventually feel ashamed of themselves.''

   The book touches on many social issues long taboo in Chinese
litera- ture, from female masturbation to homosexuality. It
includes graphic, if sensitive, descriptions of sex.

<P>
   ``I strip to my bra and panties in the humid, night breeze from
the Huangpu River. I hope this scene will stimulate Tian Tian. I
continue, like a stripper. `Have a try. Come to me, like a real
lover, honey. Give it a try'.''

   The book is one of the first in China to portray Weihui's
generation of urban women, born in the 1970s, as they search for
moral grounding in a country of shifting values. In many ways, her
age group's dislocation from China's traditional culture is
reminiscent of the generation gap that characterized the West in
the 1960s _ an era that Weihui evokes with references in her book
to Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and others.
</P>
<P>
   Weihui sees herself as a feminist helping her generation of
women understand themselves. ``This is the first book to tell young
modern girls how to face sex,'' Weihui says. ``I just write the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth has always been difficult for China's cultural
mandarins to handle. Nearly two decades ago, China banned the
writings of another woman, Dai Houying, whose novel ``People, Oh
People!'' was among the first books to explore people's emotions
during the Cultural Revolution. Dai's writings, which are now back
in print, were deemed too frank at the time.

<P>

<P>
   If indeed Weihui was going into seclusion, she was doing it with
as much fanfare as she could muster. She fox-trotted on the veranda
with a spiky-haired woman in a sleeveless blue top as a film crew
and several photographers gyrated around her, recording the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The party felt staged _ the guests were an odd mix of ages and
backgrounds, including the young man who applied her makeup. A tray
of sliced French bread was drying out on a table next to a platter
of coarse cakes covered with whipped nondairy cream. Waitresses in
red skirts, white shirts and limp bow ties served tepid beer, Coke
and red wine. The Lennon Sisters warbled from floor speakers, ``One
day a little girl, the next day a lady,'' in an off-target attempt
to create an atmosphere befitting Weihui's dress and the prewar
bank buildings behind her.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the film crew was working on a documentary that,
combined with a dramatization of Weihui's works, will be sold on
video disk together with her next book, ``Evil Pearl,'' a tragic
story about a woman of Shanghai's demimonde. ``It's about how
desire leads to destruction,'' Weihui said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weihui is the daughter of an army officer and spent three years
of her childhood living in an army-occupied temple from which the
monks had been expelled during the chaotic Cultural Revolution. She
studied literature at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University and
has written four previous books: ``The Shriek of the Butterfly,''
``Virgin in the Water,'' ``Crazy Like Weihui'' and ``Desire
Pistol.'' She hopes to publish ``Shanghai Baby'' in Taiwan, Japan
and France.
</P>
<P>
   Off-camera, she exudes an impersonal affability. ``I think I'm
an elegant person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, she headed home to her mother,
clutching a red silk handbag and a small black cell phone that rang
steadily at 15-minute intervals. Despite her bold stance, the
mounting criticism was taking its toll, touching, perhaps, the
filial emotions of a more tradition-bound woman deep inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't know who is right,'' she said. ``Maybe I am
wrong.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A group led by a former Coca-Cola benefits manager
said Wednesday that it would press on with a boycott against the
company despite a lack of support from major civil rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The former benefits manager, Larry Jones, said that his group,
the Committee for Corporate Justice, which includes some former and
current Coca-Cola employees, will ask Atlanta businesses and
churches to remove Coke vending machines and will distribute
literature at local transit stations. The boycott will then extend
to other major markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is demanding that the company change what the group
contends is discriminatory treatment of black employees.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is not among the plaintiffs in the suit, announced
the boycott at the company's annual meeting in Wilmington, Del., on
April 19; Coca-Cola says the action has not had a discernible
impact.

DREYFUS TO PAY $2.9 MILLION AFTER INVESTIGATION OF FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dreyfus Corp. agreed Wednesday to pay $2.95 million to
settle charges that it failed to inform investors adequately about
the risks of one of its mutual funds and that the fund's early
performance had been manipulated by loading it with initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fund's former manager, Michael Schonberg,
agreed to a nine-month suspension from the investment management
business and will pay a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dreyfus, a unit of the Mellon Financial Corp., nor
Schonberg acknowledged any wrongdoing under the terms of the
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New
York attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC order and a finding from the attorney general's office
said Dreyfus had not adequately informed investors of the risks
associated with its Dreyfus Aggressive Growth Fund, particularly
regarding investments in initial public offerings and small,
iliquid companies in 1995 and 1996. The order also said Dreyfus did
not adequately ensure that personal securities transactions by
Schonberg did not pose a potential conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg's lawyer, Lee S. Richards III, said in a statement
that it was ``extremely important to note that the attorney general
did not find that Schonberg's personal trading had violated any
federal or state statute or rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlements, which came after a nearly
four-year investigation, Dreyfus will pay $1.6 million to the State
University of New York for an investor education program and
$400,000 to the attorney general's office for investigation costs.
Dreyfus also will pay a $950,000 fine to the SEC. Two proposed
class-action suits on behalf of the fund's investors are pending,
in federal court and in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with the outcome,'' Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer of New York said Wednesday. ``It is always important to
establish that any investment entity needs to explain the nature of
the risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which was introduced in 1995, accumulated $154 million
in its first eight months, and its portfolio gained 82 percent in
its first year. But after the speedy start came a humbling fall.
The fund lost 15.8 percent in 1997 and 36.7 percent in 1998,
placing it in the bottom percentile of its peer group, according to
Morningstar Inc., which tracks mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg's substantial bets on initial offerings propelled the
fund's early performance. But Dreyfus did not adequately explain in
its prospectus and advertisements that such gains can be
short-lived, according to the commission findings.
</P>
<P>
   Investments in initial offerings generally have a far greater
effect on new funds, which have a small base of assets, than on
more mature funds. The result is that lofty returns driven by gains
from initial offerings sometimes attract a tide of investor money
to a fund, which eventually becomes too large to benefit greatly
from more initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In Schonberg's case, he appeared to allocate the majority of his
initial offering stakes to the Aggressive Growth fund over three
other funds he managed, even though documents Dreyfus filed with
the SEC said the allocation would be equitable, according to the
SEC's finding. In its first year, Schonberg invested in 97 initial
offerings for the Aggressive Growth fund, at least 70 more than for
any of his other funds.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg was replaced as primary manager of the funds he still
ran in April 1998 and was placed on paid administrative leave that
July. He recently resigned, a Dreyfus official said Wednesday.

IN STAGES, THE BOSS' SECRETARY BECOMES A DOT-COM EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet revolution has allowed people with unconventional
professional backgrounds to become far more successful far more
quickly than they may have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a new way to become a budding cyberspace entrepreneur:
start out as John Sidgmore's secretary. At least it seems to be
working for Paula Jagemann, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Sidgmore, 49, is vice chairman of WorldCom and chief of its
Uunet unit. He has invested in and become chairman of Jagemann's
dot-com venture for the office supply industry, eCommerce
Industries, based in Tysons Corner, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the company, which prefers to be known as ECI2,
intends to announce that it has formed the first electronic
exchange to link office supply manufacturers, wholesalers and
retailers. It also plans to announce the acquisition of two small
private software companies for about $15 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of ECI2 has value because the company is also set to
announce a $40 million round of financing from two venture capital
firms, Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates. One reason
such prominent firms have agreed to invest in ECI2 may be that its
board includes Mory Ejabat, former chief executive of Ascend
Communications, and Dan Rosen, Microsoft's general manager for
Internet research. And perhaps the reason such prominent technology
executives have joined ECI2 's board is Sidgmore. ``Our mission in
life,'' he said, ``is to automate the 15,000 little independent
guys in the office supply business so they can win against the
goliaths like Staples.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagemann, chief executive of ECI2 , added, ``We have the first
electronic platform to really bring the independent dealers up to
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidgmore has had faith in Jagemann for a long time. In 1989, she
became his secretary when he was chief executive of Intelicom
Solutions, a software company. Sidgmore aided her move into
Intelicom's marketing department. She followed him to Uunet a few
years later, where she headed public and investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sidgmore is in a somewhat unusual position as chairman of
one of his own customers. ECI2 buys most of its data communications
services from Uunet. But so far, Sidgmore and Bernard J. Ebbers,
WorldCom's chairman, think the arrangement is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``These start-ups are really forging new ground,'' Sidgmore
said, ``and I have felt for awhile, and Bernie agrees, that getting
in the middle of this could be important to WorldCom. And it keeps
me fresh.''

RANDOM HOUSE AND AUDIBLE INC. AGREE TO SELL DIGITIZED AUDIO BOOKS
ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)  By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Random House, the nation's top trade publisher of
popular books, and Audible Inc., an Internet audio company, have
signed an agreement to begin selling digitized audio books online,
the companies plan to announce Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will create a new imprint, called Random House
Audible, that will try to convince consumers to download audio
material _ ranging from existing Random House books to historical
material such as speeches to new, specialized content like business
books _ from the Web. Listeners would then listen to the books on
their computer or a portable device like an MP3 player.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement marks the first time that a publisher will sell
new audio material through the Web, rather than offering existing
audio books in a digital form as well, said Paul Rush, the
president of both the Audio Publishers Association and Earful of
Books, a Dallas-based chain of stores that sell books on tape.
Random House Audible will be able to release audio books more
quickly _ to respond to a news event, for example _ and will likely
inspire similar moves by other publishers, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our industry, it is a major event,'' Rush said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Frost, president of Random House's audio publishing group,
said the new imprint will focus on material with a narrower
audience than the company's current list of audio titles. That list
includes books by John Grisham and Danielle Steele and J.K.
Rowling's Harry Potter series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our programming doesn't have to support two inches on a shelf
in a bookstore anymore,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   The new imprint could also serialize books more easily than the
existing audio division, which is Random House's fastest-growing
group, Frost said. For example, Random House Audible would not have
had to wait to release Grisham's recent serialized novel until all
of the chapters had been published, said Jonathan Korzen, a
spokesman for Audible. Books that sell particularly well over the
Web may later be sold as tapes and compacts discs, Korzen said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies expect to sell their first digitized audio book
this summer. The books will typically cost about 20 percent less
than audio books available on tape or CDs, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   The new kind of books will not be as easy to listen to as the
old version, however. After downloading a book from the Internet,
people will be able to listen to it on their desktop computer, on a
hand-held computer run with Microsoft software or the Diamond
Multimedia Rio MP3 player. But Audible will encrypt the audio
material so that consumers cannot listen to it on a tape player, CD
player or the most popular brand of hand-held computers, 3Com's
Palm, Korzen said.

NEW NET DEVICE EASY TO USE, BUT SELLING IT NOT AS SIMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Texas)  By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is rare in the world of high-technology gadgets to have the
luxury of introducing a product without the concern of immediate
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance Inc., the maker of the i-Opener _ a simple,
inexpensive device that provides Internet and e-mail access without
a personal computer _ finds itself in such a position, at least for
a little while. So, to take advantage of a wide open marketplace,
the company is introducing a marketing campaign before the battles
begin for dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just trying to maximize our first-mover advantage,''
said Bill Cobb, general manager for consumer sales at Netpliance,
which is based in Austin, Texas ``We're not going to worry about
the competition right now. We're just focused on getting our
message out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the message out and explaining the product are the
second phase of the company's marketing plan after introducing the
device during the Super Bowl. A $13 million campaign, consisting
primarily of print and direct mail, is the first work from BBDO New
York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, since
that agency was named to handle the account in February.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet use continues to extend beyond the desktop to
kitchen countertops, there are still plenty of people overwhelmed
by the complexity of even turning on a computer. The i-Opener
appliance and service, which is focused on computer novices 40 and
older, is as easy to use as a microwave. Users can take it out of
the box, plug it in, push a couple of buttons and surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But it is less simple to market a consumer-friendly Internet
device to those who have technology phobia. One way, Netpliance and
its agency decided, is to position it as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   One leg of the new campaign is centered on Mother's Day and
Father's Day celebrations. Emotional holidays like those are a
sensible time for marketers to start the communication to find
customers because people are already in the market to buy gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Opener now sells for $99 plus a $21.95 monthly fee to
connect to its Internet service. The device, whose price is
scheduled to rise to $199 after Father's Day, is primarily sold
through the company's call centers or on its Web site, with retail
distribution at stores like Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the i-Opener has the advantage of being the
trailblazer in the Internet appliance category in what some people
are calling the post-PC era. But a host of competitors, including
Compaq, Gateway and IBM, are preparing to offer Internet-only
terminals by summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have the marketplace to ourselves,'' said Lynne
Seid, who heads the Netpliance account at BBDO New York as
executive vice president and managing director. ``In fact, we are
trying to create our own Christmas now.''
</P>
<P>
   New technology products are traditionally pitched heavily in the
fourth quarter around Christmas, where there tends to be a plethora
of ads from marketers eager to stimulate sales. Netpliance's goals
for the second quarter are to explain the product simply, identify
the best media for the target audience and gain subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Opener first came on the ad scene in January with what was
meant to be a big splash during Super Bowl XXXIV, but the
commercial ended up getting lost in the blur of dot-com ads.
Although that commercial was amusing and the message was clear, a
month later Netpliance ended up shifting its account to BBDO New
York from McGarrah/Jessee, a small shop in Austin that created the
Super Bowl ad.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, who joined Netpliance in February, attributed that shift
to his familiarity with BBDO New York from working with that agency
in his previous posts at the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of PepsiCo and
Tricon Global Restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGarrah/Jessee is a fine branding agency, and they got us to
a certain level, but the capability of BBDO as an ad agency and the
additional agency services is so much wider,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb noted: ``Phase One of the campaign was really just trying
to get in the game. Now we are in the educational phase.''
</P>
<P>
   From a visual standpoint, the new ads are staid and lack
pizzazz, but BBDO hasn't lost its touch. It's all part of its plan
to speak to its audience in a no-nonsense manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purposely not edgy like a lot of dot-com advertising you
see,'' Seid said. ``The whole purpose was to look open, accessible
and very plain-spoken and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to be indirect or cute,'' she added with a
chuckle. ``We are trying to be engaging. Obviously, we are in the
advertising business.''
</P>
<P>
   Two ads with a Mother's Day theme feature a shot of the i-Opener
accompanied by the phrase, ``Introducing i-Opener.'' One headline
reads, ``If you want your mom to stop calling, buy her an
i-Opener.'' A second ad's headline reads, ``Remind your mom why
you're her favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other general advertisements speaking directly to potential
users will run between the two holidays. One headline reads, ``Meet
i-Opener, your soon-to-be significant other.'' Another reads, ``Who
says you can't get through to your kids.'' Each ad elaborates on
the product, provides a toll-free order number and gives the
address of the company's Web site, www.netpliance.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ads lack a tagline or some kind of catch phrase,
the unifying factor, besides the stark look in general, is that
they are ``selling an experience,'' Seid said.
</P>
<P>
   For the educational phase of the campaign, the company and
agency decided to leave television out of the mix. That is unusual
because BBDO is known for its lavish television campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot to ask a 30-second commercial to do,'' Seid said,
``in terms of educating a consumer, also having some stopping power
and also registering the basic information so they can respond to
the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Print, in general, allows companies to focus on their audiences
more precisely. Some of the publications in which i-Opener ads
began running earlier this month include Entertainment Weekly,
People, Time, TV Guide, The New York Times and The Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Future marketing plans for the i-Opener were not disclosed. ``As
we approach a more competitive environment and have lots of
competitors spending a lot of money, we will be looking at what we
will be doing next,'' Seid said.
</P>
<P>
   Being one of the first Net appliances doesn't come without
pitfalls. An engineer recently posted on a Web site instructions
for tweaking the i-Opener hardware so that it could work as a
full-fledged PC. Since then, said Munira Fareed, the marketing
director at Netpliance, the company closed the loophole that
allowed people to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the company can learn from the skills of the ``modifier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can get some great R&AMP;D from this,'' Cobb said.

NYC COLUMN: WHEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMMINGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The continuing drama of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
increasingly public private life is nothing short of astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of his charged confessional Wednesday at a news
conference in Bryant Park, where, in an emotional, halting voice,
he announced he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna
Hanover. The mayor spoke most kindly of her. And then, in the next
breath, he conceded how much he needed his recently acknowledged
``very good friend,'' Judith Nathan, in his life _ especially given
his recent diagnosis of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly shaken, the mayor said the marital estrangement was
``painful, very painful,'' and added that he and Hanover had been
leading separate lives for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   As if that wasn't enough for one day, a few hours later an
equally distraught Hanover held her own news conference to confirm
the impending marital separation and to say that her marriage had
been troubled pre-Nathan because of her husband's relationship with
a ``staff member,'' a reference to the mayor's former
communications director, Cristyne Lategano, said Hanover's
spokeswoman, Joannie Danielides. She and the mayor were long the
center of rumors about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano, now president of the city's tourism bureau, said that
she did not want to speculate about Hanover's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the last two weeks, beginning with the mayor's
announcement about his cancer, defy characterization. Clearly he,
his wife, and Nathan are under great stress.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with cancer is one thing; as noted in this space last
week, most people with treatable cancers want to continue with
their pre-diagnosis lives, and do. But dealing with affairs of the
heart _ in the public eye _ is decidedly more complicated. The
mayor said he wasn't thinking about politics. But everyone else is,
and the obvious question is whether the mayor can survive this
curious, uncomfortable exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Is even New York ready for a candidate who acknowledges
adultery, is accused by his wife of another affair, and brazenly
parades his relationship for months, taking Nathan to public event
after public event, from the St. Patrick's Day Parade to community
meetings?
</P>
<P>
   Many would like to live in a world where public figures were
judged on their public records, not their private conduct. The
public is more open-minded than ever; Bill Clinton's popularity
survived Monica Lewinsky and impeachment. But he was already well
liked. Polls show that even some of Giuliani's supporters have
reservations about his pugnacious temperament _ the tough,
self-righteous image of his own making. Paradoxically, he has never
appeared more vulnerable than he did Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He has nurtured a harsh reputation throughout his career,
insisting that the public accept his style and values and
succeeding on his own terms much more often than failing. His
unorthodox politics and his stubborn defiance have been his
political identity and strength.
</P>
<P>
   But how does the fierce, moralistic mayor jibe with the married
father of two openly defying classic public morals? The two
personas are in blatant conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe that Giuliani really thinks this will
not hurt him. .
</P>
<P>
   But it was just as hard to believe that he blamed Patrick
Dorismond _ an unarmed black man killed in an altercation with
police officers _ for his death; that he didn't care what the press
thought of him; that he let the Lategano rumors hover for years.
</P>
<P>
   Most New Yorkers were offended, but this mayor nonetheless
insisted on punishing the Brooklyn Museum of Art for exhibiting
works he found morally offensive by attempting to deny them city
money. He tried to revise the city charter just to prevent a
politician he disliked _ Mark Green, the public advocate _ from
succeeding him should he move on to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is one headstrong man whose every fiber
says, you'll do it my way. That has led to a most remarkable series
of policies and incidents, of which this is surely the most
astounding.
</P>
<P>
   And it will not go away. This is one of those political
phenomena that develop a life of their own. It will get messier. If
there are more peccadilloes to be revealed, they will be. That's
how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, perhaps impelled to go public about his life by a
reminder of his mortality, could triumph. If he does, he will have
changed the course of politics here and maybe across the land.
</P>
<P>
   If he fails, it is hard to see how he could not have committed
political suicide.

<P>
   Until now, electronic books were an idea whose time might have
never come. But thanks to Stephen King, publishing houses and
electronics manufacturers are taking a second look at a market they
have long been content to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Prompting the reassessment is the March publication of King's
66-page novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' which was initially
available only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Offered for free by both Amazon.com and, briefly,
barnesandnoble.com, and for a mere $2.50 on other sites, King's
story flew off servers as fast as Web surfers could log on to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two days the book was available, more than a
half-million copies were downloaded. (In the print world, King's
books typically sell about 75,000 hardcover copies on the first day
of sale, which is a huge amount.)
</P>
<P>
   The online furor proved that ``content is what people want and
will read,'' says Tom Morrow, a spokesman for SoftBook Press, a
unit of Gemstar International, which owns the technology behind the
SoftBook electronic books. ``The medium isn't that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. It's important that the medium be affordable
and easy to use. Today's electronic book-reader technology isn't.
But that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gemstar has a virtual monopoly on E-readers. The
SoftBank costs $600 by itself, or one can purchase it for $299,
plus a commitment to buy $20 worth of E-books a month for 24
months. The lower-end Rocket eBook retails for $199.
</P>
<P>
   An E-reader isn't needed to download ``Riding the Bullet'' _
it's readable on an ordinary personal computer _ but SoftBook sales
did increase around the time of the novella's release.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar is convinced that there's a viable market for a
popularly priced electronic reader. To bring down costs, the
company has allied itself with Thomson Multimedia, the French
electronics manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Thomson will license Gemstar's
technology and produce an electronic reader under the RCA brand.
Thomson declines to give a price range, but it plans to have an
``affordable'' product on the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   Price alone won't persuade consumers to buy an E-reader. A good
selection of choices is also important, and tradition-bound book
publishers have been slow to digitize their wares, says John
Corcoran, an analyst with CIBC Worldmarkets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But by 2004, International Data Corp. predicts there will be 4
million users of electronic books. That's incentive enough for
publishers to start digitizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most major publishers realize that electronic publishing is an
important market,'' says SoftBook's Morrow, ``and they're making
more content available.'' Much of the first wave will be
educational and business titles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the economics of E-books may be irresistible. ``If
the Web is about nothing else,'' says Corcoran, ``it's about
reducing the cost of distributing content to something close to
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Since distribution, not paper or printing, is a publisher's
biggest cost, Stephen King may soon have some company on the
electronic bookshelf. &QL;

ARTHUR WILLIAM DAKE, 90, CHESS GRANDMASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur William Dake, a chess grandmaster and one of the last of
a talented crop of American players who won major competitions
before World War II, died on April 28 in Reno. He was 90 and lived
in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Dake had a brilliant although abbreviated career as a chess
player. He learned the game at 17, very late for someone who would
later become a top player. By the time he was 28, his career was
essentially over as family responsibilities compelled him to look
for a more stable and better-paying job. In that short time,
however, Dake had established himself as one of the country's best
players, and he helped the American chess team win three world team
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Dake was born on April 8, 1910, in Portland. When he was 16, he
went to work as a merchant seaman, sailing to Japan, China and the
Philippines. He returned to Oregon in 1927 to go back to high
school. He learned to play chess from a Russian immigrant living in
a local YMCA. A year later, Dake again left home to work on a ship,
this time returning to New York City in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   The city was a hive of chess activity, and Dake quickly immersed
himself in it. He joined a leading checkers player, Kenneth Grover,
in setting up a chess and checkers stand in Coney Island, where
they took on all comers for 25 cents a game, but their customer
base dried up with the market crash.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories,''
Arnold Denker, another grandmaster and a lifelong friend, recalled
that Dake's diet soon ``narrowed down to water, coffee and green
grapes.'' But in 1931 Dake won the championship of the prestigious
Marshall Chess Club. As a result, he was asked to play on the U.S.
team in the 1931 world team championships in Prague. As the No. 3
player on the team, Dake scored five wins, two losses and seven
draws, helping to lead the United States to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Dake would also play on U.S. teams that won world championships
in Folkestone, England, in 1933 and in Warsaw in 1935. At the 1935
championships, Dake won 13 games, drew five and and lost none, the
best result among all the players in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Dake also had some notable individual successes. He finished
third in an international tournament in Pasadena in 1932, behind
Alexander Alekhine, the world champion, and Isaac Kashdan, the best
American player of the period. Dake defeated Alekhine during the
tournament, becoming the first American to beat the champion and
inflicting one of only four tournament losses that Alekhine
suffered from 1927 through 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Dake played in the U.S. championships in 1936 and 1938,
finishing tied for sixth both times, but then he quit chess to
support his family, first by selling insurance and telephone
directories and later by working in the department of motor
vehicles in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he emerged from retirement to play. In 1946 he
participated in the second U.S.-USSR match, drawing two games with
Andrei Lilienthal. And in 1953 and 1955 he played in the U.S. Open,
finishing tied for 13th and 11th, respectively. It was only after
he retired in 1973 that Dake again began to compete regularly,
although he was no longer as formidable as in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the International Chess Federation (the ruling body of
chess, known as FIDE, for Federation Internationale des Echecs)
awarded him the title of grandmaster for his performances in the
1930s and, in 1991, the U.S. Chess Federation inducted him into its
hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Dake met his wife, Helen, on an oceanliner coming home from the
U.S. team victory in Warsaw in 1935. He wrote years later, she
``simply turned around and smiled at me. That's all.'' Six weeks
later they were married .
</P>
<P>
   Dake is survived by their daughter, Marjorie Metzger; a sister,
Lillian; and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   In his day, Dake was the best American player at rapid transit
chess, in which games are typically played at the rate of five
minutes for each player for each game. In a speed chess tournament
among the best players in the country in September 1935, Dake won
with a score of 12 wins, no losses and no draws.

 By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ  
 c.2000 Worth Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Sweden is beautiful. The land is beautiful. The people are
beautiful. The economy is beautiful. And yes, the stock market is
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Sweden is winning the race among major
countries for the strongest stock market. Its Stockholm (``OMX'')
index was up some 20 percent, as of mid-March, and has soared 74
percent since last October.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kind of outsized gains investors have come to
expect from blazing tech stocks. It's no wonder: Sweden is among
the most tech-savvy countries in the world. If you visit Stockholm,
you'll hear more cell phones beeping on a street corner than most
any other place in the world. And fully one-third of Swedes are
plugged into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Sweden's infamous welfare state still stands, its
government was forced to cut spending in the mid-1990s to combat a
12 percent budget deficit and is actually now running a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's 28 percent corporate tax rate is far below the European
Union average of 40 percent. Even labor policies are less rigid
than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's difficult for firms to fire full-time workers, the
market for temporary workers is fairly fluid. No surprise, then,
that a company like Poolia, which provides temporary help, is
thriving. Its stock price has climbed 61 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when many high-tech stocks around the world
experienced a major fall as investors shifted assets back into
old-economy industries, Swedish tech companies escaped with less
damage than most.
</P>
<P>
   ProAct IT, which provides data storage, is up 123 percent this
year, and Digital Vision, which specializes in digital processing
for movies and television, has jumped 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ericsson, locked in a tough battle with telecom giants
Nokia and Motorola, has climbed 50 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish economy is galloping along at a healthy 3.5 to 4
percent clip, much like it did in 1999. Most impressive is that
economic growth hasn't kicked up inflation, which remains below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the central bank, led by trusted bureaucrat Urban
Baeckstroem, has been slowly raising interest rates, following the
successful example of U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan, just to make sure that inflation doesn't re-ignite.
</P>
<P>
   The market's faith in Baeckstroem shows up in the solid trading
of the Swedish krona, which has gained over 6 percent in the past
year against the flabby Euro currency. And Swedish ten-year-bond
rates, at 5.38 percent, were nearly a full percentage point below
U.S. rates in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   For a country of only 8.5 million people, Sweden is also an
export powerhouse, racking up a current-account surplus of $4.5
billion in 1999. By selling so much to the rest of the world,
Sweden helps keep the krona strong.
</P>
<P>
   Any worries? The government looks a little shaky. The ruling
Social Democrat Party (SDP) holds only a minority of the seats in
the Riksdag, Sweden's parliament, and it depends on the leftist
Green Party and Left Party to maintain power.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance could crumble before the next election, which
isn't scheduled until September 2002. Prime Minister Goran Persson
would like Sweden to join the European Monetary Union, but that
would have to be approved in a general referendum, which would
likely be held in 2000 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses would welcome the currency stability and reduced
transaction costs that come with EMU membership. Labor unions,
however, would like to see unemployment, currently at 5 percent,
drop a percentage point beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   As for the voters, many are undecided, but a plurality feel
that, for now, Sweden's currency and economy are doing fine without
Europe. &QL;

<P>
   Sweden is beautiful. The land is beautiful. The people are
beautiful. The economy is beautiful. And yes, the stock market is
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Sweden is winning the race among major
countries for the strongest stock market. Its Stockholm (``OMX'')
index was up some 20 percent, as of mid-March, and has soared 74
percent since last October.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kind of outsized gains investors have come to
expect from blazing tech stocks. It's no wonder: Sweden is among
the most tech-savvy countries in the world. If you visit Stockholm,
you'll hear more cell phones beeping on a street corner than most
any other place in the world. And fully one-third of Swedes are
plugged into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Sweden's infamous welfare state still stands, its
government was forced to cut spending in the mid-1990s to combat a
12 percent budget deficit and is actually now running a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's 28 percent corporate tax rate is far below the European
Union average of 40 percent. Even labor policies are less rigid
than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's difficult for firms to fire full-time workers, the
market for temporary workers is fairly fluid. No surprise, then,
that a company like Poolia, which provides temporary help, is
thriving. Its stock price has climbed 61 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when many high-tech stocks around the world
experienced a major fall as investors shifted assets back into
old-economy industries, Swedish tech companies escaped with less
damage than most.
</P>
<P>
   ProAct IT, which provides data storage, is up 123 percent this
year, and Digital Vision, which specializes in digital processing
for movies and television, has jumped 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ericsson, locked in a tough battle with telecom giants
Nokia and Motorola, has climbed 50 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish economy is galloping along at a healthy 3.5 to 4
percent clip, much like it did in 1999. Most impressive is that
economic growth hasn't kicked up inflation, which remains below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the central bank, led by trusted bureaucrat Urban
Baeckstroem, has been slowly raising interest rates, following the
successful example of U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan, just to make sure that inflation doesn't re-ignite.
</P>
<P>
   The market's faith in Baeckstroem shows up in the solid trading
of the Swedish krona, which has gained over 6 percent in the past
year against the flabby Euro currency. And Swedish ten-year-bond
rates, at 5.38 percent, were nearly a full percentage point below
U.S. rates in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   For a country of only 8.5 million people, Sweden is also an
export powerhouse, racking up a current-account surplus of $4.5
billion in 1999. By selling so much to the rest of the world,
Sweden helps keep the krona strong.
</P>
<P>
   Any worries? The government looks a little shaky. The ruling
Social Democrat Party (SDP) holds only a minority of the seats in
the Riksdag, Sweden's parliament, and it depends on the leftist
Green Party and Left Party to maintain power.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance could crumble before the next election, which
isn't scheduled until September 2002. Prime Minister Goran Persson
would like Sweden to join the European Monetary Union, but that
would have to be approved in a general referendum, which would
likely be held in 2000 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses would welcome the currency stability and reduced
transaction costs that come with EMU membership. Labor unions,
however, would like to see unemployment, currently at 5 percent,
drop a percentage point beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   As for the voters, many are undecided, but a plurality feel
that, for now, Sweden's currency and economy are doing fine without
Europe. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sleep-deprived _ that's the disclaimer Stacy Schiff,
who's won the Pulitzer for biography, throws over her interview.
She spent five years on her book about the marriage of Vera
Nabokov, but what's concerning her now is her own domestic life.
</P>
<P>
   The new baby is 2 weeks old and nursing, her 7-year-old daughter
has a strep throat, the 8-year-old son's birthday party is coming
up _ ever put together a child's birthday party? _ Schiff, a
breakneck New York speed talker, is saying. Would you like to come
over Saturday and take a shot? She doubts she'll make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hit her with that annoying question after the nanny
brings coffee into the living room with the piano and the old-money
space: heck of an apartment, off Park, in the 60s. How many rooms?
(Subtext: are you loaded? Schiff will protect herself pretty well.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough to lodge our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, c'mon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people we know think we have too few bedrooms; half
think we have too many bedrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, charming, for Schiff is very charming: ``Do we
have to go into that?''
</P>
<P>
   You know the scene in ``The Princess Bride'' where two manic
swordsmen go at each other, taking a breather once in a while to
discuss technique? This is how it is when a reporter sits down with
a biographer who is wary of giving it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too boring.'' ``Truly boring.'' Those are the words Schiff,
39, uses when you look into certain parts of her life: the medical
condition that compelled her to remain in bed for her latest
pregnancy; her finances.
</P>
<P>
   She also interviews the interviewer and compares notes: how
about the guilt-provoking pause _ that one work for you? Don't you
just hate it when you have to go back because you've missed the big
question?
</P>
<P>
   She is more forthcoming on Vera Nabokov, the wife of Vladimir
Nabokov, who during their 52-year marriage served as her husband's
agent, editor, secretary and chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Schiff, who had previously written a biography of the
French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery, not write about
the creative partner?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that she was the creative one to some extent,'' Ms.
Schiff says. ``I suppose my thesis was the minor player was going
to be very revealing of the major player. I'm trying to remember if
Mrs. Dostoyevsky said to Mrs. Tolstoy or it was the other way
around that a person's character is never so much revealed as in
his day-to-day life at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what is interesting about Schiff's life at home: the
absence of a husband. She has one, Marc de La Bruyere, a real
estate developer in Edmonton, Alberta. He spends, in what Schiff
cheerfully calls her bizarre life, about 10 days a month in New
York. In the summer and on school holidays, Schiff and the children
join him in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live here; he lives most of the time in Edmonton,'' Schiff
says. ``You might want to ask why.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever try to leave New York?'' Schiff says in an escalating
comic riff. ``I did once. I lasted about a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had these great excuses: My agent is five blocks
away. The kids go to school here. It's very cold there. It's really
dark, at the end of the world. Like the Arctic Circle.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time for the nanny to bring in the baby to nurse, and while we
courteously avert our eyes, Schiff's background:
</P>
<P>
   Despite the swank apartment, she is not a member of the powerful
and rich New York Schiff family. She comes from the small mill town
of Adams, Mass. Her mother taught at North Adams State College, and
her father owned a clothing store in the Berkshires. They were one
of three Jewish families in the county. ``Looking back, I think it
was just a little alienating,'' Schiff says. ``Why do you think I'm
always writing about refugees, people out of sync?''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff describes herself as ``an obstreperous child.'' When her
parents tried to get her into boarding schools, she intentionally
fell asleep in the car and would not leave. Later, she graduated
from Phillips Andover Academy, then Williams College. She came to
New York and worked as a book editor. The next book project will be
Ben Franklin, the Paris years.
</P>
<P>
   End of visit. A few hours later one realizes there is, in this
interview, one of those awful enormous holes: the wife Tolstoy or
Dostoyevsky has said that domestic life reveals character. What
does Schiff's unconventional domestic life reveal?
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, phone in hand, nursing the newborn, takes a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you do this one,'' she says. ``You could say I was
ultra culpable; you could say I was the poor neglected party. I
seem to be the poor neglected party. Marc is coming back _ did I
mention that?''
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, not counting the nanny, she is alone with three
young children, one of whom is a 2-week-old. ``Don't think that
didn't get into the conversation,'' Schiff says. `` `Darling,
everyone has strep, and the one that doesn't have strep is 2 weeks
old.'''
</P>
<P>
   Character, Schiff. What does this reveal?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say you have two stubborn people here. You could say
there is a certain resistance to giving up one's identity. Have you
ever been married? Had that thing of someone calling you by a name
not your own? It's unsettling. It's like a fictitious person.''

COMPROMISE WOULD REMOVE CONFEDERATE FLAG FROM S.C. STATEHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: LEADS with Representatives reaching compromise; 2nd take to
follow.) 
By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The battle flag of the Confederacy, which has
divided South Carolina from its perch atop the statehouse since
1962, will come off the dome on July 1, under a tentative
compromise reached late Wednesday night by the state House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which has already been approved with minor differences
by the Senate, calls for a smaller, square version of the flag to
be placed on a flagpole near the front of the Capitol, adjacent to
a Confederate soldiers' memorial. House leaders and senators
predicted few difficulties in ironing out the differences, and Gov.
Jim Hodges has said he will sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill will by no means end the racial acrimony that
created such pressure for a compromise in the first place. Only
three of 26 black members of the House voted for the bill, and many
denounced it furiously as a plan that would make the flag an even
more prominent feature of the state's official landscape. The
NAACP, which has been conducting a national economic boycott of the
state to get the flag removed, has said the plan is unacceptable,
and has vowed to continue the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Once the flag comes off the dome and out of the spotlight,
however, it is unclear how effective the boycott, which has hurt
the state's tourism industry, will be. The NAACP had originally
said the boycott would continue until the flag was lowered from the
dome, and its opponents are now accusing it of changing its goals
because the group was not a participant in the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the flag's longtime supporters said the move was a
historic step forward for the state, which saw its reputation
severely tarnished by the flag's presence in such a prominent
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for our state, a giant step
forward,'' said David Wilkins, the speaker of the House, who had
pushed hard for a compromise.

RAILYARD SUSPECT THOUGHT HE WAS `HALF ANGEL, HALF MAN,' EXPERT
SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An expert called by the defense testified Wednesday
that Angel Maturino Resendiz is a paranoid schizophrenic with
religious delusions who believed he was ``half angel, half man''
when evil forces sent him on his cross-country killing rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has admitted to the December 1998 slaying
and rape of Dr. Claudia Benton at her West University home near
Houston, as well as brutally killing five other people in Texas,
two in Illinois and one in Kentucky over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to capital
murder in Benton's death. Under Texas law, a jury can only find
someone legally insane if he had a severe mental disorder and could
not tell right from wrong when the crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   The state rested its case against Maturino Resendiz on Tuesday
after linking the railcar-hopping transient to the Benton case
through fingerprints, DNA and stolen items recovered from his home
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys began Wednesday by questioning Dr. Larry
Pollack, a Houston neuropsychologist they hired to examine Maturino
Resendiz in the Harris County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock's testimony and intense cross-examination by prosecutor
Lyn McClellan was followed by the testimony of four of Maturino
Resendiz's siblings about their brother's troubled childhood and
bizarre beliefs as a young man in which he likened himself to a
biblical prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock, who examined Maturino Resendiz for three days in
October, said the Mexican national was schizophrenic, but tests did
not prove he was a psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is extremely paranoid,'' Pollock said. ``He believes
things about the world that are unverifiable to anyone else ... he
has a crazy delusional perception of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia is a mental disorder causing delusions and
irrational thinking. A psychopath has no conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Tests determined Maturino Resendiz has an above-average IQ,
Pollock said, but a neurological exam found a brain impairment that
could explain why he suffered from confused, disorganized logic.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of his heinous acts, Pollock said, Maturino Resendiz
was likable, even when he went into wild, unsolicited diatribes on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't know what we know about him, you'd have thought
he was a very nice man,'' Pollock said. ``He was a very nice person
when he talked about his daughter, in a crazy way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollock also said Maturino Resendiz thought he could cause
earthquakes, floods and explosions, believed he eluded authorities
by making himself invisible and traveled in his sleep from his jail
cell to visit his wife.
</P>
<P>
   When he surrendered to Texas Rangers at the Mexican border in
July, he knew he would be executed, Pollock said. But he believed
his death would cause everyone involved, including the judge and
jurors, to die, then he would be resurrected because he was
immortal.
</P>
<P>
   When he killed, Maturino Resendiz believed he was an angel
following God's will, Pollock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something at the time he was near those homes that
triggered him,'' Pollock said. ``I don't know what those things
were. ... He was overwhelmed by a sense of evil. His mission was to
destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   But McClellan countered by asking if those same evil forces had
also told him to rape his dead or dying victims or steal valuables
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt an evil force pulling him into these homes and
directing him to people who were evil and deserved to be dead, and
as an angel of God he was doing God's will,'' Pollock said, adding
the sexual assaults were ``bizarre behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When McClellan asked how Maturino Resendiz could claim to be
guided simultaneously by evil forces and God's will, Pollock said
paranoid schizophrenics often exhibit contradictory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to make it logical, and this is one of the most
illogical diseases known to mankind,'' Pollock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or,'' McClellan responded, ``it's the most illogical
explanation someone has come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked if Maturino Resendiz could be using schizophrenia as a
cover for violent anti-social behavior and really did know right
from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew society may judge him as wrong,'' Pollock said, ``but
in his heart he knows he was right.''

 c.2000 Worth Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bill Clinton campaigned for the U.S. presidency in 1992, he
applauded the ``German model,'' highlighting the intimate links
between banks, unions, corporations, and government.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Clinton moved into the White House, he soon learned
that the German economic model was falling apart, and that the U.S.
economy was in fact far healthier and sturdier than Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, America's robust economy has created millions of new
jobs, while Germans have sat around in their lederhosen waiting for
their own economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton travels the globe bragging about the ``American
model'' of open markets, aggressive competition, and tight fiscal
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany may be getting its economic house in order. After
years of painfully high unemployment, the country is creating jobs.
The jobless rate has been falling the past two years, down to 10.1
percent recently from a peak of 11.8 percent in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is still ridiculously high when compared with the
4 percent jobless rate in the U.S. and U.K., it's still progress.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the German stock market has caught more than a
whiff of optimism. Its benchmark DAX index leaped 39 percent in
1999 and was up 10.1 percent during the first seven weeks of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will point out that the euro has skidded during the
past year, losing some 16 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar. Clearly, European leaders and central bankers haven't quite
earned the respect of world financial markets, but a cheaper euro
has been great for German exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The big electronics firm Siemens can compete much better against
Motorola and IBM if it is charging lower prices. And those swank
new Mercedes-Benz cars look less expensive to Americans when
they're being built by German workers paid in euros.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the German rebound than its cheap currency.
Ironically, what's driving the recovery is the breakdown of the
German model of cozy relations among the country's industrial
giants, banks, and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, every major company seemed to own a piece of each
other, in a ``you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours'' system,
with the same 60-year-old men sitting on every important board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   While this world of complex cross-holdings kept matters
peaceful, it hindered the intense competition that drives
innovation. Mergers, takeovers, and shareholder rebellions were far
too rare.
</P>
<P>
   If a company needed money to build a new factory, it would just
go to its affiliate bank for a loan. No need to borrow from the
bond market or issue public stock; heaven forbid _ that would
require justifying its finances to the public. And shareholders
came last. More important were executive perks and union support.
</P>
<P>
   In a millennial twist, it is the left-wing government of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder that is now dragging German businesses
into the Western world of heated competition.
</P>
<P>
   His Social Democrat Party, in a coalition with the
pro-environment Green Party, is slashing corporate capital-gains
taxes to encourage firms to spin off their cross-holdings without
having to pay punitive taxes. In addition, Schroder's government
proposes to slash individual income taxes, even for the wealthiest
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   With a cheap currency and a bonanza of tax cuts, the German
economy should grow at least 3 percent in 2000. This is
Reaganomics, twenty years after Reagan, albeit with a leftist tilt.
</P>
<P>
   For Germans, the 21st century is getting off to a strange but
promising start. &QL;

<P>
   When Bill Clinton campaigned for the U.S. presidency in 1992, he
applauded the ``German model,'' highlighting the intimate links
between banks, unions, corporations, and government.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Clinton moved into the White House, he soon learned
that the German economic model was falling apart, and that the U.S.
economy was in fact far healthier and sturdier than Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, America's robust economy has created millions of new
jobs, while Germans have sat around in their lederhosen waiting for
their own economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton travels the globe bragging about the ``American
model'' of open markets, aggressive competition, and tight fiscal
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany may be getting its economic house in order. After
years of painfully high unemployment, the country is creating jobs.
The jobless rate has been falling the past two years, down to 10.1
percent recently from a peak of 11.8 percent in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is still ridiculously high when compared with the
4 percent jobless rate in the U.S. and U.K., it's still progress.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the German stock market has caught more than a
whiff of optimism. Its benchmark DAX index leaped 39 percent in
1999 and was up 10.1 percent during the first seven weeks of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will point out that the euro has skidded during the
past year, losing some 16 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar. Clearly, European leaders and central bankers haven't quite
earned the respect of world financial markets, but a cheaper euro
has been great for German exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The big electronics firm Siemens can compete much better against
Motorola and IBM if it is charging lower prices. And those swank
new Mercedes-Benz cars look less expensive to Americans when
they're being built by German workers paid in euros.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the German rebound than its cheap currency.
Ironically, what's driving the recovery is the breakdown of the
German model of cozy relations among the country's industrial
giants, banks, and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, every major company seemed to own a piece of each
other, in a ``you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours'' system,
with the same 60-year-old men sitting on every important board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   While this world of complex cross-holdings kept matters
peaceful, it hindered the intense competition that drives
innovation. Mergers, takeovers, and shareholder rebellions were far
too rare.
</P>
<P>
   If a company needed money to build a new factory, it would just
go to its affiliate bank for a loan. No need to borrow from the
bond market or issue public stock; heaven forbid _ that would
require justifying its finances to the public. And shareholders
came last. More important were executive perks and union support.
</P>
<P>
   In a millennial twist, it is the left-wing government of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder that is now dragging German businesses
into the Western world of heated competition.
</P>
<P>
   His Social Democrat Party, in a coalition with the
pro-environment Green Party, is slashing corporate capital-gains
taxes to encourage firms to spin off their cross-holdings without
having to pay punitive taxes. In addition, Schroder's government
proposes to slash individual income taxes, even for the wealthiest
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   With a cheap currency and a bonanza of tax cuts, the German
economy should grow at least 3 percent in 2000. This is
Reaganomics, twenty years after Reagan, albeit with a leftist tilt.
</P>
<P>
   For Germans, the 21st century is getting off to a strange but
promising start. &QL;

GALAXY BRACES FOR SHAKEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Six of Luis Hernandez's Galaxy jerseys are
already waiting for him in the team's Rose Bowl locker room, and
Major League Soccer is expected to announce later this week that it
has signed a transfer agreement with the Mexican club team Tigres
for Hernandez's services.
</P>
<P>
   But the news isn't all good for the Galaxy. Team officials told
Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino and Roy Myers at Wednesday's practice
that they will be sent to other teams in order to make the deal
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will definitely be a transition period with the players
leaving on behalf of acquiring Hernandez,'' said Galaxy defender
Paul Caligiuri. ``To acquire a top star like Hernandez in his prime
and with his goal-scoring abilities is definitely a bonus for the
league and this team but it did come with a cost.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis refused to comment,
but Galaxy head coach Sigi Schmid admitted it is all but done. ``We
sort of informed them of what's supposed to happen if everything
finalizes itself,'' said Schmid of the three players.
</P>
<P>
   If Hernandez, Mexico's top striker and contributor during the
1998 World Cup in France, signs today or Friday, he could be in
uniform for the Galaxy's game in Dallas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and Franchino said their goodbyes to teammates.
Franchino, 23, a graduate of Damien High School in La Verne, said
he would go to the New England Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, 23, is having an all-star year (three goals and an
assist) after signing a multi-year contract with the league last
month. He said he would go to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars,
where he will be reunited with former Galaxy coach Octavio
Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear where Myers is heading but the Galaxy will have
to release the 31-year-old midfielder. Myers will likely be
reassigned to another team as a foreign allocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was told I will go to New England,'' said Franchino,
the most emotional of the three. ``I'm pretty sure this is my last
practice. The toughest part is walking out of here because I've
been with these guys for three years and they're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They way I look at it, this is an opportunity to further my
career,'' said Mathis. ``New York hasn't been doing as well as they
hoped, so if this happens, hopefully I can help turn them around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, an international star with his recognizable long
flowing blonde hair, is Mexico's most marketable and talented
player. Only 31, ``El Matador,'' as he's known in Mexico, will
attract a large Mexican contingent to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The big question for the Galaxy, however, is how will this
affect the team. Hernandez will replace Mathis on the front line
and team with Cobi Jones. UCLA rookie standout Sasha Victorine will
step in for Myers as an attacking midfielder. And Caligiuri will
replace Franchino as the team's outside left back.
</P>
<P>
   The starting lineup doesn't look like it will suffer, but the
Galaxy's strength has been its depth, which now will be tested.
When one factors in that Carlos Hermosillo left the team after the
1999 season, leaving a foreign allocation spot for Hernandez, it
looks on paper like the Galaxy is giving up four players to get
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   This is a situation the Galaxy has wrestled with. Basically, MLS
told the Galaxy it was pursuing Hernandez and that when a deal was
finalized, the Galaxy would have to make three players available.
That was the only way to free up salary cap space and move Los
Angeles ahead of San Jose and New England to get the next foreign
allocation.

INTERSTATE BAKERIES REIMPLEMENTS POISON PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interstate Bakeries Corp.'s on-again, off-again poison pill is
back on again.
</P>
<P>
   The company reimplemented a so-called shareholders rights plan
Tuesday, eight months after one was first put in place and about
three months after it was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate dissolved its first poison pill after several months
of fruitless discussions with Ralston Purina Corp., which owns
about 40 percent of Interstate's stock. Ralston Purina got the big
stake in Interstate when it sold Continental Baking Co. to
Interstate five years ago in a stock and cash deal.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate originally implemented a poison pill amid rumblings
on Wall Street that a competitor might pursue the company. Such
plans are designed to make it difficult for outside interests to
take over a company.
</P>
<P>
   The company was particularly vulnerable after its stock price
took a big one-day hit in October 1998, after Interstate warned
that earnings were going to fall short of analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The stock never recovered, and continued to go down as the
company experienced more problems, including more missed earnings
targets, operating problems at a new plant, an eight-day Teamsters
strike that took product off shelves in a wide swath of the
Northeast and higher fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding Interstate's depressed stock price was a provision
that Ralston Purina had to reduce its stake in Interstate from
almost 40 percent to less than 15 percent by Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston Purina balked at having to sell so much of its stock
when Interstate's stock price was so low. As a result, the two
returned to the table and worked out an agreement whereby Ralston
Purina would reduce its holdings in Interstate over a much longer
period in hopes that Interstate's stock price would rise.
Interstate has the right of first refusal on all Ralston Purina
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The new poison pill, like the first one, is triggered if someone
buys 15 percent or more of Interstate's stock and makes a tender
offer. If that happens, each existing shareholder except the group
making the offer has the right to receive one share of preferred
stock for each share of common stock already owned.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the new plan had any substantial
differences from the original poison pill.
</P>
<P>
   All of Interstate's top management, including Chairman Charles
Sullivan, was out of town and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ralston Purina said he could not comment on the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Pinheiro, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said
Interstate clearly continued to feel exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they feel the value of this company is a lot
higher, even more than perhaps a premium a hostile player would pay
for the company,'' Pinheiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The poison pill would not stop a suitor from pursuing
Interstate, but would force it to deal directly with the company's
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Sullivan said: ``The (plan is) designed to
assure that all of IBC's shareholders receive fair and equal
treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company and
to guard against partial tender offers, squeeze-outs, open market
accumulations and other abusive tactics to gain control of IBC
without paying all shareholders a more equitable value.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinheiro said the one name he heard bandied about as a possible
suitor was Bimbo Bakeries US, the U.S. division of the largest
baking company in Mexico. The company has a small presence in the
United States, but would like to have a larger one.
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario is that Sullivan and other top management could
take the company private.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's top managers and directors have been
actively buying Interstate stock, including Sullivan, President
Michael Kafoure, and Vice President and Controller John McKenny.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate's stock is trading around $14. If a group of managers
made a leveraged buyout, they probably would pay somewhere around
$22 a share, Pinheiro said. That would give Interstate a takeout
price of about $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're generating about $150 million each year in free cash
flow, so that would give them enough to service the debt, although
they probably wouldn't want to leverage it that much,'' Pinheiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he said, Interstate could bring in a partner.
Ralston, which already owns a huge chunk of Interstate, would be
the most logical one, Pinheiro said.
</P>
<P>
   And what would be the motivation for going private?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first the dislike of being a public company,'' Pinheiro
said. ``I don't think Chuck Sullivan likes being a public company
too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, going private is a possibility, but one that seems
to be driven by frustration of the stock price and the fickle
nature of Wall Street and not driven perhaps by strategic
thinking.''

MICROSOFT REJECTS BREAKUP PLAN  &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Conceding almost nothing in the government's antitrust case,
Microsoft yesterday adamantly rejected not only the idea of
breaking it in two but also the restrictions on its conduct
proposed by the Department of Justice two weeks ago.
<P>
   The software Goliath offered its own list of alternative
remedies, including changes to its business practices that would
give PC-makers more freedom to customize their products. But Bill
Neukom, Microsoft's chief lawyer, reserved the company's right to
appeal the final judgment even if Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
agrees to its proposals to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Microsoft called on the judge to dismiss the
government's bid to break it into separate companies. Calling the
demand ``unprecedented,'' ``unwarranted'' and ``punitive,'' the
company argued that would have ``horrendous'' effects on consumers,
the computer industry and the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company will not be broken up,'' declared Microsoft Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. ``It will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, supported by 17 state attorneys general,
had proposed splitting Microsoft into two companies, one based on
the Windows operating-system business and the other taking over the
remaining Microsoft products, including its Internet Explorer Web
browser and its popular Office application suite.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also proposed ``conduct remedies,'' including a
requirement that Microsoft allow other companies to examine the
``source code,'' or programming instructions, underlying Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft flatly rejected the request. Ballmer said in a
statement that ``the government's so-called conduct and disclosure
remedies are just as damaging to the company and just as bad for
consumers as their breakup demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the six documents Microsoft filed yesterday in
response to the government proposals, it declared that the
disclosure proposal ``would constitute a wholesale confiscation of
Microsoft's intellectual property _ the company's crown jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   What the software company did offer was a list of changes to its
business practices that it said would correct the abuses Jackson
found in earlier rulings. In April, Jackson ruled that Microsoft
had used its monopoly position in the operating systems' market to
stifle innovation and hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under its plan, the company would agree:
</P>
<P>
   _To allow PC manufacturers to delete the Internet Explorer icon
from the Windows desktop and Start menu, to make a non-Microsoft
browser the default program for Web access, to display icons for
non-Microsoft programs and to offer their own Internet sign-up
routine when the computer is first turned on.
</P>
<P>
   _Not to enter into contracts to promote any product or service
in exchange for the other party agreeing to limit distribution of
non-Microsoft programs.
</P>
<P>
   _To disclose equally to all software developers timely and
complete access to technical information, and not to condition such
disclosures on developers agreeing not to create products for
computing platforms that compete with Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   _Not to withhold Microsoft programs for other platforms in order
to force the vendor of the competing platform to limit its product
plans. That restriction, however, would apply only to Microsoft
programs ``ready for commercial release,'' not to any that might be
under consideration or development.
</P>
<P>
   _Not to raise prices on the previous version of Windows after it
releases a major upgrade. In the past, Microsoft has raised the
price of earlier versions to push PC manufacturers and users to
adopt its new releases.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MICROSOF (78159 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We think these proposals are incorrect both as to the facts of
the case and appropriate remedies,'' said California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer, one of the plaintiffs in the case. ``We
continue to see Microsoft saying they really didn't do anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly settlement `lite,''' said Richard Gilbert, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who served
as chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division
earlier in the Clinton administration. ``There's not a lot here
that Microsoft hasn't already agreed not to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's a gulf, a very large gulf, between the
government's proposals and these,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George Washington
University in Washington, D.C., said Microsoft's proposal ``does
address a number of the judge's specific concerns'' as reflected in
Jackson's courtroom comments, findings of fact and conclusions of
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wise for Microsoft to offer these proposals,'' Kovacic
said. ``It's a way to focus attention on the conduct issues, as
opposed to a breakup.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Gray, founder and principal of Outside General Counsel in
Menlo Park, said he found Microsoft's brief against the
government's breakup proposal much stronger than he'd expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading their brief I'm pretty persuaded that even if
they can't persuade Judge Jackson on the breakup remedy, they are
very likely to win that issue on appeal,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Miller, a San Francisco antitrust attorney who served as the
lead counsel in the Justice Department's 1994 case against
Microsoft, said that Microsoft's proposal overlaps with the
government's concerns about its conduct. ``In that sense,'' he
said, ``there is certainly some common ground now. The question is
whether that common ground is broad enough to satisfy the
Department of Justice and the states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From all indications, it isn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the judge decides Microsoft's concessions would
effectively prevent the kinds of abuses he has found in its past
behavior, according to Miller, he might not consider them adequate
remedies. Supreme Court precedents, he said, clearly establish that
a judge who has found violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act can
not only prohibit the conduct that violates the law, but also take
measures to restore competition in the affected markets and ``fence
in'' the monopolist so it can't commit other violations in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Judge Jackson has offered few clues at to the remedies
he considers appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs will respond next Wednesday to Microsoft's latest
filings. An open hearing on possible remedies is scheduled for May
24.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge were to accept its proposals, Microsoft attorney
Neukom said in a post-filing press conference, the case could be
settled as early as this month _ unless, of course, Microsoft were
to appeal even that outcome.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge is considering farther-reaching remedies, Microsoft
said in its filings yesterday, he should change the schedule to
allow it more time to prepare for the next phase of the case.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company said, it should have until December 4
to prepare if the judge is considering breaking it up. If he
rejects that idea but entertains the possibility of requiring it to
disclose its source code, Microsoft would need until October 2 to
prepare, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's proposal includes an offer to pay attorneys' fees
for the 19 states that were plaintiffs in the case, but apparently
not to cover the Justice Department's costs.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Well, knock me over with a feather.
Organizations that offer the most sought-after employee benefits
are the most effective at getting and keeping employees.
</P>
<P>
   Management consultants Bud Burgess and Don Feltham kept hearing
a plea from their Kansas City area clients: Help me recruit and
retain good workers.
</P>
<P>
   They knew there was no silver bullet. Still, they reasoned,
there are places right here where the annual staff turnover rate is
below the national 15 percent to 20 percent norm. What do they do
that others don't?
</P>
<P>
   The Burgess &AMP; Associates crew worked up a survey this spring,
mailed it to nearly 400 area businesses, got 65 responses and
picked apart the returns. The conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``Low-turnover organizations are doing a better job than
high-turnover organizations of providing what their existing
workers want,'' Feltham said.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants were not shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low-turnover places really take care of the people they
have working for them now. They know their people talk. They know
their existing people are their best referral agents,'' Burgess
said. (They define low turnover as an annual rate of 12 percent or
less.)
</P>
<P>
   The low-turnover organizations said flexible scheduling was
their most effective benefit. Also, in the cafeteria of employee
benefit offerings, the lowest-turnover companies put more on the
buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 46 recruitment and retention tactics in the poll, the
typical low-turnover company offered 60 percent to 70 percent of
the benefits choices. The typical high-turnover company used only
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After massaging the data, the consultants came close to assaying
that magic bullet for getting and keeping workers. Some
ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   - Flexible scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   - Referral bonuses for employees who recommend new hires.
</P>
<P>
   - Subsidized transportation and parking.
</P>
<P>
   - Casual dress code.
</P>
<P>
   - Liberal internal job-posting and job-changing policies.
</P>
<P>
   - Job-offer decisions made (and revealed) after the applicant's
first visit.
</P>
<P>
   - Subsidized health care.
</P>
<P>
   The local findings dovetail with national results. Hewitt
Associates, the nation's largest employee benefits consulting firm,
surveyed 1,020 major U.S. employers last year.
</P>
<P>
   To ``remain competitive in today's war for talent,'' employers
must ``offer attractive benefits that enable employees to better
balance their work and personal lives,'' Hewitt concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits listed were flexible scheduling; child- and elder-care
assistance; adoption benefits; on-site concierge, banking, dry
cleaning and travel services; discount purchases; casual dress;
financial advice programs; professional growth and training,
including tuition reimbursement and on- and off-site seminars; and
liberal family- and medical-leave policies.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, those are big-company kinds of benefits. But all
employers need to understand the competitive employment market.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of whether employers can afford such
benefits; it's whether their competitors can _ and whether they can
afford not to.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While continuing to reject the antitrust findings
against it, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday offered a series of narrow
restrictions on its behavior that it said would be more appropriate
remedies than breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also asked the judge to throw out the government's
breakup proposal immediately, arguing that ``the laws and the facts
do not support such a radical step.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's counterproposal is a four-year plan largely
governing its relations with computer makers and software
developers.
</P>
<P>
   In its court filing, Microsoft said that if the government's
breakup plan were adopted, its employees might ``leave the company
in droves.'' If that were to happen, Microsoft continued, ``the
company's entire business would be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such passages seemed clearly intended to warn U.S. District
Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft
would be a dangerous gamble to take with a pillar of the nation's
high-technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is no basis for the government's
unprecedented breakup proposal,'' said Bill Gates, the company's
chairman, ``and we are hopeful that the court will dismiss this
excessive demand immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion for summary rejection was added unexpectedly to the
company's formal response to the remedy proposal offered last month
by the Justice Department and 17 states. In the motion, Microsoft
argued that since the company achieved its monopoly position by
legal means, the government has no right ``to dismember
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   After four years of investigation and 19 months of litigation,
the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed on
April 28 that Microsoft be broken into two companies. One would
hold the Windows operating system, the other everything else,
including the Office suite of application programs like Word and
Excel. Two of the 19 states joining in the suit _ Ohio and Illinois
_ advocated steps short of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled on April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of
the nation's antitrust laws. But if he chose to break up the
company, it would be one of only a few instances the last hundred
years when a major national company was broken apart as a result of
an antitrust case _ and the only one resulting from court order
rather than a consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, the federal and state governments are entitled to
reply to Wednesday's filing from Microsoft. And then during a
remedies hearing on May 24, both the government and Microsoft will
offer arguments in support of their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, the Justice Department said that
``Microsoft's proposal is ineffective and filled with loopholes.''
Among the loopholes, the department added, the proposal would not
prevent ``attempts to divide markets with competitors; retaliation
against personal computer manufacturers and software developers
that support non-Microsoft technologies; or tying to require PC
manufacturers to ship other Microsoft products with Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who leads the states that
are joining in the suit, said: ``The remedies proposed are
inadequate. These measures would not have prevented the serious
violations of law found by Judge Jackson, and they are not adequate
remedies to assure that the law is not broken in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Microsoft's leaders have repeatedly said there was
a ``church and state'' separation within the company between the
Windows group and the others that develop applications programs
like Office.
</P>
<P>
   But in Wednesday's filing, Microsoft said: ``Cross pollination
between engineers working on different products such as Windows and
Office has led to numerous innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that the company's success and attendant benefits for
consumers ``would not have been possible but for Microsoft's
unified structure, which enables Microsoft to conceive and
implement new ideas that span operating systems and applications.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday's filing, Microsoft offered its own
proposed remedies, a collection of rules that would modify the
company's conduct, while reiterating its conviction to appeal the
case, even if its remedy proposal were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's proposals are similar to those in the
government plan, though they are more narrowly focused on specific
complaints raised in the trial. Along with the breakup plan, the
government wants to impose about a dozen rules intended to moderate
Microsoft's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's proposed conduct restrictions fall far short of the
government's, and the company explained: ``Courts are not
authorized in civil enforcement proceedings to punish antitrust
defendants. Instead, relief must extend no farther than is
necessary to redress the conduct found to be unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposals included several significant concessions.
Among them, Microsoft would have to take these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree not to discriminate in the release of technical
information about Windows to outside software developers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow computer manufacturers to make ``non-Microsoft Web
browsing software the default browser on a new personal computer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree not to threaten to withhold a license for Windows from a
computer maker featuring products by a Microsoft competitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enter into no exclusive deals that offer other companies
favored treatment in Windows in exchange for agreements to feature
only Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree not to condition the release of its software intended
for non-Microsoft operating systems, like Apple Computer's, on the
other company's agreement not to distribute or promote competitors'
software.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department complained in its statement that
Microsoft's remedies would not ``prevent the company from using its
monopoly power in the future to engage in the same kind of illegal
behavior to crush new innovations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the department promoted its own plan, saying it would
``address the serious violations found by the court'' by
``stimulating competition and innovation, leading to better
products and lower prices for consumers.''

HOTELS FOR THE MENTALLY ILL 
 &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably wouldn't give Lawrence a second glance.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps to himself as he goes about his business, attending
classes in African American history at City College of San
Francisco, walking to school from his little room in the
downtrodden Graystone Hotel on Geary Street.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence seldom speaks to other students. He does not interact
with other hotel residents. ``I'm pretty withdrawn'' is his
explanation for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lawrence is a product of both modern medicine _ his
schizophrenia controlled by daily doses of anti-psychotics and mood
stabilizers _ and the latest thinking on how a city can better
handle the heaviest users of its mental health system by getting
them out of institutions and into the community.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the experimental program begun by San Francisco in
1997 is a glowing success. The annual cost of housing and treating
the 400 mentally ill individuals brought most frequently to San
Francisco General Hospital has dropped from about $24 million to $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   That success may now make the so-called Program for Assertive
Community Treatment, or PACT, the city's best bet for managing its
population of mentally ill residents as cutbacks loom at San
Francisco General. A city budget shortage could soon lead to
elimination of 21 of the 87 beds in the hospital's psychiatric
ward.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clear monetary benefits of PACT, the reality of
the program is that Lawrence and people like him are the exception.
For most participants, days are spent in an unsupervised pursuit of
spare change and cheap drugs, and few have shown a willingness or
ability to play a more active role in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, you hope you've gained one inch in the
long road toward bringing these people back into society _ one
little inch,'' said John Mitchell, a registered nurse at Community
Focus, the largest of three PACT projects in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Run by the University of California at San Francisco, Community
Focus accounts for half of the 400 people in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Mitchell said. ``In many cases, the most
we can expect is that they'll have a roof over their head and three
meals a day and be clothed. And that's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   A morning spent with Mitchell as he made his rounds of
Tenderloin hotels illustrated the difficulty of the job as well the
pluses and minuses of housing the city's mentally ill in downtown
residential hotels.
</P>
<P>
   He began just after 8 a.m. at the Graystone, where two clients,
Clinton and Donald, were waiting outside for their daily medication
and, more important, envelopes containing the few dollars that
would be their spending money for the day.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Quieting Interior Voices
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received 13 pills in a rainbow of colors _ a
pharmaceutical cocktail to keep him calm, rational and undisturbed
by the voices in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to sleep after I take them,'' he said after swallowing
all the pills in one big gulp. ``I like sleeping during the day.
I'm up all night.''
</P>
<P>
   After running a comb through Donald's hair to check for head
lice, Mitchell proceeded past the Graystone's ``No visitors'' sign
and into the hotel, where dark, foul-smelling rooms go for about
$500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Fred in Room 608 told Mitchell that he would not be taking his
medication that day because he was fasting ``for religious
reasons.'' Mitchell, as per PACT rules, did not argue the point,
handing Fred his pills for later, along with his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always got a reason,'' Mitchell said as he headed down
the hallway. ``He's manic depressive, and manic depressives don't
like medicine because it brings them off their high.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred would be up most of the night, Mitchell predicted,
``getting louder and louder.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of HOTELS10 (35664 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; sh1  &LR; Another Hotel to Cover
</P>
<P>
   He went quickly through the other rooms on his list and then
headed over to the Columbia Hotel at the corner of O'Farrell and
Taylor streets. Henry in Room 612 had the window closed and
curtains drawn as he chain-smoked in a wooden chair by the bed.
</P>
<P>
   As Henry swallowed his pills, Mitchell quietly explained that
Henry, a manic depressive, had been born into money but had
squandered his family's fortune on call girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived my whole life in San Francisco,'' Henry said
bitterly. ``I hate this city. It hasn't done anything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Mitchell doled out medicine and money to Willie,
a flirtatious transvestite whose room was covered floor to ceiling
with magazine pictures of men and women in suggestive poses.
</P>
<P>
   Willie is one of the few in the program with an activity outside
the hotel. He serves as an assistant to the art therapist at
Mitchell's clinic on Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for us working with him real hard, he'd be in a
hospital 12 months a year,'' Mitchell said. ``He's one of our
success stories.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Program Created in 1972
</P>
<P>
   Versions of PACT have been around for nearly three decades,
since the idea was first introduced in Madison, Wis., in 1972. San
Francisco's version is also known in bureaucratic circles as the
Single Point of Responsibility program.
</P>
<P>
   The basic concept is simple: Hospitalization costs can go down
and quality of life for patients can go up by moving the mentally
ill out of institutions and back into society, where they will be
attended to on a daily basis by nurses and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Wisconsin, PACT-type initiatives have been adopted in
Delaware, Idaho, Michigan, Rhode Island and Texas. Pilot programs
are under way in Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Virginia, as
well as in California.
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a leading advocacy
group, is pushing for every state to adopt the PACT system by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research by and large shows that the PACT model can reduce
hospitalization,'' said Dr. Robert Okin, chief of psychiatry at San
Francisco General Hospital. ``It has the capacity to stabilize
patients in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Miracle Cures Not Expected
</P>
<P>
   ``Stabilize'' _ that is the key word here. No one expects
miracle cures or even that a majority of PACT participants will
become functioning members of society.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the program is designed to place patients on something
close to an even keel, to get them to take their medication each
day and, through a long-term relationship with caregivers, to
address the more excessive aspects of their disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, PACT participants _ the program is
voluntary _ frequently withdraw into their hotel rooms, emerging
onto the street only to panhandle or buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the PACT model, the client's wishes are incorporated into
the plan,'' said Bea Stephens, executive director of San
Francisco's Westside Community Mental Health Center, which also has
a PACT contract with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a clinician, I may think a client needs a more supervised
environment,'' she said. ``But the client may choose to have more
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Addiction Common
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Stephens said, as many as 60 percent of
participants in Westside's PACT have ``addiction issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most singular barrier we have to
integrating enrollees into the community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Community Focus' Mitchell also observed that drug use is
prevalent among PACT participants and that many turn to panhandling
or prostitution to support their habits.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of HOTELS10 (35664 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``It's a lifestyle of choice,'' he said. ``They do a little
panhandling, get a little disability money, and the streets are
their kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   The burnout is evident in Mitchell's eyes _ a fairly common
consequence for those who make a living by treating the mentally
ill. He said he was willing to speak candidly about PACT only
because he will be leaving the program soon to look after his
father, who has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to have these people in the community,'' Mitchell
said. ``But not all of them. Some people need four walls and a
locked door.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Fewer Hospital Beds
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer walls and doors available, though. The state
hospital in Napa County now accepts only a handful of patients from
San Francisco. San Francisco General, meanwhile, could end up with
just 66 beds in its four dormitorylike psychiatric wards, which
divide patients along ethnic, gender or cultural lines.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the San Francisco General wards is
surprisingly quiet _ it is no ``Cuckoo's Nest'' _ but there is also
the general sense of ennui among inhabitants that comes with being
shut inside for weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So great is demand for space in the wards that the hospital
turns away as many as 100 people a month brought in by police for
being a threat to themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's Okin was frank about where the mentally ill can
end up: an institution, jail, the street or PACT.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point,'' he said, ``society has to make the decision
about what it's going to do with its most disabled, least
functional members.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; San Francisco a Magnet
</P>
<P>
   And San Francisco, with its gentle climate and relatively
generous social-support network, will remain a magnet for such
people, placing an ever-growing burden on the city's resources,
Okin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the federal government abandons people who are the
most disadvantaged and disturbed, those parts of society that are
most humane will inadvertently be asked to shoulder the greatest
share of the burden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest wild card for PACT's future in San Francisco is the
residential hotels. Although city ordinances bar most such hotels
from being converted to other uses, the stock of available rooms is
limited, and few restrictions prevent owners from raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rates will be what the market will bear,'' said Sam Patel,
owner of the Mission Hotel and co-manager of two other downtown
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he said, this means most residential hotel
occupants pay between $100 and $150 a week for their rooms. But as
downtown property values continue to rise, Patel said, it is likely
that these rates will increase.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Housing a Major Need
</P>
<P>
   ``The Achilles' heel of the program is how many people it can
accommodate,'' said Steven Segal, director of mental health
research for the School of Social Welfare at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see how the housing stock will keep pace with
need,'' said Marc Trotz, director of housing development for the
San Francisco Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rising rents in San Francisco are a threat to any
low-income person,'' he said. ``It's a unique challenge to anyone
working with poor people in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   For PACT, this challenge is exacerbated by the fact that it must
compete for limited space in the residential hotels with other city
programs for homeless and low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   To make more rooms available, the city has taken the unusual
step of leasing six residential hotels in the past year, including
two leased through the Department of Public Health, which oversees
PACT.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Rising Rent at Private Hotels
</P>
<P>
   But most PACT participants continue to be housed in privately
run hotels and, in some cases, already are seeing most of their
monthly $700 disability checks go to pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of HOTELS10 (35664 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We're quite worried about how the housing market will affect
clients' lives,'' said Joanne Wile, director of Community Focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen,'' said Randy
Shaw, director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, a grassroots
organization. ``The city's going to have to further subsidize the
rents.''
</P>
<P>
   This will place more pressure on PACT initiatives to maintain
political backing from the mayor's office and the Board of
Supervisors, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Issues Raised by Violent Acts
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it will take only one violent incident
involving a PACT participant for questions to be raised about
housing those with the greatest tendency for errant behavior in the
community instead of at institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the economies _ it's cheaper to have these people
at hotels,'' Shaw said. ``But they shouldn't be in hotels. They
should be in hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the case, many now agree, with Hollis Owens, who was
arrested in connection with the beating of a Vallejo man in San
Francisco's Portsmouth Square last December.
</P>
<P>
   While Owens, who had a criminal history of assaults going back
15 years, was not in PACT, he was in a similar program run by the
Department of Public Health called Citywide Case Management.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide shares offices with Community Focus and is also
administered by UC San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a drink of vodka from Ramon Calderon, who
apparently made a habit of befriending street people, Owens
suddenly flew into a rage and struck Calderon on the head with a
stick. Calderon later fell into a coma and was declared legally
dead at Marin General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, originally charged with murder, eventually pleaded guilty
to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced Monday to eight years
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will happen again,'' said Community Focus' Mitchell.
``There are enough people just like this guy that we work with as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco General's Okin disputed the suggestion that PACT
clients pose a greater danger to the community. ``I think we have
increased the security of the community through this program,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell, who works with PACT clients day in and day out,
warned against complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these people out in the community,'' he said.
``Caseworkers are trying to make them safe and civil, but we're
having a hell of a time doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Funding for PACT runs out next month. Linda Wang, director of
adult services for the Department of Public Health's Community
Mental Health Services, said she is confident that the city will
approve additional funds to continue the program.

features to Windows, sell a version of Windows at a discount with
that new feature hidden or removed; a requirement that Microsoft
publish a uniform price list for Windows; and a ban on design
strategies that are intended to compromise or disable other
programs that run on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also offered a proposed schedule for remedy hearings,
a sliding scale that calls for longer proceedings if the judge
chooses to consider the government remedy proposals that Microsoft
considers most onerous.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson chooses to consider the government's plan to break up
the company, Microsoft said it would need six months to prepare for
an extensive remedies trial that would begin in early December.
</P>
<P>
   Other options _ accepting some parts of the government plan but
not others _ would bring delays of weeks or months, under the
Microsoft plan.
</P>
<P>
   While attending a convention in New Orleans on Wednesday, Steven
A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said flatly: ``Our company
will not be broken up. It will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has said he wants to complete the remedy phase by the
end of May. But Microsoft lawyers made clear when Jackson proposed
his fast-track timetable in April that the company could not agree
until it had seen the government plan.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cited one government demand as one justification for
its proposed delays: a proposal requiring Microsoft to share
technical information about Windows with other software companies
that is far more sweeping than Microsoft's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for deliberate procedures is especially strong
because much of the intellectual property the government seeks to
confiscate relates to products and technologies, such as Windows
2000, that were not even mentioned at trial,'' one of the company's
briefs says. ``If the company intends to consider such draconian
relief, Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said, ``The government's proposal would take away
Microsoft's property'' even though ``Microsoft spent millions of
dollars to develop these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Microsoft documents, the company makes the case
that it is a national asset, central to the nation's economy, so
that disturbing Microsoft would be unfortunate for both the
American people and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has reaped substantial benefits from Microsoft's
development of Windows and other software products,'' the company
said. ``Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that they entire
United States economy has benefited from Microsoft's efforts. Such
benefits would be put at risk were this court to order that
Microsoft be broken up into separate companies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the filing, Microsoft fell $1.625 to $66.1875 on the
Nasdaq market. In after-hours trading, the shares dipped as low as
$65, reaching the company's 52-week low, before rising slightly to
$65.50.

NAPSTER KICKS OFF 300,000 METALLICA FANS  &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Embattled software startup Napster Inc. said Wednesday that it
has blocked access to more than 300,000 Napster users who the rock
group Metallica said were swapping illegal copies of their songs.
</P>
<P>
   But in an attempt to shift blame to the heavy-metal band, the
San Mateo company said it would reinstate anyone who lodged a
formal protest that they were mistakenly named by Metallica.
Reactivation of the account would take 10 to 14 business days as
long as the band doesn't sue the individual first.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the formal online reinstatement request form asks the
banned members to give ``your consent to be sued by Metallica in
the federal court where you reside.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press release titled ```Heavy Metal Heavyweights K.O.
Fans,'' Napster attorney Laurence F. Pulgram said the company ``has
taken extraordinary steps to comply with Metallica's demands to
block hundreds of thousands of its fans from using the Napster
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallica attorney Howard K. King said the band still had no
intention of suing individual fans and that it was ``outrageous''
Napster was trying to shift blame to Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has done is let Napster fly its true colors,'' King
said. ``They don't have any intention of protecting copyrighted
material.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass takedown of Napster users is the latest twist in the
short but controversial history of the startup, which makes a
popular software program that allows users to freely share and
trade downloadable music compressed into the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica filed a $10 million civil suit against the company on
April 13 for copyright infringement and racketeering. Napster is
also fighting similar suits by rap artist Dr. Dre and the Recording
Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich hand-delivered 13
cardboard boxes filled with the screen names of more than 335,000
Napster users the band said claims  &LR; were offering illegal copies of
Metallica songs during the last weekend of April. The band demanded
Napster terminate access for those users.
</P>
<P>
   The event became a media circus outside Napster's downtown San
Mateo offices. The next day, without fanfare, Metallica's lawyers
transmitted an electronic version of the list to Napster. The list
was culled to 317,377 when Metallica agreed not to go after Napster
fans who had copies of bootleg music that were authorized by the
band.
</P>
<P>
   Napster began blocking members on Metallica's list last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock last night when I saw I was blocked,'' said Jay
Arnold of Tulsa, Okla., who added that he also felt ``betrayed by
Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said he has purchased CDs after hearing songs he sampled
using Napster. But now, he won't buy the latest ``Mission
Impossible'' soundtrack because it contains a Metallica song.
``They want to have this image of being rock and roll rebels and
they do crap like this,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Banned Napster users seeking reinstatement have to sign an
online form requiring their real names, addresses and a sworn
statement they believe they were mistakenly blocked. Napster will
forward the forms to Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   A Napster spokesman did not know how many users had filed forms
but said it was running into the ``thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet message boards were filled with posts from banned users
who got back online simply by deleting Napster and any references
to Metallica on their hard drives. They then reinstalled Napster
and signed on using another name.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newest version of Napster keeps track of anyone who
has been banned in the past, Napster users said they simply
reinstalled older Napster versions that didn't have that function.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Napster controversy has made a team of Santa
Clara University students $1,000 richer.
</P>
<P>
   The four sophomore business majors, Kelly Walsh, Laura Erickson,
Joseph Rushmer and Blaze Smallwood, recently won first place in a
nationwide business ethics competition by suggesting a compromise
to the recording industry's beefs with Napster.
</P>
<P>
   The solution called for the Recording Industry Association of
America to drop its civil suit against Napster in exchange for a
cooperative agreement with the software company that included
Napster supplying demographic data on its users to the RIAA.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Ethics and Business at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles awarded first prize to the Santa Clara
students.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the students picked the Napster issue because it is
particularly popular among college students, so popular that the
program has been banned or restricted on about 100 campuses because
of bandwidth or copyright problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Napster Web site could actually facilitate the sale of
merchandise or concert tickets,'' she said. ``There's so much more
than record sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the proliferation of Napster-style file-sharing
software, the team sought to devise an all-encompassing solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge issue,'' Walsh said. ``I might not go to Tower
Records to steal a CD, but don't have a problem downloading an MP3
into my computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster suffered a legal setback in its case with the RIAA when
a judge ruled it has not proven the company is protected by one
provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

PROVIDIAN CHIEF HINTS TALKS ARE PROGRESSING 
 &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Credit card giant Providian Financial is making progress in its
talks with law enforcement agencies to settle consumer fraud
charges against it, the company's top executive hinted Wednesday.
<P>
   Settlement talks aren't stalemated, even though there has been
no agreement in the seven months since negotiations between
Providian and the San Francisco district attorney's office were
first reported, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Shailesh Mehta
suggested during an interview after the company's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time, but that doesn't mean it's not progressing,''
Mehta said about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office disclosed a year ago that it was
investigating Providian for charging late fees when customers
actually paid bills on time, selling consumers products they hadn't
requested and other alleged abuses. The company says only that it
accidentally levied improper late fees, which it later refunded.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's chief didn't comment on the substance of the talks
or a timetable for reaching an agreement. But his remark went
further than previous statements from the San Francisco company, in
which it said only that it was cooperating with law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been very guarded,'' said Banc of America Securities
analyst Caren Mayer. ``All they have said is that they continue to
have discussions and still hope for a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the district attorney's office declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to read too much into Mehta's optimistic
spin, said an attorney who has taken part in similar negotiations.
The attorney, who asked not to be identified, cautioned that
successful settlements depend heavily on last-minute give and take,
and that major issues between Providian and investigators
presumably still have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks between the district attorney and Providian
began last fall, the company later confirmed. Then, early this
year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal bank
regulatory agency that had opened a separate investigation of the
company, joined the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations made little progress until the two agencies
presented the findings of their investigations to the company
several months ago, people familiar with the matter said. In
addition, the need to reach an agreement among three parties is
probably delaying a settlement, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement would likely include tens of millions of dollars
in fines and repayments to victimized customers, plus Providian's
commitment to halt improper practices, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already rewritten marketing materials and
changed other business practices, steps it claims have resolved
outstanding legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took criticism very seriously,'' Mehta said. ``I can assure
you we're very high integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta said he hadn't been aware of improper late fees because
the company had adopted a liberal fee-waiver policy that hid the
problem. ``I should have (noticed) the late-fee problem a lot
sooner,'' he said.

STUDY FINDS SHIFT IN EXAMINER EDITORIALS AFTER LUNCH WITH MAYOR 
 &HT;     BY DAN FOST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A new analysis of San Francisco Examiner editorials has found a
``subtle but troubling shift'' in the paper's treatment of Willie
Brown after the mayor's now infamous lunch with Examiner Publisher
Tim White.
<P>
   The Examiner had been caustic in its portrayal of Brown before
the August 30 lunch but was more cautious and even supportive
afterward, according to the findings of John McManus, project
director of Grade the News, which objectively examines the Bay
Area's major news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   McManus dissected the Examiner's op-ed columns and editorial
cartoons published two months before and after August 30. He posted
his findings Wednesday on his Web site ( &LR; www.gradethenews.org &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   August 30 was the date _ according to White's testimony in an
antitrust lawsuit last week _ that White told Brown the Ex would
support the mayor on the editorial page if the mayor would support
the Hearst Corp.'s acquisition of The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   White later said he made no such promise, and Examiner
Editorial-Page Editor James Finefrock offered a spirited defense on
Sunday, writing that even if White had promised Brown kid-glove
treatment, he never could have delivered.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Examiner _ which had been among Brown's toughest
critics _ endorsed Da Mayor in his re-election bid, people wondered
if White's ``horse trade'' had been consummated.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know: After their lunch engagement, the Ex seemed to pull
its punches in its treatment of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   We know this because McManus, a former reporter and journalism
professor who launched Grade the News earlier this year,
scrutinized the Examiner's op-ed pages during the period in
question with a list of objective criteria. (Presumably, Hearst is
doing the same thing as part of its ballyhooed investigation into
White's ``horse trading,'' but those results may not be made public
for months.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Examiner does show a more positive tone toward Willie
Brown after August 30 than before, but it doesn't give him a free
ride,'' McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   Before that date, the Examiner ran two editorials favorable to
Brown, four editorials that were unfavorable, three negative op-ed
columns and no positive editorial cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   After August 30, the Examiner ran six editorials favorable to
Brown, four negative editorials, no negative op-ed columns, one
positive editorial cartoon and two negative editorial cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before August 30, they think Willie Brown is an arrogant SOB _
they're very negative,'' McManus said. ``After that, the coverage
becomes much more balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ex's Finefrock took issue with McManus' findings. ``Some of
these things, especially the numerical analysis, are awfully thin
reads to base judgments on. This guy is seeing shadows,'' Finefrock
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously don't agree with his analysis. It's not true. ...
I endorsed Brown because he was the best guy in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus launched Grade the News earlier this year as a special
project of San Jose public television station KTEH. It is funded by
the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual attempt to apply the rubric of consumer affairs
reporting to local news. ``The biggest crisis in journalism is
happening at the local level, not nationally,'' McManus said.
Nationally, people can choose quality sources like the New York
Times, National Public Radio and the ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locally, people are dependent on the daily newspaper and the
local television station,'' he said. ``The competition is a lot
thinner, and often the journalism is manipulative and not helpful
to people.''
</P>
<P>
   He is evaluating stories that appear in The Chronicle, San Jose
Mercury News and Contra Costa Times, and that run on channels 2, 4,
5 and 7. He measures each report based on criteria such as
newsworthiness, fairness, the quality and quantity of sources,
whether the news outlet is covering local government, whether it's
digging up ``enterprise'' stories and whether its news is locally
relevant.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site, for instance, slams most media outlets, including
The Chronicle, for too much coverage of the opening of Pac Bell
Park. It's fine with McManus if the story appears in the sports
section and occasionally on the front page, but he nailed The
Chronicle for putting it out front 14 times in 18 days, often
eating up half of this valuable real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports isn't really news at all,'' McManus writes on his site.
``It's entertainment. If it attracts people who otherwise wouldn't
pay attention to the newspaper or newscast, I'm for it. But when it
takes over the front page of a newspaper, it's a distraction,
displacing what's important. It's pandering.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus, a former reporter for the Virginian-Pilot newspaper in
Norfolk, Va., is the author of ``Market-Driven Journalism: Let the
Citizen Beware?'' He is a particularly harsh critic of local
television news and its emphasis on crime and disasters. ``You'd be
surprised how many people watch local TV news and feel informed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McManus has set a ``grand goal'' for Grade the News: that people
will benefit from the comparisons between various media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to ``induce at least a portion of the audience to forgo
schlock for serious journalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A MAGAZINE NO MORE: Salon.com has no one else to blame but
itself. It wants to be known as so much more than an online
magazine, yet it was the company's original Web address at, ahem,
 &LR; www.salonmagazine.com  &LR; that leaves the taint of pulp and ink on
its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to watch, however, as Salon continues to take
steps toward the multimedia reputation it so craves. This week was
the latest move, a $5 million move into MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry: Salon isn't likely to offend Metallica with this
one. Instead, it bought MP3Lit.com, a Web site that offers ``spoken
word and audio literature recordings'' in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The site features snippets of books-on-tape recordings,
downloadable in the MP3 format now popular with rap stars and
garage bands.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of Salon CEO Michael O'Donnell's agenda to branch out
into other media. ``This year, we make that final push from a
Webzine to a media company,'' he said, noting a variety of
initiatives: Salon is developing a television show for the Bravo
cable channel, it's working on an Internet radio channel and it's
publishing books based on content that's appeared on the  &LR; its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Salon is looking to license more of its content to
others, both in print and online. For instance, Kimberly-Clark
Corp. _ the maker of Huggies diapers _ is licensing content from
Salon's ``Mothers Who Think'' section to put on its own new Web
site at  &LR; www.parentstages.com &LR; . &LR;   &LR; ``Syndication could be half of
our revenue,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell watches the rise in online advertising with enthusiasm
and believes that Salon could reach profitability in 18 months.
Media firms need time to build their audience, he says. Once that
happens, though, ``it's a cash cow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, O'Donnell's greatest challenge is to keep
staffers and shareholders calm as the stock flounders in the low
single-digits. It closed yesterday at $3.13, down 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep blunt objects out of reach, and I tell the staff
it's a marathon, not a sprint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TALK TALK TALK: I spoke to Salon chief O'Donnell at a swanky
party his company was co-hosting with Talk Media, showing off the
Miramax movie ``Takedown,'' about hacker Kevin Mitnick. Talk tabbed
Salon as a local sponsor, so that it would invite the right crowd,
and suitable tech stars like Marc Andreessen and Kim Polese were
indeed in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Salon and Talk made for an interesting pair: Both are companies
somewhat on the ropes, Salon with its depressed stock price and
Talk with a revolving door of editors. But both also manage to
captivate other media outlets with provocative stories and
charismatic leaders, including Salon Editor David Talbot and Talk
chief Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The two met for the first time in New York last month and
schmoozed again at the Delancey Street party in San Francisco.
Might there be some sort of teamwork coming up? ``We have been
talking about the various ways Salon and Talk might be able to
continue a national conversation,'' Talbot told the assembled
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   (O'Donnell later added: ``Maybe we can help them out with their
Web plans, and they can help us get into print.'')
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps alluding to Sean Elder's thoroughly reported Salon
piece ripping Brown's latest hire, Vicky Ward, Brown said, ``I hope
all this collaboration with Salon doesn't mean I won't be trashed
in Salon.''
</P>
<P>
   Give the queen of buzz credit: She understands the rule that no
publicity is bad.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING A FORTUNE? Just wondering how it is that Fortune could
run such a sunny cover story on Cisco Systems at the same time that
Barron's found clouds gathering over the networking colossus.
</P>
<P>
   Barron's painted Cisco's acquisition strategy as a house of
cards and mocked Cisco's logo with the question: ``Does Anybody
Want to Buy a Bridge?'' But Fortune's cover asked a different sort
of question: ``Is John Chambers the Best CEO on Earth?''
</P>
<P>
   A clue appears in the third graf of the Fortune story, in which
reporter Andy Serwer discloses ``my few hundred shares'' of Cisco
stock. (Two hundred shares would be worth more than $12,000, for
some perspective.)
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Serwer's well-written piece examines many of the
risks threatening Cisco, and a section on risk factors closes with
a discussion of the company's ``arrogance and hubris.'' ``When
questioned about earnings for an upcoming quarter, one Cisco
employee said to me, `Don't you know, at Cisco we never miss our
numbers?' Well, I've got news for you, bub! Someday you will!''
</P>
<P>
   But given the recent spotlight Fortune placed on weak ethics in
the dot-com world, one has to wonder: Shouldn't the magazine have
avoided the appearance of a conflict by assigning a reporter who
doesn't own stock in the company?

STARVING THE COOKIE MONSTER: HOW TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION 
 WHILE SURFING THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By Becky Waring
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent news about viruses, hacker invasions, denial-of-service
attacks and Trojan horses illustrate the vulnerability of the
Internet to criminal assault. But what about the hidden attacks on
our privacy from seemingly innocuous sources, such as the Web sites
we visit and the e-commerce transactions we make?
</P>
<P>
   You may not realize it, but ``cookies'' (those little tags
placed on our computers ostensibly to identify us to a Web site
when we visit it a second time) can be toxic as well as beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you want the convenience of being ``remembered'' by your
favorite sites and may even take advantage of personalization
features like MyYahoo or MyExcite. But do you really want to be
``followed'' as you surf the Web, with information being collected
and aggregated into profiles that tell advertisers all about you?
Cookies can do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Cyber Dialogue, an Internet
customer relationship management company, more than 46 percent of
all Web browsers are set to accept all cookies indiscriminately,
without any warning to the user. Only 3 percent are set to reject
all. Yet 49 percent also feel that sharing personal data with other
Web sites via cookies is an invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many people concerned about Internet privacy but
seemingly not doing anything about it? Basically because managing
cookies is too technical a task for most people. Opening up
Internet Explorer 5.0's preferences panel, I counted over 250
cookies in my ``jar.'' And this &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; c,12p2  &LR; is for a browser I have been using for only a month. Most
of the cookies had cryptic or generic names that indicated nothing
about their purpose or use.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the average surfer can't figure out which
cookies are ``good'' (used only to provide added services to the
user) and which are ``bad'' (used to collect personal information
that will be sold or exchanged with others).
</P>
<P>
   The one piece of information that was easy to decipher was the
``server'' column, which tells you the source of the cookie. While
most were from sites that I remembered visiting, a disturbingly
large number were related to advertising, from banner networks like
Engage, Link4Ads, AdMaximize, DoubleClick, LinkExchange and
Advertising.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt the information-gathering power of these networks,
just visit their sites and see what they promise to deliver to
advertisers. After all, advertisers want proof that their ads are
being seen by their target audience, which means you.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, solutions are beginning to emerge that help you fight
back against the data collectors without giving up the beneficial
aspects of site personalization. There are two basic approaches to
the problem. The more limited one focuses on cookies, letting you
choose which ones to accept or deny. These usually distinguish
between cookies from ad networks versus site-specific cookies, so
you can routinely block the former without affecting the latter.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PRIVACY1 (53742 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  For the truly paranoid, or those whose work demands utmost
secrecy, there is also a class of anonymous proxy servers that
basically intercept all Net traffic to and from your computer,
making sure that none can be traced back to you (unless you allow
it).
</P>
<P>
   This broad cloak covers e-mail, chat and Internet newsgroups, as
well as surfing. Most consumer-friendly proxy servers involve fees,
but, in a strange twist, a new class of ad-supported opt-in servers
is also emerging.
</P>
<P>
   While an ad-supported proxy server devoted to preserving privacy
might seem like a contradiction in terms, it can actually offer
many benefits to both user and advertiser. The user is assured that
all personal data will be aggregated with other users' before being
sent to advertisers, while ad networks can still provide targeted
advertising of interest to the user.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the options? In the cookie-control category, there
are six major commercial packages, half of them free: AdSubtract
Pro, IDcide Privacy Companion, McAfee Internet Guard Dog, Norton
Internet Security, PC Magazine's CookieCop and Siemens' WebWasher.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a number of shareware products, but most of these
are out-of-date. In this fast-changing and complex area, you are
probably better off with a commercial solution.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine's CookieCop is a free program that does exactly what
it sounds like: It notifies you of all cookies and lets you accept
or reject them by site. It works with most browsers, and a new Plus
version adds the ability to block certain Web sites and graphics.
While it works fine, it can be tedious to respond to every cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens' WebWasher is another free program with a different
focus. It cleans up your browser and system files after each
browsing session, clearing out the cache, cookies, history, forms
data and more, leaving no trace of your surfing. You can designate
certain cookies as keepers, if you want to remember a few trusted
sites. It works with most browsers and is the only cookie-cleaner
on our list to support Mac and Linux as well as Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec's Norton Internet Security and McAfee's Internet Guard
Dog take a bigger bite out of the cookie and Web security problem.
NIS' cookie-control options include blanket ad blocking, which gets
rid of both ads and their cookies, and the ability to designate
certain personal info that may not be transmitted to unsecured
sites. NIS includes many additional features, such as virus
control, a firewall, and child-safe site blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Guard Dog is a similar complete utility that
incorporates ad blocking, McAfee's VirusScan software, file
encryption and password storage.
</P>
<P>
   McAfee also touts the program's ability to filter Internet
Messenger and chat room streams for objectionable words or personal
data. Settings for both NIS and Guard Dog can also be configured
for multiple users, a big convenience.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PRIVACY1 (53742 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But our favorite cookie-cutters were IDcide Privacy Companion and
AdSubtract Pro, both applications devoted specifically to cookie
management that do the best job of combining control and ease of
use.
</P>
<P>
   AdSubtract Pro intercepts both ads and cookies, and you can
configure it to block them from all sites or only from some sites.
Ad-blocking means faster page downloads, a nice side effect. It can
also block things like pop-up windows, animations and background
music, further conserving bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   IDcide's Privacy Companion is a new entry with some powerful
features. It can distinguish between ``local'' cookies and
third-party cookies like those from ad networks and automatically
ban the latter. This is great because many sites you want to
personalize and allow cookies from also have hidden ad network
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   The other cool feature of IDcide is that it puts little icons in
the corner of your browser that show you instantly when you're
being tracked. Privacy Companion is free _ IDcide hopes to make
money from sites that want to cater to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the anonymous proxy server category, we have Anonymizer,
Junkbusters, Privada and Freedom. Junkbusters is a free download
that hopes to make money from advertisers. It allows users to
specify what information may be transmitted to whom, in an
``opt-in'' approach. It can block cookies, graphics and other types
of data, from all sites, allowing in only those from trusted
sources. It works a lot like the cookie-cutters listed above (which
are also really proxy servers under the hood).
</P>
<P>
   Anonymizer goes a step further, with total blocking of your URL
(so even your ISP can't log you), blocking of ``hostile'' Web-based
programs in Java and JavaScript. Even better, since it's Web-based,
it works with any platform or browser, and there's no software to
install on your computer. You simply configure the proxy server
settings in your Web browser for Anonymizer.
</P>
<P>
   Another entry, Lumeria's SuperProfile.com, will offer a free
cookie and ad-management service next month that relies on opt-in
ad sponsorship. Users can specify what information they want to
give to advertisers, and all such information will be aggregated so
it is not traceable to a specific person.
</P>
<P>
   All ads but Lumeria's will be blocked. Like Anonymizer, it will
be platform-independent. One interesting benefit of the opt-in
advertising model is that it allows local advertising, which should
be of much more interest to consumers than the typical national
banners.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Privada.net and Freedom.net are for the truly devoted
privacy hounds. They let you develop whole online identities
separate from your real-world ones for all Web activities,
including e-mail, chat, and surfing.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of PRIVACY1 (53742 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The big advantage of this approach is that you don't have to
constantly make decisions about cookies, since you are simply not
identifiable anyway. Your online persona has all of your
characteristics and preferences, however, so you can still receive
personalized information. But you won't get any mail or phone calls
to your residence.
</P>
<P>
   Privada's Web Incognito and Messaging Incognito are available
for $5 a month direct, or through certain ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Zero-Knowledge Systems' Freedom.net costs $49.95. Both are now
currently  &LR; available only for the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever cookie-busting program you choose, you will be taking
the first steps toward safeguarding your privacy on the Web.
Several industry and legislative privacy initiatives are also in
the works, notably the advertiser-sponsored Network Advertising
Initiative and the World Wide Web Consortium's Platform for Privacy
project. Hopefully, the need for consumers to constantly monitor
cookies will soon evaporate.

HOW TO KEEP THE ECONOMY BOOMING 
 &HT;     BY CAROLYN SAID
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maintaining and expanding the current economic boom is the
biggest challenge facing the government, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said Wednesday in a luncheon address to financial
analysts and technology executives.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the current prosperity stems from a
fundamentally different ``new economy'' centered on information,
not physical goods, sustaining it will require drawing on
old-fashioned virtues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the next five years crucial, Summers outlined five
``economic imperatives'' during a speech at the Chase H&AMP;Q
Technology Conference, and later expanded on them at a private
meeting with journalists and The Chronicle's editorial board:
</P>
<P>
   Pay off the national debt. The enormously effective performance
of the economy presents the government with a golden opportunity to
reduce publicly held debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do something historic for the future by paying off the
debt before the baby boom generation retires,'' he said, adding
that the government is on track to eliminate it by early in the
next decade. ``We're paying it off faster than we built it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Invest in education. ``The most important investments in an
information age are surely investments in the human brain,''
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pronouncements such as ``kids need classrooms, not
closets,'' and ``we need to make teaching a valued and honored
profession and to attract and reward teachers,'' Summers did not
outline any specific plans for increased education funding,
although he said any increased federal funding for education should
be accompanied by increased accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Expand market size. The government should craft policies, such
as deregulation and international trade expansion, to grow larger
markets, allowing businesses to achieve economies of scale and
generating ``cascading benefits,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his top priority is convincing Congress to grant
China permanent normal trading status. He planned to take a red-eye
flight back to Washington last night to testify on the matter
before the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only vote with a chance of being in the history books
20 years from now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed concerns that the move could reduce U.S. power to
curb human-rights abuses, saying the current policy doesn't have
such an effect. This isn't an issue of ``whether the Chinese
deserve a merit badge,'' it's about what will benefit the U.S.
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it loses the Congressional vote, China will join the
World Trade Organization, allowing Europe and Japan to benefit from
increased trade with the world's most populous nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increase spending on basic science. Innovations built on
progress in basic science ``from group theory to quantum theory''
has driven the economy forward, Summers said. President Clinton's
budget for 2001 calls for the largest-ever public investments in
basic science, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions of the capital markets to funding research and
development are also very important. ``We're the only country in
the world where you can raise your first $100 million before you
buy your first suit, if your idea is good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridge the digital divide. The strong economy in which instead
of people looking for jobs, jobs are looking for people, is
benefiting those who might otherwise be trapped on the sidelines,
he said. Just as access to electricity and running water for all
was paramount decades ago, the challenge now is to ensure access to
telecommunications, information technology and basic financial
services.

COURT ALLOWS SUITS AGAINST ESTABLISHMENTS THAT SERVE DRUNKEN
DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE and ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Supreme Court has ruled that
bars and restaurants can be sued for serving too much alcohol to
patrons who injure and kill in drunken-driving accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-3 ruling radically reshapes how Missouri treats
drunken-driving victims and liquor establishments. The decision
reverses a 1985 state law intended to stop such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine states and Washington, D.C., fare worse than Missouri
in percentages of traffic deaths that are alcohol-related. And
Kansas City leads Missouri in alcohol-related accidents and repeat
drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the ruling was split.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving predicted it would save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for everybody's safety,'' said Lela McDuffy, president of
the Heartland chapter of MADD.
</P>
<P>
   Bar and restaurant owners said the ruling would result in
needless lawsuits and add to the cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I think is that my liability insurance, which
is already high, is going to go up,'' said Bill Nigro, a partner in
the Beaumont Club and owner of Torre's Pizzeria.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's court ruling eliminates a requirement that forbade
victims from suing unless an owner or employee had been convicted
of a misdemeanor for serving an obviously intoxicated person.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors never filed such charges; so civil lawsuits for
injuries or wrongful death could not be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that section of the law created
``arbitrary and unreasonable barriers'' to the courts and
improperly gave prosecutors power over civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision, Maria Kilmer of O'Fallon can proceed with a
wrongful death case against a St. Charles pizza restaurant that
served beer to a drunken driver. Her husband, Tom, was on his way
home from work when he was killed in February 1998. The driver was
convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, James G. Krispin, Kilmer's attorney, praised the
court's ruling as a tool against establishments that serve ``drink
by drink, watching them load up.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Watters, attorney for the restaurant, said he would ask
the Supreme Court to rehear the case. He noted that the split
decision overturned a unanimous 1988 Missouri Supreme Court
decision that had upheld the same law.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling makes Missouri the most liberal state in the United
States for such litigation, Watters said. He noted that many states
do not allow such lawsuits and some limit damages, but Missouri
does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wide open,'' he said. ``Be ready to be sued.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws governing lawsuits against bars and restaurants vary from
state to state. Kansas has no such law, the Kansas Legislative
Research Department said Wednesday. In the past, measures have been
introduced in the Legislature but never passed.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's sudden shift drew strong reactions.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffy said education was the best weapon against drunken
driving, and lawsuits would encourage more establishments to train
servers and promote designated driver programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not going to bring back the people we love,'' McDuffy
said. ``But the bars and restaurants need to take some
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pelzer, executive vice president of the Missouri Restaurant
Association, called the decision ``poor public policy'' and said
the association was researching ``appropriate actions and
remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City club and restaurant owners said they watch for those
who have had too much to drink, but that can be hard when the only
thing they hear from a customer is, ``Bud Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigro said most clubs work at being responsible, training staffs
to watch for those who have had too much to drink, but they don't
individually serve every drinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get 1,200 people in the Beaumont. You may get a
big group and one person will say, `Give me five Buds and three
shots' and take it back to the table. That can happen all night
long,'' Nigro said. ``We have cut people off when we think they
have had too much. But if you don't interact, there can be times
where people will get intoxicated and leave the club and leave us
open for litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigro added that some patrons bar hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our typical customer has been to one or two, and we may be the
last place they left,'' he said. ``If they create a problem, it
will be that place someone will go after.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a rough ruling for club owners, said Calvin
Shelby, co-owner of Epicurean II at 8625 Troost Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only go by what you see, and some people can be
legally drunk and we can't tell,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can sue, Shelby said, ``and one lawsuit can put you out
of business.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army's inspector general has concluded
that the service's highest-ranking female officer was a victim of
inappropriate sexual advances from another Army general, Defense
Department officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry substantiated the claim of Lt. Gen. Claudia J.
Kennedy, whose career is often cited as an example of the
opportunities for women in uniform, that Gen. Larry G. Smith
touched her inappropriately and tried to kiss her in her office at
the Pentagon in 1996, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The case, the first instance of a sexual harassment case lodged
against one Army general by another, is a serious embarrassment for
the Army, which like the other armed services has been roiled by
sexual scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's allegation proved explosive among senior Army offcers
and resulted in a charge against her _ later dismissed _ of
personal misconduct. The conclusions in the inspector general's
report were first reported in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy filed a formal complaint last August after the Army
announced that Smith had been appointed deputy inspector general.
Officials said she was outraged, since the inspector general's
office is responsible for investigating charges of sexual
harrassment, among other types of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy, the Army's first woman to earn three stars,
did not formally report the 1996 incident for nearly three years,
investigators validated her claim through interviews with friends
and peers with whom she spoke after the event.
</P>
<P>
   An Army spokesman had no immediate comment on the results of the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cautioned that the disciplinary process against Smith
was far from over. The Army inspector general is preparing to send
his findings to the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John Keane,
who must then issue his own finding. Smith then has a right to
rebuttal before the vice chief makes his final report.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who never took over the post as deputy inspector general,
is expected to be forced to retire soon. He is not expected to face
a court-martial because Army officials do not consider that the
incident merits prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who could not be reached for comment late Wednesday
night, joined the Army in 1966 and served three tours in Vietnam as
a cavalry officer. In 1996, at the time he was accused of the
inappropriate advance against Kennedy, he was serving as the
manager of the Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program,
which provided training and equipment to Saudi forces.
</P>
<P>
   While the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael W.
Ackerman, has led the inquiry, the clash between two generals was
deemed sufficiently high-profile to invite oversight by the
Pentagon's inspector general, who may ultimately be called upon to
determine any actions taken against Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 52, is one of only three women in the military who are
three-star officers, out of a total of 116 officers who hold the
rank in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who recently announced that she would retire later this
year, had been deputy chief of staff for intelligence before her
promotion to lieutenant general in May 1997. She joined the Army in
1969, after receiving a bachelor's degree in philosophy from what
is now Rhodes College in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   She advanced in an institution that initially had a separate
women's corp with severely limited opportunities for women. She
eventually took over the command of two military intelligence
battalions, in Germany and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   She has refused to discuss publicly her allegations of sexual
harassment. In interviews after her promotion to lieutenant
general, however, she said she had experienced sexual harassment in
her career. In an interview with ABC News in 1997, she said she had
dealt with the incident ``individually.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing about it is that early in my
career, what I did was I dealt with it individually,'' she said.
``My approach was to turn it over to my boss. And I was very
impressed with the way it was handled.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Pentagon officers have sought to portray the
overwhelmingly male-dominated military as more open than ever to
women, even at the highest ranks, while insisting that sexual
harassment would never be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's case obviously undercut that impression, as did
investigations of two other male generals who were demoted for
having had adulterous affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. John J. Maher 3rd was demoted two ranks and forced to
retire last November after having affairs with the wives of two
subordinate officers. Maj. Gen. David Hale was demoted one rank and
fined after pleading guilty to eight counts of misconduct stemming
from affairs he had with the wives of four subordinate officers.

EDITORIAL: GIULIANI'S TURBULENT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 11:
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began the day Wednesday
with a sensible attempt to clarify his personal and political
future by saying that he and his wife, Donna Hanover, would
separate. But his situation moved into a more strained and more
public phase when Hanover responded with a statement saying that
her efforts to share her husband's public life and save the
marriage had been undermined by his turning to other relationships.
</P>
<P>
   In personal terms, it was a day of high emotion and personal
anguish for Giuliani. In political terms, it was certainly the most
complicated and perhaps the most critical moment of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spoke with commendable candor about his sadness over
the state of his marriage, his determination ``to deal with it
honestly and directly'' and his priorities in meeting an
astonishing confluence of problems. In recent days he has received
news that he has prostrate cancer, publicly acknowledged a close
relationship with a single woman, confirmed long-rumored marital
troubles and seen the future of his Senate candidacy thrown into
uncertainty by his medical situation. Determining his political
course is a ``second, maybe third, maybe fourth'' priority, he
said. Indeed, the public will fully understand that choosing a
treatment for his illness comes ahead of all other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But other issues will continue to press in upon the mayor. Even
before Wednesday's events, in what was widely read as a signal from
the state Republican hierarchy, the majority leader of the state
Senate, Joseph Bruno, called on Giuliani to bring order to his
domestic situation. The subtext of the statement was that GOP
leaders are worried that publicity about Giuliani's personal life
could cripple or even end his candidacy and allow Hillary Rodham
Clinton to win the Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani himself acknowledged that some people will be ``very
angry, very upset'' with him, adding a new element of uncertainty
to an already turbulent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover's statement had a subtext too, with its hints of a
bitter divorce and custody battle and potentially embarrassing
revelations. Her reference to Giuliani's ``relationship with one
staff member'' seemed a threat against the mayor's insistence that
he has maintained a wall between his personal and public lives.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a state that allows its politicians plenty of room, this
combination of medical, personal and political difficulty is
formidable. Giuliani has prided himself on being a mold-breaking
politician with an extraordinary capacity for work. But there is a
limit to the amount of political baggage that any candidate can
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense dictates that Bruno's advice about the campaign is
apt. Giuliani must move as quickly as his health allows to restore
a sense of order to his personal life and to inform voters about
his political future.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal for some confidential space in which to work out his
medical and marital decisions is reasonable. But with the
statements from Giuliani and his wife Wednesday, the issues
surrounding him have become part of the civic discourse. As the
manager of a complicated city and a declared aspirant for national
leadership, Giuliani has an obligation to bring clarity and
stability to a disorderly situation.

<TEXT>
AltaVista, the Palo Alto Web portal, Wednesday became one of the
latest Internet companies to announce layoffs in an effort to
reduce costs.
<P>
   The company said it is laying off about 40 workers, including
ones in Palo Alto, Southern California and Massachusetts. The cuts
will affect a wide range of departments, including marketing, sales
and news, but not any of the executive staff, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes nearly a month after the company
postponed its initial public offering because of the slumping stock
market. Yesterday, the company said the initial public offering is
still on hold pending an improved climate on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``AltaVista is in serious trouble,'' said Rob Enderle, a
technology analyst with Giga Information Group. ``Because of the
delay in the IPO, they're not getting the money they expected and
have to reduce costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Enderle said the layoffs will worry potential investors and
could ``make the company's stock damaged goods.'' He added that
AltaVista may have trouble keeping the employees who remain because
of their fear of being laid off.
</P>
<P>
   David Emanuel, an AltaVista spokesman, said the layoffs are
intended to ``streamline operations'' as part of a goal to make the
company profitable by the end of the year. He added that the
layoffs were also a consequence of the industry's and investors'
new emphasis on cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still very well funded,'' Emanuel said. ``We still have
very ambitious plans.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past year and a half, AltaVista has grown
significantly from its roots as a simple search engine through
several big acquisitions. The company, which trails far behind
competitors like Yahoo and Lycos in traffic, spent hundreds of
millions of dollars buying financial Web site Raging Bull and
Shopping.com, an online retailer.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista's staff expanded accordingly, from 55 in January 1999
to more than 800. Yesterday's layoffs represent a workforce
reduction of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several other large Internet companies have laid off workers
since the beginning of the year. Among them are e-retailers
Amazon.com, Beyond.com and Healthshop.com.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista, owned by the venture capital firm CMGI, laid off an
additional 60 workers between August and March from its
Shopping.com division. But Emanuel said that had more to do with a
change in that division's focus from being an online retailer to a
search engine for shopping on other Web sites.

 COLUMBIA, S.C.: a compromise. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This plan received support across party and racial lines,''
said Hodges, clearly relieved that the support for the plan in the
House did not come entirely from white lawmakers. ``I believe South
Carolinians will join together and embrace this compromise as an
honorable way to resolve this debate once and for all.'' He said he
could not control what the NAACP does, but effusively praised the
three black legislators who supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Six of seven black senators had originally supported the bill,
and one of their leaders, Sen. Darrell Jackson, predicted their
votes would not change once the differences with the House bill
were worked out.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Rutherford, a black House member who opposed the bill,
predicted another debate over the new flag in next year's
legislative session, vowing to propose legislation himself to move
the flagpole away from the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historic occasion, no doubt about that,'' Rutherford
said, after the vote. ``I'm just sorry that something this
momentous has to occur without African-Americans being in the
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill failed to get much black support precisely because it
was designed to win the votes of white Republicans who had
previously refused to even consider a vote on moving the flag. On
Tuesday, Republicans angered black legislators by voting to make
the flag even more prominent, raising it to 30 feet high, from the
20 feet in the Senate bill, and illuminating it at night. Those
changes made it into the final House bill Wednesday night, along
with a provision mandating stiff penalties for anyone who
vandalizes the flag or the monument. (Wednesday morning, officials
had to remove some spray-painted graffiti from the monument.)
</P>
<P>
   The bill also removes the Confederate flags from the House and
Senate chambers, where they have flown next to the United States
and South Carolina flags for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-56 vote came after nearly 10 hours of debate Wednesday
that starkly revealed the deep mistrust and animosity between the
races in the House. Black leaders had hoped to support a plan that
would move the flag from the Confederate memorial, but would also
erect flagpoles bearing military banners to honor soldiers who fell
in four 20th-century wars. Republican leaders would only accept the
plan if it included flying the flag from the dome on Confederate
Memorial Day every year, which by coincidence was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But hardliners on each side found those aspects unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fly that flag for a day, even for an hour, even for a
minute, is unacceptable to us,'' said Rep. Joseph H. Neal, a black
Democrat from Chester, who would have supported the plan if not for
the one-day-a-year provision. ``It is not a sovereign flag, and it
is an insult to people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   White Republicans who want to keep the flag on the dome picked
apart the plan from the other end of the spectrum, criticizing it
for not honoring soldiers in the Revolutionary War, or for being
vague on which flags symbolize certain wars. The Republican
Majority Leader, Rick Quinn, who supported the proposal, said its
chances were hurt when black members compared the Confederate flag
to a swastika, and when a local activist burned the flag in front
of the Capitol shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the flag, which has overshadowed almost every
other policy issue in South Carolina for more than a year, became
so intense because it perfectly embodied the much larger political
gulf between the races in the state, which has persisted since
Reconstruction. Blacks have long felt that they were barely
tolerated as political equals, and saw every reference to
``Southern heritage'' as scarcely hidden nostalgia for the days of
white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   White legislators, on the other hand, believed the flag was a
legitimate expression of honor for ancestors who had died fighting
for the South, and resented being lumped in with the racists and
Klansmen who had expropriated the flag for their own purposes. Many
made it clear they had also chafed over the years at the
encroachment of affirmative action and other social policies sought
by black residents, and considered the flag a last remnant of a
vanishing nobility.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the final hours, the arguments of the House leadership
to move the flag were based on how it was affecting the state's
image and business climate, rather than the moral or historical
problems engendered by the flag's presence atop the seat of state
government. One member complained to the House that South Carolina
had become the butt of jokes on the late-night talk shows, and
Wilkins asked his colleagues to imagine what would happen to the
state if the flag flew for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is hurting our state,'' he said, explaining why he
had changed his position from solidly supporting the flag on the
dome. ``If you reach down deep inside, you'll have to admit that.
And this is the last opportunity we'll get to do something. You may
not get exactly what you want, but it will be in the best interests
of our state.''

   A BOSNIAN BY ANY OTHER NAME
</P>
<P>
   Although aides to Gov. George W. Bush have dismissed as
unimportant the several times he has mangled the proper terms for
people of various nationalities, they were elated by a report
Wednesday that his adversary, Vice President Al Gore, had committed
a similar error.
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, gleefully
broadcast the bulletin that Gore had referred to Bosnians as
Bosniaks. ``It can happen to the best of us,'' Hughes said, ``as I
hope the vice president will concede.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but. As it turns out, Bosniak is an apparently acceptable
alternative, listed in some dictionaries, so Gore spoke correctly.
And Hughes got no more mileage out of the incident than she had
with a disapproving recitation on Tuesday night of Jewish jokes
that the vice president had publicly told. Where was the outrage?
Not among the Bush press corps, whose members were too busy
laughing to be on political-correctness patrol.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BUSH AHEAD IN NEW POLL
</P>
<P>
   The latest national presidential preference poll shows Bush
taking a substantial eight-point lead over Gore, 51 percent to 43
percent. The poll, published Wednesday in The Los Angeles Times,
surveyed 1,211 registered voters, and has a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It was conducted from
May 4 to 7, just about the same time that a poll done for the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press found Bush barely
edging Gore, 46 percent to 45 percent. That poll, conducted May 2
to 6 and covering 940 registered voters, has a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in polls conducted last week in six of the largest
and most politically important states by the American Research
Group of Manchester, N.H., Bush leads Gore by 7 percentage points
in Florida, 47 points in Texas and 3 points in Pennsylvania,
whereas Gore leads by 14 points in California and 20 in New York.
In Illinois, there is a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, according to the latest available state polls, Bush is
ahead in 17 states (good for 183 of the required 270 electoral
votes), and Gore leads in 10 states (good for 146 electoral votes).

   A MESSAGE FROM WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who polls indicate is having difficulty maintaining the
traditional Democratic advantage with women, has been put on notice
by two dozen women's organizations that he needs to work harder to
win women's political allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong session on Tuesday in the Old Executive Office
Building with about 40 leaders of the women's groups, the vice
president was told he needed a better media strategy to convey his
positions on issues like Social Security, paycheck fairness,
domestic violence and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message isn't getting out to women,'' Kim Gandy, executive
vice president of the National Organization for Women, said in an
interview after the meeting. Nancy Zirkin, a spokeswoman for the
American Association of University Women, said the meeting was
requested four months ago, on a nonpartisan basis, so the women
could hold a general discussion with Gore about their concerns. She
said the request was not prompted by the vice president's lag in
the polls or growing polling evidence that the Democratic
candidates' edge with women was beginning to erode.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was accompanied at the meeting by Donna Brazile, his
campaign manager; Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services, and Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor,
agreed to additional meetings. Brazile suggested after the meeting
that the women's groups could help him get out his message. ``But
we're not in any trouble with women voters,'' she insisted. &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM GIULIANI'S PRESS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following are excerpts from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
news conference in Bryant Park on Wednesday, in which he discussed
his marriage to Donna Hanover and his relationship with Judith
Nathan, whom he has called a ``very good friend.'' The remarks were
recorded by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayor's Comments
</P>
<P>
   This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably
been apparent that Donna and I lead, in many ways, independent and
separate lives. It's been a very painful road and I'm hopeful that
we'll be able to formalize that in a, in an agreement that protects
our children, gives them all the security and all the protection
they deserve, and protects Donna.
</P>
<P>
   And that's something we have to work out and we have to strive
toward and _ you know, I'm a public person, I'm elected to public
office. I do my job, I think, honestly and effectively and as well
as I can. And I, you know, I realize that my private life is open
to everyone. I just watch what's going on and I just wish that
you'd maybe respect it a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   But in any event, you know, we'll do the best that we can to
make the decisions that we have to make that are, that are
consistent with our own lives and our children. But I don't think
I'm saying anything that you haven't, that you haven't all written,
that over the course of some period of time in many ways we've
grown to live independent and separate lives, and we should
probably strive toward formalizing that.
</P>
<P>
   Questions and Answers
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is that a legal separation, Mr. Mayor?
</P>
<P>
   GIULIANI. I _ I would _ I really don't want to go into, any more
than I want to go into the great details of, you know, what one
doctor said to me or what another doctor said to me, I don't want
to get into that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would she move out of Gracie Mansion?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nobody, nobody, nobody is, nobody is moving anywhere.
Everybody is secure and safe. What I said is that we should try to
work out a separation agreement. That's different. . . . What I
said is what I said, a separation agreement; it's not a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. Mayor, are you at all motivated by the . . .
</P>
<P>
   A. And I should say _ no. I'm motivated by all of the tremendous
invasion of privacy that's taken place in everyone's life, my
family's, Judith Nathan's family's. This is something, this is
something that has developed over some period of time and it's
something between Donna and me, not anyone else, and really not
even the whole world, just between Donna and me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. . . . concerned about a backlash?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, you know, I don't really care about politics right now. I
don't. I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and
what's, what can be done that's honest and truthful and that
protects them the best.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not thinking about politics. I'm not; politics comes at
least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all
work itself out some way, politically. I'm hoping that if I, maybe
if I say something, I mean, some of the things that the news
organizations are doing, horrendous. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you still running for the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   A. It has nothing to do with the Senate. It has something to do
with the fact that there's a tremendous amount of intense scrutiny,
and I felt I had to say at least something that explains it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has the media caused damage to . . .
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course this is damaging and painful and very, very
difficult for everyone. . . . But you have to deal with it honestly
and directly. You can't, you can't pretend or hide.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has the media caused the damage?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. The media makes the damage much worse; it didn't cause
the damage. I take responsibility for everything that I've done.
And you have every right to ask me, and then I have a right to
answer or not answer. And that's the way I think we can have a
respectful relationship with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the . . . is that affecting your . . . Senate race?
</P>
<P>
   A. I haven't thought about it yet in that context. Maybe I will.
I've been thinking about it more in the health context. Judith
Nathan is a very, very fine person. She's been a very good friend
to me before I had to deal with the decisions that I have to make
about my illness and what to do about it, and I rely on her and she
helps me a great deal. And I'm going to need her more now than
maybe I did before. These are decisions I have to make, you know,
at a very difficult time, so __
</P>
<P>
   Q. She has been more supportive of you than Ms. Hanover? . . .
</P>
<P>
   A. I, my, Donna Hanover is a wonderful woman. And she's a
wonderful mother. She's someone that I respect tremendously. The
fact that we've grown independent, we've grown more separate over
the years; who knows why those things happen? But she is a very,
very fine, wonderful person, and she's a, extraordinary mother and
I have tremendous respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your emotional . . . right now?
</P>
<P>
   A. My emotional state is, I'm very sad. And I feel terrible. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does your wife agree with you?
</P>
<P>
   A. My wife speaks for herself, as you know. She made a statement
the other day and she'll, she has her right to whatever she wants
to say, and Donna, Donna is an independent person and I respect her
for that. And there are obviously going to be things that we
disagree about, but __
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any chance that you might resign from office?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, there's no chance.

A TEAM OF TWO WHO BY NOW THINK AS ONE  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Juliet Taylor has helped
Woody Allen cast 26 movies, including his latest, ``Small Time
Crooks,'' opening on Friday. Since the actors Allen hires regularly
receive Oscar nominations, The New York Times invited him and
Taylor to discuss the process they use in casting his films. They
met at the Park Avenue offices of his production company, and, in
between compliments, talked about their 25-year association.
Excerpts from the taped conversation follow.
<TEXT>
<P>
   JULIET TAYLOR: Often before Woody's written a script, he'll
telephone me and talk about the idea with an eye to who might be
cast.
</P>
<P>
   WOODY ALLEN: Usually I try not to write in anything to influence
you _ so you read the script without any idea, for the most part,
who I had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: But you never alter the making of a film for an actor,
which is unusual. Most directors will say, ``Oh gosh, if I can get
so-and-so, I'll do it a year from this January.'' But you'll roll
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Because the films are not based on an actor agreeing. I
might wait if an actor said, ``Four weeks later I'll be
available.'' But to wait for an actor who says, ``I can't do it
this year'' _ I don't have any interest in that.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Except many directors do. And if you wanted the
absolutely perfect cast, you could do that. But I always think it's
kind of confident and interesting that you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: If I can get the perfect person within reason, that's
fine. If not, I make do. Because you can always ask yourself, you
know, what if this actor or that actress gets hit by a truck? Are
you not going to make the picture?
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: I also thought that you didn't want to get sucked into
the whole ritual of centering your movie around an actor because
then there are so many other people determining the future of your
movie. I always think you're sort of resistant to someone else
setting up your timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: And it's just good luck that my films have always been
financed completely irrespective of who was in them. So many
directors I know, their whole film is predicated on getting
such-and-such an actor or actress _ only then do they get the
financing. But I've never had that problem. So I'm casting for the
best person that I can cast. And if the best person is a complete
unknown with no track record, that's fine. If the best person is a
big star, that's also fine.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Don't you think we're thinking ahead a little bit more
than we used to in the old days?
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: I think I've gotten to a point with you of trying to
alert you, because there have been times when you warned me,
``Look, you're going to shoot in the fall and there are a lot of
films going.'' And so if I have an idea as I'm writing that would
be great for a particular person, I don't mind telling you. And you
can get some idea whether he or she is busy or leaving the country
or would have any interest in working for no money. You know, there
are a lot of restrictions working with me. There's not a lot of
money to be made _
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: But actors love to work with you.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Some do, but as you know, we've had our share of
turndowns _
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Yeah, there are times when people have turned us down.
But the track record is so great. Because they all look so
wonderful in your movies.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: If they look good it's because the parts are often a good
fit. Even if the movie stinks and I mess up in every way, their
parts are good for them. I mean, they're not asked just to drive
cars or do stunts or special effects or moronic, infantile jokes.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: But not only do you write great characters, you always
show everybody's best performance.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Well, I let them have a lot to say about it. I have a lot
of faith in the instinct of the actors. And if you encourage them
to be creative, they do a lot of great things that I wind up
getting credit for. It's really them making me look good in the
end.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Another thing that's really worked out well _ although
they'd love to be making billions of dollars _ is that our money is
uniform. Everybody gets the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Yes. They get practically nothing.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: But at least everybody's getting nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Right. If people want to work with me, it's for reasons
other than money. And I also have to be lucky, as you know. If
they're coming off a $10 million payday and looking forward to
another $10 million payday and they've got eight weeks free__
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: It's true _ catching them at the right moment. And also
sometimes we try to work dates out so that they can then go make
some blockbuster afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Right, whatever accommodations we can make for them, we
try and make. With the exception of postponing the picture. We
break our neck to accommodate them because they're accommodating us
by working for a tiny fraction of what they're worth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: And more often than not I say, ``I never heard of that
person.'' Because Juliet keeps abreast of everybody in television,
everybody on Broadway and Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway, and I
don't at all. So when I hand her a script and there are, let's say,
10 major parts, she'll give me a very substantial list of viable
possibilities for each part. And some of the people I'll know
because everybody knows them. And lots of the people I've never
heard of.
</P>
<P>
   I can think of two times very vividly that I wrote a script and
gave it to you _ one was ``Interiors,'' when you introduced me to
Mary Beth Hurt, and she was just on the way up, and Juliet thought
she'd be great. And the second she walked into the room, it was on
the nose. I mean, she didn't have to speak. It was just absolutely
perfect. And that was also true of Chazz Palminteri, with ``Bullets
Over Broadway.'' ``A Bronx Tale'' hadn't come out, and I'd never
heard of him. And the second he walked in this door, it was what I
had written _ what I was thinking of without knowing he existed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are times she will suggest very well-known people.
When we were casting ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' you mentioned Max
von Sydow, you know, just speculating _ we throw names out for
hours sometimes. And the second Juliet mentioned him, it stopped
right there. It was just, ``Let's get him.''
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: It's not always that easy to get you to use new people.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: No, I know.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: That's an ongoing battle. But you're getting better and
better.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Juliet's been pushing new people on me for years. I don't
like any kind of change. So if I've worked with a person
successfully, I like to work with that person again. And I don't
like to meet people. I don't like casting at all. I don't like the
process. I sit in this room and people come in here and we give
them something to read, sometimes we'll just talk to them. And I
find the whole thing nerve-racking and unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: When I first met Woody, I was the assistant to Marion
Dougherty, who was casting ``Bananas.'' And back then, you didn't
even conduct your own interviews. You sat in a chair in the corner
of the room and your producer talked to the actors. Do you
remember?
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: You were so uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: After years I had to give in. But I have nothing to say
to them. When they come into the room, they often get the
impression that it's not going well because it's so quick. But all
I want to do is meet them briefly.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Woody thinks, ``They'll be thrilled that I'm only going
to take a minute of their time.'' And they all want to sit down and
really get to know him.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: And I don't like to do that. I don't learn anything by
it. Juliet is always saying: ``This next person just won a Tony and
she's a big deal. Please ask her to sit down for a minute.'' But
usually I shake hands with them and the casting lasts 35 seconds,
40 seconds. I tell them we're doing a movie and Juliet thought
they'd be right for something, and I just wanted to look at them.
Every now and then we will read somebody.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: More and more.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Yeah, we never used to read anyone at all. And Juliet's
prevailed on me. I always find that really uncomfortable, and I'm
sure they hate it.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: When we were in London working on ``Mighty Aphrodite,''
I would say to Woody, ``You have to let this next person have a
little bit of a visit, because he's a knight.'' And he said, ``OK,
only the knights can sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: I mean, I just don't know what to say to them or do with
them. It's awkward for me and I probably communicate that
awkwardness to the actors. And that's the last thing in the world I
want to communicate to them. All we're looking for is someone who
strikes me as the right type for the part.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Woody, more than anyone I've ever worked with, works off
an initial response to an actor. It's like what you said about Mary
Beth a minute ago, when somebody walks in the room, before they've
even opened their mouth, you distinctly know whether you feel
they're right.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Yes, because don't forget I'm the author of the script.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: You go on that instinct more than most people I've
worked with.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Well, for me it's a wonderful thing, when you send in
someone who's, you know, perfect. I find it's easier to get what I
want from a guy who's 90 percent right as the character and can act
a little than from a guy who's not as right and who's a great
actor.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: So as a result, sometimes we slip over into the other
area, which is somebody who has a great quality for it, but really
has very little acting experience. ``Stardust Memories'' was full
of people who had either funny looks or interesting qualities, but
really weren't very experienced actors.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Yeah, movie acting is different from stage acting. Some
of those people wouldn't last three minutes on a stage, because
they have no craft and no authority. But if they've got to do a
scene in a movie, they're absolutely great. Then they go back to
their lives as lawyers or short-order cooks or whatever. And I've
also met actors who have very impressive credentials _ and they're
no good. I don't care how many Broadway plays they're in or how
often they're nominated _ when I go to the movies, I and my friends
don't buy them.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: It's true. And I think you have good antennae. We
usually agree, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: I do..
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: It's been over 25 years _ I really understand Woody's
tastes, I guess. But you're definitely more scrutinizing about who
you think is good than the rest of the film business.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: On who I think is good?
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Who you're interested in. Often the stars everyone else
is trying to get you'll have no interest in.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: But this is true in any job, whether actors or film
directors or doctors or policemen. There are a few good ones, most
are mediocre and there are a number of bad ones. There are a few
really fine actors and actresses _ people you'll make a point of
going to see every time they do a movie.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Do you want to say who?
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Well, I've never missed anything that Marlon Brando's
done in my life, because the force of his acting was _ and is _ so
special, so amazing. It reinvented acting. I mean, his contribution
to my lifetime of theater and films is stupendous, beyond the
contribution of most playwrights, most of the directors, and all of
the actors.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: But you have never tried to cast him.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: No, but only because there's never been anything he would
be right for. I'm sure I would be intimidated. You know, I'm often
very intimidated by many of the people I've cast over the years.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: But you don't cast people you think will be difficult to
work with. You like people who are going to be nice, and we go
through a big ritual of checking people out.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: We do put time into it. But there again, I'm not a
dedicated artist in the sense that I must have the right person if
that right person is a pain in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Except that in other areas you are less reasonable _
like lighting. You don't like to shoot in the sun _ those things
you don't let go.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Some things bother me more. If I'm shooting in the sun,
it's just so depressing when I look at the dailies _ they're so
ugly if the weather's not right. But in the casting, you know, if I
don't get the perfect actor, we still get somebody who's good. I
don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but there have been times
when we've settled. It hasn't been often. But there will be
somebody on Juliet's list and I'll say, ``No way.'' And eight weeks
later, with no other prospects, I'm suddenly praying he or she is
available. And sometimes someone is just all right, you know, and I
don't have the patience to go any further.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Sometimes it's the other way around. I'll think we have
it and he'll say, ``No.'' Not often.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Right. But usually I don't have the patience you have
with the whole process. I like to keep it moving, you know _ cast
it, shoot it, edit it, get on to the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The single most outstanding thing that I notice when I'm casting
is that actors or actresses will come in and be very charming and
natural and speak just like we're speaking here. And then you give
them something to read and they lapse into their acting mode.
Suddenly they're not speaking like any human being you know. And of
course, I never hire them.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: But I think _ and this is true with every audition, not
just auditioning for you _ they come in here and they want to
impress you in a short amount of time; and people will often do too
much, even though they're told by everyone: ``Just keep it natural.
This is his style.'' Or sometimes because it's you, they push the
humor too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: It's interesting that doing too much is the universal ill
of making a movie. So the actor will do too much. And a costume
designer will have his equivalent or her equivalent. And the scenic
designer. And the cameraman. Doing too much is a very common trap.
They feel they're not doing enough if they just do a normal,
graceful amount.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Don't you think, though, that actors who are really
gifted have an ear for that, they can't hit a false note?
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: I've seen many pictures with Michael Caine over the years
_ great pictures, mediocre pictures. I've never seen him hit a
false note. Liam Neeson is a guy who is pitch-perfect. He reads any
line, whether he's Schindler or somebody else, and it sounds like a
human being talking.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: And that's really what the gift is. You have that or you
don't, I think.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Gene Hackman. Some of these people are just amazing. Now
Geraldine Page, who was an enormous actress, didn't have that
particular odd skill. She was a genius, but you had to watch her.
You had to say ``do less'' or ``take it easy.'' And she was as
great as they come.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: There are people who said that about Olivier, too.
Right? He had those moments where he got a little hammy.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Very often. And he was a genius actor. But there are
certain ones that just are real. And that's some kind of gift _
being natural on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: It's amazing when you read actors and they do that. You
just melt. ALLEN: Yeah. Do you remember how we felt, for instance,
when Edward Norton came in for ``Everyone Says I Love You''?
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: Yes. Good example.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Again, Juliet had heard of him, I never had. And we had
heard the part read 15 times or something. And he came in, and _
there it is! All of a sudden it was alive. And it wasn't fancy. I
almost always look for people that are real, unless we've decided
at the beginning that we want to go for a clear-cut bravura-type
performance. So we cast Mia [Farrow) to play in ``Broadway Danny
Rose,'' to play a character that no way in the world is anything
like her. And the pleasure for the audience, partially, comes from
watching a good actress stretch herself, bring something off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' was no problem because it was a broad
comedy _
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: And Woody was starring in it.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: And for me that was the easiest way to do it. So we had
to find funny women. And I, of course, was intimidated because I
was working with Elaine May and Tracey Ullman, these two comic
genuises.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: It gave us a chance to use people we like and have
wanted to use. We've always wanted to use Elaine May.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Right. Because the criterion is that they have to be, you
know, funny people.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR: You know, one thing we didn't mention in terms of the
process, which is pertinent in this case, is that because I've been
working for Woody for so long, we spend a huge amount of time
talking about actors before we even start seeing people. There are
so many people Woody's used over the years that there's a whole
pool _ and he likes the idea that we might cast a movie, literally,
from the sofa in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN: Yeah, so I'd never have to meet anybody.
</P>

S.C. HOUSE VOTES TO REMOVE CONFEDERATE FLAG FROM CAPITOL DOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Combines takes, moves vote total up to 2nd graf.) By DAVID
FIRESTONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The battle flag of the Confederacy, which has
divided South Carolina from its perch atop the statehouse since
1962, will come off the dome on July 1, under a tentative
compromise reached late Wednesday night by the state House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which the House passed 63-56, has already been
approved with minor differences by the Senate. It calls for a
smaller, square version of the flag to be placed on a flagpole near
the front of the Capitol, adjacent to a Confederate soldiers'
memorial. House leaders and senators predicted few difficulties in
ironing out the differences, and Gov. Jim Hodges has said he will
sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill will by no means end the racial acrimony that
created such pressure for a compromise in the first place. Only
three of 26 black members of the House voted for the bill, and many
denounced it furiously as a plan that would make the flag an even
more prominent feature of the state's official landscape. The
NAACP, which since last summer has been conducting a national
economic boycott of the state to get the flag removed, has said the
plan is unacceptable, and has vowed to continue the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Once the flag comes off the dome and out of the spotlight,
however, it is unclear how effective the boycott, which has hurt
the state's tourism industry, will be. The NAACP had originally
said the boycott would continue until the flag was lowered from the
dome, and its opponents are now accusing it of changing its goals
because the group was not a participant in the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the flag's longtime supporters said the move was a
historic step forward for the state, which saw its reputation
severely tarnished by the flag's presence in such a prominent
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for our state, a giant step
forward,'' said David Wilkins, the speaker of the House, who had
pushed hard for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan received support across party and racial lines,''
said Hodges, clearly relieved that the support for the plan in the
House did not come entirely from white lawmakers. ``I believe South
Carolinians will join together and embrace this compromise as an
honorable way to resolve this debate once and for all.'' He said he
could not control what the NAACP does, but effusively praised the
three black legislators who supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Six of seven black senators had originally supported the bill,
and one of their leaders, Sen. Darrell Jackson, predicted their
votes would not change once the differences with the House bill
were worked out.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. J. Todd Rutherford, a black House member who opposed
the bill, predicted another debate over the new flag in next year's
legislative session, vowing to propose legislation himself to move
the flagpole away from the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historic occasion, no doubt about that,'' Rutherford
said, after the vote. ``I'm just sorry that something this
momentous has to occur without African-Americans being in the
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill failed to get much black support precisely because it
was designed to win the votes of white Republicans who had
previously refused to even consider a vote on moving the flag. On
Tuesday, Republicans angered black legislators by voting to make
the flag even more prominent, raising it to 30 feet high, from the
20 feet in the Senate bill, and illuminating it at night. Those
changes made it into the final House bill Wednesday night, along
with a provision mandating stiff penalties for anyone who
vandalizes the flag or the monument. (Wednesday morning, officials
had to remove some spray-painted graffiti from the monument.)
</P>
<P>
   The bill also removes the Confederate flags from the House and
Senate chambers, where they have flown next to the United States
and South Carolina flags for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Wednesday came after nearly 10 hours of debate that
starkly revealed the deep mistrust and animosity between the races
in the House. Black leaders had hoped to support a plan that would
move the flag from the Confederate memorial, but would also erect
flagpoles bearing military banners to honor soldiers who fell in
four 20th-century wars. Republican leaders would only accept the
plan if it included flying the flag from the dome on Confederate
Memorial Day every year, which by coincidence was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But hardliners on each side found those aspects unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fly that flag for a day, even for an hour, even for a
minute, is unacceptable to us,'' said Rep. Joseph H. Neal, a black
Democrat from Chester, who would have supported the plan if not for
the one-day-a-year provision. ``It is not a sovereign flag, and it
is an insult to people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   White Republicans who want to keep the flag on the dome picked
apart the plan from the other end of the spectrum, criticizing it
for not honoring soldiers in the Revolutionary War, or for being
vague on which flags symbolize certain wars. The Republican
Majority Leader, Rick Quinn, who supported the proposal, said its
chances were hurt when black members compared the Confederate flag
to a swastika, and when a protester burned the flag in front of the
Capitol shortly after noon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The struggle over the flag, which has overshadowed almost every
other policy issue in South Carolina for more than a year, became
so intense because it perfectly embodied the much larger political
gulf between the races in the state, which has persisted since
Reconstruction. Blacks have long felt that they were barely
tolerated as political equals, and saw every reference to
``Southern heritage'' as scarcely hidden nostalgia for the days of
white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   White legislators, on the other hand, believed the flag was a
legitimate expression of honor for ancestors who had died fighting
for the South, and resented being lumped in with the racists and
Klansmen who had expropriated the flag for their own purposes. Many
made it clear they had also chafed over the years at the
encroachment of affirmative action and other social policies sought
by black residents, and considered the flag a last remnant of a
vanishing nobility.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the final hours, the arguments of the House leadership
to move the flag were based on how it was affecting the state's
image and business climate, rather than the moral or historical
problems engendered by the flag's presence atop the seat of state
government. One member complained to the House that South Carolina
had become the butt of jokes on the late-night talk shows, and
Wilkins asked his colleagues to imagine what would happen to the
state if the flag flew for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is hurting our state,'' he said, explaining why he
had changed his position from solidly supporting the flag on the
dome. ``If you reach down deep inside, you'll have to admit that.
And this is the last opportunity we'll get to do something. You may
not get exactly what you want, but it will be in the best interests
of our state.''

THE HEAT IS SHRINKING THE KNICKS' BIG GUARDS
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were supposed to be the stars of this series, the tag-team
scorers who would allow the New York Knicks to overcome Alonzo
Mourning's superiority to Patrick Ewing and whatever offensive
exploits Jamal Mashburn could muster. But in the first two games of
the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Miami Heat, Latrell
Sprewell and Allan Houston have gained more notice for their
struggles than for their skills.
</P>
<P>
   They are shooting the ball like role players known for defense
and hustle, voiding much of the advantage in athleticism that makes
the Knicks the finer team. Just six of Sprewell's 25 attempts have
fallen through the net, a 24 percent clip that has left him
averaging 11 points a game. And Houston nullified the 21 points he
scored in the Knicks' Game 1 loss by committing three turnovers in
the final three minutes, then followed that by shooting 3 for 14 on
Tuesday in the Knicks' Game 2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with their two leading weapons shrinking beneath the fire
of the oppressive Heat defense, the Knicks will enter Friday
night's Game 3 at Madison Square Garden with one victory and a
pilfered home-court advantage. How's that? The Knicks would have
you believe that, in a testament to their great depth, other
players came through in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Latrell and I are leading the team in scoring,
that doesn't mean we don't have guys that are capable, as Charlie
proved last night,'' Houston said, referring to Charlie Ward.
``We're fortunate enough to have a team where we don't have to
score 30 points every night.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Ward's 13-point performance was exceptional, it was,
after all, only 13 points. Even with Ward, their oft-criticized
point guard, playing above himself, the Knicks shot just 35
percent, managed only 10 assists and scored just 82 points.
</P>
<P>
   More than a confirmation of the Knicks' depth, Tuesday's 82-76
victory was evidence of their outstanding defense as well as
Miami's offensive paralysis and horrendous foul shooting (19 for
33). If the Heat had shot well from the line, the Knicks might be
staring at a 2-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' defense should remain constant, but it is unlikely
that Miami will shoot 57 percent from the foul line again. So
unless they are counting on Ward leading them in scoring every
night, the Knicks need Sprewell and Houston to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when me and Spree don't play well, we don't do very
well as a team,'' Houston said after Tuesday's game. ``This night
was out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an extraordinary defensive scheme that has kept
Sprewell and Houston down. First, Miami's perimeter defenders are
playing them tenaciously. Mashburn has used his 6-foot-8-inch,
240-pound frame to bump the slight Sprewell and keep him from
backing toward the basket, eliminating a key part of Sprewell's
arsenal. And the burly Dan Majerle and the wiry Bruce Bowen have
smothered Houston, who is used to playing against smaller shooting
guards. Majerle has used his huge arms to knock Houston out of his
groove, and Bowen is long enough and moves well enough to swarm
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give them credit, they've done a good job, not
just on team defense, but individually,'' Chris Childs said of the
Heat guards. ``Majerle don't get enough respect. He's a heck of a
defensive player. They let him grab and hold, and he does whatever
he can to stop those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Sprewell can blow past the slower Mashburn, and
Houston can easily beat Majerle off the dribble. But after one
bounce of the ball, one or two Heat defenders fly in to help their
teammate. That has often left Sprewell and Houston surrounded by
the opposition and staring at the menacing Mourning or the athletic
P.J. Brown once they break into the paint. Mourning, the league's
shot-block leader, rejected four shots on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that they do better than Toronto is that
they make it difficult on you when you get past one guy,'' said
Sprewell, who ran roughshod over Toronto's defense in the first two
games of their first-round series. ``They have Zo in there and more
size. And it's not just one guy. They've got four or five guys in
that paint area. They do a good job of clogging that area up.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston said: ``We're still going to attack. I don't care
whether I get my shot blocked three or four times. Alonzo's the
leading shot-blocker, but you can't get discouraged if he blocks a
shot. That's like someone getting discouraged if I make a jump
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   With Heat players sprinting at him at every turn, Sprewell, who
at times was double-teamed in the corner, was afforded no breathing
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Riley was out there, too,'' Childs said, referring to
Miami coach Pat Riley. Unlike Houston, who had his moments in Game
1, Sprewell has been in an offensive dry spell since the final game
of the Toronto series, scoring 11 points in each of the past three
contests. Double-teamed much of the time, he has shot 28 percent
(10 for 36) over that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get more transition buckets,'' Childs said,
presenting a solution to the struggles of Sprewell and Houston.
``We've got to get those guys down the floor before the defense can
set up, because once they set up they're focused on taking the ball
out of those guys hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell said he was not bothered by his slump. ``Because we've
won two of those games, and we had a shot at winning the other,''
Sprewell said. ``It's not about what I can do individually. We'd
all love to go out and play as well as we could every night, but
reality is that it's not going to be that way all the time. So you
just have to deal with it and not get your head down and remember
what the ultimate goal is _ winning a championship.''

WOMAN, 24, SHOT TO DEATH NEAR HER HOME IN QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 24-year-old Japanese woman who worked as a music
promoter was fatally shot early Wednesday morning as she walked
home on a quiet Queens street, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Ryoko Chosa, who was from Nagano, Japan, was found
about 3:15 a.m. on the sidewalk outside 87-59 52nd Ave. in
Elmhurst, about a block from her home, police said. Chosa was found
after several neighbors were awakened by gunshots and called the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman, who had majored in Spanish and Latin American
affairs and, according to one of her professors, had hoped to work
as a translator at the United Nations, had been shot in the face,
the neck and the stomach, police said. She was taken to Elmhurst
General Hospital, where she died about 5 a.m., the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Chosa's killer left behind her watch and her large black purse
containing her wallet, and police detectives said they were unsure
of the motive for the killing. ``We're seeking to determine if
robbery was the motive or if the young woman was killed by someone
known to her,'' said Richard Brown, the Queens district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from the 110th Precinct and the Queens Homicide
Squad, who are investigating the killing, spoke with the woman's
family in Japan, who said they did not know whether Chosa had been
seeing anyone, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   The murder shattered the calm of the middle-class neighborhood
of three-story brick row houses and single-family homes, where many
Asian families live. Jee Choe, 20, said that he and his girlfriend
moved to the neighborhood because they thought it was safe, but
that now they were not so sure. ``It worries me now, especially for
my girlfriend, that something like this could happen around here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chosa had worked since December for YWA Music in Soho, where her
responsibilities included helping to promote Japanese bands in
Latin America and in the United States, the authorities said. Calls
to the office were not returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated in April 1999 from Flagler College, a small
liberal arts school in St. Augustine, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   An energetic and dedicated student with a ready smile, she
impressed her teachers and classmates because she had to study
twice as hard as some of her peers to master English so that she
could then master Spanish, said a spokeswoman for the school,
Laurin Bosse.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dawn Wiles, the head of the college's Spanish language/Latin
American studies department, said in a statement issued by Bosse,
``I think that anybody who knew her admired her so much because she
undertook such a difficult program of studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Chosa had spent the evening before she was killed at the
Limelight, a nightclub in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She lived in a room on the second floor of a small house around
the corner from where she was killed, police said. The house was
divided into five rooms that shared a kitchen and a bathroom, and
most of the residents were Japanese, the authorities said.

ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN 18 STATES SEEK CHANGES IN BOXING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of attorneys general from 18 states called Wednesday for
wide reforms of boxing, including independent polls to rank
fighters and limits on a single judge's power to skew a fight's
result.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, including those from big-fight states like
Nevada, New Jersey and New York, issued their 60-page report after
more than a year of interviews with people in boxing. The attorneys
general pledged to push athletic commissions in their states to
adopt the measures.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York, the chairman of
the committee, said the next step would be to persuade broadcasters
and pay-per-view companies to honor an independent writers' poll
rather than relying on rankings by the three main sanctioning
bodies, which have been shown to be arbitrary at best and corrupt
in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said if broadcasters ignored the sanctioning
organizations, it would break an ``unholy alliance'' between
ratings officials and promoters, who he said manipulate rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we will have stripped the sanctioning bodies of their
power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also called for new rules to protect the health of
boxers, including guidelines for weight loss and a rule requiring
the final weigh-in to be the day of the fight rather than the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The career of the welterweight Joey Gamache was ended at New
York's Madison Square Garden recently after Arturo Gatti, who
gained 19 pounds between the weigh-in and the fight, knocked him
out and caused brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also recommended standardized testing for judges,
referees and ring physicians, and standardized contracts between
boxers and managers that would disclose all financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general urged the adoption of a consensus scoring
system. Under such a system, if three judges cannot agree on a
round then the aberrant score is thrown out. Such a system would
have given Lennox Lewis the victory in the widely criticized
championship fight last year that ended in a draw between him and
Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   While the recommendations, if put into effect in all 18 states,
could be a giant step toward cleaning up boxing, Spitzer said
national legislation was still needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fights can always migrate to states with less restrictive
laws,'' he said.  &QL;

DONNA HANOVER AND JUDITH NATHAN: WOMEN AT THE CENTER OF GIULIANI'S
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Donna Hanover &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was a made-for-TV romance at the beginning. After a friend of
Rudolph Giuliani, then an associate attorney general in Washington,
suggested he call Donna Hanover, then a news anchorwoman, he had
his secretary make the call to arrange a meeting _ actually, a
television interview on a drug crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, at Walt Disney World, Giuliani proposed. They
married in April 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, Hanover has played a number of roles,
from an evangelist in ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' to the dutiful
political spouse.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, she has increasingly shied away from
playing the role of the New York City's first lady, making a name
for herself with myriad jobs in television and in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   It was in recent weeks, however, that her role as the mayor's
wife again thrust her into the political spotlight. Her decision to
appear in ``The Vagina Monologues'' provoked controversy in light
of Giuliani's U.S. Senate run, and she later canceled her role in
the play after the mayor learned he had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier years of her marriage to Giuliani, Hanover, a
graduate of Stanford University and the Columbia School of
Journalism, regularly accompanied her husband on his professional
duties, even visiting New Haven, Conn., as he prosecuted the
corruption trial of Stanley M. Friedman, the Bronx Democratic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning for Giuliani's unsuccessful 1989 bid for the
mayor's office, Hanover, who was born in California, starred in a
campaign commercial, featuring scenes of him playing with their two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Rudy, he seemed strong and at the same time
gentle'' she said in the advertisement. ``And I liked that. I
thought, this is the kind of man I want to be the father to my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   She worked at WPIX-TV from 1983 to 1990, and later as a
correspondent on WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York,'' the morning news
program on Channel 5, and as co-host of ``In Food Today,'' a show
on the national cable Television Food Network. In dramatic roles,
she has appeared on the ABC series ``The Practice,'' as well as on
``Law and Order,'' ``Family Law'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' and was
praised for her performance as Ruth Carter Stapleton in ``The
People vs. Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover has played a television anchorwoman in at least seven
feature films, including ``Ransom'' with Mel Gibson. She has also
conducted celebrity interviews for Good Housekeeping magazine, and
has worked with the directors Sidney Lumet and Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
   She has also branched out into teaching, as an associate faculty
member at Utica College and an adjunct professor in the journalism
department of New York University.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, she has increasingly distanced herself from the
role of political spouse, and was far less visible on the campaign
trail during Giuliani's second successful run for mayor in 1997.
Around that time, she also bristled when called ``Mrs. Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her various careers, Hanover appears to have taken
the advice that she offers on the Internet home page of the Food
Network: ``Work hard at several projects. That way, no matter what
is going wrong, something will be going right.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Judith Nathan &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Nathan, the woman whom Mayor Rudolph Giuliani calls a
``very good friend,'' is an executive at a drug company who lives
on the Upper East Side with her 15-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Nathan have both declined to say how they met or
explain the nature of their relationship, asking reporters to
respect their privacy. But they have increasingly been seen
together at events attended by the mayor, such as parades, as well
as at private meals at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor first responded to questions about their relationship
last Wednesday, the day that The New York Post published photos of
them together leaving a restaurant on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, who is licensed as a nurse in New York state and whose
maiden name is Stish, was married for several years to Bruce Nathan
before the two had a contested divorce. The divorce included a
dispute over the custody of their daughter, who attends a private
school on the Upper East Side, people who know Nathan said.
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani announced Wednesday that he was separating from
his wife, Nathan could not be reached for comment. But outside of
her apartment building in recent days, she has generally limited
her remarks to asking people to respect her privacy and to saying
that she was concerned about the health of the mayor, who has been
diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Wednesday, Giuliani called Nathan ``a
very, very fine person'' and said that because of his illness,
``I'm going to need her more now than maybe I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   A former boyfriend of Nathan's, Manos Zacharioudakis, said he
had a long relationship with her until they ``ran out of steam''
last year. Zacharioudakis, a psychologist who said he works for the
city's hospitals agency, praised Nathan, saying that she was a
wonderful mother. ``If there is going to be a next Mrs. Giuliani,
she is going to make a perfect wife,'' Zacharioudakis said. ``She
is an extraordinary individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan did not respond to two messages left for him at his home
on Wednesday night.

HEAT'S MOURNING PROMISES TO BE MR. INSIDE IN GAME 3
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCONUT GROVE, Fla. _ Pat Riley and Tim Hardaway suggested to
Alonzo Mourning that he shot too many long-range jumpers in Miami's
82-76 loss to the New York Knicks in Game 2. Then his former
college coach, John Thompson, made it unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning had 17 points, but one of his worst shooting
performances of the season, missing 13 of 18 field goals and 6 of
13 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big John said, `One thing I've always told you is the game is
played from the inside out, and you settled for the outside
yesterday,''' a chagrined Mourning said Wednesday after the Heat's
practice at LaSalle High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `Just think about every opportunity that you had
yesterday to take the ball to the hole. Just think about all the
good things to happen out of it. You score or you're fouled or
somebody tips it. Or you kick it to an open player.' I know I
didn't really exploit that side of my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning promised that he would assert his 6-foot-10-inch,
261-pound body closer to the basket on Friday in Game 3 at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's got me into the position I am today,'' he said, ``is
taking the ball to the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning missed 10 straight shots from 9 minutes 59 seconds of
the second quarter until 1:26 of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking the next shot that I took was going to fall,''
he said. ``Then the next one I take is going to fall. Then the next
one _ instead of thinking, why don't I make the extra pass and get
the defense moving and get a deeper spot on the weak side or get
somebody wide open, based on patience and execution of the
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, who had 17 points overall, misfired on eight shots
from beyond 13 feet and was 0 of 7 in the third quarter as the
Knicks built a nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm a better player than I showed yesterday _ by far,''
he said. ``It's a shame to say it took a game like this to make me
realize what I need to do, because I knew it already.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said: ``We've got to find a better way to get him the ball
deeper. We know it. They know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks sometimes have put Larry Johnson on Mourning, even
though Mourning is almost 6 inches taller. The Heat center knows he
can almost shoot at will over Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it's not smart, I have to go to the next option,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning came into the game aware that any time he took a
15-foot or longer jump shot, he needed to make a high percentage of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I get caught up in the game so much that I
settle for what the defense is giving me, instead of putting more
pressure on the defense,'' he said. ``But like I said, It won't
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the game a complete bust for him offensively were the six
missed free throws. He missed the first two, late in the first
quarter, then botched three of his next four. Overall, the Heat
missed 14 free throws, a transgression that looked pivotal in
Riley's day-after assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of felt like I started it,'' Mourning said of the
team's free-throw debacle. ``They caught the disease from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mourning didn't sound too worried that the disease will
carry-over to the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I was actually clanking them and they were
hitting the backboard and bouncing off to the side,'' he said.
``They were going in that rim, and coming back out. So it's just a
matter of mechanics. It's locking my elbow, following through,
getting up my toes, getting it over the rim _ things like that.''
