<P>
LONDON April 27 (Xinhua) - Soaring bank, oil and telecom stocks

rally in European markets Tuesday with London and Paris setting
new records.
</P>
<P>

Positive momentum built up gradually in the City, as the FTSE
100 had scored a century around midday, with the session's best
coming shortly before Wall Street opened.
</P>
<P>
"We've been following Wall Street for some time and will
continue to do so, but US markets are looking pretty mixed, with
the S&AMP;P little changed and the Nasdaq lower," said James Dewhurst,
senior salesman at UK brokerage Charterhouse.
</P>
<P>
French shares shot up 2.49 percent, or 106 points, to finish at

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence, a key
indicator of future U.S. economic activity rose nearly a full
point in April for the sixth straight month, the Conference Board,
a private research group, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Index rose 0.9 point to 134.9 from a
revised 134 in March, the group said. The Expectations Index rose
to 108 from 105.5.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are showing no signs of pessimism and no signs of
curbing their strong spending habits," said Lynn Franco, Associate
Director of the Board's Consumer Research Center. "They will
continue to contribute significantly to this record-breaking
economic expansion."
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence survey is based on a representative
sample of 5000 U.S. households and consumer sentiment is an
important economic indicator because consumer spending accounts
for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity. The
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to
buying plans.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Progress in Economic Development Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is one of the emerging
economies in the world with vast prospects for foreign
investments, according to an annual report issued Tuesday by the
Arab-German Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Egyptian government is exerting growing
efforts to turn the country into a trade and financial hub in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The report cited Egypt's strong commitment to economic
liberalization and privatization, the country's geographical
position and its enormous technological potentials as factors that
will benefit the Egyptian economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started economic reforms in 1991 to loosen control over
and privatize the state-run enterprises. Since then, its gross
domestic product has grown from 2 percent to more than 5 percent,
inflation has fallen from 20 percent to under 4 percent and
foreign currency reserves have climbed to 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Till 1998, Egypt had privatized more than one third of the 314
state-run enterprises selected for the process starting in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said Egypt's stock exchange is one of the most
active and fastest growing bourses in the world, with a market
capital of over 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended Egypt increase exports to reduce its
trade deficit. In the 1997-98 fiscal year ending on June 30 last
year, Egypt's exports were registered at 5.331 billion dollars
while its imports amounted to 16.552 billion dollars, with a
deficit of 11.221 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Parliament's President Visits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 27 (Xinhua) -- There are no major hindrances
to conclude a bilateral treaty between Romania and Repubic of
Moldova, the President of the Moldovan Parliament Dumitru Diacov
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dumitru Diacov told a press conference here that the "future
Romania-Repubic of Moldova treaty will have to cover the current
reality of the ties between the two countries".
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, "there are no major hindrances to conclude such
a treaty which could establish the legal frame of a co-operation
and remove certain suspicions".
</P>
<P>
Dumitru Diacov also said that the two sides agreed in a meeting
with the Foreign Ministry on the fact that the experts groups in
the two states should meet as quickly as possible in order to
start negotiations for the conclusion of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the chances to return properties to the refugees
from the former Romanian province of Bessarabia (the Republic of
Moldova at present) who live in Romania after the second World
War, Diacov said the issue had not been discussed in the Republic
of Moldova until now. Anyway, there is no such possibility because
of a lack of archives which were supposed to prove the legal
status of properties, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Dumitru Diacov arrived on Monday in Bucharest on a two-day
official visit, at the invitation of the Romanian Senate. It is
his first visit in Bucharest after parliamental elections on March
2, 1998. Dumitru Diacov had talks with the President of Romania's
Senate Petre Roman and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Ion
Diaconescu. He also met Romanian President Emil Constantinescu and
Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties between Romania and the Republic of Moldova have
been moving upwards since their establishment on August 29, 1991,
the day of the proclamation of independence of the former Soviet
republic. During the span of time, authorities in the two states
have signed about 40 treaties, agreements and conventions.
However, the conclusion of a political treaty delays, and the
Republic of Moldova is now the only neighbouring country with
which Romania has not signed a basic treaty.

<P>
GENEVA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from China, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), South Korea, and the
United States ended the fifth round of talks on the Korean
Peninsula here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement issued at the end of the four-day
talks, the four parties said that they had agreed to continue to
discuss substantive issues and proposals for agenda items of the
two subcommittees at the next session, the sixth one, to be
chaired by China in August.
</P>
<P>
The two subcommittees, established during the fourth session
last January, were meant to discuss respectively tension reduction
on the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of a peace regime
there.
</P>
<P>
During the subcommittee meetings on April 25-26, according to
the statement, detailed substantive views were freely exchanged.
The negotiators admitted that "serious differences in positions
exist".
</P>
<P>
However, "the four parties agreed in the next round to consider
and fashion measures to reduce tension that fit the unique
situation on the Korean Peninsula," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to take steps in the next round "to explore
further the outlines of a future peace regime on the Korean
Peninsula", according to the statement.
</P>

The four countries began the talks on the Korean Peninsula in
December 1997 in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Signals Recovery, U.S. Paper Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- After a year and a half of
recession, Hong Kong is beginning to show signs of recovery, the
Wall Street Journal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Journal said in a dispatch from Hong Kong that overseas
companies are bidding for and buying sizable stakes in corporate
Hong Kong and property prices are stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
The stock market in Hong Kong has rebounded to its highest
level in 18 months, the paper said, adding that concern about the
Hong Kong dollar has abated.
</P>
<P>
The Journal said even tourism, until recently one of the worst
sectors, is up. Visitor arrivals jumped 13 percent in the first
quarter of this year compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
Those indicators contrast with the gloom among some
business people and economists not that long ago, the paper said.
"They also suggest that recovery is being hastened by the
intangible advantages that Hong Kong wields over many of its Asian
neighbors: minimal red tape, a transparent business environment
and a robust legal system."
</P>
<P>
The Journal said even a negative sign like bankruptcies
illustrates one of Hong Kong's strengths and a transparent and
effective legal system helps to aid recovery. Christopher Howe, a
director of Anglo-Chinese Corporate Finance Ltd. In Hong Kong, was
quoted as saying that in Hong Kong, creditors can collect on bad
debts, and a small but growing number of outside investors have
used the bankruptcy courts to gain control of poorly managed
firms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper said, hard time are forcing some firms to
cut costs and revamp, enhancing their competition in the market.

ATHENS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The President of Greece's
Democratic Social Movement (DHKKI) Dimitris Tsovolas and the
Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Aleka
Papariga agreed during their talks Tuesday that there was a need
to form an anti-NATO front from social and political forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, Tsovolas said that Greece's
progressive parties should back the formation of a broad social
anti-NATO front in order to create obstacles to the inhuman,
barbarous choices of the major Western powers.
</P>
<P>
He had agreed with Papariga on the need for the convening of a
meeting of Greece's political party leaders, so that the parties
could make their positions clear on current developments and, if
possible, formulate a national strategy.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party's stance was that Greece should not
provide facilities to NATO.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Papariga said that the purpose of an anti-NATO
front would be to prepare the Greek people for the difficult days
which were coming.
</P>
<P>
Greece's main opposition New Democracy (ND) leader Costas
Karamanlis and Coalition of the Left President Nikos
Constantopoulos also agreed during their talks last week that
Greece should not become directly or indirectly involved in any
ground operations by NATO in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the establishment of a foreign policy
council and a meeting convened of the country's political party
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Nuclear Station Stopped Working Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The first and the only
generating unit of the Cernavoda nuclear power station stopped
working, late on Monday, because of a mechanical breakdown of the
water supply, the Nuclearelectrica National Company AS informed
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first incident of this kind since the unit was put
into operation in 1996. The breakdown has not caused a surge in
radiation level and had no impact over the the environment or the
population, according to the local specialists.
</P>
<P>
This unexpected break occurred after 141 days of the station's
functioning around the clock. The station is to be closed for 36
hours to have mechanical breakdown repaired, said sources of the
company.
</P>
<P>
The Cernavoda Station, located on the east bank of the Danube
River, 170 kilometers east of Bucharest, is Romania's first
nuclear station. It was designed to be composed of five generating
units, each with a power of 700,000 kwh.
</P>
<P>
The first unit of the station was put into use in 1996,
following delays to the project because of financial problems. The
unit provides ten percent of the total electric energy production
of Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government has given priority to the construction
of the station's second generating unit that could go into
operation in the year 2000 if the funds could be guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> UN on Humanitarian Impact of Possible Fuel Embargo  Against FRY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) --There would be two
immediate humanitarian concerns over the possible fuel embargo on
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), a senior U.N. official
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the United Nations Security Council on the latest
humanitarian situation in FRY after NATO launched its airstrikes a
month ago, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs,
Vieira de Mello, said the possible fuel embargo would further
restrict the ability for international humanitarian agencies to
provide assistance to civilians with the FYR.
</P>
<P>
The insecurity within the country and the destruction of the
transportation infrastructure had made it extremely difficult to
provide assistance, and several U.N. agencies had highlighted that
a fuel embargo would render the provision of humanitarian
assistance even more complicated, Mello said.
</P>
<P>
Mello said the embargo would adversely affect the welfare of
civilians throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The fuel embargo would impact the civilian population first,
and that the stated objective, an impact on the Yugoslav forces,
would take more time, Mello said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the current shortage of fuel and the impact of an
embargo, would of course severely hamper the agricultural sector
in FRY, and render this year's sowing and harvest well nigh
impossible, Mello added.
</P>
<P>
During the summit over the weekend, NATO countries agreed to
impose an oil embargo on FRY, an apparent bid to jepordize the
military forces of FRY.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO's bombing campaign
had had serious humanitarian repercussions for civilians within
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), a senior U.N. official
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the United Nations Security Council on the
humanitarian situation in FRY after NATO launched its airstrikes a
month ago, U.N. Under-Secretary-General General Vieira de Mello,
said according to Belgrade, as at April 21, there had been 7,200
NATO air strikes in which 517 civilians were alleged to have been
killed with some 4,500 civilians injured.
</P>
<P>
The aerial bombardment of industrial, oil and chemical plants
in the regions of Topola, Vojvodina, Pancevo and Novi Sad had
repeatedly resulted in widespread ground and air pollution, and
Yugoslav health and environmental officials had warned of a
possible ecological emergency that would have significantly
adverse effects for the residents in these area, Mello noted.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities also claimed that the strikes had
caused extensive damage to the infrastructure of the country, and
had severely disrupted the population's ability to secure their
own sustenance, Mello said.
</P>
<P>
The airstrikes had reportedly damaged and destroyed water
supply systems, power stations and telecommunications
installations, Mello continued.
</P>
<P>
A protracted air campaign was bound to have a dramatic impact
in the psychological, social and economic conditions of the
Yugoslav population, Mello added.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Praised for Attending PLO Central Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
praised the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) for
attending the meeting of the Palestinian Liberation Organization
(PLO) Central Council that opened here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the opening session, Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said the presence of Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin at the meeting was an
important progress in the process of national unity and showed
that the movement shouldered its responsibility in this regard.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Central Council will make a decision on
whether to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 or
to postpone the plan, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
On the threats by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
annex the West Bank and Gaza if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
declares an independent state on May 4, Sha'ath said the threats
were "empty and erroneous."
</P>
<P>
They would exert no impact on the Palestinian decision on the
statehood issue, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian independence declaration became our right that
can be achieved at any time," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We may declare the independence due to the current
developments," Sha'ath said, noting that the Palestinian side was
not intended to hinder the peace process with the statehood issue.
</P>
<P>
"We will, however, go on the peace talks and the process till
the end of the final status talks," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S. position on the recent developments in the
peace process, he said it was not as clear and firm as that of the
European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a final decision to be made on Wednesday or
Thursday," Sha'ath added.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Joint Efforts to Resolve Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China called here Tuesday for
joint efforts of the international community to resolve financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"With increased economic globalization and financial
integration, and growing interdependence among different
economies, the ultimate resolution of crisis depends on the joint
efforts of the international community," said Liu Mingkang, Deputy
Governor of People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at the 52nd meeting of the Interim
Committee of the Board of Governors on the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Liu said although the risk of global recession has been
reduced, the world economic outlook is still less than optimistic.
"The global slowdown may yet prove deeper and more prolonged than
so far assumed."
</P>
<P>
World economic prospects will mainly rely on the ability of the
United States to achieve a "soft landing", a solid recovery of the
Japanese economy, a strengthened domestic demand to maintain a
sustained growth in Europe, a substantial revival of capital flow
to emerging market economies, and the stability of the major
exchange rates, he added.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the advanced economies to undertake the
responsibility of supporting the Asian economic recovery, Liu said
they should coordinate their macroeconomic policies and maintain
economic growth to contribute to economic recovery in the crisis
countries and promote world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
On the Chinese economy, Liu said in 1999, the Chinese
government will continue to pursue a vigorous fiscal policy and
sound monetary policy to stimulate domestic demand and achieve the
growth target of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident about continuing to maintain strong growth
and the stability of the renminbi in the context of an unfavorable
external environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his belief that with the mainland of China's
expected robust economic growth in 1999 and Hong Kong's remarkable
flexibility to adjust, the economy of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region will recover in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
As for the reform of the international monetary and financial
system, Liu said such reform is critical to guarantee exchange
rate stability and the effective supervision of capital flows.
</P>
<P>
"The start and spread of the recent financial crisis reflects
the weakness and difficulties facing the current international
financial system which has seen fundamental changes take place in
its international economic structure over the past 50 years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to play the central role in international
monetary and financial issues, the IMF should give greater
consideration to the specific political, economic, and social
conditions of its members, and more flexibility should be allowed
in its policy advice, liu said.

<HEADLINE> Southeast European Transport Ministers Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Transport and Communications
Ministers from southeast European countries began here Tuesday a
meeting aimed at adoption of a multilateral accord on road
transports that would be a key step forward in regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The 11 ministers from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia
and Turkey were expected to adopt a memorandum of understanding
containing the principles for policy and action in facilitating
transports, such as liberalization of the road transport of goods,
membership in international accords, so that all the countries
would follow the same rules of transport and transit, adoption of
a Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI) weighing
standard, abolition of special fees, and the operation of an
information system on pricing and taxation, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Transport and Communications Minister Tasos Mantelis
said at the meeting that the transport sector was emerging as an
important factor of economic cooperation and development among the
countries of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The SECI aimed at getting rid of obstacles and distortions in
the market of international road transport of merchandise that had
serious repercussions on Greece in particular due to its
geographic position.

<HEADLINE> UK Eager to Welcome Back "Isolated" Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) - British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Tuesday that he wanted Russia to be part of the
solution, not the problem, in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"They are now seeking a way back from isolation and we welcome
that. We want Russia to be part of the solution," he said in an
interview to BBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
Cook's remarks were regarded as a part of the efforts by the
western alliance to bring Moscow on side as it is seen to carry
influence with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"When we have that peace in Kosovo, I would want Russia to be
there with us. After all, they were there with us in Bosnia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the private conversations of the past two weeks, both with
the United States and ourselves, Russia has made it very clear
that it does want to try and be positive and constructive," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that the NATO alliance was not planning an
invasion of Kosovo against armed resistance by the Serb Army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Vladimir Andreyev, the press attache in the Russian
Embassy in London, said that a Nato invasion of Kosovo could push
Russia "too far".
</P>
<P>
Andreyev said NATO must stop the bombing and resume talks. He
stressed that "anger and outrage" still existed in Moscow over
Nato's strikes against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and NATO have become strained as NATO
plans for an oil embargo against Serbia clash with the Russians'
insistence that they will continue to ship oil to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Mr Andreyev said attempts to stop Russian ships reaching Serbia
would be very dangerous and "would be close to an act of war".

<HEADLINE> 6 Israeli Soldiers Injured in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Six Israeli soldiers and three
members of the Israel-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded
Tuesday afternoon in attacks by Lebanese guerrillas in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attacks, saying one of its group stormed
the Israeli-held post at Sujoud on the edge of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fighters wounded all Israeli soldiers at the post
and erected the group's flag on the top of a house.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas also raided other Israeli posts in the border
zone, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has confirmed the casualties, which raised to
16 the number of wounded Israeli soldiers since the start of this
year. Another eight were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In return, Israeli warplanes raided suspected Hezbollah bases
M14-42NBB189i0427ql01:0801:081403
in the Iqlim Toufaha area just outside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli shell landed on the road of Jarjua village only two
kilometers away from Sujoud, wounding a four-year-old boy and his
mother.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery forces also bombarded villages and hills in
the country's eastern Bekaa valley.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 200 in S. W. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has killed more than
200 people since last Wednesday in Dinsor town in Somalia's
southwestern region of Bay, local authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main traditional leader of the town, Ugas Sidow Hajji
Mohamed, told Xinhua via VHF radio that his people are incredibly
dying in great numbers and that the situation is alarming.
</P>
<P>
According to the local authorities, the average death rate is
20 people per day and the disease is especially rampant in eight
villages and the town of Dinsor itself where people are fallen
from the disease in dozens everyday.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the disease has further been facilitated by the
new influx of refugees arriving in Dinsor and its surrounding
areas within Bay and Bakol regions.
</P>
<P>
Ugas said that over 2,000 destitute families displaced by the
droughts and insecurity are now draining out the resources of
Dinsor town.
</P>
<P>
He noted that thousands of people are suffering from serious
food shortage in the region after the droughts had prolonged more
than expected and the past harvests were extremely poor.
</P>
<P>
Lack of proper quarantine is also attributed to the spread of
the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
The local health authorities in Dinsor town said there has been
no international response to their plight other than the World
Health Organization which offered them 40 crates of the
anti-dehydration solution besides the American IMC which provided
chlorine for purifying the potable water in the town.

PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The National Secretary of the
French Communist Party Robert Hue Tuesday warned against what he
called ``extremely grave risks of escalation'' in the Kosovo
crisis, after NATO and EU have imposed an oil embargo on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
``We know that it is always the people who suffer the
consequences,'' Agence France-Presse quoted Hue as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that after more than one month of bombings, NATO
has not only failed to move closer toward a solution, but also is
finding it more difficult.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that France call for a meeting of the United
Nations Security Council ``within hours or within days'' to
examine a ``peace plan which could have the legitimacy given by
the international community.''
</P>
<P>
``The crisis of Kosovo reveals the need for a union, a
solidarity, the need of Europe, the need to construct a pacific
power capable of standing up to the American empire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe's and France's future is closely linked
with the way to find a political solution to the conflicts in the
Balkans.

<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
spoke on telephone on Tuesday with his Irish counterpart Bertie
Ahern about ways to advance the "difficult" situation in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
After the telephone conversation, Downing Street said Blair
still had an "iron determination" to find a way forward despite
the process being at a "difficult stage".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is also expected to talk to party leaders
from the province at Downing Street later this week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam insisted the
government had no plans to "park" the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam was in Dublin, where she joined Irish Justice Minister
John O'Donoghue to sign an agreement aimed at identifying the
locations of the graves of IRA victims who disappeared over a
period of more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said: "I have no intention of parking the process. I
think parking would be a mistake."
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be potentially dangerous. I think it would
unravel. I intend to keep talking as long as the party leaders
keep talking," she added.
</P>
<P>
The continued deadlock follows the refusal by unionists to
allow Sinn Fein members to take their seats in the Northern
Ireland Assembly's executive until republican paramilitaries begin
decommissioning their weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein say the disarming of paramilitary weapons was
never a precondition of sitting in the executive.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
Tuesday left Umtata, about 250 km southwest of Durban, for Russia,
first stop of his last series of official trip abroad, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning he will be in Moscow, the first leg of an
11-day jet-hopping tour that will also take him to Hungary,
Pakistan and China, Foreign Affairs Department officials were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Freedom Day rally in Umtata shortly before his
departure, Mandela reiterated that the South African government
would continue its effort to promote relations with the world.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Day marked the first all-race election in South Africa
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is flying in the presidential falcon jet, will be
accompanied throughout by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, who is now
in Washington, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would also have Trade Minister Alec Erwin with him in
Moscow, and a high-powered delegation from the local business
sector, including mining groups and major manufacturers, a
spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who will retire after the election in June, has
repeatedly postponed a Moscow visit since he assumed the
presidency in 1994. He is expected to sign a declaration of
friendly relations between Pretoria and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He is due to visit Hungary on April 30, Pakistan on May 4, and

BAGHDAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Four Iraqi civilians were killed
and several others injured on Tuesday in U.S. and British
warplanes attacks on Iraqi targets, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 14:50 (1050 GMT), 11 formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace bombed some civilian
facilities and military sites in Neineva province.
</P>
<P>
He added Iraqi air defenses fired missiles at the enemy planes,
and according to a report by observation posts, one enemy plane
might have been hit as black smoke could be seen emanating from it.
</P>
<P>
Iraq declared several times in the past that its air defenses
had downed U.S. and British warplanes violating its airspace, but
failed to present relevant evidence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain denied this kind of Iraqi claims every
time, saying all their planes enforing the no-fly zones returned
to their bases in Turkey, or in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait safely.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-December, clashes between U.S. and British jets
patrolling the no-fly zones and the Iraqi air defenses have
almost become daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south from "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these
restricted zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied
plane violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Falun Gong Practitioners' Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Letters and
Calls Departments of the General Offices of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China and the State Council was
interviewed by Xinhua today on the April 25 gathering of the Falun
Gong practitioners around the Zhongnanhai compound.
</P>
<P>
The official said that a magazine of a university in Tianjin
recently published a signed article, talking about the Falun Gong.
And some of the practitioners disagreed with what the article said,
so they began on April 19 to make representations to the magazine.
On April 25, some of the practitioners in Beijing, Tianjin and
some other places came to gather around the Zhongnanhai compound,
the central Party and government headquarters, upon hearing some
rumors. Entrusted by authorities concerned, some officials
contacted practitioners in the gathering, listened to them
patiently, and did some persuasion. At the same time, the
aforementioned two departments, along with the Beijing Public
Security Bureau, issued an Announcement, calling on the
practitioners not to believe in rumors, but to observe related
regulations and jointly maintain the capital's public order. The
gathering disappeared after persuasion work on the evening the
same day.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that governments at all levels have never
prohibited any health fitness activities. He said different views
and opinions are allowable, and can also be reported through
normal channels according to law. But those who have different
views should not gather around the Zhongnanhai, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed such kind of gathering would affect the public
order and people's normal life around the headquarters of the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council, and therefore is
completely wrong. He said those who jeopardize social stability
under the pretext of practicing any Gong shall be dealt with
according to law.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China now enjoys a good political,
economic and social situation, which is hard-won. Therefore, it is
necessary to cherish social stability and unity, and
conscientiously maintain them, because it accords with the
people's fundamental interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Defense and Aviation
Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz on Tuesday kicked off a tour of
Tunis, Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian embassy sources in Riyadh said Sultan, who is also
Second Deputy Prime Minister, will discuss with Tunisian President
Zine Elabdine Ben Ali and other senior officials means of boosting
bilateral cooperation at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the two sides will also tackle Arab and
Islamic issues, and ways of reviving Arab solidarity in the face
of pressing challenges.
</P>
<P>
The sources said they believe the visit will give a big push to
the already mounting bilateral cooperation, which they termed as
"tangible" in recent years especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Saudi investments in Tunisia exceed 500 million U.S. dollars.
The two Arab states have set up a joint investment company, which
has invested in over 340 industrial and agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Saudi Arabia and Tunisia was
estimated at 71.2 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sultan's tour to Tunisia will be followed by his first-ever
visit to Iran, where he will hold talks with moderate President
Mohammad Khatami on the Gulf developments, the Middle East peace
process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister is also expected to meet with Iran's
spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, former president Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani.
</P>
<P>
Both Riyadh and Tehran are believed to have attached great
importance to Sultan's visit since it is coming just before
Khatami's first official visit to Saudi Arabia due in May.
</P>
<P>
Sultan will head on May 3 to Pakistan for talks with Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Arab, Islamic and international
developments, including the persistent tension in the South Asia
sub-continent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sales of Existing Homes Hit New High in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Americans purchased existing
homes at an annual rate of 5.05 million units in March, 0.6
percent higher than February's 5.02 million rate and breaking the
previous record of 5.04 million set in January, the National
Association of Realtors reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The record sales pace at the outset of 1999 follows an
unprecedented year of 4.78 million existing home sales in 1998.
March was the fourth consecutive month that the sales rate topped
5 million.
</P>
<P>
"A combination of factors -- excellent housing affordability
conditions and a strong desire by consumers to buy -- are keeping
the market incredibly strong," said Sharon A. Millett, president
of the real estate group.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate near a 29-year low, rising incomes, low
mortgage rates, and solid stock market gains are driving the brisk
home sales.

months, said reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both pilots of the jet fighter ejected safely and appeared to

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expected to Sign Reserve Call-up Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton is
expected to sign a call-up order requested by the Pentagon to have
33,000 reservists to active duty so that NATO would expand its air
armada and quicken the pace of its attacks against Yugoslavia, the
White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president fully recognizes this disrupts lives," White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. "But this is what reservists
train for. This is what their mission is. From time to time, they
are called."
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton was expected to sign the call-up later on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The of 33,000 reservists for the call-up was set by Defense
Secretary William Cohen. But the initial requirement may be for a
smaller number. About three-quarters of the total are expected to
be Air Force reserves. Some Army National Guard and REserve
members are likely to be called up to support the Apache
helicopter operations in Albania. A smaller number of Navy and
Marine Corps reservists also are likely to get the call to help
with port management, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The reserve call-up, which Cohen had predicted would happen a
week ago, has been delayed while NATO worked out agreements with
Hungary and other allied countries to host some of the additional
300 strike and support aircraft requested by Army Gen. Wesley
Clark, the NATO commander.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said on Monday that 30 more Air
Force refueling aircraft had been ordered to Europe in support of
the airstrikes against Yugoslavia. They would leave this weekend
from bases in Arizona, California, Michigan and a fourth,
unspecific state.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told reporters
at the Pentagon that 23 Apache attack helicopters had arrived in
Albanian and were ready to begin attack missions against Yugoslav
army in Kosovo as soon as NATO commanders gave the signal.
</P>
<P>
One of the Apaches crashed near Tirana while on a training
mission early on Tuesday. The cause of the crash was under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UNDP Works Hard to Promote African Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Africa Bureau of the United
Nations Development Bureau (UNDP) Tuesday concluded a workshop on
"Financial Intermediation and Private Sector in Africa" here
during the five-day "Attracting Capital to Africa Summit", which
began on Saturday last week.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was held to analyze the problems of the private
sector in Africa and suggest approaches to help the continent
deepen its financial mediation and attract foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to use the event to generate new ideas and
concrete proposals on how to make the African private sector the
engine of economic growth," said Thelma Awori, assistant
administrator of UNDP and director of the U.N. agency's Africa
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
UNDP has co-organized the State of Connecticut Africa Business
Conference 1999 with the State Government on April 20-21, as a
part of an effort to ensure global competitiveness of African
enterprises and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is one of the most widely implanted development agencies
in Africa. With a network of 45 country offices, 10 regional
program offices and two sub-regional offices in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, and Harare, Zimbabwe, UNDP focuses on critical issues
ranging from poverty, gender equality and the empowerment of women
to good governance and private sector development.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July 1998, approvals of UNDP Africa projects
amounted to 764 million U.S. dollars out of total authorized
programming of 976 million U.S. dollars for the 1997-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's renewed emphasis on empowerment of African people has
become necessary because past approaches have failed to eradicate
poverty on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the fact that Africa is the only continent where
poverty is predicted to increase in the 21st century, Awori
stressed that UNDP Africa Bureau must turn to those who know
development best and who will ultimately reap the rewards of its
success or pay the price of failure -- African themselves.
</P>
<P>
UNDP will seek to forge new development partnerships with
African youth, traditional leaders, churches and other religious
groups. "We must integrate ourselves into the rich networks of
existing grass-roots and community-based organizations," she said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is now looking at ways in which it can work with African
religious leaders, to draw on the wealth of experience that they
have acquired. "We can learn a lot from them," she said.
</P>
<P>
Facing up to the consequences of the declining trend of
official development assistance (ODA), UNDP has identified the
negative trend as among Africa's most critical challenges.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for the lion's share of external resource flows to
Africa, ODA fell from 14.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 12.8
billion U.S. dollars in 1996. ODA flows have fallen for short of
the 30 billion U.S. dollars a year that some economists estimate
is needed to reduce poverty in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Although the General Assembly set an ODA target of 0.7 percent
of GNP for donor countries in 1996, these countries on average
provided ODA equivalent to just 0.25 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
"Declining ODA is a reality and I think it is important that
Africans wake up to that reality," Awori said.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President-Elect Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President-elect
Abdelaziz Bouteflika was sworn in Tuesday for a five-year term
according to the Algerian constitution.
</P>
<P>
In the inaugural speech, Bouteflika spoke highly of the efforts
made by outgoing President Liamine Zeroual in safeguarding the
national order since he came to power in 1995, the Algerian News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to achieve public peace and eradicate violence in
thoughts, words or actions will take priority in the new
government's work, Bouteflika said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the responsibility of the state to preserve the
security of individuals and properties.
</P>
<P>
The state should mobilize all ranks to stop violence and
eliminate its effects in line with the laws of the republic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is also responsible for stamping out all direct and
indirect causes of rampant vicious acts of violence, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged all sides concerned to work together to stabilize the
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has been rebuilding its institutions since 1992 when
the authority canceled parliamentary elections the now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. The move triggered an
Islamic insurgency that has left some 75,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election on April 15 had been originally seen
by the vast array of opposition parties as a chance to break with
the old order of military-backed rule to help mend the nation
fractured by deeply rooted division and the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
But after six other candidates dropped out of the race in
protest of voting fraud, Bouteflika, who was widely seen as the
choice of the powerful military-backed establishment, became the
only contender and won 73.75 percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> 6 Israeli Soldiers Injured in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Six Israeli soldiers and three
members of the Israel-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded
Tuesday afternoon in attacks by Lebanese guerrillas in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attacks, saying one of its group stormed
the Israeli-held post at Sujoud on the edge of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fighters wounded all Israeli soldiers at the post
and erected the group's flag on the top of a house.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas also raided other Israeli posts in the border
zone, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has confirmed the casualties, which raised to
16 the number of wounded Israeli soldiers since the start of this
year. Another eight were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In return, Israeli warplanes raided suspected Hezbollah bases
in the Iqlim Toufaha area just outside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli shell landed on the road of Jarjua village only two
kilometers away from Sujoud, wounding a four-year-old boy and his
mother.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery forces also bombarded villages and hills in
the country's eastern Bekaa valley.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UNDP Works Hard to Promote African Development (2)  by Gu Zhenqiu and Ding Baozhong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Another priority area for UNDP is
to capitalize on globalization's opportunities while responding to
its challenges.
</P>
<P>
In his September 1998 progress report on the implementation of
the U.N. New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that globalization offers
major economic and social benefits, such as access to large
financial savings, new export markets and new technologies.
</P>
<P>
But in the case of Africa, he pointed out that globalization,
in the short term, has led to a significant marginalization of the
continent, largely because African exports are mainly primary
products, with little progress made in diversifying into
manufactureed goods.
</P>
<P>
Africa's export revenues have grown only marginally, due to
price uncertainties associated with commodities and the negative
impact of higher interest rates on export financing. In addition,
the U.N. chief said that Africa faces the risk of further
marginalization if it fails to attract more foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
UNDP, since its meeting held early this year in Benin, has
realized that efforts must be made to support African countries by
helping them to develop and implement adaptive strategies to
minimize the adverse fallout from globalization and take advantage
of the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Africa's debt burden is a third priority area for UNDP Africa
Bureau. External public debt reached 223 billion U.S. dollars in
1997 and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative,
established in 1996 to reduce the debt burden, has been largely
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see Africa move into the new millenium with
no debt," she said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth priority area is a redoubling of UNDP's commitment
to serve as a voice for the poorest of the poor and other
marginalized groups, including women and those affected by
HIV/AIDS, the killing disease in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
UNDP already has been doing a lot of work with women, for which
it allocates 20 percent of its funds. "It is important that women
know this," she said.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Provide Sao Tome With Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan has decided to provide Sao
Tome and Principe with food aid worth one million U.S. dollars,
the Angolan News Agency Angop reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the two governments Monday,
Japan will continue to provide more rice to the tiny Atlantic
island country. Sao Tome has been receiving food aid from Japan
for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement demands that the money gained through selling the
aid food should be used in implementing the poverty elimination
program.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Japanese Ambassador Hideki Saski
called on the government of Huilherme Posser da Costa to show
transparency in using the Japanese assistance so that Japan would
increase its aid to the island country.
</P>
<P>
Saski noted his government has been watching the flow of its
assistance since 1995 and it hopes that the food aid could go
directly to the poorest.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome and Principe is one of the least developed countries
identified by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Rice and banana are the basic food for the local citizens. But
a serious shortage of rice has made the rice price shoot up in the
market, much higher than those of banana and cassava.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Infrastructure Development Program in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
morning announced its plan to support the infrastructure program
in Africa in a bid to help the Sub-Saharan region boost economic
growth and better life quality for the population of more than 700
million.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to some 750 representatives of businesses and
governments in both Africa and the United States, Rodney Slater,
U.S. transportation secretary, said that "Our initiative seeks to
create new opportunities and a higher quality of life for the
ordinary citizens in both Africa and America by improving the
basic transportation infrastructure of Africa."
</P>
<P>
"Improved transportation within, to and from this major new
market will allow economies on both sides of the Atlantic to move
to higher heights than ever before," he said.
</P>
<P>
Transportation is a major component of the U.S. Government's
partnership with Africa and the U.S. Department of Transportation
has launched a major initiative to support the Partnership, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The theme of our initiative is 'Transportation: the Tie that
Binds.' Transportation is about more than concrete, asphalt and
steel -- it is about connecting people to people," he said, adding
that the United States will help Africa in three ways.
</P>
<P>
"First, we seek to help Africa compete more effectively in the
global marketplace by showing how governments can adjust economic
policies to allow market forces greater flexibility," Slater said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, we seek to expand trade and investment opportunities
for U.S. investors who want to bring transportation technology and
transportation-related goods and services to African markets," he
said. "The bottom line is that if you can't get there, you can't
trade."
</P>
<P>
"Third, we seek to foster economic development in Africa
through training, technical assistance and improved transportation
services for local communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. transportation secretary made the remarks at the
five-day "Attracting Capital to Africa Summit," which began here
on Saturday last week.
</P>
<P>
The biannual conference follows on the heals of the U.S.-Africa
Ministerial Meetings held in Washington last month, both
gatherings are seen as an integral part of the redefinition of the
U.S. relationship with Africa. The first such summit was held in
April in Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Call-Up Order for Expanded Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Tuesday
signed a call-up order to have 33,102 reservists to active duty to
support NATO's ever-expanding bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He announced that about 2,000 members of the Air National Guard
and Air Force reserve in eight states will be the first to be
mobilized.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he signed the order under the request of Defense
Secretary William Cohen who intended to use the call-up authority
to immediately activate 2,100 airmen to support the continued NATO
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
It would be the biggest activation of such troops since 239,000
reservists were called to duty during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
It also marked the first non-voluntary call-up of reservists
since the NATO airstrikes began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"These reserves are essential to America's military strength;
they are part of the total force we bring to bear whenever our men
and women in uniform are called to action," Clinton said. It was
not immediately known how many of the reservists would operate in
the Balkans and how many would work at bases elsewhere in Europe
and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told a Pentagon news conference earlier Tuesday that the
call-up would be made in stages, reflecting the needs of U.S. Army
Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander, who is expanding allied
air operations.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said NATO would continue to insist that an armed
international force be allowed to enforce any peace deal in Kosovo
and that it be led by NATO rather than troops under the United
Nations flag.
</P>
<P>
About three-quarters of the total are expected to be Air Force
reserves. Some Army National Guard and Reserve members are likely
to be called up to support the Apache helicopter operations in
Albania. A smaller number of Navy and Marine Corps reservists also
are likely to get the call to help with port management, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. law, Clinton can authorize what it termed a
"Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up," which would authorize the
defense secretary to select from a pool of as many as 200,000
reserve or National Guard troops.
</P>
<P>
Those called up would be subject to serve on active duty for as
long as 270 days if needed.

<HEADLINE> China Calls For Joint Efforts to Resolve Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China called here Tuesday for
joint efforts of the international community to resolve financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"With increased economic globalization and financial
integration, and growing interdependence among different
economies, the ultimate resolution of crisis depends on the joint
efforts of the international community," said Liu Mingkang, Deputy
Governor of People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at the 52nd meeting of the Interim
Committee of the Board of Governors on the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Liu said although the risk of global recession has been
reduced, the world economic outlook is still less than optimistic.
"The global slowdown may yet prove deeper and more prolonged than
so far assumed."
</P>
<P>
World economic prospects will mainly rely on the ability of the
United States to achieve a "soft landing", a solid recovery of the
Japanese economy, a strengthened domestic demand to maintain a
sustained growth in Europe, a substantial revival of capital flow
to emerging market economies, and the stability of the major
exchange rates, he added.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the advanced economies to undertake the
responsibility of supporting the Asian economic recovery, Liu said
they should coordinate their macroeconomic policies and maintain
economic growth to contribute to economic recovery in the crisis
countries and promote world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
On the Chinese economy, Liu said in 1999, the Chinese
government will continue to pursue a vigorous fiscal policy and
sound monetary policy to stimulate domestic demand and achieve the
growth target of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident about continuing to maintain strong growth
and the stability of the renminbi in the context of an unfavorable
external environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his belief that with the mainland of China's
expected robust economic growth in 1999 and Hong Kong's remarkable
flexibility to adjust, the economy of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region will recover in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
As for the reform of the international monetary and financial
system, Liu said such reform is critical to guarantee exchange
rate stability and the effective supervision of capital flows.
</P>
<P>
"The start and spread of the recent financial crisis reflects
the weakness and difficulties facing the current international
financial system which has seen fundamental changes take place in
its international economic structure over the past 50 years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to play the central role in international
monetary and financial issues, the IMF should give greater
consideration to the specific political, economic, and social
conditions of its members, and more flexibility should be allowed
in its policy advice, liu said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers New Gun-Control Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed gun-control legislation Tuesday to raise the legal age
for handgun possession from 18 to 21 and hold negligent parents
liable when their children commit crimes with guns.
</P>
<P>
Buyers of explosives would also be subject to the same Brady
law background checks as gun purchasers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposals were made one week after the Colorado
school shooting, in which 13 people were killed by two students.
</P>
<P>
The proposals would amount to no more than minor delays and
minor hassles for sportsmen and legal gun owners, Clinton said at
a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The president's omnibus crime package, which the White House

In addition, Clinton renewed measures that died in the last

<HEADLINE> Israel "on Verge" of Buying U.S. Fighter Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel will soon decide what
kind of U.S. fighter jets it would buy -- either F-15s, or F-16s,
or a mix -- in a new package offered by Washington last year,
Israel's Defense Minister Moshe Arens said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister, at a joint news conference with
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen after their talks at the
Pentagon, said Israel was "on the verge of making a decision" on
the fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told the joint news conference that he and Arens
"discussed Israel's military modernization program and the United
States's commitment to help them to maintain their qualitative
edge in defense."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said there also was a "need to support Jordan's security"
because of the key role Amman plays in regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Washington announced it had offered to sell 30
F-15 and 60 F-16 fighter jets to Israel for an estimated 2.5
billion dollars for each package. The advanced F-15I ground attack
jets are built by Boeing Co. and the F-16C and F-16D models by
Lockheed Martin. Arens is leaving to visit a Boeing Co. plant
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel also asked the United States early last year to expand
the Arrow anti-missile defense program to three batteries from
two. Arrow is an Israeli-produced missile jointly funded by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
As a response, Cohen said at the joint news conference that the
Clinton administration supported the continuation of the
development of a third battery and would work on 40 million
dollars in funding for the program.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika Tuesday rejected the resignation of sitting Prime
Minister Ismail Hamdani and asked him to stay.
</P>
<P>
Hamdani tendered his resignation shortly after Bouteflika was
sworn in as president earlier in the day, the Algerian News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Former President Liamine Zerowal appointed Hamdani prime
minister in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
On April 16, a day after the presidential election, Bouteflika,
who won a landslide victory, said the current government led by
Hamdani will continue its mission through the summit of the
Organization of African Unity, which is due to be held in Algeria
in July.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has been rebuilding its institutions since 1992 when
the authority canceled parliamentary elections the now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. The move triggered an
Islamic insurgency that has left some 75,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election on April 15 had been originally seen
by the vast array of opposition parties as a chance to break with
the old order of military-backed rule to help mend the nation
fractured by deeply rooted division and the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
But after six other candidates dropped out of the race in
protest of voting fraud, Bouteflika, who was widely seen as the
choice of the powerful military-backed establishment, became the
only contender and won 73.75 percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> Angolan PM Post Controversial Prior to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Major controversy has arisen
during debate in Angolan parliament prior to the constitutional
amendment on whether to keep the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Bornito de Sousa, vice chairman of the Constitution Committee
of Angola' s National Assembly, said here Tuesday that the ruling
People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) insists that
the president to act as prime minister, whereas some other parties
request to retain the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos reshuffled the cabinet on
January 30 with an excuse to downsize the institutions, and the
prime minister position is taken over by the president himself.
</P>
<P>
The president's decision has yet to be confirmed by the
constitution. Angola's National Assembly will amend the
constitution this year. The ruling MPLA takes up 129 seats of the
223 seats in the parliament, while the break-away UNITA Renovation
Committee have 70, the rest belongs to other 10 parties.
</P>
<P>
It is widely speculated that draft the amendment on
strengthening presidential power might be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Sousa said to date, all parties have handed in their drafts of
amendment with most members of parliament are for the country to
be a united one under decentralized administration, but still some
others insist on federation.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that in areas of "citizens' basic rights
and freedom", opinions contained in draft amendment handed in by
various parties are quite close.
</P>
<P>
Most parties agree to keep the parliamentary system and on the
establishment of a market economy based on public, private and
cooperate ownership.

<HEADLINE> World Needs $2 Billion to Eliminate Malaria: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization official
David Nabarro said here Tuesday that it will take two billion U.S.
dollars for the world to fight malaria in the next ten years, of
which 500 million dollars will be from his organization.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the on-going meeting on the elimination
of malaria in southern Africa, which has entered its second day.
</P>
<P>
A major challenge facing the world is to make remarkable
achievement in reducing the death rate of malaria and its
incidences before the year 2000, said the official.
</P>
<P>
WHO has pledged to increase fund for anti-malaria goods.
However, Nabarro said the wish could face difficulties due to poor
economic situation in sub-Saharan countries affected by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
He urged countries affected by malaria to try rely on
themselves in fighting the disease.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting which started Monday focus on the
effective elimination of malaria in Africa through strategies
closer to the African reality in accordance with the WHO Roll Back
Malaria program.
</P>
<P>
The Roll Back Malaria program which was initiated last year is
aimed at both eliminating malaria and supporting the development
of health systems in countries affected by this disease.
</P>
<P>
A WHO report showed that about 1.5 million to 2.7 million
people in the world die of malaria every year, among them at least
one million are children under five years.
</P>
<P>
Those affected by the disease are mainly living in countries
with poor health conditions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa,
which has brought negative impact on the countries' ecomony.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be closed Thursday, has drawn representatives
from South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia,
Swaziland,Zambia, Zimbabwe, Sao Tome &AMP; Principe and Seychelles.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Trading Starts in Nigerian Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Stock Exchange
launched its Automated Trading System Tuesday, replacing the
manual call-over trading system after a one-week test run.
</P>
<P>
The new system is the final stage of a modernization program of
the stock market in Lagos which started in 1997 with the
introduction of a central clearing and depository system.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the new system was stalled by the soured
relations between Nigeria and Canada under the late dictator
General Sani Abacha as the Canadian experts handling the project
were denied Nigerian visas.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the electronic trading will make the stock market
in the west African country more transparent and efficient, and it
is expected the new system would result in a quick release of
daily market summary of activities at the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian stockbrokers who had a one-week rehearsal on the new
system welcomed the end of the noisy open outcry trading system
which had been in use since the market opened in 1961.

WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- the United States is
preparing a comprehensive embargo on all exports to Serbia,
including oil and other petroleum products but excluding
humanitarian supplies, the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now working through the amendment to the export
administration regulations that are pending -- which would
establish a comprehensive embargo on exports and re-exports to
Serbia of all goods," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This includes exports and re-exports of oil, gasoline and
other petroleum products," he said.

<P>
Under the amended regulations, any export license from the
Department of Commerce would be required for all exports for
Serbia and the department would deny licenses as a matter of
course, except for humanitarian items, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is working through the system now. I would expect an
announcement shortly by the Commerce Department," he said.
</P>
<P>
The amendments are to an earlier sanctions package which
included a freeze on the foreign funds of Yugoslav officials and
a ban on export financing and on investment in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Leaders, U.S. Firms Discuss Investment  on Oil, Energy  ( by Gu Zhenqiu and Ding Baozhong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The "Attracting Capital to Africa
Summit" concluded here Wednesday with strong African appeals for
more U.S. investment on the continent, rich in natural and human
resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some cabinet members of the Clinton administration,
who attended the summit, said that promoting trade and investment
in Africa is also beneficial to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Gabon already gets 80 percent of its export revenues from oil,
but the African country would like more, with the help of major
oil companies, President Omar Bongo of Gabon has said.
</P>
<P>
Like other presidents and national officials from African
countries, Bongo is touting his nation as a good place to invest.
The president is at Houston to attend the five-day gathering aimed
at exploring opportunities for the two-way trade and investment
between Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition to proven oil reserves, which Gabon has doubled
since 1996, Africa offers vast and untapped resources of natural
gas, Bongo said in a speech to some 750 business and government
representatives from both Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you, you will be able to double your returns," Bongo
said.
</P>
<P>
In response, William Richardson, U.S. secretary of energy, said
in a prepared speech that "the future of the U.S. investment in
Africa will be mainly in the field of energy."
</P>
<P>
"Doing business with Africa creates American jobs," Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings said that it is time now for
Africa and its friends to counter negative perceptions. The
continent boasted 5 percent economic growth last year, when many
parts of the world were struggling in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Also at the discussion in the forms of workshops and roundtable
consultations were some U.S. company executives, who outlined the
difficulties in investing in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the case of oil and gas, Africa is at disadvantage because
much of its considerable resources are high-cost, technically
challenging and in remote locations, said Ken Evans, vice
president of Exxon, a world-famous oil company in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Because oil companies have such long lead times, sanctity of
agreements is of prime importance, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to invest its money, business needs civil order,
economic and political stability, anti-corruption standards by
government and a reliable infrastructure in the African countries,
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
Despite such difficulties, Chevron Vice Chairman David O'Reilly
said the company and its partners have invested 9 billion U.S.
dollars in Africa during the past five years, and will invest 12
billion U.S. dollars there in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Slater, secretary of Transportation, said that the
United States plans to help Africa improve its transportation
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to expand trade and investment opportunities for U.S.
investors who want to bring transportation technology and
transportation-related goods and services to African market," he
said, "The bottom line is that if you can't get there, you can't
trade."

<HEADLINE> Arab League, Russia Discuss Iraqi Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Assistant Secretary
General Ahmad Ben Heli met on Wednesday with Russian Ambassador in
Cairo Vladimir Goudev on issues related to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Goudev told reporters after the meeting that he and Ben Heli
discussed the situation in Iraq and the debate held in the United
Nations Security Council on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the Security Council is debating two draft resolutions
on Iraq, adding that one was sponsored by Russia and the other
jointly by Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Russian blueprint proposes a new monitoring mechanism for
the dismantlement of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction be set up
to replace the U.N. Special Commission and calls for the lifting
of the U.N. economic sanctions on the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Western proposal does not mention the lifting of the
economic sanctions and even seeks to impose new restrictions on
the country, in perpetration of keeping the punitive embargo in
place, Goudev said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat underlined that the Western proposal does
not tally with circumstances in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the economic embargo on Iraq
in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. Destruction of Iraq's banned
weapons is a must for the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Goudev said the Arab League saw Russia's ideas as positive and
constructive, adding that consultations are continuing between the
two sides in a bid to secure approval of the Russian draft
resolution in the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> NATO Tanks Bound for Macedonia Blocked in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A large number of demonstrators
Wednesday prevented the transportation by rail of 30 tanks and
other military equipment from the northern Greek port city of
Thessaloniki to NATO forces stationed in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, believed to be Communist Party of Greece (
KKE) supporters and Greek Railways Organization (OSE) employees,
stood on the railway line near the old railway station in the city,
shouting slogans against the NATO bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also threw stones at a train carrying light
tanks and other military vehicles which were unloaded Tuesday from
the British-flagged freighter "Sea Centurion," according to the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
The train was later forced to return to the port of
Thessaloniki, which has been used as one of the main transit
points for the supply and reinforcement of NATO troops in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Some 14,000 NATO troops and heavy equipment have reportedly
passed through Greek territory and about 4,000 British and German
troops are scheduled to pass through Thessaloniki soon.
</P>
<P>
More demonstrations, which are being organized by teachers of
Thessaloniki prefecture and the Initiative Committee Against the
War, are expected to take place in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Institute will also launch a campaign to urge
consumers to boycott products from NATO countries participating in
the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, demonstrators in the city blocked a convoy of
eight French military vehicles and 48 containers loaded with
supplies for a French contingent in Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Five Major Exhibition Halls for Horti-Expo '99 (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International
Horticultural Exposition is scheduled to open in Kunming, capital
of southwest China's Yunnan Province, on May 1. Following is a
brief introduction to the five major exhibition halls at the venue
of the exposition:
</P>
<P>
The indoor exhibition area for the '99 International
Horticultural Exposition consists of five exhibition halls, namely
the China Hall, the Human and Nature Hall, the Grand Greenhouse,
the Science and Technology Hall and the International Hall.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 33,000 sq m and with a total floor space of
16,800 sq m, the China Hall ranks first among the five major
exhibition halls in terms of architectural functions. It has
adopted the traditional Chinese garden design, with three
courtyards interconnected by corridors. There are ponds, rockeries,
small bridges, weird stones and pretty flowers and trees in the
courtyards. The theme of the China Hall is "Splendid Gardens and
Gardening Art of China". It has provided all provinces and regions
across China with a chance to display their time-honored history
of horticulture and distinct gardening arts.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5,000 sq m in floor space, the Human and Nature Hall is
shaped like a trefoil. With "Man and Nature" as its theme, the
hall is divided into three sub-halls, namely the hall of indoor
ornamental plants, the "mankind and global ecology" hall and the
hall of vegetables, medicinal herb and traditional Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Reputed as a small "kingdom of plants", the Grand Greenhouse is
divided into three parts, devoted, respectively, to flowers,
tropical plants and Alpine plants, with four separate exhibition
zones displaying tropical rain forest, temperate zone plants, sub-
tropical plants and Alpine plants respectively. There are also a
large number of rare and precious plants and gardening
masterpieces from all over the world in the greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of more than 6,000 sq m, the Science and
Technology Hall, which seems like a combination of geometric
figures in its external shape, is intended to present the theme of
"Horticulture and Science and Technology". On display in the hall
are the latest scientific and technological achievements in the
field of horticulture worldwide. There is also a large ball-shape
cineorama in front of the hall.
</P>
<P>
With a height of 21 meters, the International Hall is mainly
devoted to masterpieces of horticultural works from all over the
world. Designers of this structure said that it symbolizes
equality, unity and harmony among peoples across the world in
their march toward the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan to Discuss Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan, Turkmenistan and
Afghanistan will open talks on a proposed 2 billion U.S. dollar
gas pipeline project here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan's Deputy Prime Minister Batyr Sardaev and Taliban
official for mines and industries Ahmed Jan have arrived here for
the talks, official sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, minister for petroleum and natural
resources, will lead the Pakistani delegation in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The planned 1,280-kilometer gas pipeline will carry gas to
Pakistan from Turkmenistan via Afghanistan. It will connect the
Dauletabad gas field in southeastern Turkmenistan with Multan in
Pakistan's Punjab Province.
</P>
<P>
The gas pipeline, which will be 48 inches in diameter, is
planned to carry 20 billion cubic meters of gas every year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed pipeline, the first major economic investment in
Afghanistan in the last two decades, will run through the west and
south of the country which is now under the Taliban's control.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Turkmenistan are very interested in the early
construction of the project. However, instability in war-torn
Afghanistan is believed to be the main hurdle to the project.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan is the only country which has sent its foreign
minister to the Taliban's stronghold of Kandahar, the second
largest city in Afghanistan, for talks with the Taliban's supreme
leader, Mullah Omar. It also hosted the face-to-face talks between
the Taliban and their rival, the Northern Alliance, in Ashgabat in
March this year.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Session Ends in Thailand With Call for Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) ended the 55th Session
here Wednesday with a call for reform and regional cooperation to
realize comprehensive economic and social recovery.
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.N. body unanimously adopted the report of the
session which contains resolutions calling for greater economic
and financial monitoring and surveillance in the region.
</P>
<P>
The report also highlights sustained development of inland
water transport, involvement of older persons in the work of the
United Nations and national socioeconomic programs and closer
regional cooperation in tackling the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
In her closing statement, Nyam-Osoryn Tuya, chairperson of the
session, urged governments in the region to sustain efforts and
speed up reforms toward economic recovery and enhance
international and regional initiatives for revamping global
economic frameworks.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that the Asian crisis was not the first one in the
last few years and that it may not be the last in the coming
years, countries are encouraged to fully participate in the
formulation of a new international financial system," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also emphasized the need for growth with equity, saying the
liberalization process has to be managed carefully by countries in
line with the conditions of domestic institutions, level of human
resources development and economic governance.
</P>
<P>
The 55th Session of ESCAP began last Thursday with the Senior
Officials' Segment, followed by the Ministerial Meeting, which was
opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
The theme chosen for this year's session was "Asia and the
Pacific Into the Twenty-First Century: Information Technology,
Globalization, Economic Security and Development."

<P>
"The ACWF and all women in China strongly support the important
speech made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the issue of
Kosovo, and the principled stand of the Chinese government against
NATO's airstrike against Yugoslavia," said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF and all Chinese women admire greatly the national
spirit of the Yugoslav people in safeguarding state sovereignty
and territorial integrity, as well their spirit in bravely
combating the powerful invaders.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF and Chinese women will always strongly support the
righteous struggle of the Yugoslav people, including the women,
against foreign intrusion and interference to maintain its sacred
sovereign and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav people, who have a glorious tradition of resisting
Fascists, will persist until the end, the announcement insisted.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the ACWF and Chinese women will continue to
concern themselves with the situation of Yugoslav women and
children.
</P>
<P>
Finally, it strongly called on all women around the globe to
rise up and reject this war, and urged NATO, with the U.S. in the
lead, to stop immediately the bombing against Yugoslavia and seek
a new approach for political settlement of the issue of Kosovo, so
that "the Yugoslav children could once again possess a peaceful
and serene sky and a complete hometown," and so that "all mothers
in Yugoslavia will be able to smile again."

<HEADLINE> Horti-Expo '99 Stimulates Yunnan Tourism in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the '99 International
Horticulture Exposition scheduled to open in its provincial
capital of Kunming on May 1, Yunnan Province in southwest China
witnessed a sharp rise in the number of tourists it received in
the first quarter of the year, the provincial tourism
administration reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from January to March, Yunnan received
nearly eight million domestic and foreign tourists and garnered 4.
007 billion yuan (about 500 million US dollars) in total earnings,
a 20.66 percent year-on-year rise.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial tourism official, the first quarter
used to be a slack tourism season in Yunnan. This year, however,
many tourists, particularly those from overseas regions, have
shown very strong interest in this plateau province in deepest
China after learning that Yunnan will play host to the world
horticultural show.
</P>
<P>
"In the first three months of this year, there was an influx of
700,000 overseas tourists into our province, a 32.6 percent rise
year-on-year," said the official, adding that many of them came
from countries bordering on Yunnan, such as Vietnam, Laos and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of domestic tourists to Yunnan also
exceeded 7.17 million in the period, a 16.75 percent growth over
the same period of 1998, said the official.
</P>
<P>
"This is really a great success for us, as there are many
important festivals, such as the Chinese Lunar New Year, in this
period, during which many people prefer to stay at home for family
reunion instead of traveling around," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan expects to attract some 10 million domestic and overseas
tourists during the six-month run of the horticulture exposition.
Local analysts now predict that the actual figure could turn out
to be much higher if the province's tourism sector can maintain
its current growth momentum.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the peace process could be moved forward if
Arafat refrains from doing so, otherwise, the 1993 Oslo accords
could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords
if he wins in the May 17 elections.

The PLO is discussing in Gaza whether to declare statehood on
May 4.

Netanyahu opposes unilateral Palestinian statehood declaration,
threatening to annex parts of the West Bank now under Israeli
control. The peace process could only be moved forward through
negotiations, he said, adding that no unilateral actions could
help.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that Israel could not accept the resolution
adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission Tuesday in
Geneva, which calls for Palestinian self-determination on the
basis of the U.N. partition resolution 181 adopted in 1947.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Attitude Turns Tough on Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi reiterated Ethiopia's position that Eritrea needs to
officially declare that it will withdraw its troops from "all
Ethiopian land and agree to set a short time frame for the
withdrawal".
</P>
<P>
Meles made the remarks when meeting with U.N. Special Envoy for
Africa Mohammed Sahnoun here Wednesday, the office of Ethiopian
Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun is currently touring the Horn of Africa, aiming at
ending the 11- month conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Eritrea of invading Ethiopia's land,
saying, "Noting that Eritrea invaded Ethiopia's sovereign
territory in May 1998, Meles emphasized the importance of undoing
the invasion before other matters can be contemplated."
</P>
<P>
"As long as Ethiopian territory remains under Eritrean
occupation, it is impossible to discuss a cease-fire and negotiate
a resolution to the border conflict," the Ethiopian Premier was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun told Meles that he will continue with his efforts, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun arrived here Tuesday after holding talks in Asmara with
Eritrean leaders Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have nominally accepted the peace
plan proposed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), but so
far no cease- fire has been agreed.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia accepted the OAU framework agreement last November
while Eritrea accepted it in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The 11-month border conflict escalated into fierce fighting in
June 1998 and in February and March this year.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun's last visit to the Horn of African was in early
February this year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Play Positive Role in Solving Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Wednesday that Russia and Greece both support the
United Nations to play a positive role in the political settlement
of the current Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov made the remark at a joint press conference after a
meeting with his Greek counterpart George Papandreou,who arrived
here on a working visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said that their meeting focused on the present situation in
the Balkan region, saying both countries agreed to set up a
special working team for providing aid to Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
On the latest U.S. announcement of sending reserves to the
Balkan region, Ivanov said that Russia is opposed to any action
that might make the situation there more complicated, including
oil embargo and ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
These actions will cause heavy casualties on both sides, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Papandreou said that such actions "should not
happen," adding that the damage NATO has inflicted to the region
could not be healed within the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
He complained that NATO's military action in the region has
brought serious economic loss to Greece which has a big investment
in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Orders for U.S. Durable Goods Up 2 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
big-ticket durable goods from refrigerators to tanks rose 2
percent to a seasonally adjusted 197.7 billion U.S. dollars in
March, with improvement showing in most sectors, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase followed a much bigger decline in demand for
durable goods in February, although revised figures pegged that
drop at 3.9 percent, not as bad as the 5.0 percent decline first
estimated.
</P>
<P>
Economists had predicted a modest rebound in March. However,
many analysts remain concerned about signs of weakness in U.S.
industry.
</P>
<P>
American manufacturers have been hurt by world economic
troubles that began in Asia nearly two years ago. Export sales
have plummeted, and low-priced imports have increased competition
for consumers' attention here.
</P>
<P>
The recovery in durable-goods orders in March was led by the
military industry, which saw a 36.2 percent jump in new orders.
Excluding defense items, orders for all other goods rose 1 percent
for the month.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders rose 3.6 percent in March after a large,
12.8 percent drop in February that was somewhat skewed by a
downward swing in demand for aircraft.
</P>
<P>
March orders for electronic and other electrical equipment rose
3.1 percent, and for industrial machinery and equipment, rose 2.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The soft spot in March durable-goods orders was primary metals,
where demand fell 1.4 percent after a wild upward swing of 7.3
percent in February. The steel industry, which falls into this
sector, has been among the hardest hit by economic hard times
abroad and is seeking government protection from low-priced
imports.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Proposes Multi-Ethnic Govt. in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday proposed
establishing a representative multi-ethnic government through an
indigenous process in Afghanistan to realize durable peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Illahi Bukhsh Soomro, speaker of
Pakistan's National Assembly, at a banquet he hosted in honor of
the visiting Chairman Gennady Seleznev of the State Duma (lower
house) of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
"The Afghanistan tragedy is a source of great concern to us.
For the last 20 years Pakistan has exerted all possible efforts,
individually and together with other countries, for the
restoration of durable peace and stability in that country,"
Soomro noted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this can best be achieved on the basis of a
representative multi-ethnic government through an indigenous
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soomro stressed that "the return of peace and normalcy in
Afghanistan will not only be in the interest of the people of
Afghanistan but of the entire region."
</P>
<P>
"It will also create new opportunities for cooperation between
Pakistan and Russia. We as parliamentarians can join hands in
achieving this common goal," Soomro added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Kashmir, Soomro expressed his hope that Russia
as a world power will play its due role in promoting an amicable
settlement of the issue and preventing an arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Without a settlement of the Kashmir issue there cannot be full
normalization of relations between India and Pakistan and the
threat of conflict will continue to cast dark shadows on the
region," the speaker stressed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, as a developing country, wants to devote its
resources to the well-being and prosperity of its people, said
Soomro. "It seeks to achieve normal, friendly and cooperative
relations with all its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Soomro said Pakistan is also keen to avert a nuclear arms race
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan attaches great importance to its relations with the
Russian Federation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that Seleznev's visit to Pakistan
will not only help promote relations between the two parliaments
but also between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Soomro said Seleznev's visit, less than a week after Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's trip to Russia, "is indicative of the
mutual desire of our governments and peoples to overcome the
distrust and differences of the past and lay down the foundation
of a new edifice of friendly and cooperative relations."
</P>
<P>
He also said Seleznev's visit will greatly help promote mutual
trust and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev, accompanied by a 49-member entourage, arrived here
earlier Wednesday on a three-day visit at the invitation of
Soomro. Apart from the capital city, the Russian delegation will
also tour Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city and the
provincial capital of Punjab.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Adopts Law on Banning Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian National
Assembly Wednesday adopted a law to ban the use of land mines.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, no one is allowed to use any kind of
anti-personnel land mines under any circumstances except for
training purposes.
</P>
<P>
"And the user will be imprisoned from 10 to 20 years and will
be fined in cash from 10 million riel (about 2,600 U.S. dollars)
to 20 million riel (about 5,200 dollars)," the law states. In
addition, those who used land mines and killed people will be
punished by law.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Mouly, president of the Cambodian Mines Action Center
(CMAC), told reporters that "the law is of great significance for
the entire Cambodian people and it will help greatly reduce the
loss of lives and property."
</P>
<P>
Ieng Mouly said, "365,000 hectares of land in Cambodia were
minefields and so far, only 6,000 hectares have been cleared of
mines."
</P>
<P>
Land mines have already killed more than 13,000 people and
disabled 100,000 others in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the efforts of the government and the CMAC, the
number of accidents relating to land mines has dropped to 50 from
150 per month in the last two years, well down from 600 a month in
1992," Ieng Mouly added.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia signed the Ottawa Treaty against the use, stockpiling,
production and transfer of anti-personnel mines in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Israel Protest Against U.N. Resolution on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Foreign Ministry
has lodged a protest against a resolution adopted by the United
Nations Human Rights Commission, which supports Palestinian
self-determination on the basis of the U.N. partition resolution
181 adopted in 1947.
</P>
<P>
With European support, the commission adopted on Tuesday in
Geneva the resolution on the Palestinian issue, which also calls
for the right of Palestinian refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
Israel's lobbying efforts to prevent the Geneva voting failed,
and the United States was the only country among the 53 attendance
that voted against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday night
blasting the resolution and expressing particular disappointment
at the European support.
</P>
<P>
Such a move "distances Europe from involvement it could have in
the peace process," the statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The ministry sent a strong protest to the U.N. on Wednesday,
criticizing the commission for passing the resolution without
mentioning the foundation of the peace process set in the
U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's version of explanation, the two
resolutions entitle Israel not to return all its occupied Arab
territories while at the same time urge its Arab neighbors to
recognize Israel's security.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Entry Will Boost Solidarity: ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Rodolfo C. Severino
said Wednesday that he believes Cambodia's entry into the regional
grouping will strengthen its solidarity.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency here, Severino said the
membership of Cambodia would increase the diversity of ASEAN and
would even influence the consensus process, understanding and
positions of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
Severino acknowledged that with more countries joining ASEAN,
the organization will have more difficulty in reaching consensus.
</P>
<P>
"But despite the difficulties, we need Southeast Asian
solidarity, cooperation and integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Southeast Asian nations have more need to come
together to face the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In this globalization era, one nation, no matter how rich or
big, can no longer survive alone. Globalization leaves ASEAN no
other choice but to stick together," he said.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony will be held in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Friday to admit
Cambodia, finally fulfilling the ASEAN dream of including all the
10 countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was originally supposed to join ASEAN in July 1997.
But its membership was put on hold when a bitter political feud
between the then Co-Prime Ministers Hun Sen and Prince Norodom
Ranariddh burst into the open that month.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, founded in 1967, currently groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Severino pointed out that ASEAN has many dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
"To have ASEAN's voice heard in the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the United Nations and dialogues with its partners, ASEAN
has to speak together, otherwise nobody will listen," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's dialogue partners include China, the United States,
Japan, the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South
Korea, India and Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the China-ASEAN relations, Severino said ASEAN has good
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN and China have many channels for holding talks, like the
foreign ministers meeting and senior officials meeting, the
secretary general said, adding that ASEAN also cooperates with
China in trade and investment and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN appreciates China's effort to uphold its currency, which
contributes much to the stability of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN supports China's early entry into WTO, which he said will
help the Sino-ASEAN trade relations.

</P>
<P>
The total investment of the railway is estimated at 9.85
billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) and construction

<HEADLINE> NATO Breaching Geneva Convention: British Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A committee chaired by a British
Member of Parliament said on Wednesday that the latest massacre by
NATO of civilians in Yugoslavia confirmed that NATO is breaching
the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, chaired by Alice Mahon,
a member in the House of Commons, said in a statement that a NATO
guided weapon on Tuesday massacred between 20 and 40 civilians,
including at least 11 children, when it hit a residential area.
</P>
<P>
The massacre confirmed again that "NATO is now routinely
violating the 1949 Geneva Convention which outlaws targeting of
civilians in war," the committee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The cornerstone of the 1949 Convention is the duty to protect
the life, health and safety of civilians and other non-combatants.
All warring parties have a duty to do everything possible to avoid
civilian targets and casualties," said the committee.
</P>
<P>
"Since NATO started bombing Yugoslavia, three times more
civilians may have been killed by NATO per day than the total
average daily deaths in the preceding year of civil war in Kosovo,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Geneva Convention governing the conduct of war,
which is binding on all states, it is specifically stated that
'civilians shall not be the object of attack,' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"By these criteria NATO has already committed numerous war
crimes in Yugoslavia including the deliberate and premeditated
decision to kill and maim civilians working in the Belgrade
television center on 23 April," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The committee called for those responsible for the crimes,
whether they be military commanders or politicians, to be brought
to justice.
</P>
<P>
The committee for Peace in Balkans was founded early this
decade to promote peace and reconciliation in the Balkan countries.
It strongly condemned NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia from
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
A number of British MPs are working in the committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Total assets of Hong Kong's
Exchange Fund amounted to 927.1 billion HK dollars (about 118.9
billion U.S. dollars) at the end of March, 5.8 billion HK dollars
(about 743.6 million U.S. dollars) higher than at the end of
February.
</P>
<P>
According to the Exchange Fund Abridged Balance Sheet and
Currency Board Account published by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) Wednesday, the increase in total assets reflected
an increase of 10.7 billion HK dollars in HK dollar assets, which
was partly offset by a decrease of 5.0 billion HK dollar in
foreign currency assets.
</P>
<P>
In releasing the figures, the HK MA said the increase in HK
dollar assets was mainly due to appreciation in market value of
the Hong Kong equities held by the Exchange Fund, and the decrease
in foreign currency assets can mainly be attributed to reversal in
note issuing activities in March after the Chinese New Year.

JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to
declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year.
</P>

Talking to reporters before meeting with foreign diplomats here

<P>
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could

Arafat has stated many times in the past that he has the right

The Palestine Liberation Organization Central Council is

Netanyahu opposes unilateral Palestinian statehood declaration,

The peace process could only be moved forward through
negotiations, he said, adding that no unilateral actions could
help.
</P>

Meanwhile, he said that Israel could not accept the resolution
adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission Tuesday in
Geneva, which calls for Palestinian self-determination on the
basis of the U.N. partition resolution 181 adopted in 1947.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Donates Rare Trees to Horti-Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An ethnic minority in southwest
China's Yunnan Province has turned down an offer by a Japanese
tourist for buying a rare species of tree in large quantities for
10,000 yuan each and donated some of them to the '99 International
Horticultural Exposition instead.
</P>
<P>
The first world exposition to be held in a developing country,
the '99 horticulture show is scheduled to open in Kunming, capital
of Yunnan, on May 1 and last through October.
</P>
<P>
The trees, known as alexgeorgei or "Jishegougu" in Chinese,
were moved into the Tree Garden at the expo venue last summer from
the Gulu Township in the suburbs of Kunming, where people of the
Yi ethnic group, one of the 25 ethnic minorities in Yunnan, reside.
</P>
<P>
For generations the Yi people have planted such trees, whose
long and slim leaves look like chicken's tongues, around their
residences because the trees maintain exuberant leaves speckled
with little red fruit even in winter.
</P>
<P>
However, they had never actually realized the value of the tree
until early 1998, when a Japanese tourist, obviously well-versed
in botany, came to the town. Excited at first sight of the trees,
the Japanese asked the local people to sell him some of the trees
for 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Though 10,000 yuan means an annual income of a local family,
the Yi people turned down the offer without hesitation. Meanwhile,
they immediately invited botanists from Kunming to give the tree a
full evaluation.
</P>
<P>
"We found that this tree is a species of the holly family never
reported before. Apart from ornamental value, the tree also has
significant economic value, as its fruit, leaves and bark can be
used to make medicine for treating rheumatoid arthritis," said
Jiang Zhixiang, one of the botanists who visited the Gulu Township.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, also chief advisor to the horticultural
show, the trees donated by the Yi people have all survived
transplantation, with new sprouts bursting out.

KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- If you couldn't be in Kunming
when the '99 International Horticultural Exposition opens here
Friday evening, just start your computer at 8 p.m., access to the
Internet and there you may enjoy the entire opening ceremony
broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
"Don't miss the last grand international gathering of this
century," says an online advertisement presented by the Yunnan
Provincial Infoport, www.yn.cninfo.net, one of the service
providers for live broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The horticultural show in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province,
is the first international exposition to be hosted by China, or by
a developing country.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time for China to introduce on-line
broadcast of the opening ceremony of a major international
activity it hosts.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 professional and amateur performers will attend a
large entertainment show Friday evening after the horti-expo is
declared open. Journalists and Kunming citizens who have had the
chance to watch the rehearsals described the show, titled "A
romantic melody of heaven and earth", as very exciting and
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony and performance will also be broadcast
live on www.expo99.net, a website opened on March 1 specially for
the upcoming expo. As the Chinese government's first attempt to
use the Internet for publicity of an international activity held
in China, the website has to date received more than 70,000 visits.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the opening ceremony, we will plan to broadcast
live the inauguration of the expo venue scheduled at 8 a.m. on May
1, as well as some other major events during the six-month run of
the exposition," said Deng Hengyuan, one of the operators of the
expo website.
</P>
<P>
As China's several previous attempts of Internet broadcast,
including one by the China Central Television to broadcast its
1999 Chinese Lunar New Year entertainment soiree worldwide, have
unexpectedly encountered problems like communication jam and even
website breakdown, telecommunication departments in Yunnan have
spent big money on upgrading the facilities of both websites.
</P>
<P>
"Our website alone can accept one million visitors at a time,"
said Deng.

<P>
"We know that many families are really struggling now," said
Burk Oberle, WFP's country director for Somalia. "Their stocks are
either weak or dying; safe drinking water is in short supply, and
the region's entire economy is becoming more fragile by the day."
</P>
<P>
Puntland has been hit by drought since the end of last year.
Rains expected in December failed, and the region's main rain
season, which should have begun this month, is delayed.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agronomists predict that if rains are not received by
mid-May, thousands of head of livestock may die. This would
devastate the livelihood of over 100,000 nomadic pastoralists, who
are dependent on their animals as a direct food source.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in Puntland by the U.N. Food Security
Assessment Unit (FSAU) , which works closely with WFP, indicates
that livestock milk production in the region is about one-fifth of
the normal amount for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
Pasture is considered to be very poor, and animals such as
sheep and goats are dying at unusually high rates due to the lack
of water.
</P>
<P>
Since November last year, WFP has been running a large
emergency operation in southern Somalia. So far WFP has
distributed over 11,500 tons of relief food in south Somalia under

<HEADLINE> NY FWA President: It's Encouraging to be in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The president of the New York
Financial Women's Association (FWA) Lenore Albom, who is here
heading a FWA delegation to China, told Xinhua in an interview
that it is encouraging to be in China, and that all the members of
the delegation have favorable views about this country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation comprises about 50 women Wall Street CEOs,
including vice presidents with the Citizens Bank and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
The FWA was founded in 1956 by six women and has grown into an
influential organization of 1,100 members who work as bankers,
securities analysts, investors and so on.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to find investment opportunities," said Albom, who
herself is vice-president with Chase Securities, explaining that
China is in the midst of a critical transition, moving from a
central government-controlled economy to a more decentralized, and
varied one. "It is experiencing an industrial revolution and an
information revolution simultaneously, offering enormous
opportunities to the world," she added.
</P>
<P>
Each year the FWA targets an international destination and that
China has been chosen for the third time within two decades is
rare in the history of the FWA and it is an indication of the
importance China has.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing, the delegation
believes it has a fair understanding of what is going on in China.
"Everyone is excited, and agrees unanimously that the prospects
for the country are terrific," said Albom, who seemed to be
particularly impressed by the sharing of advanced U.S. technology
in some Sino-U.S. joint ventures, using the General Motors (
Shanghai) project as an example.

<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
expressed the conviction today that Macao's stable transition can
be realized smoothly through Sino-Portuguese efforts and
implementation of reached agreements.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks in a meeting with former Australian Prime
Minister Paul Keating.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian said that the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), initiated by Australia, is conducive to better
communications between countries in the region. He expressed his
appreciation for Keating's efforts to promote Sino-Australian
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Regional peace and stability require regional cooperation
organization rather than regional military alliance," Qian said.
He added that China is willing to develop friendship and
cooperation with Japan geared to the 21st century, and with regard
to a correct view of history.
</P>
<P>
"Japan should adopt a correct view towards history," agreed
Keating, who is here at the invitation of the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Keating also exchanged views on other issues of mutual
concern.

</P>
<P>
The delegation visited several government agencies including
the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, where those sharp-witted women put quite a
few insightful questions.
</P>
<P>
Albom also voiced her hope that China enters the World Trade
Organization as quickly as possible, as she is convinced that will
bring great benefits to both China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the delegation paid special attention to the role of
Chinese women in the financial sector. Albom described those women
leaders in government or enterprises as "smart and capable",
adding that she will never forget her meeting with Chinese State
Councilor Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
"The 12-day trip is just too short," Albom said. "We will
present our findings about what we've seen and heard here to Wall
Street for analysis when we are back there, and also list China's
experiences in all training programs sponsored by the FWA, both of
which will help the Chinese model."
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I think that some members of our delegation are
already pondering the possibility of investing in China," she
smiled.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military on
Wednesday closed the Area "A" of Jenin in the West Bank following
a shotting incident in which an Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldier
was wounded, according to a senior Palestinian Security officer.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military announced the closure of Area "A" and
turned it into a military zone shortly after the shotting incident
Wednesday noon, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security forces opened fire at and wounded the IDF
solider who attempted to enter the area near Saylat Al-Harithiya
village north of Jenin, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian forces asked the soldier to stop, but he went
on in defiance of the warning, the officer added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Israeli army said the IDF soldier was shot and
wounded in a village north of Jenin when an unknown gunman opened
fire at him.
</P>
<P>
The gunman fled away in a civilian car and the IDF and police
are investing the case, the army said.
</P>
<P>
This was the third shooting incident that occurred in the West
Bank since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
On January 4, a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a Jewish
settler's van and wounded three women settlers in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, the IDF troops in the city shot dead a
Palestinian youth named Badar Kawasshmeh.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, Area "A" is under total Palestinian control,
while in Area "B" the security affairs are in the hands of the
Israeli military and civil affairs under the Palestinian
administration. Area "C" is totally under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye peace accord signed by Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority last october, Israel had pullout
its troops from most of the Jenin area by the end of last
year.

<HEADLINE> China Successful in Increasing Onshore Oil Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- After 30 odd years of scientific
research and practice, China has scored remarkable progress in
increasing crude oil recovery by developing oil polymer driven
technology, and plans to introduce it to all onshore oilfields
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to Han Dakuang, a senior specialist at the China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), most of the country's oilfields
belong to the complex continental deposits as far as reserve
layers are concerned, with thick crude and oil wells containing
more water.
</P>
<P>
He said that the polymer driven technology is the most useful
way to solve the above mentioned problems. "It has become a
pressing task to develop oil recovery technology, for two thirds
of such crude reserves remains to be extracted," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The specialist noted that as early as the 1960s, China started
interior experiments with the polymer driven technology and
achieved positive results in Xinjiang and Daqing, the country's
largest oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has carried out six pilot experiments in
the oilfields of Daqing, Dagang and Henan, resulting in the
decline of the water content and higher crude output in these
oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1990s, the country expanded the experiments
into industrial production, with more satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
The specialist said that the polymer driven technology is very
promising and more mature in terms of technological application,
which produced higher economic returns after being applied to the
country's various major oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that injection of one ton of polymer into the
oil wells will turn out an additional 167 tons of crude.
</P>
<P>
To provide more polymer for the oilfields, the country has set
up the world's largest polymer making plant with an annual
production capacity of more than 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The specialist expects the country to pump out an additional 10
million tons of crude annually by the year 2000 by spreading the
use of the new technology in the onshore oilfields nationwide.

</P>
<P>
"Some lawyers are not discharging their duties by toeing the
line of the law, and lack a sense of social responsibility." he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"They are breaking away from the law in pursuit of economic
interest, or out of personal favoritism. Exorbitant fees were
found to have been imposed on litigants in some places," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These problems are getting worse despite repeated bans and
rectification efforts," he said, warning that they are "tarnishing
the image" of the legal profession as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Those 'black sheep' should not be left at large, and the new
leadership must assume the responsibility of redressing such ills
and exercising self-regulation over the profession," Gao said .
</P>
<P>
He called for an immediate installation of a committee for
handling violations of ethical code of conducts in line with the
lawyers law and related regulations of the Justice Ministry.  (

<HEADLINE> Article Reveals Cruelty of Feudal Serfdom in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The overseas edition of People's
Daily today carried an article which reveals the true condition of
Tibetan people's personal rights under feudal serfdom which ended
40 years ago, saying it was absolutely necessary to abolish the
backward and reactionary system.
</P>
<P>
An attached editor's note commented that "the article proved
the necessity to carry out the democratic reforms in Tibet in 1959
and to thoroughly abolish feudal serfdom", and refuted the Dalai
Lama's claims to be concerned about the condition of human rights
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In the article, the author Gyadun pointed out that personal
rights and freedom should be a key part of human rights, which,
however, were hardly enjoyed by serfs who accounted for 95 percent
of the Tibetan population in the old period.
</P>
<P>
Before the democratic reforms in 1959, Tibet was under the rule
of the Dalai Lama-led despotic theocratic authority, which was
composed of administrative officials, the nobility, and high-
ranking lamas representing only the rights and interests of serf
owners. Serfs were forced to be in bondage to the three categories
of feudal lords and were deprived of personal freedom throughout
their lives.
</P>
<P>
Under the extremely backward and reactionary system, the serfs'
fate was dominated by the owners so much that they could be beaten,
transported, presented as gifts or sold as the owners liked, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a Tibetan archive as proving that even the marriage
of serfs could be decided by their lords. The document revealed
that an adopted daughter of a serf in the Nequng Temple, named
Lhaba, was transferred to a migrant to marry him after the
temple's senior lama paid the serf an amount of money.
</P>
<P>
In the old Tibet, the relationship between serfs and their
owners was called "mi-rtsa", or "human root", which meant that
every serf had his or her own root and had to be ruled by the lord.

<TEXT>
<P>
In attempt to prevent serfs from escaping, the then Tibetan
administration published strict laws. For instance, an order
issued by the 13th Dalai Lama to all local governments and temples
prohibited officials and monks from sheltering runaway serfs. The
Tibetan government of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) set up an
official position, called "so-nam-las-khungs", to take
responsibility for recapturing escaped serfs.
</P>
<P>
A poll tax in the old Tibet, known as "mi-bogs", was another
form of serf ownership to bind them to their masters. The system
forced traveling serfs including craftsmen, peddlers and even
beggars to pay an annual poll tax to their original lords no
matter how far they traveled.
</P>
<P>
Codes in the old Tibet divided people into three classes and
nine ranks, under which values of life varied from different ranks.
Tibetan kings, living Buddhas and the nobility on the top of the
class system were described as "priceless", however people at the
bottom, including blacksmiths, butchers, hunters and women, were
merely worth a "straw rope".
</P>
<P>
With the help of the law, the serf-owners applied extremely
cruel penalties to those who defied superiors, such as the gouging
out of eyes, cutting off of feet, their tongues, or hands,
throwing people off cliffs or into water or simply executing them,
in order to maintain their rule, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Many Tibetan archives contain examples of different kinds of
instruments of torture used during the rule of Dalai Lama, as well
as photos taken in the 1950s, which depicted serfs whose eyes
were gouged out and hands or feet were cut off.

<TEXT>
<P>
Serfs in old Tibet were divided into three classes and received
different kinds of enslavement accordingly.
</P>
<P>
People belonging to the first two classes were called khral-pa
and dud-chung. They each made up 45 percent of the total
population in old Tibet. The third class of serf, nang-gzan, which
accounted for five percent of the total population, had the lowest
social status of all three.
</P>
<P>
Feudal lords gave khral-pa, or people who rented farmland to
till, plots of land and houses which they could use for
generations. But khral-pa were not allowed to leave their land for
a long period of time or give it up. They also had to do tasks
both on the farmland and manors of their landlords and had to pay
various types of tax.
</P>
<P>
When stricken by natural disasters or accidents, some khral-pa
borrowed usurious loans from the owners to make ends meet and were
thus further burdened by heavy debts.
</P>
<P>
Numbers of khral-pa did flee their rented land and houses but
would be beaten up by their lords and downgraded to mere slaves if
they were caught.
</P>
<P>
Dud-chung, which means small households, were humbler than
khral-pa, and were not qualified to rent land. They could only
till a small plot of land to make a living and throughout their
lives had to do all kinds of labor for their feudal lords. They
lived in small and rundown houses and only received a small amount
of food as payment from their landlords. They were not allowed to
leave the manors of their landlords.

<P>
Nang-gzan, or domestic slaves, had the lowest social status in
old Tibet and endured the poorest living conditions. They were
used as "tools" by feudal lords and were deprived of any human
rights. They did not own any farming tools, domestic animals or
land. They were not even allowed to marry or have families.
</P>
<P>
Feudal lords only provided nang-gzan with a minimum of living
necessities, and forced them to do all kinds of household work and
many hard outdoor tasks. They were often maltreated by their lords
and some were beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
Before the democratic reform in Tibet, feudal lords applied a
set of strict written or unwritten laws and regulations which were
intended to deprive serfs of their human rights.
</P>
<P>
First of all, when a child was born to a serf's family, he or
she would be registered with the recorder of population, which was
part of their feudal lords domain, and lost their freedom once and
for all. Serf owners collected tax both in kind and in labor from
serfs according to this population record.
</P>
<P>
Serfs, who were regarded as the private property of their
owners, had to work for feudal lords from the age of 15 to 60
years old, and could only shake off all the labor and tax burden
after a registered death.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, serfs who belonged to the same owner and wanted to
marry each other, had to ask for consent from their owners, and
marriages between serfs who belonged to different owners were
strictly controlled. Serfs had to give a certain amount of money
to redeem themselves from their original owners if they were
married to serfs owned by other feudal lords.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, feudal lords could deprive serfs of their personal
freedom at any time if they wanted to enlarge the production scale
of their farmland and manors, or wanted more serfs to do household
work.

<P>
The above facts truly demonstrate that the feudal serfdom
system had seriously hindered the development of the productive
forces in Tibet, and had to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Serf owners were only concerned with how they could exploit the
maximum amount of work and effort from serfs and slaves, but paid
no attention to their living and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
They had no idea how to improve the production tools and skills
of laborers and also did not know how to enhance productive forces
and invest properly to enlarge the production scale.
</P>
<P>
To give vent to their anger and complaints about poor living
conditions, serfs often went on a go slow in their work, made
petitions, destroyed production tools, refused to hand in tax or
paid back debts or just simply fled from their land and houses.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in large areas of farmland going to waste in
terms of cultivation, and in turn people's living standards
declined. The decreasing number of laborers in feudal manors also
led to the reduced income of feudal lords and caused economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In short, to abolish the feudal serfdom system in Tibet,
implement democratic reform, and get rid off the feudal hierarchy
was the only way to safeguard the human rights of Tibetan people
and provide them with equal opportunities to exercise their
political, economic and cultural rights and enjoy a happy life.

<HEADLINE> Dengue Fever Cases Rise Nearly 20 Folds in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of dengue fever
cases in Malaysia has increased by almost 20 folds since 1986,
Malaysian Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were only 1,408 cases with eight deaths in 1986, but the
number spiraled to 27,373 with 58 deaths in 1998, Chua told a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
From January to April 10 this year, dengue fever cases
increased by 6 percent to 4,373 with 11 deaths compared with 4,126
cases in the corresponding period of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned of the possibility of a large-scale serious outbreak
in six hot-spot states -- Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Perak, Pahang,
Kedah and Pulau Pinang -- if no immediate actions were taken to
clear the breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquito, the dengue
carrier.
</P>
<P>
Chua urged all government and private agencies and
non-governmental organizations to immediately conduct cleanliness
campaigns, saying the only way to arrest the dengue menace is to
get the fullest cooperation of all the people.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia launched a nationwide anti-mosquito and cleanliness
campaign on April 20 following the outbreak of the Japanese
Encephalitis (JE) and Nipah viral, which have already claimed more
than 100 lives.
</P>
<P>
Chua said that since the JE and Nipah viral outbreak had
abated, his ministry was now giving more attention to the dengue
fever menace.
</P>
<P>
Chua said most of the dengue fever cases occurred in urban
areas due to the increasing population and the rising number of
breeding places of the Aedes mosquito.
</P>
<P>
The 20-fold increase in the number of cases appeared to show
that Malaysians did not care about their surroundings anymore, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all Malaysians to participate in the on-going
anti-mosquito campaign.

<HEADLINE> Definition of "Model Worker" Alters in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A model worker in China gives
people an impression of someone who works very hard and even gets
ill constantly because of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
But model workers who are praised today in Shenyang, capital
city of northeast China's Liaoning Province, give people another
feeling -- for they are masters of new technology and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
A new rice variety developed by Fan Xiangjiu, a farmer at a
small town called Dingtao in Tieling City, brought more than 1.4
million yuan (168,670 US dollars) in economic profits for local
people. Fan only received a junior high school education and
became a self taught agro-technician.
</P>
<P>
Stepping down form the awards rostrum, Fan said," Technology is
badly needed in the countryside and I will use my know-how to
serve the farmers".
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 model workers were selected in Liaoning this
year and included were an increasing number of people who have
become rich by relying on science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of the model workers are enterprise managers; the
winners covered owners of private enterprises for the first time,
making up three percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
A list of 1,000 "national model workers" came out a few days
ago, including 174 researchers and technicians. A survey shows
that 48.6 percent of them graduated from colleges for professional
training and 27.3 of them have a senior title equaling to
professor.
</P>
<P>
"Model workers in the existing market economy should not only
have a good public image in society, but help to bring huge
economic profits," said Niu Gang, president of the Dashang Group,
the largest commercial group in the northeastern part of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Attracts Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai has attracted large numbers of birds
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows the city is now home to 429 species of
bird, of which, about 200 are under the protection of
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute this to an improving environment resulting
from the increasing awareness of the importance of environmental
protection among local residents.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic development and urban expansion had posed a
threat to the habitat of birds in the city, and local
ornithologists had been worried about it.
</P>
<P>
The city launched an annual "Love Birds Week" 18 years ago, and
has since spread knowledge about birds among millions of local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the municipal government set up a nature reserve on
Chongming Island to protect the habitat of rare birds.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, which is on a major migratory route for many birds,
has become a wintering place for some 100 bird species, including
cranes and storks.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Soccer Club Has No Money For Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Football Association of
Zambia (FAZ) has said it has no money to hold elections to chose
its new leadership as being demand by the government.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Wednesday quoted a FAZ source as saying that it
does not have the means to comply with the government directive to
put in office a new executive by May 7 to replace the out-of-favor
Teddy Mulonga administration.
</P>
<P>
Sports Council of Zambia (SCZ) General Secretary Mattew
Mulwanda was quoted as saying that "as far as the council is
concerned, the deadline of May 7 is still in force. We'll talk
about it when it lapses."
</P>
<P>
But another council member said the FAZ is merely time buying,
especially knowing FIFA is behind it.
</P>
<P>
"It would be just another tactic to buy time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mulonga won a confidence vote 34-30 at the council meeting of
the FAZ held last February but the government ignored the result
and ordered new elections within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Mulonga's executive has been under government squeeze since
April last year when his executive was dissolved by SCZ over
allegations that it had misapplied 577 million kwacha (about 230,
000 U.S. dollars) of a government grant given to it for last
year's Africa Cup of Nations finals in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The FAZ has been going though financial difficulties since the
government withdrew support to show its displeasure with the
association's national executive led by Teddy Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
Following Zambia's poor performance at the Africa Cup finals in
Burkina Faso in February of 1998, the FAZ executive was removed
two months later on the charge of misapplication of the money the
government released for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
World soccer governing body FIFA, reacting to what it saw as
government interference in the running of soccer, was on the verge
of banning Zambia from international football activities when the
government reluctantly restored in office the FAZ executive led by
Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
The government allowed in September in 1998 Mulonga and his
team back in office but it imposed a financial squeeze on the
association in a bid to force the current executive out.
</P>
<P>
The estrangement of the FAZ executive has cast a shadow on the
future of Zambian football given the fact the association is
dependent on the government financial support to fulfill its
various international engagements.
</P>
<P>
Last month government spokesman Newstead Zambia said that the
government is waiting for a new FAZ executive to be elected before
it could once again begin to provide the financial, moral and
logistical support it withdrew from the FAZ last year.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Pursue Budget Reforms in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to instituting reforms
in the government's expenditure program to ensure fiscal
discipline and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said these reforms include a shift from the present
cost-based method of managing public funds to the more efficient
performance-based procedure.
</P>
<P>
The reforms will also help his administration's campaign
against graft and corruption by promoting transparency and
integrity, Estrada said at the 63rd anniversary celebration of the
Department of Budget and Management.
</P>
<P>
"Let's always remember that most of the funds spent by the
government come from the efforts of our countrymen, like small
farmers, fishermen, laborers and small entrepreneurs and ordinary
employees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was pleased with the series of reforms
implemented by the department, among which is the formation of the
Budget Dialogue Group.
</P>
<P>
The group ensures the high-level representation and
participation of the cabinet, legislature, the business community,
experts and the people in the formulation of the national budget,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The group will also be involved in drafting rules and
procedures on how to come up with a medium-term budget framework
that aims to identify priority government programs, he added.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Discusses Donation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The draft law on public welfare
donations is of great significance to the nation and should be
approved as soon as possible, according to participants in the
ongoing ninth session of China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
The law will enhance protection of the legal interests of both
donors and beneficiaries, and further promote the social economic
development of the country, it was declared.
</P>
<P>
Gan Ziyu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC), said that as donations to
charities are becoming more popular than ever, more problems have
also popped up.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to have legislation that will regulate the
activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law decrees that only public welfare organizations,
non-profit making institutions and government departments at
county level or above are entitled to accept such donations.
</P>
<P>
In the discussions, some participants said the scope should be
enlarged, especially when it comes to numerous, small donations,
and that the law should pay more attention to the will of donors.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that government departments, whenever
possible, should not receive donations so as to avoid the
conflicts of interests.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, there was much disagreement over
whether the draft legislation includes the practice of soliciting
donations.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, a member of the NPC Standing Committee and noted
economist, said the draft law on donations should exclude
soliciting as to combine the two issues in one legislation would
create confusion.
</P>
<P>
"The draft should also make it more specific on the
preferential measures to be used to attract more donations," said
Gu Songfen, another member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Some suggested that the draft provide confidentiality to those
donors who prefer not to have their contributions made public.

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A court hearing started today
into the major fire that destroyed Beijing's Yuquanying Furniture
Center, the largest furniture market in the Chinese capital, last
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 observers watched as the two men accused of
responsibility for the fire, 37-year-old Zhang Jianguo and 54-
year-old Wang Jinlai, stood in the main hall of the People's Court
of Dongcheng District as official prosecutors read out details of
the case.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of May 5 last year, the Yuquanying Furniture
Center, covering 18,000 sq m and located in Fengtai District, some
ten km from Tiananmen Square, was burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The economic loss caused by the blaze is estimated at 20.87
million yuan. The first batch of compensation of five million yuan
(about 620,000 US dollars) has already been paid by Huatai
Insurance Ltd, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
According to experts the fire was caused due to the overheating
of an electric bell's coil.
</P>
<P>
The final verdict will be handed down after the court
investigations are completed in several days time, according to
information from the Dongcheng People's Court.

were in the spotlight again, as they attended a reception in
Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
The event just ahead of International Labor Day on May 1 aimed
to honor the great achievements that the retired workers had made
to the country, according to the China National Committee on
Ageing (CNAC), the country's largest non-governmental organization
of old people.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Ismail Amat said at the reception that the once
elite workers had played an active role in promoting social
progress and now they deserved the care and respect of the whole
society especially because of their seniority.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that President Jiang Zemin recently wrote words of
encouragement to demonstrate support for those working on behalf
of senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
The CNAC had invited the old people to Beijing from different
parts of the country, organizing sightseeing programs for them, as
well as letting them take part in seminars on population ageing
issues.
</P>
<P>
"Organizing such events was part of the CNAC's efforts to
arouse the public awareness of the value of old persons," said an
official with the association.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that prejudice, even discrimination, still exist in
the country due to ignorance about old people's contributions, as
well as an underestimation of their value. And the work in this
field has become more and more urgent since China's ageing
population is expanding rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The number of people aged 60 and older will reach 130 million
in China next year, accounting for one tenth of the total
population.

<HEADLINE> China Eastern Airlines Reports Loss in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The China Eastern Airlines
Corporation Ltd. (CEA), one of China's top three airways, reported
a loss of 632.4 million yuan in 1998 in its annual report
published in today's Shanghai Securities News.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the CEA's business proceeds stood at 8.6
billion yuan in 1998, falling from the previous year's 9.4 billion
yuan. However, the company suffered a severe loss last year
against a reported profit of 332 million yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share also sank from 0.068 yuan in 1997 to minus 0.
13 yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
An analysis in the report attributed the loss to a sluggish
demand in the aviation market both at home and in Asia, as well as
the cut-throat price war in the industry.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the difficulties, the CEA will adopt new measures
this year including modernizing its fleet by selling old planes
and buying new jets and expanding code sharing business with
international airways, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the CEA had an asset value of 27 billion
yuan, with 71 planes flying on 129 air routes, including 21
international lines.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will launch a
fresh crackdown on international crimes together with other
African countries, a senior police officer has said.
</P>
<P>
The police plan to identify possible targets before the action

</P>
<P>
The operation will be carried out with the assistance of other
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, as well
as Kenya and Uganda, Rajabu said, adding that tactics will be
similar to those of last year's crackdown on cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the nationwide swoop recovered more than 160
automobiles stolen from Tanzania, South Africa, Malawi and
Swaziland.

<P>
In addition, the police seized 27 guns and eight bullets,
cracked 13 drug cases and arrested a number of suspects.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President Challenges Rebels to Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah has urged the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
to "renounce violence and terror", and challenged them to meet at
the polling booth in less than 15 months' time.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation in a broadcast to mark 38th anniversary
of independence on Tuesday, the president said that coup and
counter-coup which have plagued the country since independence
"have not solved any of our economic, social and political
problems", The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since 1961, Sierra Leone has seen four major military coup
d'etats, two counter-coup d'etats, at least five attempted ones
and four palace coup d' etats in addition to eight years of bloody
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah noted that coup and counter-coup "have increased the
number and complexity of our problems", resulting in "wanton
killings of kith and kin".
</P>
<P>
He announced that an independent human rights commission would
be set up shortly "to strengthen existing mechanisms for the
protection of the basic rights of all Sierra Leoneans".
</P>
<P>
Kabbah made no direct reference to a statement by rebel leader
Foday Sankoh in Togo on Monday that he was prepared to declare a
ceasefire "which could be immediate, temporary or definitive."
</P>
<P>
In Lome, capital of Togo, 19 representatives of the RUF who
arrived last weekend are holding informal discussions with Sankoh
who was released temporarily from prison in Freetown for the
consultations with his followers.
</P>
<P>
The consultations are seen as a precursor to actual peace talks
between the rebels and the Kabbah government.
</P>
<P>
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), is closely
following the consultations along with ECOWAS Executive Secretary
Lansana Kouyate and envoys from the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
On the ground, the two sides of the Sierra Leone conflict are
fiercely defending their positions. The West African
peace-keeping force of ECOMOG holds capital Freetown and its
vicinity while the rebels control several strategic points
including the country's second largest city of Makeni.

<P>
JINAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Environment friendly motorcycles
which use a new technology to reduce exhaust emissions have been
developed by the Qingqi Group, China's motorcycle giant based in
Jinan, capital of east Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The volume of both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emitted by
the "green" motorcycles has been reduced by more than 70 percent
compared with the group's older machines.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the emission level is much lower than the official
country limit for motorcycles and is actually of international
standard, according to the provincial environment inspection
center.
</P>
<P>
Such "green" products indicate that China is now able to
control pollution caused by motorcycle exhausts.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 14 billion yuan worth of capital, The Qingqi
Group has three listed companies. It has over 80 sale outlets
scattered across the country.
</P>

<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Flowers and plants growing in the
gardens of the China '99 Kunming International Horticultural
Exposition are facing another severe challenge as the temperature
fell to a new low of 11.4 Celsius degrees this morning.
</P>
<P>
Information from the local weather station shows that the cold
weather is the result of the invasion by a cold current from
northern China.
</P>
<P>
Known as a "city of eternal spring", Kunming has experienced
abnormal weather conditions ever since the beginning of this year,
including heavy snow in the spring, followed by a long hot and dry
spell and the allegedly early arrival of the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
However, the rare flowers and plants at the '99 horticultural
exposition have successfully tided over the abnormal weather
conditions thanks to the meticulous care by gardeners.
</P>
<P>
The horticultural exposition, scheduled to open on May 1, is
hailed to have gathered an unprecedentedly great number of plants.
There are more than 500,000 square meters of turf, about 430,000
trees and shrubs of more than 2,000 species, and more than one
million pots of flowers.
</P>
<P>
An unusually heavy snow hit the city in mid-January, covering
up the whole Expo site for days. About one-third of the plastics-
covered greenhouses and sheds collapsed, with some of the tree
branches ruptured and many tropical and sub-tropical flowers and
plants endangered.
</P>
<P>
The whole city moved quickly to clear the snow and rescue the
rare species.
</P>
<P>
From early February to some days ago, the city fell into the
grip of a long hot and dry spell, with the highest temperature
reaching 30 Celsius degrees, close to the record 31.7 Celsius
degrees. All the irrigation facilities were called up, including
fire engines, to carry water from a nearby reservoir to the Expo
site.
</P>
<P>
The gardeners working there had to water the plants and flowers

A local meteorological official dismissed the worry about a
possible early arrival of the rainy season. "The rain last night
is favorable to the flowers and plants at the Expo site, since
most of the plants are tropical, sub-tropical and temperate, quite
used to the humid environment," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Bleeds as Brain Drain Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
lost 8.4 billion rand (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) of potential
income tax as a result of brain drain between 1994 and 1997,
Business Day newspaper Wednesday quoted a study as showing.
</P>
<P>
The emigration of graduates and professionals in the four years
cost the South African economy 285 billion rand (47.5 billion
dollars) in potential contributions to overall GDP.
</P>
<P>
The study, compiled by Reinhold Joubert, associate professor of
 economics at the University of South Africa, concludes that the
costs of emigration may not appear drastic in a single year, but
it will in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"Emigration is like syrup running from a spoon. If it starts to
run, it is difficult to stop."
</P>
<P>
South Africa was regarded as an immigration country until
1994, but has become an emigration country. Factors in the change
include crime, expectations of economic growth and potential
earnings and the promulgation of the Employment Equity Act.
</P>
<P>
The researchers say emigration is a rational response to the
act, which is aimed at making the work place representative of the
racial breakdown of the population as quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Guard Against Undue Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has called for caution in the privatization process in Kenya,
saying it should be selective to safeguard local enterprises from
undue foreign influence.
</P>
<P>
Moi told those involved in privatization process to ensure that
the affected enterprises were not conduits for inferior foreign
goods into the country, he was quoted as saying by Wednesday's
Kenya Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Noting the country was poised for newly industrialized status
by 2020, Moi told entrepreneurs to ensure that local industries

markets.
</P>

Moi made these remarks Tuesday at the Abothuguci Secondary
School in Meru Central District in Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for prudent use of all money

Moi pointed out that the globalization of the world economy
required that individual countries manage their affairs more
prudently.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, the president called for proper management
of the coffee and tea industries, saying that agriculture is the
backbone of the country's economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has expressed its
appreciation for Chile's action of destroying all New
Zealand-developed apple trees illegally grown in that country,
local media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Pat Murray, strategic marketing general
manager of Enza, the exporting trading arm of New Zealand's Apple
and Pear Marketing Board, as saying that Enza has greatly
appreciated Chile's prompt and positive affirmation of
international legislation to protect intellectual property rights
(IPR).
</P>
<P>
Enza's concern became public in January when it said it had
discovered 65,000 Sciros trees growing in Chile. The Sciros trees
produce patented Pacific Rose apples developed by the Horticulture
and Food Research Institute of New Zealand. Under the
international Plant Variety Rights Agreement, which Chile signed
last year, it is illegal for any country to grow plant varieties
patented by other growers.
</P>
<P>
Destroying all New Zealand-developed apple trees by Chile has
created a more favorable atmosphere for New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley to visit the country next month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Sales Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. March existing home
sales rose 0.6 percent to a record 5.05 million units from 5.02
million units in February, according to the National Association
of Realtors (NAR) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
March resales were up 3.7 percent from 4.87 million units a
year ago in March 1998, the NAR added.
</P>
<P>
"A combination of factors -- excellent housing affordability
conditions and a strong desire by consumers to buy -- are keeping
the market incredibly strong," NAR president Sharon Millett said.
"The months ahead look very promising."
</P>
<P>
By region, March resales were strongest in the West, where they
rose 2.8 percent, and weakest in the Northeast, which had a 2.7
percent drop last month. Sales rose 0.8 percent in the Midwest but
were unchanged in the South.
</P>
<P>
The NAR said the median price for an existing home was 132,700
U.S. dollars in March, up from 129,500 dollars in February and
also up from 127,100 dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts cited a robust labor market, affordable interest rates
and strong consumer demand as reasons behind the record increase.
</P>
<P>
"We've got an economy, I think, that is going to be unmatched
historically, possible going clearly into the year 2000," NAR vice
president Fred Flick told a news conference. "We are forecasting 3.
5 percent real growth in 1999."
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment rate and 30-year mortgage rates
remained low during the first three months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Haven for Plants Planned in Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States are
planning to invest five million US dollars to build a "botanical
haven" in southwestern China's Yunnan province in order to protect
the biological and cultural diversity there and help local people
eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
About the size of Ireland, the area will be a demonstrative
area for sustainable development. The Nature Conservancy of the
United States will contribute two million US dollars and Yunnan
Province will contribute three million US dollars, according to
Yunnan provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
Researchers of the two sides will cooperate closely in
protecting forests and endangered species of animals and in
controlling water loss and soil erosion, according to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
With a population of three million, the botanical haven is one
of the ten areas that are the most biodiversified in the world and
is home to such endangered animals as Yunnan golden monkey and
lesser panda.
</P>
<P>
The area is also one of the world's most important national
cultural heritage protection areas which are inhabited by more
than ten minority nationalities, each with a history of thousands
of years. The ancient city Lijiang, built by the ancestors of the
Naxi people, has been listed as one of the world's cultural
heritage. The written language used by the Naxi people is the only
pictograph still in use in the world.
</P>
<P>
Inaccessibility has held back the economic development in the
area. There are still more than 600,000 people in the areas who
have not solved the problem of inadequate food and clothing.
Poverty has resulted in over-dependency and excessive exploitation
of the natural resources, posing a mounting pressure and threat to
the ecological environment there.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the ecological environment in the area also has
a direct bearing on the life of billions of residents in southern
and southeastern Asian countries since the upstreams of the
Yangtze River, the Mekong River and the Nujiang River all flow
past the area," said a provincial official.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable development, advocated by the United Nations as a
global program of action, requires increasing global cooperation
to better protect and manage the global ecological system.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the project will find a way for both mountainous
areas that have not been much damaged and regions inhabited by
ethnic groups to attain economic prosperity while effectively
protecting the ecology," said Hao Jianxiu, vice minister of the
State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts and officials from both sides have gathered
here. They are required to complete a plan for the massive project
in 18 months and work out policies and rules and regulations that
will ensure the implementation of the plan.

<HEADLINE> Zambian-Congolese Border Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Acting chief government spokesman
of Zambia,

Bennie Mwiinga, said that Zambian government is still negotiating
with DRC over the release of the five Zambians, who were detained
by the heavily- armed DRC soldiers last Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The border post at Kasumbalesa in the north of Zambia has been
reopened, after its was closed Monday morning after five Zambian
surveyors were picked up and detained by government soldiers of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The border was reopened late Monday afternoon following
intensive negotiations between government officials of the two
countries, Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But the five Zambians abducted last Saturday have not yet been
released despite assurances by the captors that they would be
freed.
</P>
<P>
The five were on government duty checking the border line west
of Kasumbalesa barrier when the armed Congolese soldiers pounced
them and dragged them into their side.
</P>
<P>
The Zambians were accused of carrying out military data for the
rebels fighting to topple DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Later, the authorities of DRC have refused to free the five
Zambians and instead they have made fresh demands that five
unknown Congolese allegedly being held in Zambia for unknown
reasons be swapped, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The new demand took aback the Zambian reception team which was
at Kasumbalesa border post the whole day to receive the expected
freed Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Chijingu expressed profound disappointment at the turn of
events considering the promises the Congolese made on Monday to
free the Zambians.

</P>
<P>
The Education and Youth Department of the Macao government is

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Police Officer Accused of Taking Bribe in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan police officer in
charge of criminal investigations was charged with accepting a
bribe of 100 million shillings (100,000 U.S. dollar) to block
probe into a murder case.
</P>
<P>
Chris Bakiza, director of the Criminal Investigations
Department (CID), is said to have accepted the bribe from city
tycoon Karim Hirji to stop investigations into the 1997 murder of
motor rally driver Gerald Kiddu, the New Vision newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The allegations are contained in the terms of reference of the
newly- formed Judicial Commission of Inquiry into corruption in
the police force.
</P>
<P>
Bakiza is now on a six-month forced leave and is barred from
leaving the country without permission of the internal affairs
minister.
</P>
<P>
Kiddu, a business associate of Karim, was killed in 1997 by
unknown assailants at a friend's house in Bunga near Kampala. At
the time of his death he had been a rally driver while also being
employed by Dembe Enterprises, a company owned by Karim.
</P>
<P>
Bakiza is also accused of defying orders from the former
Inspector General of Police Cossy Odomel. He is said to have
defied orders to take actions on one Kalyango who had been
arrested on charges of highway robbery.
</P>
<P>
Bakiza's case, together with Cossy Odomel who was recently
removed from office on charges of abuse of office and corruption,
contributed to the transference of former Internal Affairs
Minister Tom Butime to another ministerial post in the latest
cabinet reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> PNG Stock Exchange Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Port Moresby Stock Exchange
in Papua New Guinea (PNG) was officially launched Wednesday and
began a trial period of trading.
</P>
<P>
PNG Commerce and Industry Minister Ian Ling-Stuckey said the
launch of the stock exchange was crucial to the PNG government's
attempts to successfully conclude the PNG's first sovereign bond
issue, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch in Port Moresby, capital of the South
Pacific nation, PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate said the stock
exchange would be of tremendous benefit to the people of PNG.
</P>
<P>
"When it is open for business, the Port Moresby stock exchange
will open doors to increased foreign investments ... and it will
create job opportunities for our people," Skate said.
</P>
<P>
A PNG stock exchange has been discussed since the mid-1970s
but enabling legislation, the Securities Act, was only passed in
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister promised that his government would not
interfere in the operations of the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
"My government has no intention of interfering with statutory
bodies," Skate said in his keynote address at the launch.
</P>
<P>
"We only interfere when we know there is no productivity. We
only interfere when we know they're not producing results."
</P>
<P>
Last year the government attempted to appoint its own chairman
of the stock exchange, AAP said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert Finds Way to Tackle CIH Virus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) - A leading Chinese computer expert
has worked out an effective way to repair the hard drives of
computers that are damaged by the CIH Chernobyl virus.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xu, chief engineer of Beijing-based Rising Company, China's
leading anti-virus company, told Xinhua today that his team has
succeeded in designing a program that is capable of restoring most
of the data on CIH-rocked disks.
</P>
<P>
Liu's team worked overnight to find the solution after the
Rising Company received reports that more than 100,000 computers
nationwide were affected on April 26.
</P>
<P>
"The program has been added to the upgraded version of the anti-
CIH software developed by the company and is now available for
users across the country," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
CIH is a widely distributed virus with the potential to render
PCs useless. Its payload results in a significant loss of data
from the hard drive, as well as the possible inability to start up
or reboot the computer.
</P>
<P>
The virus had been timed to strike on April 26, June 26 or each
26th to mark the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The total economic losses from the virus may amount to millions
of yuan, according to Liu.

<HEADLINE> S. African Electricity Supplier Makes Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Eskom, South African
Electricity supplier, has made a gross profit of more than 150
million rand (25 million U.S. dollars) by selling electricity in
Africa last year, Sowetan newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eskom's electrification drive is progressing well despite the
high cost related to its domestic rural electrifying program,
Peter Adams, an official of the company said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, 32 percent of houses in South Africa had electricity
and to date more than 60 percent, including rural houses are
electrified.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to achieve the 70 percentage mark by next year," Adams
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that his company would continue to show commitment
to its rural electrification program although this costs the
company one million rand (about 167,000 U.S. dollars) a kilometer
to provide transmission lines to remote rural homes.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the largest producer and consumer of electricity
in the sub-equatorial region, accounts for 85 percent of
electricity consumption in the Southern African Development
Community.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, bordering with South Africa, has proven to be a good
market for South African power, Eskom said.
</P>
<P>
According to Eskom, Botswana is trying to be self-sufficient in
power supply but it takes time to build its own big power
stations.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Moves for Stricter Foreign Workers Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 28 (Xinhua)-- Singapore launched a new work
permit identification system Wednesday as part of its efforts to
evolve a tougher and more comprehensive foreign manpower
management system.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the new work permit services center, Minister of
State for Manpower Othman Haron Eusofe said every foreign worker
in Singapore will have to replace his or her current Work Permit
Card from May 3, 1999, with the new work permit identification
card.
</P>
<P>
The new card combines the current Work Permit Card, the
Immigration Disembarkation/Embarkation Card and the Visit Pass in
one card as well as carry his or her photograph and fingerprint
record and incorporate more effective security features.
</P>
<P>
The security features will minimize the likelihood of forgery
and the fingerprints impressions will allow the enforcement
agencies a conclusive means of identifying the card holder, Eusofe
said.
</P>
<P>
Eusofe said there are more than 450,000 foreign work permit
holders in Singapore and the presence of a large pool of foreign
workers has brought some social problems. "It has become
imperative for us to better manage these foreign workers during
their stay in Singapore."
</P>
<P>
According to Eusofe, a total of 2,952 foreigners were found
working illegally in Singapore without valid work permits in 1998,
about twice the number of such cases in 1997, and an increasing
number of illegal workers were also immigration offenders which
accounted for 44 percent of illegal workers compared with the 21
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Eusofe said the increasing number of illegal workers and the
rising incidence of forged work permit cards have made it more
difficult for enforcement officers to identify foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
He said the new cards will be jointly issued to its holders in
phases by the Singapore Immigration and Registration and the Work
Permit Department.
</P>
<P>
Eusofe reiterated that work permit holders are required to
carry work permit cards with them and the government intends to
enforce this work permits condition strictly.
</P>
<P>
Employers who retain the original work permit identification
card will risk being debarred from employing foreign workers while
the workers may be liable to have their work permits canceled or
themselves repatriated for not carrying the work permit card, he
said.

<HEADLINE> First Quarter Sees Steady Growth in Commodities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The first quarter of this year
saw a steady growth in China's commodities market, Ding Junfa,
deputy director of the State Administration of Internal Trade (
SAIT) said at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The total retail sales volume of consumer goods hit 760.4
billion yuan, up 7.4 percent year on year in the first quarter.
When price fluctuation is factored in, it is 10.6 percent in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
As a result of increased fixed asset investment in
infrastructure facilities, positive change was seen in the capital
goods market, with demand continuing to pick up and sales
remaining notably brisk, he said.
</P>
<P>
The total value of sales of capital goods was 858.4 billion
yuan during the first three months, up seven percent or 10 percent
in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices continued to fall during the same period. The
retail price index dropped by 2.9 percent and residents' consumer
price fell by 1.4 percent. The price of vegetable, aquatic
products, and meat, poultry and eggs decreased respectively by 17.
3 percent, 8.1 percent and 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pork meat dropped a remarkable 20 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
However, Ding also cautioned that there are still difficulties
such as sluggish domestic demand, a continuing price fall of
consumer goods and the high cost of the means of production.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SAIT is to enhance market exploration, in the
rural sector in particular, in a bid to stimulate domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that the nation's commodities market is to maintain
steady growth in the first half of this year and there will not be
notable ups and downs of prices.

<HEADLINE> China Breeds Herb With Biggest Leaf in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese botanists have succeeded
in breeding a herb whose leaf can cover up three horses standing
in a row with their riders.
</P>
<P>
The young plant, known as "Gunnera Manicata" native to Chile,
is now growing in the Alpine Plant Hall of the Grand Greenhouse at
the China '99 Kunming International Horticultural Exposition,
which is scheduled to open on May 1 in the capital of Southwest
China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
"This indicated that China has the conditions of growing such
plant in wider areas," said Sun Weibang, associate research fellow
with the Kunming Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Sun studied the plant when he was studying in Britain some
years ago and mastered the key techniques for breeding the herb.
Upon his departure for China, Nown, director of the Royal
Botanical Garden Edinburgh gave him a plant of the herb as a gift.
</P>
<P>
Sun took good care of the plant ever since, keeping it under
low temperature, humid conditions and watering it. The plant
regained vitality by the end of 1994, and has grown over one meter
high at present.
</P>
<P>
Sun collected seeds of the herb, bred them and transplanted one
of them in the Grand Greenhouse of the Kunming Exposition '99.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is only 20 centimeters in height at present, the
exotic plant is sure to grow into one that will catch the
attention of visitors." Sun said.

<P>
The report jointly issued by the National Bureau of Statistics
and the China Business Climate Monitoring Center attributes the
rise to the government's pro-active financial policies and stable
monetary measures to spur economic development, which boost the
real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country launched three building programs for low-
price houses, which sent the whole real estate sector soaring.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the first quarter of this year witnessed
an increase in developed land and investments in the industry
along with a drop in the number of unsold buildings.
</P>
<P>
In the January-March period, the country developed 7.4 million
sq.m. of land, up 93 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The investments in real estate development totaled 41.3 billion
yuan, up 19.4 percent on a year on year basis.
</P>
<P>
But the indices for newly constructed areas, sources of funding
for this year, and the housing prices edged down in March,

<P>
BELGRADE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO aircraft bombed Belgrade
early Wednesday, the 36th day of the alliance's strikes, as
Yugoslav rescue workers continued to search for survivors in the
wreckage of civilian installations in a southern Serbian town
raided by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Seven powerful explosions shook the capital after air-raid
sirens were sounded around 01:00 local time. The official Tanjug
news agency said the bombings destroyed a fuel depot 100
kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, rescue workers pulled out 10 bodies and 20 injured
persons from debris in residential quarters hit by NAT0 missiles
in downtown Surdulica, about 300 kilometers south of Belgrade. The
toll number could far exceed those figures.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, NATO missiles fell on residential districts in
Surdulica, Leskovac and Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman admitted in Brussels overnight that civilian
deaths could not be excluded in the attack, saying that "...
unfortunately we cannot completely exclude the possibility of harm
to civilians, or to civilian property during a conflict such as
this one."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbian Health Minister Leposava Milicevic told a
press conference here that more than 400 Serbian civilians have
been killed and over 4,000 injured since NATO launched airstrikes
on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Donates Rare Trees to Horti-Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An ethnic minority in southwest
China's Yunnan Province has turned down an offer by a Japanese
tourist for buying a rare species of tree in large quantities for
10,000 yuan each and donated 100 of them to the '99 International
Horticultural Exposition instead.
</P>
<P>
The first world exposition to be held in a developing country,
the '99 horticulture show is scheduled to open in Kunming, capital
of Yunnan, on May 1 and last through October.
</P>
<P>
The trees, known as alexgeorgei or "Jishegougu" in Chinese,
were moved into the Tree Garden at the expo venue last summer from
the Gulu Township in the suburbs of Kunming, where people of the
Yi ethnic group, one of the 25 ethnic minorities in Yunnan, reside.
</P>
<P>
For generations the Yi people have planted such trees, whose
long and slim leaves look like chicken's tongues, around their
residences because the trees maintain exuberant leaves speckled
with little red fruit even in winter.
</P>
<P>
However, they had never actually realized the value of the tree
until early 1998, when a Japanese tourist, obviously well-versed
in botany, came to the town. Excited at first sight of the trees,
the Japanese asked the local people to sell him some of the trees
for 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Though 10,000 yuan means an annual income of a local family,
the Yi people turned down the offer without hesitation. Meanwhile,
they immediately invited botanists from Kunming to give the tree a
full evaluation.
</P>
<P>
"We found that this tree is a species of the holly family never
reported before. Apart from ornamental value, the tree also has
significant economic value, as its fruit, leaves and bark can be
used to make medicine for treating rheumatoid arthritis," said
Jiang Zhixiang, one of the botanists who visited the Gulu Township.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, also chief advisor to the horticultural
show, the 100 trees donated by the Yi people have all survived
transplantation, with new sprouts bursting out.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Vows to attain 3,000 Point Stock Index in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to catch up with its
neighbors in terms of foreign fund inflows into the local market,
the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) has vowed to attain the 3,000
points Phisix index before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Philippine News Agency Wednesday quoted PSE Chairman Maria
Trinidad Kalaw as saying that she will attain the target by
launching new products that would attract a mixture of local and
foreign investors into the market.
</P>
<P>
Kalaw identified these new products as government bonds and
other securities instruments under the small investors program of
the Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000 composite index target will be hit owing to the
recent launching of the various issues that will come from the
small and medium enterprises (SME) board, she said.
</P>
<P>
Kalaw said the establishment of the SME board was intended to
address the needs of the SMEs for alternative sources of
financing.
</P>
<P>
Through the facilities of the PSE, the SMEs will have the
option to sell their shares to the public, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Phisix index rose sharply in the past month from around
2,000 points to 2,459 points Wednesday due to the economic rebound
in the country.

SHENYANG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A tiny premature baby weighing
only 750 grams has survived his first 30 days in local maternity
hospital of Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The infant boy, who is still in an incubator, is the smallest
and lightest baby ever born in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
According to hospital sources, Zhang Fengxia, a woman from
Liaoning's countryside, gave birth to the baby on March 29 after
only 29 weeks of pregnancy. Before this premature delivery Zhang
had suffered five abortions.
</P>
<P>
At birth, the baby was breathless and only had 60 to 80
heartbeats per second, much lower than the 120 per second for
normal babies. He was immediately transferred to an incubator to
be kept alive through artificial means.
</P>
<P>
On day 24 he was able for the first time to take milk unaided.
</P>
<P>
The boy's weight has now increased to 1,400 grams and hospital
sources say once it reaches 1,800 grams it will be safe for him to
be discharged.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Preparing for More Open Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China will take measures to
ensure the stability of its agricultural market while it is
opening further to the world market.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai, spokesman for the State Administration of Internal
Trade, told a press conference here today, that government at all
levels will set up storage markets for major agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
China has signed an agricultural cooperation agreement with the
United States, which is seen as the first real agreement between
the two governments toward China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
International competition is expected to intensify the existing
over supply of major agricultural products such as vegetables,
meat, poultry and eggs.
</P>
<P>
Huang said a 100,000-ton storage facility has been set up for
pork, aiming to check the slumping price of pork in the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to shouldering the pressure from suppliers, the
central government will work on smoother and quicker
transportation of excessive agricultural goods to consuming
regions.
</P>
<P>
Prices for agricultural products will gradually move toward the
international level, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
While actively preparing the agricultural market for the WTO
accession, China does not expect the entry to greatly affect the
domestic retail market, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
But this market will be "gradually" opened, he said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded retailers only control 5 percent of the
nation's total retailing business volume.

<HEADLINE> UNDP-Aided Sugar Beet Project for Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the Chinese Government have jointly launched a
sugar beet development project in northeast China, which will
benefit some 72,000 poverty-stricken local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Yannick Glemarec, UNDP deputy resident representative in China,
signed the project's contract today with Sun Yongfu, deputy
director general of the China International Center for Economic
and Technical Exchanges, the official Chinese coordinator of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out in four towns in Hailun and
Ning'an counties, in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, a
leading sugar beet producing area in China, within two years,
according to Glemarec.
</P>
<P>
The project will cover a training program for technical staff
and farmers, with technical assistance provided by international
specialists, a demonstration program which will include the
setting up of township-based demonstration sites for a variety of
sugar beet culture growing tests, and the provision of advanced
breeding equipment and office equipment for the Farmer Information
Centers, and transport for the demonstration program.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will assist the project by injecting 750,000 U.S.
dollars, with funding from the Danish International Development
Agency through the UN Office for Projects Services.
</P>
<P>
A major sugar beet producer in Europe, Denmark is recognized
for its world advanced expertise in sugar beet production and
sugar making.
</P>
<P>
"Denmark will provide technical assistance, which will include
sending technicians to the project areas in northeast China," said
Franz-Michael Mellbin, a counselor at the Royal Danish Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government will contribute the equivalent of 112,
500 U.S. dollars as a cash contribution.
</P>
<P>
"One of the priorities of the UNDP is poverty elimination,
which is also the priority of the Chinese Government," said Song
Yongfu. "We believe the project will contribute to that target."
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years of China-UNDP cooperation, a total of
800 projects have been implemented in China, involving some 500
million U.S. dollars, according to Sun.

<HEADLINE> 300-year Old Incense Cedar Transplanted to '99 Expo-site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese horticulturists have
successfully transplanted a 300-year-old incense cedar to the
Tree Garden of the China '99 Kunming International Horticultural
Exposition, which is to open here on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Standing aloft by the entrance to the Tree Garden, the cedar
was moved there in April last year from a village 76 kilometers
from Kunming, capital of southwestern China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The old tree has completely acclimatized itself to the new
environment and began to flower and bear fruit not long ago," said
Jiang Zhixiang, a senior engineer in charge of the transplantation
project.
</P>
<P>
The tree stands 13.8 meters. The trunk measures 1.2 meters in
diameter and the huge crown measures 64 square meters. Farmers in
its native place love it and adore it as "Old Tree God".
</P>
<P>
The wood of the tree is hard and resistant to corrosion and has
a strong fragrance. It is an endangered species under state-class
protection.
</P>
<P>
"To move the cedar without harming the over-stretched entangled
roots, we used two huge cranes, one carrying the upper part and
the other carrying the bottom part," recalled Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The tree withstood the acid tests by a heavy snow last spring
and is now full of vitality, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
One of the six outdoor specialized exhibition areas, the Tree
Garden has three sub-gardens, devoted respectively to the family
of Mongolia, plants of rare or endangered species, and cash trees.
A total of 700 rare or endangered plants in 51 species grow in the
garden, which receive first- and second-class state protection.

<HEADLINE> UAE Company to Buy Stake in S. Korean Oil Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Dhabi-based
International Petroleum Investment Co. (IPIC) will take a 50
percent stake in Hyundai Oil Refinery Co. of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The two oil majors have agreed in principle on the deal and
will sign an agreement shortly, Wednesday's Gulf News daily quoted
South Korean Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Kim
Song-Tuk as saying.
</P>
<P>
IPIC, owned by the Abu Dhabi government, will invest 500
million U.S. dollars in Hyundai Oil Refinery Co. as part of its
overseas investment strategy in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
This is likely to be Abu Dhabi's first investment program in
South Korea's energy sector, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai enjoys a refining capacity of 310,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on investment opportunities in South
Korea at the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kim said
bilateral trade between his country and the UAE slid to 3.6
billion dollars in 1998 from 4.5 billion dollars in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
"The decline was mainly due to depressed oil prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, with the South Korean economy back on track, trade
with the UAE and some other countries will increase in 1999, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- All-Star center of the Miami
Heat Alonzo Mourning is out indefinitely after suffering an eye
injury in Monday's 90-65 victory in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
The injury comes at a bad time for the Heat, who are battling
for the top seed in the Eastern Conference. At 30-14, they lead
Indiana by 1 1/2 games, Orlando by two and Atlanta by 2 1/2, with
six remaining.
</P>
<P>
Mourning is no stranger to injury, having missed an average of
nearly 14 games over his first six seasons. Last year, he wore a
protective mask that covered most of his face after breaking his
left cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
The 6-10, four-time All-Star leads the league in blocked shots
at 4.0 per game, is 12th in scoring (20.3), seventh in rebounds (
11.1 and ninth in field-goal percentage (.511).
</P>
<P>
A physical, intimidating force, Mourning also is the leader of
the NBA's best defense. The Heat have allowed a league-low 82.8
points per game.
</P>
<P>
Mourning is in his fourth season with Miami. He has averaged
more than 20 points and 10 rebounds during his career, which began
with Charlotte in 1992.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa-Zimbabwe Trade Increases by 32% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (xinhua) -- Bilateral trade between South
Africa and Zimbabwe increased by 32.8 percent last year to 39.6
billion Zimbabwean dollars (over one billion U.S. dollars), the
daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure excludes a substantial amount of undeclared and
informal trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing guests at a reception to mark South Africa's fifth
independence anniversary in Harare Tuesday, acting South African
High Commissioner Hester Pretorious said despite the long
protracted dispute between the two countries over trade
imbalances, Zimbabwe still remained South Africa's number one
trading partner in Africa and 10th largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Our joint efforts to resolve our trade differences are
beginning to bear fruit and we are entering into a new phase in
our trade relations," she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, South Africa introduced punitive import duties of up
to 90 percent to protect its own clothing and textile industry at
a time when Zimbabwe was in the process of liberalizing its
economy. Since then, trade relations have been strained between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, Deputy Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Zimbabwe Nicholas Goche said although the current
trade between South Africa and Zimbabwe was being governed by the
1964 Trade Agreement, it was pleasing to note that progress had
been made in reaching an agreement on textiles and clothing and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the acceleration of negotiations on and
agreement to cover such products as machinery, mechanical
suppliances and electrical equipment, " he said.

<HEADLINE> World Needs $2 Billion to Eliminate Malaria: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization official
David Nabarro said here Tuesday that it will take two billion U.S.
dollars for the world to fight malaria in the next ten years, of
which 500 million dollars will be from his organization.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the on-going meeting on the elimination
of malaria in southern Africa, which has entered its second day.
</P>
<P>
A major challenge facing the world is to make remarkable
achievement in reducing the death rate of malaria and its
incidences before the year 2000, said the official.
</P>
<P>
WHO has pledged to increase fund for anti-malaria goods.
However, Nabarro said the wish could face difficulties due to poor
economic situation in sub-Saharan countries affected by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
He urged countries affected by malaria to try rely on
themselves in fighting the disease.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting which started Monday focus on the
effective elimination of malaria in Africa through strategies
closer to the African reality in accordance with the WHO Roll Back
Malaria program.
</P>
<P>
The Roll Back Malaria program which was initiated last year is
aimed at both eliminating malaria and supporting the development
of health systems in countries affected by this disease.
</P>
<P>
A WHO report showed that about 1.5 million to 2.7 million
people in the world die of malaria every year, among them at least
one million are children under five years.
</P>
<P>
Those affected by the disease are mainly living in countries
with poor health conditions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa,
which has brought negative impact on the countries' ecomony.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be closed Thursday, has drawn representatives
from South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia,
Swaziland,Zambia, Zimbabwe, Sao Tome &AMP; Principe and Seychelles.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Trading Starts in Nigerian Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Stock Exchange
launched its Automated Trading System Tuesday, replacing the
manual call-over trading system after a one-week test run.
</P>
<P>
The new system is the final stage of a modernization program of
the stock market in Lagos which started in 1997 with the
introduction of a central clearing and depository system.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the new system was stalled by the soured
relations between Nigeria and Canada under the late dictator
General Sani Abacha as the Canadian experts handling the project
were denied Nigerian visas.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the electronic trading will make the stock market
in the west African country more transparent and efficient, and it
is expected the new system would result in a quick release of
daily market summary of activities at the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian stockbrokers who had a one-week rehearsal on the new
system welcomed the end of the noisy open outcry trading system
which had been in use since the market opened in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (57) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can the Government of the MSAR Region negotiate and sign
agreements on mutual exemption of visas with foreign countries or
regions?
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the entry into and exit from their territory in
international contacts, many countries and regions have instituted
a visa system. However, to simplify the entry and exit procedures,
some countries or regions very often would sign bilateral or
multilateral agreements with other countries or regions to do away
with visa requirements for each other's citizens on the basis of
equality and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
At present, residents in Macao are exempted from visa
requirements for entry into some countries with which Portugal has
signed such bilateral or multilateral agreements and made them
applicable to Macao. Likewise, citizens from the United States,
Germany, France and 30 or so other countries may enter Macao
without a visa according to the existing laws in Macao.
</P>
<P>
After Macao returns to China, the Government of MSAR may
exercise entry and exist control over entry into, stay in and exit
from Macao for people from foreign countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
As for visas, the Central Government will assist or authorize
the Government of the MSAR to negotiate and conclude the visa
abolition agreements with relevant foreign countries or regions.
In other words, with the assistance or authorization of the
Central Government, the Government of the MSAR definitely can
negotiate and sign such agreements with foreign countries and
regions on the basis of equality and reciprocity. This will make
it easier for Macao residents to go to foreign countries or
regions for work, study or as a tourist.

<P>
Can foreign governments set up consular missions in the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
According to Article 142 of the Basic Law, to facilitate the
development of economic and cultural relations between the MSAR
Region and foreign countries, foreign consular and other official
or semi-official missions may be set up in the MSAR, subject to
the approval of the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
Due to geographical reasons, no foreign government has set up
special consular mission in Macao. The consulates of more than 30
countries in Hong Kong concurrently handle consular affairs in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Only a few countries have appointed some eminent figures in
Macao as their honorary consuls in Macao.
</P>
<P>
It is agreed between China and Portugal through consultations
that the Portuguese Government will set up a consular mission in
Macao before December 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Whether the foreign consular mission in Macao will remain will
be decided according to Article 142 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The principles to be followed in handling this matter are:
</P>
<P>
1. Countries that have formal diplomatic relations with the
People's Republic of China and that have consular and other
official missions in Macao may maintain their missions there.
</P>
<P>
2. Countries that have not established formal diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China but have consular or
other official missions in Macao may either maintain them or
change them into semi-official missions in the light of the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
3. Countries not recognized by the People's Republic of China
may only establish non-governmental institutions in the MSAR
Region.

<HEADLINE> Internet Service Provider Sees Good Days Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- After years of a painful struggle
for survival, SOHU.com, one of the country's most successful
Internet service providers (ISP), is now looking for new expansion
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaoyang, founder and chief executive officer, has
attracted attention from representatives of foreign companies at
the China Business Summit of the World Economic Forum held in
China.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ISP company will balance its income and
spending within one or two years. The next step that the company
will take is to seek a merger or takeover by a major foreign
company so as to expand its operations.
</P>
<P>
China's ISP sector has gone through continuous consolidation in
the past five years. The number of ISPs in the country has
decreased from several hundred to scores. Most of the ISPs that
survived fierce competition are wholly or partially funded by
foreign companies. Over 90 percent of SOHU.com's capital is from
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that foreign funds did not only ease the shortage of
funds of local ISPs, but also helped enhance their management
through strict requirements of economic returns from the overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the failure of most Chinese ISPs can be
attributed to a lack of market-oriented management mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a returned student from the United States, expressed
optimism about the future of ISPs in China.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with the same difficulties all Internet service
providers are competing as equals in the China market and only the
fittest can survive and win better returns than in any other
markets in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
SOHU.com had one million US dollars in revenue last year,
becoming the best performing ISP in the country. Now it has about
one million pages downloaded from its website every day.
</P>
<P>
Zhang predicts that China's access to the world trade
organization will promote the expansion of his company.
</P>
<P>
"We have already established an advantage in the China market.
Increasing international competition will push our operations into
wider fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China had more than two million Internet
users. The figure is expected to grow to 3.5 million by the end of
this year and to 4.5 million by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Securities Companies Granted More Accesses to Money Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese securities companies will
be given access to new money raising channels including inter-bank
lending and borrowing and bond repurchasing markets, according to
the China Securities industry's watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), was quoted by Wednesday's People's Daily as
saying that more policies governing financing sources of
securities companies are under way.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said in a speech early in March that securities companies
are entitled to the same money raising rights as other financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to China's first Securities Law promulgated last
December, securities firms will be classified into two groups.
Companies with registered capital above 500 million yuan may have
access to business lines ranging from underwriting of new stocks
to brokerage, while companies with registered capital between 50-
500 million yuan will be confined to brokerage.
</P>
<P>
"The new money raising channels will help prevent
irregularities amongst securities companies by giving them more
accesses to the capital market," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned new regulations for investment funds, under
which they will be issued by existing fund management companies.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are aimed at reducing the outlay of those
companies and expanding the proportion of institutional investors
in the stock market, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Start IP Phone Trial Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of
Information Industry (MII) announced it has approved three Chinese
telecommunications service providers to conduct Internet Protocol
(IP) phone trial services.
</P>
<P>
The three companies are the China Telecommunications Corp. (
China Telecom), United Telecommunications Corp. (Unicom), and
China Jitong Telecommunications Co.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Yin, an MII official in charge of telecom
development planning, China Telecom will launch its trial services
tomorrow, and the other two companies will start within the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The trial period is set to be six months and will conclude by
the end of the year," Chen said, adding that the official
operation of the IP phone services is expected to start then.
</P>
<P>
During the experimental period, international IP calls will be
charged at 4.8 yuan per minute, and domestic long-distance IP
calls will be charged for 0.3 yuan per minute.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the above charges, IP phone users will pay the
local call that is triggered by each IP call.
</P>
<P>
Regular DDD call in China is between 0.5 and one yuan per
minute. Regular IDD call within Asia except for the Middle East is
12 yuan per minute; that to other parts of the world is 15 yuan
per minute.
</P>
<P>
Li Lihua in charge of the telecom financial settlement of the
MII said the fee standard is a temporary one applicable only to
the trial period. Adjustments will be made before the official
full time service is introduced.
</P>
<P>
"The IP phone business is developed among three major telecom
outfit," Chen said, which is an "important step toward breaking
the monopoly and introducing competition in China's telecom
industry."
</P>
<P>
China Telecom will carry out experimental services in 25
cities, and the other two will handle a further 12 cities.
</P>
<P>
The MII also pledged to continue to crack down on illegal IP
phone services to ensure a "healthy and orderly" development of
the telecom market.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Press Criticizes NATO's Strategy and Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's new "strategic concept" adopted by NATO leaders at
the just-concluded summit and the continued air strikes against
Yugoslavia were heavily condemned by the United States press
recently.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, in a signed article, described the
alliance as "an idea whose time has passed". It said that the
conflict in Kosovo has shown that NATO is "increasingly irrelevant
to contemporary problems".
</P>
<P>
The article said that the alliance "has little to celebrate"
for its 50th anniversary, since it lost its raison d'etre after
the end of the Cold War. "America's European partners no longer
needed our protection, because there was no external enemy to
contain," it added.
</P>
<P>
NATO adopted the new "strategic concept" at the summit held
here over the weekend, which shifted its primary task from
deterring external attack to preventing terrorism, ethnic conflict
and other low-level security threats.
</P>
<P>
"This step transformed NATO from a coherent and credible
defense pact to a vague and loosely defined regional militia," the
article said.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times also published readers' letters on Tuesday,
criticizing NATO's new strategy and air bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"In a major political blunder, the U.S.-led NATO decision to
bomb Yugoslavia is turning a low-level conflict into a nightmare
of biblical proportions," one of the letters said, adding that "
the bombing is a blatant violation of international law".
</P>
<P>
The bombing is "destroying a major European city and creating
serious environmental problems", and "ruining relations with
Russia", the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It called for a halt to the bombing and a start of honest talks
before the tragedy escsalated into "a major European war -- or
worse".
</P>
<P>
Another letter that appeared in the same newspaper pointed out
that NATO had been used "to justify trillions of dollars of
totally useless military spending both here and abroad", and it
had put off the establishment of democracy "in Eastern Europe and
elsewhere for decades" by promoting military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times, in a strong-worded advertisement by the
Milica Rakic Memorial Committee on Tuesday, called passionately
for a stop to the air assault in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply saddened by the swiftly worsening situation in
Serbia (Yugoslavia). NATO bombing and missile strikes only
aggravate the danger," it said.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement said that the U.S. involvement in a Balkan
conflict "has led to more refugees, more destruction and more loss
of human life".
</P>
<P>
"We are guilty of aggression against a nation that has done
nothing against another country. We have set a precedent that
would-be-aggressors can use to justify attacks against other
countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement condemned the U.S. government for aping "
dictators who violated treaties and other solemn agreements".
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. considers the bombing of Yugoslavia illegal. People
here and abroad deplore NATO's use of force to achieve a political
settlement. In addition, we conveniently ignored the International
Convention of Treaties (1980), which asserts that agreements
resulting from coercion and the use of force are invalid," it said.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement urged the government to learn from "the
horrendous experience of Vietnam", and stressed that "war is no
solution in the Balkans".

airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The countries will need billions of dollars in aid to deal with
the problems, a joint report from the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund said.
</P>
<P>
The costs of humanitarian aid alone could reach upward of 300
million U.S. dollars if the bombing drags on through 1999, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The aid, if provided, did not include the cost of resettling
refugees or rebuilding Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in Kosovo is real," World Bank President James
Wolfensohn told reporters. "It's not just Kosovo and the Yugoslav
Republic, but also adjacent states."
</P>
<P>
The report studied the effects on six neighboring countries to
Yugoslavia. They are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Macedonia and Romania.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that the strains of providing for destitute
refugees would be great, especially since the countries most
affected, Albania and Macedonia, are poor.
</P>
<P>
"As the refugees have, by and large, been stripped of their
possessions and savings, they are reliant on others --
humanitarian organizations, local residents, recipient country
governments -- to provide for their basic needs," the draft report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report looked at two scenarios. Under one of them, the
conflict in Kosovo is resolved quickly and official trade with the
Yugoslav Republic begins to return toward its pre-crisis level
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The financing need was based on an assumption of an influx of
more than 250,000 refugees to the affected countries.
</P>
<P>
The other scenario involves a war lasting throughout the year,
with all official trade with Yugoslavia assumed to be suspended.
That scenario assumes the number of refugees peaks toward the
middle of 1999 at about 750,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition to more than 300 million dollars in aid needed, the
costs would produce a balance of payments gap of 1.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
That means the total cost for providing for refugees would hit
1.8 billion dollars, or about 2.5 percent of the region's GDP.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican Health
Authorities on Tuesday gave an alert of the rise of deaths from
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Without giving specific figures, Dolores Gallardo, chief of the
Division of Education for Health of the National Institute of
Cancerology, said that now deaths from cancer have ranked second
among all the causes in the country, compared to the fifteenth
place 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
She attributed this to the bad life-styles, such as the lack of
exercise, smoking as well as eating too much high-fat food and
little fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The largest number of cases are connected with tumors,
bronchial tubes, oral cavities, larynx, stomach, intestine and
colon.

Women have a higher incidence than men, with womb and breast
cancers accounting for 25 and 13 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> NATO New Concept Aims to Dominate Europe, World Affairs: Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A statement issued Tuesday by the
Russian Foreign Ministry said that NATO's new concept of strategy,
adopted recently at its Washington summit, aimed to enable the
alliance to dominate in affairs of Europe and the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that this concept is not only no good to
Europe's security but also no help for NATO members to carry out
their international commitments within the authorization of the
United Nations and Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
It held that security in Europe should cover all countries in
the continent and all of them should be equally treated.
</P>
<P>
NATO has officially renounced the bloc's original defense
strategy by unveiling the new concept, which allows the bloc to
take any actions, including military ones, outside the territories
of its member countries when necessary, the statement said, adding
this is against the pronouncement it made in the concept that the
UN Security Council should play a principal role in maintaining
peace and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of preventing mass destructive weapons
mentioned in the alliance's formal document, it stressed the issue
can only be settled under international norms and atmosphere of
trust among countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which reaffirmed its long-term opposition to NATO's
eastward expansion, expressed worries over NATO's announcement
that the expansion will not be restricted by geographic boundaries,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement loudly called on NATO to stop bombing Yugoslavia,
which has entered day 34, and bring the Kosovo crisis back to the
track of political settlement.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, it urged Washington, which has repeatedly asked
for partnership with Moscow recently, to take concrete actions
instead of words only.

VIENNA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday told a United

The international community had to urgently toughen its actions
against cross-border organized crime which in recent years has
grown considerably and has done grave harm to social order and
international trading and economic activities, he noted.

China, also facing such crime during the process of opening to
the outside world, was paying great attention to expanding
judicial cooperation with other states, while intensifying

<HEADLINE> Dali: Phantom of Harmony between Man and Nature (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- It is charismatic and charming.
The natural scenes, the dexterous and industrious people and the
stories behind them have made this ancient little town of Dali the
phantom of harmony between man and nature.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the 13th century, Italian traveller Marco Polo
recorded a story about how boas, mysterious horses and local
residents lived harmoniously together.
</P>
<P>
The kind people and the picturesque landscape also amazed the
contemporary Chinese action novelist Louis Cha Leung-yung, who
fabricated a "Kingdom of Dali" that gives a vivid description of
the wise kings, amiable people and the fascinating landscape. Mr.
Louis Cha Leung-yung, whose influence in the Chinese-speaking
world is comparable to that of Stephen King in the English-
speaking world, has never been to Dali and it remains a mystery as
to why he was so charmed by this little border town. Dali city
honored him as an "honorary citizen".
</P>
<P>
 Dali is a famous ancient town, situated in the northwestern
part of Yunnan Province. It served as the capital of the State of
Nan Zhao and the State of Dali from the 8th through the 13th
centuries. It was later conquered by Kublai Khan, the fifth
emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, and was incorporated into the map of
the Yuan Dynasty. Now the little town is still shrouded with the
mysteries of the ancient states and beauty of the landscape. It
fully deserves to have been chosen as a sub-site of the China '99
Kunming International Horticultural Exposition that has "man and
nature, marching towards the 21st century" as its theme.
</P>
<P>
Streets of the town are paved with flagstones and lined with
wooden dwelling houses just as it was more than one thousand years
ago. Lining the winding streets are also stores and workshops
featuring such beautiful arts and crafts as needlework, hand-made
shoes, knitwear, embroideries and wooden products
</P>
<P>
But the most renowned should be Mount Cangshan and the Erhai
Lake. The thick and exuberant forests and ever-changing scenes of
the lake as rosy clouds rise from the water surface are enough to
make visitors carried away. It is said that fish weighing as much
as hundreds of kilograms was once caught in the lake.

<P>
The town is mainly inhabited by people of the Bai nationality.
In their traditional costumes and with their long hair coiled into
complicated finesse topknot modeling on flamboyant flowers, young
girls are good hands in cultivating tea and compressing the leaves
into bowl-shaped mass, known as Tuo Cha in Chinese. They also love
bathing in  hotspring water. They uphold natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
Every year thousands of egrets make a huge fig tree in the city
as their habitat. But they have never been disturbed over the past
decade as everybody in the town knows that the bird is protected
by the state.
</P>
<P>
A fountain in the city is dominated by butterflies, hence its
name "Butterfly Fountain". On the 15th of April every year,
hundreds of butterflies are mysteriously dancing over the clear
water, sometimes linking up one another to form a long string
hanging from the tree above the fountain, undisturbed by the
presence of visitors.
</P>
<P>
As more and more tourists have ventured into Dali in recent
years, the people of the city have begun to put up posters,
reminding tourists of the importance of protecting the natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
Dali is also a world of flowers. A local valley called "
Wanhuaxi" is reputed as the "paradise of botanists". The city
holds a flower-worship festival every year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that many modern buildings and boulevards have
been added to this ancient city since the founding of the People's
Republic of China, the old part of the city is still shrouded with
the air of an ancient utopian retreat.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists have thronged the city in recent years and
some even live there for a while. "I have been here for a week,"
said a tourist from Belgium."I love the environment and people
here."
</P>
<P>
A new cityscape tinged with the color of the 1990s has also
appeared in the old city. "Internet Bar" and signboards in English
can be seen along a street called by local people as "Foreign
Street".
</P>
<P>
The city has attracted a flock of artists, too. Nyima, a
Tibetan sculptor, said he is ready to buy a piece of land in Dali
and devote it to the environmental art. "It will mainly feature
simplicity and naturalness for which modern arts advocate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Dali people have always been living in good harmony with
nature," a local official, Zhang Jian remarked. "There is no need
to make deliberate preparations for the '99 horticulture
exposition."

<HEADLINE> Continuous Rains Put Guangxi on Alert against Possible Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Continuous rain in the past few
days has more than relieved a lingering drought in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and put local authorities
on alert against possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
Precipitation covered most parts of Guangxi between 21-26 this
month, with heavy rain and thunder storms hitting at least 58
counties in the region.
</P>
<P>
The rain has virtually eased the serious drought in Guangxi and
it now has refocused its attention on possible floods, a local
official said.
</P>
<P>
In the upper reaches of the Lijiang River, a major river in the
region, the rainfall reached 314 mm in the past few days, raising
the river's water level to 146.85 m, 1.85 m higher than official
warning line.
</P>
<P>
The sudden rise of the water level has forced water into some
parts of Guilin, one of the leading scenic cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists have warned of possible abnormal weather in the
coming days and urged local residents to get prepared for flood
control.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Government Ready For Talks With Tamil Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government is ready
for peace talks with the Tamil rebels if they give up their demand
for a separate state and conclude the talks within a given time
frame.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga Monday reiterated this when the
Religious Alliance for Peace, which undertook a peace mission to
northern Sri Lanka Monday, met her here and briefed her on the
outcome of its mission, the official Daily News Wednesday
reported.
</P>
<P>
The religious leaders explained to the president the
difficulties of Tamil civilians and requested her to supply them
with basic needs which she agreed to do, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
She said the government had despatched essential food and other
items to the areas mentioned but the Tamil rebels prevented those
goods from reaching the innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that since she assumed office, she
had exchanged 43 letters with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in an effort to restore peace.
</P>
<P>
But when the government formulated a 40 billion rupee (About
600 million U.S. dollars) program for the rehabilitation of the
north and requested the LTTE cooperation towards its
implementation, they wanted the withdrawal of the government
troops from the north and east if they were to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The president said she was not prepared to make the mistakes of
the former government.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the president said her government
would like to continue peace talks with the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after coming to power in 1994, the government opened
talks with the LTTE rebels who have been fighting a war for a
separate state in the country since 1983, but the LTTE abruptly
pulled out to resume their protracted campaign in April 1995.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pushes for Rapid Progress in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini told his visiting Israeli counterpart that only rapid
progress in the Middle East peace process would stop the world
thinking that the blockage was on the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon here on Tuesday,
Dini spoke of the need for "positive developments to sweep away
the impression that most of the obstacles come from Israel."
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that at the March 24 European Union (EU)
summit in Berlin, the 15 member countries reaffirmed their view
that the Palestinians had a right to self-determination and their
readiness to recognize a Palestinian state at the appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said he would declare an
independent state for his people as of next month with or without
Israeli consent.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers' talks also focused on bilateral relations,
the euro-Mediterranean partnership and the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Their meeting came a day after United States President Bill
Clinton said he would send a letter to Arafat spelling out
Washington's position regarding "the right of Palestinians to live
freely on their own soil."
</P>
<P>
Clinton made it clear however that U.S. support for a
Palestinian state was conditional on the continuation of
negotiations with Israel for another year. This would mean Arafat
would have to put off his declaration of independence, originally
planned for May 4, until 2000.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM: NATO Risks Damaging Credibility if Raids Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini warned Tuesday that NATO will risk damaging its credibility
as a force for stability if air strikes against Yugoslavia last
too long.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Wednesday by Italian daily Il Foglio,
Dini said, "NATO must safeguard its credibility as a force for
stability."
</P>
<P>
"At a certain point continued bombardment risks creating an
image of the alliance as something aggressive, threatening and
unhelpful in the creation of long-term balance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the weekend NATO summit in Washington, he added, "
The important decision was to set negotiations within the
framework of the U.N. and to confirm Russia's role as key mediator.
"
</P>
<P>
In a further hint that the time for diplomacy was drawing near,
Dini said maybe it was time to send Italy's ambassador to
Yugoslavia Riccardo Sessa back to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Sessa was summoned to Rome for consultations on April 17 in a
move seen by some as a sign of Italy's impatience with Milosevic's
refusal to budge.

<HEADLINE> First Quarter Sees Dropping Price in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A buyer's market was prominent in
China in the first quarter of this year, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Ding Junfa, deputy director of the State Administration of
Internal Trade, told a press conference that the oversupply of
commodities resulted in a 2.9 percent drop in the national's
retail price index in the first quarter from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
He said the consumer price index fell by 1.4 percent during
that period. The average price of industrial products dropped by 5.
9 percent and that of raw materials by 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the All-China Commercial Information
Center show that of the 606 major commodities, 98.3 percent are
expected to be in excessive supply in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Of the industrial consumer goods, 87.2 percent will be in
oversupply. Major farm and sideline products are expected to be in
more excessive supply, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Ding pointed to the slumping pig price resulting from increased
output and sluggish demand. He called for measures to be adopted
to halt the drop in the pig price.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Suffers Heavy Civilian Casualties, Damage: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 Serbian civilians
have been killed and over 4,000 injured since NATO launched
airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March 24, Serbian Health Minister
Leposava Milicevic told a press conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Around 30 hospitals in Belgrade, Pristina, Kragujevac, Kraljevo,
Novi Sad, Nis and Cacak and some major highways and bridges were
bombed by NATO airplanes, which made it more difficult to
transport and treat the wounded, said Milicevic.
</P>
<P>
According to another senior official in the Health Department,
NATO's wanton and indiscriminate bombing of Yugoslav chemical
factories, refineries and oil depots has caused the leaking of a
large amount of poisonous materials and severely threatened the
life of the people. The conduct in its nature is no better than
using chemical weapons, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav experts are now studying all measures to minimize the
possible harm to residents' health caused by those materials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. "For-Profit" Education Industry Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The "for-profit" education
and training industry in the United States is now worth 70 billion
U.S. dollars and growing at 13 percent a year, according to a
report released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, education and training companies have raised more
than 3.4 billion dollars of equity capital through more than 38
initial public offerings and 30 follow-on offerings, said Merrill
Lynch, one of the world's leading financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Overall, in the United States, the education and training
industry, both for-profit and non-profit, reached 740 billion
dollars in 1998 and is growing at six percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the industry already tops two trillion dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
The transformation to a knowledge-based economy is creating a
fertile environment in the for-profit education and training
industry and a significant opportunity for investors in the
foreseeable future, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report said, the educational needs of the
knowledge economy, contrasted with the current system's inability
to fill those needs, provide innovative companies with open-ended
opportunities for growth.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch also said that technology-based delivery of
education -- distributed learning -- is providing greater access
to more at a lower cost. Educational portals creating an
education-focused gateway to the Internet available to all from
kindergarten to adults is especially a big opportunity for the for-
profit education and training industry.

WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Mary Slaney of the United
States, the former world champion in the women's 1,500 and 3,000
meters, is going ahead with a lawsuit against the international
athletics governing body IAAF despite Monday's ruling by an
arbitration panel that she failed a drug test three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"They think they are protected over there, safe in their little
cocoon," Slaney said, refering to the IAAF headquarters in Monte
Carlo. "They can take away whatever rights the athletes had. This
has to be addressed, fought and changed."
</P>
<P>
Slaney's lawyer said he doubts the suit ever will go to trial
becuase the IAAF would prefer a settlement rather than make public
what he called a "sham" test for female athletes.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take the veil from over how they've been
operating their doping program. We're going to find out what
athletes they've investigated, which athletes they've let off and
why, to show the whole thing is a sham," attorney Jim Coleman said.
"It's fraudulent, and we are going to prove it."
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks unspecified damages and also names the U.S.
Olympic Committee, which administered the test Slaney failed
during the 1996 Olympic Trials.

JINAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
expected to spend additional 7.99 billion yuan (96.3 million US
dollars) improving local rural electric grids this year, as part
of its effort to ensure local economic growth.

A sum of 4.55 billion yuan will be used to complete projects in

counties.
</P>
<P>
The first package of local rural electric grids were
transformed last year at a cost of 1.5 billion yuan (180 million
US dollars). This helped cut the price for each kwh of electricity
by 0.12 yuan in those counties where electric grids were improved.

WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The WNBA sides returned to the
bargaining table Tuesday in an effort to settle down the labor
dispute in New York.
</P>
<P>
The sides talked for eight hours Monday, trying to resolve
differences which caused an apparent agreement to fall apart last
week.
</P>
<P>
The league postponed its player draft which had been scheduled
for Tuesday, causing the WNBA players association to issue a
statement charging league officials with trying to intimidate the
players.
</P>
<P>
The three-month season is supposed to begin on June 10.
</P>
<P>
The union claimed that the league introduced five issues in
talks last Wednesday night and said that if the players
association did not agree to them, there would be no deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the union and league agreed on a four-year deal that
would increase minimum salaries from 15,000 U.S. dollars to 30,000
foro veterans and 25,000 for rookies.
</P>
<P>
Those figures would increase to 40,000 and 30,000 respectively
by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Optimistic at Reaching Sudirman Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is optimistic about
reaching the semifinals of the Sudirman Cup in Copenhagen next
month, facing China and Malaysia in Group B.
</P>
<P>
The badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) training director
Christian Hadinata said Indonesia needed to win once, against
Malaysia, to go through to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"We are strong in the women's singles, doubles and mixed
doubles. We must win those events. In the men's singles and
doubles, we have an equal chance with the Malaysians," Christian
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If our women's shuttlers lose to Malaysia, it means they are
weakening", said Christian, who is also Indonesia's deputy team
manager for the event.
</P>
<P>
However, Christian was not hopeful about facing China.
</P>
<P>
"China is very strong in the women's singles and doubles. We
might win the mixed doubles, as our best duo of Minarti Timur and
Tri Kusherjanto beat China's toughest pair of Liu Yong and Ge Fei
in the Asian Games in December," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would have to win the men's singles and doubles, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In Group A, host Denmark will face South Korea and Sweden.
Denmark and China are joint top seeds at the Sudirman Cup, after
meeting in the 1997 finals where China took home the trophy.
Indonesia lost to China in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Christian said national shuttlers have prepared better for the
Sudirman Cup, which will take place from May 10 to May 15.
</P>
<P>
"They have boosted their motivation with the presence of
physical trainer Tahir Djide. He brought new methods to the
previously monotonous training. He trained singles and doubles
shuttlers together, which also raises the sense of teamwork," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the shuttlers' complaints about their training were
irrational.
</P>
<P>
"They said they couldn't stand the training, saying they would
injure themselves. That's nonsense. A professional athlete must be
prepared for any tournaments with hard training. Their complaints
reflect their poor conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christian also said he had talked with coaches and urged them
to impart the right knowledge to athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Physical training won't injure athletes, if they are really
prepared for major events. Besides, the training put more emphasis
on movements to support their technical skills," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the Sudirman Cup when it was held for the first
time here in 1989. Since then, China and South Korea have won the
trophy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's shuttlers will also compete in the World
Championships in Copenhagen from May 16 to May 23.

making Interim Committee in Washington, said the Committee
considered the policies that would be required to address the
downside risks to grow and other policy challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Priority should be given to an appropriate mix of
macroeconomic and structural measures aimed at generating early,
vigorous, and sustained recoveries in the crisis-afflicted
emerging market countries; to policies of financial restructuring
and domestic demand led growth in Japan; and to policies for
supporting domestic demand in Europe," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, despite some improvement, short-term prospects
remain uncertain," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The committee also noted open and competitive markets as a key
component of efforts to sustain growth and stability in the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
"It encouraged further trade liberalization, including market
access for developing country exports, and looked forward to the
launch of a new round of trade negotiations at the WTO in November
with a balanced agenda," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
On the world economy, the communique said the outlook for world
output growth remains sluggish in 1999 while a moderate recovery
is foreseen for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that prevention of crisis remains the key, the
Committee endorsed the Executive Board's decision to establish a
contingent credit line in the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"The new contingent credit line will help countries pursuing
sound and sustainable policies to maintain stability, even in the
face of deteriorating global financial conditions," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
The Committee also endorsed IMF's intention to intensify its
work with member governments to put in place as soon as possible
mechanisms that could facilitate the avoidance or orderly
resolution of crisis.

<HEADLINE> China to Adjust Power Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will keep
a vigilant eye on the launching of new power projects in the next
two years to promote power structure adjustment, according to a
circular released by the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The focus of power construction will be shifted from merely
expanding power generating capacity to enhancing power quality and
returns, said the circular.
</P>
<P>
The government will speed up the elimination of small and old
power generation plants, besides prohibiting the construction of
new small coal power plants within the coverage of big power grids,
the commission noted.
</P>
<P>
The circular also said the country will give greenlights to
the power generating projects using local equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Projects funded by domestic capital should purchase local
equipment, and those which use foreign investments will also be
encouraged to adopt Chinese-made equipment," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of power supply has been considerably eased since
the government launched a series of new policies concerning the
establishment of power generating stations in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The growth in power demand has subsided since the mid 1990s due
to the adjustment in the industrial structure and the introduction
of energy-efficient technologies.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Labor Set to Petition for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Union Congress of the
Philippines (TUCP) will formally ask the regional wage and
productivity boards of Metro Manila and Cebu to increase minimum
wages, Business World reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
TUCP spokesman Alex Aguilar was quoted by the newspaper as
saying Tuesday that the formal petitions will be filed with the
Metro Manila and Cebu wage boards next week, seeking 45 peso
(1.125 U.S. dollars) to 55 peso (1.375 U.S. dollars) and 60 peso
(1.5 U.S. dollars) basic wage increases, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The TUCP is one of the country's oldest and largest labor
federations with an estimated membership of two million
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said the statements of President Joseph Estrada which
tend to indicate the administration is open to the possibility of
a wage increase encouraged TUCP to proceed with its petitions.
</P>
<P>
"When President Estrada said the government was studying the
possibility of granting a minimum wage increase this year, we took
this as a sign that the economy may be capable again of supporting
another round of increases and it was time to file our petition,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Executive Secretary Ranaldo Zamora reiterated the
Presidential Palace has no plan to order an across-the-board wage
hike and will instead let the regional wage boards to decide
whether or not local conditions warrant an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said President Estrada has directed the Departments of
Labor and Employment and of Trade and Industry to convene the
regional wage boards and decide on the matter, adding that the
Presidential Palace does see a need to increase the daily minimum
wage in some regions.

<P>
TAIYUAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A young artist in north China's
Shanxi Province has drawn a 300-meter long painting featuring
ancient emperors in 5,000 years of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten year from December 1987 to October 1998, Zhao
Kailei, the painter, used his brush to draw a total of 102
emperors on a scroll that is 1.94 meters high and weighs 150 kg.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the painting also describes distinguished
officials, related historical events and battles including over 20,
000 persons.
</P>
<P>
Zhao referred to large numbers of documents, historic works and
archaeological discoveries. He visited cultural relics and sites
across the country for art clues in his painting.
</P>
<P>
His painting combines the tradition of the Chinese realistic
painting skill, which is characterized by fine brushwork and close
attention to details, with the use of skill on light and color in
Western paintings.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Urged to Improve Safety Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 Chinese people
were killed in industrial, mining and traffic accidents last year,
according to figures released by the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The SETC urged Chinese enterprises "to give top priority to
safety while striving to improve economic efficiency."
</P>
<P>
According to a SETC document quoted by today's China Daily, the
death toll of accidents dropped in 1998 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial and mining accidents dropped 16.63 percent to an
aggregate 15,372 in 1998, with the death toll hitting 14,660.
</P>
<P>
Non-mining firms recorded 5,439 deaths from accidents, down 13.
57 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents shot up 13.8 percent on a year-on-year basis
to 346,129 in 1998, killing 78,067 people.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, private enterprises have the most
serious problem of ignoring the importance of safety. These
enterprises lack safety consciousness and sufficient investment in
safety facilities.
</P>
<P>
Driving at excessive speeds and drivers with less than three
years' driving experience are the main culprits for the high death
toll in traffic accidents, the report said.

HEFEI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The British Federation of
Hemophilia and the Anhui Hemophilia Center in east China's Anhui
Province have decided to work together to try and find an
effective treatment for hemophilia, a hereditary disease that at
present cannot be cured.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the two institutions have signed an
agreement here which will see them work on a series of research
projects in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
This is the first joint effort by Chinese and British
researchers to tackle this particular disease.
</P>
<P>
A group of researchers from both institutions will center on
exploring genetic and antenatal diagnosis in a bid to find a more
efficient way to check out the disease at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
Another related project due to start soon is the prevention of
different types of hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia is a condition in which one of the normal blood-
clotting factors is absent, causing prolonged bleeding from even
minor cuts and injuries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Giant Tumor Removed from Two-year old Chinese Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A two year old girl has had a
massive tumor successfully removed from her abdomen in north
China's Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Doctors found a 3.5 kilogram tumor in the left part of Xue
Mengmeng's abdomen last September after her mother discovered a
fist-sized bulge.
</P>
<P>
It was diagnosed as a tumor immediately but doctors were
cautious about operating for fear of complications which often
occur during this operation.
</P>
<P>
Over the last six months the tumor was growing and became so
big before the operation that the girl could hardly walk and could
only take liquid food.
</P>
<P>
Doctor of the General Hospital attached to the Tianjin Medical
Sciences University, Shang Zhongliang, in charge of the operation,
said that as the girl became weaker so the operation became
riskier.
</P>
<P>
However, in an operation that lasted for over three hours the
tumor was removed and found to be just a little bigger than a
volleyball and almost a third of the girl's weight.
</P>
<P>
Doctors noted that though it is a common disease among children,
discovering such a big tumor is rare.

<HEADLINE> Man United Deny Ajax Keeper Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Manchester United have rubbished claims by the Dutch
international Edwin Van der Sar that they have approached about a
summer move to Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
The Ajax goalkeeper said Manchester United want him to replace
Peter Schmeichel but United boss Alex Ferguson said he is talking
"nonsense", according to the BBC reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The club have been linked with a number of replacements for the
departing Dane including Aston Villa's Mark Bosnich and Ipswich's
England Under-21 keeper Richard Wright, but Van der Sar says he is
top of the list.
</P>
<P>
"Manchester United were in contact with me to ask about my
feelings and availability about joining them if a transfer could
be agreed between the clubs," the 28-year-old told the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I have to be interested," added the five million
pounds rated player.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has denied making any approach but revealed he has a
very short list of two possible replacements.
</P>
<P>
"I've not made my mind up about a goalkeeper, although there
are two we're thinking about," said Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
He would not reveal the identities of his targets, but appeared
confident of successfully signing one of them.
</P>
<P>
"When the time comes to announce a goalkeeping replacement, we
will announce it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sar is thought to be keener to accept United's strict
pay scale which rises to a maximum of 25,000 pounds per week.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman realises he would make a great deal more than that
from sponsorship deals and endorsements.

<HEADLINE> Hodgson Answers Inter Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Blackburn manager Roy
Hodgson is returning to his previous job at Inter Milan, according
to local reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old will coach Inter's first team until the end of
the season when former Juventus coach Marcello Lippi will take
over on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
He was in charge at the Italian club from 1995 to 1997 before
managing Blackburn until his dismissal from Ewood Park last
November.
</P>
<P>
"Internazionale announces that Mr. Roy Hodgson, from today
until the end of the season, will be the technical director of the
first team squad," said a statement from the club.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson will work alongside Luciano Castellini, who was
appointed caretaker coach on 23 March after the resignation of
Romanian Mircea Lucescu.
</P>
<P>
His task is to salvage what has been a disastrous season for
last year's UEFA Cup winners.
</P>
<P>
They are ninth in Serie A, 10 points behind leaders Lazio and
lost to Manchester United in the European Cup quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Star player Ronaldo is reportedly considering leaving the club
after his car was attacked by fans following last week's 3-1
defeat to Udinese.

<HEADLINE> Service Sector Makes Half of Guangzhou's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The service sector has risen to
make up the largest proportion in the economy of this capital of
south China's Guangdong Province, a showcase of the country's
market economy reforms.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show that the service sector
accounted for 50.9 percent of Guangzhou's gross domestic product
in 1998, up from 29.7 percent in 1978, when it launched its
opening-up and market economy reform drive.
</P>
<P>
The service sector has become a pacesetter in Guangzhou's
economic development, with rapidest growth rates reported in the
areas of banking, insurance, transportation, communications and
product distribution, a city official said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Guangzhou had 2,813 banks and bank subsidiaries
by the end of 1998, 27.6 times the figure for 1978. Meanwhile,
overseas banking and insurance institutions have set up 62
operational agencies in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that Guangzhou's retail sales of
consumer goods totaled 90.45 billion yuan (10.9 billion US dollars)
last year, a surge of 46.1 times over the figure for 1978. The per
capita consumption volume was the highest among China's ten
biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's telecommunications and real estate sector are also
among the most developed in China, according to official data.

<HEADLINE> Maps Showing Evidence of Japanese Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The two maps discovered last year
in Xuzhou, a major city in east China's Jiangsu Province, have
been confirmed to be special ordnance surveys used by Japanese
aggressors when occupying the city in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The maps, published in January 1941 by a Japanese news agency,
trace Japanese military bases, as well as local banks, schools,
shops and other facilities in Xuzhou.
</P>
<P>
One of them, the New Greater Xuzhou Map, contains detailed
descriptions of Xuzhou's topography, population, streets, news
agencies, as well as key industries.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the city archives say the maps reveal the fact
that Xuzhou was one of the pivotal Chinese cities in Japan's plan
of occupation.
</P>
<P>
According to other records, including those made by the
Japanese, at least 300,000 Chinese were butchered and more than 20,
000 women raped in December of 1937 in Nanjing, the provincial
capital, by Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
Also known as "the Rape of Nanking (Nanjing)", the Nanjing
Massacre was later described as "a dark page in modern human
civilization" by historians worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Special Steel Tubes To Rebuild Qijiang Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The collapsed Qijiang Rainbow
Bridge in southwest China's Chongqing municipality will be rebuilt
with 496 tons of high quality, seamless steel tubes produced by
the Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official from the company, this show of
faith indicates that the work units responsible for the design and
reconstruction of the bridge have learned a lesson and paid great
attention to the quality of construction materials.
</P>
<P>
The bridge collapsed on January 4, killing 40 people and
injuring 14 others and the accident has shocked the nation.
</P>
<P>
One official held responsible has been sentenced to death and
12 others, including an engineer, a materials supplier, and
several government officials have received prison terms ranging
from three to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Steel tubes produced by the company in accordance with the
requirements of the ISO 9000 standards have been widely used in
the construction of key State projects in China, including the
Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the Nanjing
International Airport and the Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge in
Jiangsu Province.

WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Sacramento Kings forward Chris

Spurs due to a sprained sacro-illiac joint in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
His status for Thursday's contest versus the Los Angeles

ROME, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ronaldo said Tuesday angry fans
actions upon him were intolerable and hinted to leave Inter Milan
if violence repeated.

Ronaldo's parents, sister and nephew were all in the car but no-

"In this climate of tension and fear, somebody could decide to
leave Inter," Ronaldo said.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo, who was in Spain for a friendly between Brazil and his
former club Barcelona, said he had not yet thought of leaving
Inter.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ronnie O'Sullivan and Mark
Williams were both on brink of semi-final berths at the World
Snooker Championships in Sheffield, England on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
World number three O'Sullivan led 1991 champion John Parrott 11-
5 while Welshman Williams led Ireland's Ken Doherty, finalist for
the last two years, by the same score in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan, looking on course for his third semifinal
appearance, made two century breaks, wasting a chance to compile a
maximum 147 when he missed a black after potting 14 reds and 13
blacks with the colours well placed.
</P>
<P>
Williams dropped the first frame against Doherty but claimed
the next eight before the Irishman rallied and cut the lead to 9-5.
</P>
<P>
Williams, beaten by Doherty in last year's semifinals, won the
last two frames of the evening to gain a six-frame cushion at 11-5.
</P>
<P>
Doherty's hopes of reaching the final for the third year
running now hinge on whether he can reproduce the sort of comeback
he made to beat Nigel Bond in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion John Higgins was in superb form in the
opening session of his quarter-final tie against Stephen Lee.
</P>
<P>
Higgins made a second frame clearance of 132 on his way to
establishing a 4-0 interval lead over Lee, who is making his first
quarter-final appearance at the Crucible.
</P>
<P>
Higgins continued in similar vein at the resumption of play,
compiling four half-century breaks to end the session with a
commanding lead of 8-0.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hendry, seeking a record seventh world title,
established a four-frame lead over Welsh qualifier Matthew Stevens.
</P>
<P>
Hendry has yet to notch a century in the tournament but he gave
Stevens few chances to settle into his rhythm, opening up a lead
of 4-0.
</P>
<P>
Stevens reduced Hendry's lead to 5-2 with a 100 break but
Hendry won the last frame of the session to end 6-2 ahead.

<HEADLINE> US Sees no Early Breakthrough in Kosovo Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
that the alliance remains prepared to "pause" its month-long
bombing of Yugoslavia if there is a "demonstrable and verifiable
commitment implemented" of Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the air
strikes would be resumed if Belgrade reneged on its commitment.
</P>
<P>
Rubin insisted "there is no compromise" on the alliance's
primary objectives.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott held
two two-hour meetings in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, now Russia's
special envoy on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Talbott made the trip to try to narrow differences between the
United States and Russia on Kosovo and to ensure relations between
these two nuclear powers are not destroyed by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rubin called the Moscow meetings "constructive", he said,
adding that the issue of NATO's new oil embargo against Yugoslavia
did not figure prominently in Talbott's talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have received assurances from the highest levels of the
Russian government over the weekend and in regular conversations
between Foreign Minister Ivanov and the secretary (of State
Madeleine Albright) that they do not want to enter this conflict,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. "For-Profit" Education Industry A Multi-billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The "for-profit" education
and training industry in the United States is now 70 billion U.S.
dollars, growing at 13 percent a year, according to a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, since 1994, education and training companies have
raised more than 3.4 billion U.S. dollars of equity capital
through more than 38 initial public offerings and 30 follow-on
offerings, said Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Overall, in the United States, the education and training
industry, both for-profit and not-for-profit, reached 740 billion
U.S. dollars in 1998 and is growing at 6 percent a year. Globally,
the industry already tops 2 trillion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The transformation to a knowledge-based economy is creating a
fertile environment in the for-profit education and training
industry and a significant opportunity for investors in the
foreseeable future, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report said, the educational needs of the
knowledge economy, contrasted with the current system's inability
to fill those needs, provide innovative companies with open-ended
opportunities for growth.
</P>
<P>
On new things that are rapidly evolving in education and
training, Merrill Lynch said that technology-based delivery of
education -- distributed learning -- is providing greater access
to more at a lower cost. Educational portals creating an
education-focused gateway to the Internet available to all from
kindergarten to adults is especially a big opportunity for the
for-profit education and training industry.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Need Billion Dollars for Refugees Fleeing Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Balkan countries will need
billions of dollars in aid to deal with the problems caused by a
tidal wave of refugees because of NATO bombing in Kosovo, a draft
joint report from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The costs of humanitarian aid alone could reach upward of
$300 million if the bombing drags on through 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The aid, if provided, did not include the cost of resettling
refugees or rebuilding Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in Kosovo is real," World Bank President James
Wolfensohn told reporters. "It's not just Kosovo and the
Yugoslav Republic, but also adjacent states."
</P>
<P>
The draft report studied the effects on six neighboring
countries to Yugoslavia. They are Albania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonian and Romania.
</P>
<P>
The report emphasized that the strains of providing for
destitute refugees would be great, especially since the
countries most affected, Albania and Macedonia, are poor.
</P>
<P>
"As the refugees have, by and large, been stripped of their
possessions and savings, they are reliant on others --
humanitarian organizations, local residents, recipient country
governments -- to provide for their basic needs," the draft
report said.
</P>
<P>
The financing need was based on an assumption of an influx of
more than 250,000 refugees to the affected countries.
</P>
<P>
Countries, donors and international financial institutions
will meet on Tuesday evening in Washington to discuss the
financing needs of countries affected by the bombing crisis in
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cracks Down on Car Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) has arrested more than 200 people in a
nationwide campaign to crack down on car theft starting from
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Federal and state agents targeted theft rings that stole cars
to order, for chopping into parts or for shipment overseas. More
arrests are expected in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
FBI Assistant Director Thomas Pickard said the recoveries of
stolen vehicles are down in recent years and only 14 percent of
auto thefts result in arrests.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that it is "the lowest success rate for any major
crime".
</P>
<P>
"Organized criminal groups turned their attention to interstate
thefts, particularly motor vehicle theft," Pickard told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 1.4 million vehicles, worth 8 billion dollars, were
stolen and nearly 447,000 were never recovered.
</P>
<P>
Pickard said the FBI and Customs Service estimated that 200,000
of these were shipped overseas for resale.
