<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Soldiers in Angola Expected Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean soldiers serving in
Angola are expected back home by December this year as the United
Nations winds its peacekeeping mission in the war torn southern
African country, the Zimbabwean Defence Minister said today.
</P>
<P>
''We are in the process of making arrangedments of pulling out
in compliance with the U.N. directive, and before the end of the
year we would have pulled outmost of our soldiers,'' Defence
Minister Moven Mahachi told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
October 30 marks the end of the current mandate of the U.N.
observer mission in Angola with all the non-African countries
that formed part of the U.N. military contingent having already
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
Out of the U.N.military contingent which is under the command
of Zimbabwean Major-General Philip Sibanda, only Zimbabwe, Zambia
and Namibia are still to withdraw their forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.Angola Verification Mission with some 7,000 troops and
military observers, has been monitoring the implementation of a
1994 agreement signed in Zambia in 1994 which ended nearly two
decades of civil war between the Angolan government and the
former rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Commending the Zimbabwean forces for their professionalism
while in Angola, Mahachi said, ''I am very impressed with their
performance as they have lived to the expectations of our people
who are disciplined and peace loving by their nature.''
</P>
<P>
Mahachi discounted the possibility of resumption of war in
Angola, saying its nationals probably now realised the
destructiveness of armed conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Hold Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot National Guard's
annual military exercise code-named "Nikiforos '97" will start
Friday, with the participation of Greek airforce and navy, a
high ranking military officer announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Demoetrios Fasaris, the National Guard's Chief of Staff, told
reporters that some 9,000 National Guard reservists will take
part in the manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
He said the scenario includes National Guard's reaction after
an enemy's military pre-emptive strike, with the fall of
parachutists.
</P>
<P>
Greece's National Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopolulos is
expected to arrive in Cyprus Monday to watch the last part of
the five-day exercise, which will climax with a military parade,
according to Fasaris.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and the Greek defense
minister will take the salute of a military parade next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense
pact in November 1993, under which the Greek armed forces will
provide Cyprus with assistance in case the island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey, which
deploys 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Moscow to Protect Safety of Non-CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has urged the Moscow authorities
to process some 15,000 asylum-seekers from outside the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and to prevent them from
being harassed as illegal residents.
</P>
<P>
Despite considerable efforts made by the Russian Federal
Migration Service to implement an asylum procedure in some parts
of Russia, authorities in Moscow have been slow in accepting
asylum-applications, particularly from people who are not from
non-CIS citizens, UNHCR said in a press release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The frustration of asylum-seekers flared into spontaneous
violence Monday, when some 50 asylum-seekers from Angola and
former Zaire stormed into a refugee reception center and
demolished the premises, according to UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
"We had been fearing that such an incident might happen," John
Horekens, UNHCR's director for Europe, said in a statement. "For
years, these people have been living with no prospect of a better
future, in conditions of great hardship, with no security or
rights. They are feeling increasingly hopeless and, in the face of
growing xenophobia, are turning desperate."
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident occurred when representatives of
asylum-seekers visited the reception center to request funeral
fees for a Zairean asylum-seeker who was allegedly killed last
Friday by two unidentified Russians in Mytishi, 20 kilometers
north of Moscow, UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,400 Angolans and former Zaireans are registered in
Moscow, together with 30,400 others from non-CIS countries. UNHCR
provides limited cash allowances as well as medical, school and
social services to 277 Angolans and former Zairean asylum-seekers
in Moscow area.

LUXEMBOURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany today

French Minister of Internal Affairs Jean-Pierre Chevenement and
German State Secretary Kurt Schelter signed the agreement in
Mondorf in Luxembourg, where the EU ministers started the two-day

Under the agreement, the two countries are going to establish a

The German state secretary agreed that this was a further step
taken in the direction of bilateral border cooperation between

rampant organized cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in the framework of the Schengen
Agreement which was signed in March 1995, aimed at opening up
borders to citizens of all EU member countries.

the single European currency, the euro, stronger than the German
mark, a leading economist said today in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"There is little doubt in my mind that the euro will be just as
strong as the German mark.... In fact there is every reason to
believe that the euro will be even stronger than the mark," the
German news agency DPA quoted economist Marc Hendriks as telling
an economic conference in Berlin today.
</P>
<P>
Hendriks, managing director of economic research for the
European investment house SBC Warburg, also said he believed that
the single European currency was likely to pose an effective
challenge to the U.S. dollar. "After all, it is the first time
that the dollar has had any real competition," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also expressed the belief that it was only a
matter of timing that the British government would change its mind
to support the country's participation in the euro club.

ADDIS ABABA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, the
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today said that African churches are important partners in
maintaining peace which is "the single most important demand of
our people".
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief urged African church leaders to exert utmost
effort to ensure that Africa will truly be ''the continent of the
future''.
</P>
<P>
The call was made while Salim was addressing the 7th General
Assembly of All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) at the

church is well placed to play a major role in inculcating a
spirit of understanding and tolerance among our peoples and
countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the role played by archbishop Desmond Tutu during

<HEADLINE> Kirghiz President, Russian PM Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 9 (Xinhua) -- There are no differences between
Russia and Kirghizstan on political, economic and state issues,
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in Bishkek,
capital of Kirghizstan, today, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said this after talking with Kirghiz President
Askar Akayev in Bishkek, where a meeting of the heads of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) governments was held, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Akayev expressed satisfaction with the bilateral relations,
saying that the two states created a firm legal foundation for
their relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted Kirghizstan was the only republic in the CIS this year
to receive a Russian state credit of 45 million U.S. dollars to be
channeled to support the republic's energy sector, including the
purchase of turbines, generators and spares.
</P>
<P>
The Kirghiz president especially noted that "industrial growth
in Russia is the most important factor for the economies of all
CIS countries," since Russian enterprises manufacture the main
production resources for them.
</P>
<P>
Akayev believed that an intergovernment commission on economic,
scientific and cultural cooperation will give an important impetus
to the development of bilateral relations and will start
implementing specific projects.
</P>
<P>
It was said that an agreement on creation of the
intergovernment commission is expected to be signed Friday as a
result of the intergovernment talks between the Russian and
Kirghiz delegations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the existing problems in bilateral relations,
Chernomyrdin voiced support for simplifying formalities to make
mutual trips by citizens of the two countries as well as for
lifting restrictions on cooperation between Russian and Kirghiz
firms.
</P>
<P>
Akayev meanwhile emphasized the importance of Russia as a
trading partner of his country, since the Russian Federation is
responsible for over 30 percent of the total volume of Kirghiz
foreign trade.

CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian archeological team has
hit upon 34 sphinx statues along the Rams Road in the Upper
Egyptian city of Luxor, the site of ancient Egyptian rituals, the
Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Al-Sagheer, director of Luxor and Upper Egyptian
Archeological Department who spearheaded the discovering team,
said some of the new statues date back to the age of King
Tutankhamen who ruled Egypt during 1361-52 BC.
</P>
<P>
Tutankhamen is known chiefly for his intact tomb discovered in
1922. During his reign, powerful advisers restored the traditional
religion and art style.
</P>
<P>
The fresh discovery has brought the number of sphinx statues
unearthed in the area to some 600, Sagheer said.
</P>

Studies estimate that about 1,200 sphinx statues exist within
an area of just a few square kilometers near Luxor.

UNITED NATIONS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. program of "Oil

spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, told a noon briefing
today.
</P>

Eckhard quoted the spokesman for the U.N. Humanitarian

"All efforts are being made by the U.N. to implement the

Iranian jets launched attacks last week against the bases of
the Iranian Mujahideen opposition movement in Iraq and Iraqi

JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the
founder and spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), today called on all Palestinians in the territories and in
diaspora to protect their national Islamic unity and to act for
their return to homeland.
</P>
<P>
Addressing through "Voice of Palestine," Yassin said that
Palestinians must go into action immediately to maintain the
national unity.
</P>
<P>
He added that Palestinians must show their ability of
cooperation because "the enemy is betting that Palestinians will
engage in internal feuds."

Yassin stressed the Palestinian sovereignty on Jerusalem,
saying that "we are one people with the one common goal of
establishing our independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital."
</P>
<P>
Yassin was released by Israel on October 1 and return to his
home Monday in the Gaza Strip as part of a deal between Jordan
and Israel in a bid to rescue two Israeli agents, who were
arrested by Jordanian police after the botched assassination of
Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communists Insist on Raising No-Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Communist Party
intends to raise the question of no-confidence for the government
early next week, Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian
Communist Party, told a news conference in the State Duma today.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said the Federation Council should discuss the
proposal of deputies of the lower house to hold "a round-table
conference" of representatives of three branches of the
authorities, trade unions and political forces. As is known, this
idea was advanced by Communists and their allies.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Communist Party has sent 89 telegrams to every
chief of a subject of the federation, requesting support for the
idea of a "round-table conference."
</P>
<P>
According to Zyuganov, if the Federation Council backs this
initiative, and trade unions have already supported it,
representatives of the three branches of power will be able to
discuss the law on land, the tax code, the military reform, and
this may serve as the basis of a normal course and acceptable
budget.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question what could compel Communists to give
up the idea of no-confidence for the government, Zyuganov said
that the president and the government have an opportunity to make
a decision before the meeting, and there are many variants of
decisions.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party leader is confident that the 1998 budget
will now be turned down and will be referred to a special
trilateral commission of representatives of the State Duma, the
Federation Council and the government.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov noted the Communists are "strongly against" the
conciliatory commission.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Further Release Palestinian Tax Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to push peace
process forward, Israel today informed the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) that it will release 170 million shekels (about 48
million U.S. dollars) of Palestinian tax revenues to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Israeli Deputy Finance Minister
Shmuel Lavin and PNA Planning and International Cooperation
Minister Nabil Sha'ath in West Jerusalem, Lavin confirmed that
the Israeli government intends to further return the tax revenues,
which have been held by Israel for several months.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have complained that because the tax
revenues was frozen by Israel after the July 30 twin suicide
bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, some PNA employees
could not get their salary in time.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Zuhdi
Nashashibi announced that although Israel had returned 40 percent
of the withheld tax money, there were still 110 million dollars of
Palestinian tax money in Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision to repay the owed money is considered as a
good gesture to the PNA after the resumption of the
long-deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace talks early this week
and the first meeting Wednesday in the past eight months between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the PNA was stalled last
March when Israel started to build a controversial new Jewish
neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem. The bombing attacks in
Jerusalem in July and September, which killed 25 people and
wounded more than 300 others, have deepened the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Due to peace efforts by the international community, both
sides made the hard decision to get peace process back on track
in a bid to ease the tensions and prevent the situation in the
region from exploding.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Nigeria Reacts Slowly to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain seems in a hurry to lift
its ban on Nigeria-registered aircraft from its airspace enforced
this May and resume flights on the lucrative London-Lagos route.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the British High Commission to Nigeria said a
letter signed by British authorities concerned dated on August 14
was delivered to the Nigerian authorities on August 21.
</P>
<P>
The letter confirmed that "the UK aeronautical authorities are
lifting the ban on Nigerian-registered aircraft with immediate
effect."
</P>
<P>
About a month later, another letter reiterating that the UK
aviation authorities had actually lifted the ban was written by
the acting high commissioner to the Nigerian Ministry of Aviation
on September 19.
</P>
<P>
However, up to September 25, Nigerian Aviation Minister Ita
Udo-Imeh came out to deny having been aware of the decision.
</P>
<P>
The air commodore said reportedly if there was such a
development, his ministry would be the first to break the news.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Andy Stern, regional general manager of the
British Airways, re-confirmed here the unconditional lifting of
the ban, saying that his company was keen to resume the
London-Lagos route.
</P>
<P>
Still there has been no reaction from the Nigerian government
to date.
</P>
<P>
The ban, imposed by the British side on May 6 this year,
precluded all Nigerian airlines from plying the lucrative
Lagos-London route.
</P>
<P>
It cited the inability of Nigerian aviation authorities to
comply with safety oversight as stipulated by the International
Civil Aviation Organization as reason for the action, which
further accentuated the frosty relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Even before that, Nigeria's national carrier, the Nigeria
Airways was banned from flying to London since February because
of alleged frauds in its airplane insurance.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Nigeria's Ministry of Aviation asked the
British Airways to stop flying to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Now after some five months have passed with few news about
substantial improvement in the safety of the Nigerian civil
aviation sector, the British changed its attitude and has taken
the initiative to seek for resumption of air services.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the British Airways have reportedly kept making
inquiries on the normalization of flights between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We await his (the minister's) response and remain keen to
start flying again with our traditional good value for money,
fares and high quality services," said Andy Stern.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the British airline's haste is not difficult to
understand, according to observers here, because it has suffered
an estimated loss of more than 80 million U.S. Dollars for ticket
revenue alone since the impasse.
</P>
<P>
As for the alleged linger of the Nigerian aviation authorities
to react, observers believe there should be something more than
simply to resume flights on the mentioned route by both sides.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Nigeria Airways senior official reportedly said
earlier this week that the lifting of the ban to reciprocate the
British gesture would only prepare the ground for renegotiations
of the Bilateral Air Services Agreement signed between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the British Airways is bound to recruit its
cabin crew for the Lagos-London route from Nigeria as has been
the airline's practice in other countries. However, the crew at
service now are non-Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Nigeria Airways has to use 350-seated DC10
aircraft to carry passengers while the British Airways employs
Boeing 747 that has a capacity for 450 passengers.
</P>
<P>
By this, the British airline is short-changing its Nigerian
counterpart by 100 passengers for every flight it makes on the
London-Lagos route.
</P>
<P>
It might be clear that doing business on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit should be what Nigeria is seeking to resolve
its dispute with Britain.
</P>
<P>
And for the Nigerians, there comes the opportunity to look
into the infringement of the accord by the British Airways.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Telecom Company Earns $4 Million Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- An annual report released here
today by Mozambique Telecommunications Corporation (TDM) said the
company earned 46.7 billion Meticais or 4 million U.S. Dollars
last year, an 84 percent increase over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report was read out at the ongoing international meeting
on Mozambique telecommunications here at the capital. According
to the report, TDM's total income for last year is 658.9 billion
Meticais (57 million Dollars), up 16 percent compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes the increase to the 2 percent expansion
of nationwide telephone network, a 29.6 percent and 2.2 percent
growth in domestic and international call fees respectively.
</P>
<P>
Rui Fernandes, TDM's general manager said at the meeting that
the only choice for the company to cope with challenges from the
21st century and resist infiltrations from foreign companies into
the Mozambican market is to privatize it gradually.
</P>
<P>
The privatization plan for TDM, he noted, has been sent to the
country's ministerial meeting, which is expected to reach a final
decision on October 14.
</P>
<P>
TDM plans to form "strategic alliance" with international
corporations which could provide technology and capital it needs,
Fernandes said. He disclosed that TDM needs a total of 350
million Dollars of investment by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
TDM is the only telecom company in Mozambique, with 2,416
staff members.

<HEADLINE> French Socialist Party Regrets Prodi's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- France's ruling Socialist Party
regretted the resignation presented today by Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi, and cautioned Italians against the rise of
the extreme-right in their country.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Socialist Party First Secretary
Francois Hollande as saying that the action undertaken by the
government of Prodi over the past one year led Italy onto the
track of economic readjustment and national cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Prodi presented his resignation after failing to persuade the
far-left Refounded Communist Party to support his budget cuts in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hollande said that the French Socialist Party hopes that a
solution will be found to this crisis by the Italians, so that
Italy can maintain its choice to join the European single currency
by January 1999, and to fight unemployment and social inequality.
</P>
<P>
"All should be done to avoid that the Italian right allied
with the extreme-right come to power," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Tsetse Flies in Zanzibar under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has achieved
resounding success in wiping out the notorious tsetse flies with
the use of insect sterilization method.
</P>
<P>
A tsetse eradication team on the isles, led by Dr Arnold Dyck,
said today that the tripanosomiosis disease caused by tsetse
flies among animals is almost non-existent.
</P>
<P>
The success has been attributed to the effectiveness of the
sterile insect technique (SIT), an environmental friendly
technology in which male tsetse flies are reproduced and
sterilized by gama rays, rendering them unable to reproduce when
they mate with female flies, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
The reproduction and radiation of male tsetse flies are being
done at the Tanga-based tse-tse and Tripanosomiosis Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Then the gama sterilized flies are packed ready for aerial
releases from aircraft, which have targeted on the primary tsetse
habitat areas in the southern half of Unguja Island, including
the Jozani Forest.
</P>
<P>
The project, aimed at completely wiping out all tsetse flies
on Unguja island through application of SIT aerial releases, were
introduced in August of 1994. Almost eight million sterile male
flies have been dispersed over Unguja Island since then.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar is the only place in the world where this method has
been experimented, Dyck said, adding that the success of the
model project has proved that it can be experimented anywhere in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said research on disease incidence in sentinel animals
declined to a negligible level early this year.
</P>
<P>
The project has cost about one million U.S. Dollars annually
over the past four years. It has been mainly financed by the
Zanzibar government and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD).

<HEADLINE> Zambia Unable to Meet All Needs from Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia said today that it cannot
meet all the needs from the refugees living in the country
because its economy is already constrained.
</P>
<P>
Sonny Mulenga, Lusaka province minister, said here today when
meeting with refugees from a refugee project that the influx of
refugees has brought devastating effects to the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is trying its best to provide refugees with skill
training so that they can become self-reliant, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Also on the occasion an official from the United National High
Commission for Refugees based here said it is difficult to
provide refugees with all their needs and that it is important
they become self-sufficient through vocational training.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official urged refugees and community help each
other.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has accommodated a total of 130,000 refugees from
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> UN Official: Iraq Receives More Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has received 2.13 million
tonnes of foodstuffs and other supplies in line with the first
phase of the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal launched last December,
a U.N. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, spokesman of the U.N. humanitarian
affairs coordinator in Iraq Eric Valet said that shipments of
medicine worth 5.3 million U.S. dollars arrived in Iraq last week,
bringing the total sum spent on medicine by Iraq so far to over
47 million dollars, accounting for 22.4 percent of the 210 million
dollars earmarked for the health sector during the first phase.
</P>
<P>
International observers are now present at the Al Walid post
along the Iraqi-Syrian borders where another shipment of food
is due to arrive in Iraq, Valet said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the oil-for-food accord has made progress in
providing food to the Iraqi people during the first phase. The
U.N. is sparing no effort to implement the accord
"satisfactorily." Foodstuffs will continue to flow into Iraq, he
added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the second phase of the oil-for-food deal which
started on June 8, Valet said that until October 6 the
U.N. Sanctions Committee had received 61 requests from the Iraqi
government for humanitarian supplies with 28 contracts having been
approved.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2
billion dollars worth of oil over a six month period to buy food,
medicine and other basic needs for the Iraqi people suffering
under U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Canada Has Lowest Business Costs: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada has the lowest business
costs among seven leading North American and European countries,
according to an international study by the professional services
firm KPMG.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is a clear winner" when the impacts of land purchase,
labor taxation and others are combined, said Stuart MacKay, KPMG
partner-in-charge of the study, which was released here today.
</P>
<P>
The study, covering seven countries in Europe and North
America, estimated the total cost to start up a new production
site and operate it for 10 years, for businesses in eight
industries.
</P>
<P>
It found that business costs were lowest in Canada, followed in
order by Sweden, Britain, the United States, Italy, France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the study was welcomed by Canada's
International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi.
</P>
<P>
"These results clearly show that, on the basis of cost, Canada
is the number one location for investors compared to the U.S. and
Europe," Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, each of the seven countries has its own particular
strengths in different areas.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada have the lowest initial investment
costs. Land costs in the U.S. is the lowest, while Canada has the
lowest construction costs.
</P>
<P>
Labor costs, including wages and benefits, are lowest in
Britain, followed by Canada.
</P>
<P>
Transportation costs to the North American and European
marketplace are lowest in Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has the lowest electricity costs, which was closely
followed by Canada.
</P>
<P>
And Canada boasts the lowest interest costs and corporate tax
burden.
</P>
<P>
The KPMG study was sponsored by the Royal Bank of Canada,
Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and
Ontario Hydro.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Postal Services Need to Diversify: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Postal
Corporation (TPC) has been advised to upgrade technology, provide
new services and develop the present business if it is to survive
the stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
Hairsh Bhatt, a charted information system engineer, told
participants in a workshop held in Dar es Salaam today that
diversification of services is the sole way out for TPC.
</P>
<P>
"You have to operate commercially, formulate better policies,
and provide quality and efficient services," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bhatt said alternative communications channels using
information technology (IT) are a real threat to the postal
services, addinging unless something is done, TPC's market share
in personal and business mail will be eroded in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Technologies such as Internet will not only have an impact on
postal services, but also on telephones, publishing and
advertising, Bhatt noted.
</P>
<P>
Internet, however, is not expected to replace all paper-based
documents although it is expected to undergo rapid expansion in
many countries in the coming five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
The information system engineer urged the TPC to buy
affordable personal computers which have an internet connection
and work like TV but disseminate information instantly in any
part of the world.
</P>
<P>
"TPC can open up communication centers in rural areas, using
these computers under its supervision thus meeting the clients'
needs and facilitating the development of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
This will only be possible if TPC will review its policies,
operate commercially and invite potential investors who will be
attracted by a better trend of the company, Bhatt said.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Condemns US Over Terrorist List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Hezbollah today
condemned the United States for listing it as a terrorist
organization and denying its fund-raising in and entry to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, Hezbollah said Israel, which is occupying
south Lebanon, is the genuine terrorist.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Hezbollah never doubts that the U.S. is
the sponsor for the organized international terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced that Hezbollah was among 30 groups placed on a U.S. list
of terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
She said that "As of today it is a crime to provide
funds, weapons or other types of tangible support to any of
the designated organizations."
</P>
<P>
She also called on other governments to take similar actions.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has about 3,000
fighters. It is fighting to oust Israel's 1,200 soldiers and the
2,500 troops of the Israeli ally, South Lebanon Army from the
Israeli-occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It has killed nearly 200 Israeli soldiers in the South since
1985, when Israel set up a 1,000-square-kilometer "security zone"
there to prevent cross-border guerrilla raids.

<HEADLINE> French Interest Rate Rise Not to Affect Economy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The raise of a key interest rate
by the French central bank, La Banque de France, will not affect
the economic policy of the French government, said French Minister
of Industry, Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn today.
</P>
<P>
The Banque de France today raised its tender rate from 3.10
percent to 3.30 percent, a few minutes after the German Bundesbank
made a similar readjustment.
</P>
<P>
The French central bank said that the decision is aimed at
"durably preserving in the present phase of economic cycle the
monetary stability and good level of confidence in the French
franc, and thus maintaining an appropriate environment for a
substantial, healthy and durable economic growth in the 1998-1999
period."
</P>
<P>
"That will not change our economic policy or our framing of
action which is not affected by this raise of 0.20 points of
basis," said Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
He said, "All the indices of today, the consumption of
families, the inquiry into industry, confirm that the economic
resumption is there, that it is solid and... general in
continental Europe."
</P>
<P>
He said that the French government aims to achieve a 3 percent
economic growth in 1998, and a short-term rise of banking interest
rates will only have a marginal impact on the economy.

<HEADLINE> Drastic Action Demanded After Violence Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in Richmond in
South Africa's Kwazulu-Natal province today demanded drastic
measures, including house-to-house searches, to stop the new wave
of violence in the area, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Five more people were killed Wednesday night in two separate
raids on homes, adding the deaths rose to 13 since violence
resumed Saturday night after a period of relative peace in the
area.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting, the Richmond council passed a
resolution calling for prompt and effective action by security
forces, including house-to-house searches.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of the council will be brought to the army
on Friday, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the SANDF (South African National Defense Force)
should cordon off the area and conduct house-to-house searches
for weapons and criminals," Richmond Mayor Andrew Ragalavoo said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the community was in a state of panic following the
latest attacks and that there might be a flow of refugees from
there.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's incidents occurred in the Hlahla and Cuba areas
surrounding Richmond.
</P>
<P>
Many people were so terrified that they chose to sleep outside
rather than in their houses, although the cold snap and rains
made doing this unpleasant, said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal Premier Ben Ngubane said Wednesday that he would
suggest to President Nelson Mandela that a state of emergency
seemed to be the only way to deal with the continuing conflict in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The Richmond area saw frequent clashes between supporters of
the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
All the people killed Wednesday appeared to be from
ANC-supporting areas, police spokesman Henry Budhram said.
</P>
<P>
He said in both attacks the men, armed with R4 and R5 rifles,
appeared to be searching for particular people.
</P>
<P>
The ANC today condemned the new killings. "The precision and
regularity with which these killings are carried out can only
imply support from forces that have both financial and material
support to sustain terrorism of this kind.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, those responsible cannot be mavericks acting
in isolation but part of a broader conspiracy to thwart local
development and peace," the ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, it asked residents in the Richmond area "not to allow
themselves to be provoked into actions that may lead to a spiral
of violence."

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Destroys Gunship of S. Leone Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) which is enforcing blockade on Sierra Leone said
today it has destroyed a gunship of the junta in retaliation of
attacks.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia, said two of the junta's gunships on Wednesday
opened fire on ECOMOG positions in Lungi airport outside the
capital Freetown as well as innocent civilians taking refuge in
ECOMOG protection in the area.
</P>
<P>
To retaliate, ECOMOG helicopters opened fire on the gunships
and destroyed one of them, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG did not give any casualty figures but said that before
Wednesday's incident, gunships belonging to the military junta
had been in constant habit of attacking the Lungi area,
terrorizing civilians there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from Freetown accused ECOMOG of attacking
a military building at the military headquarters, killing four
people and injuring 28 others, including civilians.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian jet released seven rockets and extensively damaged
the building, where a meeting attended by the junta leader Major
Johnny Koroma was originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The venue of the meeting was changed at the last minute, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
A senior junta officer even declared after the ECOMOG attack
that the situation between Nigeria and Sierra Leone "has resulted
into a state of war".
</P>
<P>
But Nigeria said today it is not in a position to declare war
on the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's embargo on Sierra Leone, ordered by west African
leaders, received reinforcement from the United Nations Security
Council which decided Wednesday to impose oil and arms
sanctions against the troubled country.

<HEADLINE> NAA to Discuss New Trans-Atlantic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Legislators from the 16 NATO
member states and 15 central and eastern European countries
gathered here today to discuss the future of the military alliance
and new trans-Atlantic relations.
</P>
<P>
Topics at the annual North Atlantic Assembly (NAA) session
included NATO in the next century, the costs of NATO enlargement,
the reform of the NATO military structure, trans-Atlantic trade in
relation to the defense industry, stability in the Balkans, the
status quo of the Russian armed forces and NATO partnership with
Romania.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also drew observers from Egypt, Japan, Sweden,
Canada, Austria and Switzerland, NAA Secretary General Simon Lunn
told the press today.
</P>
<P>
Consensus building is one of the primary purposes of the NAA
meeting that serves as a vehicle for alliance and central and
eastern European countries to convey national preoccupations and
concerns and inform one another of the different national and
regional perspectives that exist on many key issues.
</P>
<P>
NAA views are normally reflected in recommendations or
resolutions that are then either addressed to the North Atlantic
Council urging certain actions or addressed to NATO member
governments.
</P>
<P>
A plenary session is slated for next Monday when the NATO
secretary general, the Romanian prime minister, the presidents of
both the lower and upper houses of the Romanian parliament will
join the more than 300 parliamentarians on a debate on
"trans-Atlantic relations in a wider alliance."
</P>
<P>
Participating as associate countries in the four-day annual
session were Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Macedonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania,
Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, then Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and then the
Soviet Union were first granted associate country status in 1990
to attend the NAA meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that an NAA annual session was held in a
non-NATO country and Bucharest was chosen in recognition of the
progress Romania has made this year, according to the NAA
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Romania is applying for accession to the North Atlantic
alliance.
</P>
<P>
While replying to a question from the host news service
Rompres, the NAA chief said the fact that a report describing
Romania as an "eligible candidate" for NATO expansion would be
submitted to the NAA committee for defense and security could
bolster the country's chance.
</P>
<P>
But Lunn was cautious as regards when Romania could be invited
to join NATO. It may depend on a smooth accession of Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic that were invited to join NATO at
its summit in Madrid last July.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and the three Baltic states are also applying for NATO
membership.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Sharply down on European Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
today were dealt a second blow by a sudden rise in European
interest rates following US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan's
bearish comments Wednesday and all plunged sharply to end in the
negative grounds.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates rises in Germany and France dealt the London
market another body blow less than 24 hours after Alan Greenspan's
warning about inflation and unrealistic stock market expectations.
</P>
<P>
The rise in core European rates is being seen as a step toward
European economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that rate sensitive bank and insurance stocks led
the retreat. The FTSE 100 index closed down 44.6 points at
5,217.5, but had been early 100 lower at worst. A rebound in the
Dow from an initial 90-point drop gave London a fillip.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt closed the session 104.23 points
lower at 4,243.01. Shares were hit by the Bundesbank's decision to
raise its repo rate and Wall Street's sharp overnight decline.
</P>
<P>
The bank's decision to raise the rate to 3.3 percent from 3.0
percent pushed the DAX index down an extra 20 points on top of the
drop inspired by the slump in the Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index closed down 63.43 points
or more than two percent at 2,960.65 as French stocks came under
pressure following the Bank of France's interest rate rise today.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Warns Iraq not to Entering No-Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen on Thursday warned Iraq's aircraft not to fly over
the southern part of their own country, claimed by the United
States as a no-fly zone
</P>
<P>
"If they make a mistake, they will have to bear the
consequences," Cohen said at a photo session with Israeli
President Erez Weizman at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken measures to tighten (control over) the area
around which they seem intent on seeking to exploit on a very
quick and piecemeal basis," he said. But he did not elaborate what
measures the U.S. military had taken.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said on Wednesday the U.S. warplanes had recently
increased patrols over the two zones set in northern and southern
Iraq
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz is now steaming toward the
Gulf ahead of schedule with more than 40 warplanes to help patrol
the no-fly zone in the southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Saddam Hussein continues to violate the no-fly
zones on a periodic basis... He is posing a risk to his pilots
whenever they start to challenge the no-fly zone," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched attack last week on bases of the Mujahideen
guerilla bases inside Iraq and Iraqi jet fighters rose to defend
the area, which was deemed by the United States as "violation"
of the no-fly zone.

<HEADLINE> Gun Makers Agree to Child Safety Locks on Handguns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Executives from eight major
gun makers promised on Thursday to provide child-proof locks with
all of their handguns.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said their commitment will equip by
the end of next year about 80 percent of handguns sold in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton invited executives from Glock, Beretta, Taurus, H&AMP;R,
Heckler &AMP; Koch, Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Mossberg &AMP; Sons, and SigArms
to stand in Rose Garden and be applauded by the assembly of top
law enforcement officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno.
Clinton expressed the hope that other handgun makers will follow
their lead.
</P>
<P>
Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, said that child-proof locks must be accompanied by
safe storage and safe firearms training.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Department estimates, more than one-third
of all privately owned handguns -- some 22 million -- are kept
loaded and unlocked. Easy access to these weapons send 1,500
children to hospital emergency rooms each year.
</P>
<P>
Protecting these kids, Clinton said, "is now my highest law
enforcement priority."
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony also meant to honor heroic police officers
selected by the National Association of Police Organizations,
Clinton also asked Congress to expand to state and local officers
a government scholarship program for the surviving dependents of
federal police officers killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
The gun makers today were following the lead of Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co. and Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., the world's largest maker of
handguns, who made similar commitments earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In March, the president directed all federal agencies to
require safety locks on handguns issued to law-enforcement
officers.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Hotel Industry Faces Big Blow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- As many as 450 Turkish hotels
face huge losses ahead as their major tour operator is on verge of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The insolvency challenging the Tursem, the third largest travel
agency in Turkey, will result in a drastic fall in the number of
tourists to the Aegean and Mediterranean resorts, the Turkish
Hotel Association (TUROB) warned today.
</P>
<P>
"The situation involving this company (Tursem) will lead to
the closure of some of the hotels affected," the TUROB said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 Turkish tourists and 8,000 foreign tourists
currently in those resorts will be flown home by other travel
agencies at the end of their vacations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Tursem's crisis was resulted from fluctuations in the value of
European currencies against the U.S. dollar, recent cash flow
problems as well as the cancellation of several large tours last
year.
</P>
<P>
The travel agency, which carried a total of 450,000 tourists to
Turkey and earned 84.6 million U.S. dollars in 1996, has asked for
help from the Turkish government and some international financial
groups.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Istanbul Monday, Tursem
Chairman Haluk Semiz urged Tursem's bank creditors to help it out
of the current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
At present, TUROB executives are reportedly holding talks with
the Turkish Tourism Ministry in Ankara to find a way to bail out
Tursem.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is one of the major pillars for Turkish
economy. Around 8.9 million foreign tourists visited Turkey in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Intense Fighting Breaks out Across Congo River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Intense artillery exchanges
broke out today across the Congo River that separates cities of
Kinshasa and Brazzaville, Radio Cameroun reported.
</P>
<P>
Confusion spread through the streets of Kinshasa, capital of
the Democratic Republic of Congo, when it came under renewed
artillery and rocket attacks, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers were killed and three others wounded when one
shell exploded at the gate of President Laurent Kabila's office.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa responded by intensifying cannon and rocket fires
across the river, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The attack appeared to be coming from the Brazzaville city
center, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
No casualty figures were given for the counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa had already sent several hundred troops to
Brazzaville, especially on a mission to prevent artillery attacks
from its neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, artillery shells killed 31 people in Kinshasa.
Democratic Congo had appealed to the United Nations Security
Council to discuss the Congo crisis to curb the escalation of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Brazzaville said more than 4,000 people have been
killed since the fighting erupted in June between the forces
loyal to Congolese President Pascal Lissouba and his rival former
President Sassou Nguesso.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Government' Position on Trade Link Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Any commercial transactions
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the island should be
conducted within the framework of the existing constitutional and
legal order, a senior Cypriot government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his return from the U.S. where he attended a
meeting with U.S. business leaders, Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou said that under such conditions, the
Cypriot government does not object to the trade links between the
two communities before the solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in New York, which was also attended by Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Central Bank Governor Afxentis
Afxentiou, was held at the initiative of U.S. presidential
emissary for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke has suggested that the two rival Cypriot communities
establish trade links as a step toward reconciliation between
them.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statement by Holbrooke about joint ventures
between the two communities on the island, Christodoulou said he
considers Holbrooke's plans to attract U.S. investment in Cyprus
as "natural," because Holbrooke is the vice chairman of the Credit
Swiss, one of the three largest banks in the world.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Cypriot government has clarified to
U.S. officials that if joint commercial transactions between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots are undertaken, they must be held
within the framework of the existing constitutional and legal
order with full recognition of the existing reality, the
independence and sovereignty of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
If this is so, he added, "then the Cyprus government will not
object such transactions before a settlement."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the 37 percent of the island following a
short-lived pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has maintained a boycott of the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" since its
unilateral declaration of independence in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Reform Legislation Stalled in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Thursday
failed again to move forward legislation overhauling the campaign
finance system after an effort by moderate Republicans to forge a
compromise collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The Senate fell short of ending a Republican-led filibuster --
a deliberate measure of obstructing legislation by endless debate
-- against a bipartisan campaign finance bill, which is backed by
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In a second vote, the Senate failed to end a Democratic-led
filibuster against a Republican amendment that would make it
tougher for unions to spend members' dues on political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
While Republicans oppose a package that doesn't protect union
members from having their dues used without their permission for
political purposes, and Democrats don't want unions singled out
without similar protection for members of other organizations and
to shareholders in corporations.
</P>
<P>
The vote to end debate on the campaign bill cosponsored by
Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Senator
Russell Feingold of Wisconsin was 52-47, eight short of the 60
votes required. It was the third defeat this week.
</P>
<P>
On Lott's amendment to require unions to get each member's
permission before using dues for political purposes, the vote was
51-48, nine short of the 60 needed. It was the second defeat this
week.
</P>
<P>
The McCain-Feingold bill would ban unlimited, unregulated
"soft-money" contributions to political parties and regulate
independent advertising campaigns by outside groups that promote a
specific candidate. It also would provide incentives for
politicians not to spend too much of their own money, impose new
disclosure requirements on campaign donations, and put into law a
Supreme Court decision letting non-union workers get reimbursed
for fees the union spends on political purposes.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who headed the effort to
fight the bill, said the McCain-Feingold bill is an
unconstitutional restriction on donations the Supreme court
contends are a protected form of free speech.
</P>
<P>
Democrats contend Lott's amendment regarding union dues is a
"poison pill" designed to undercut Democratic support for
McCain-Feingold.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- A Lebanese steel company suggested that the level of
duty on foreign imports return to 21 percent in a bid to curb
illegal dumping of sub-standard material.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese English-language newspaper Daily Star reported today
that Consolidated Steel, a leading steel company in Lebanon,
complained in a statement that foreign producers are taking
advantage of Lebanon's unregulated construction industry to dump
their sub-standard material.
</P>
<P>
The import of sub-standard foreign steel harms Lebanon's own
steel industry, causing the closure of steel production lines and
the redundancy of many workers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all these imports are produced in the former Soviet
Union and are of very low quality. They have a high carbon
content and are untraceable, the company said.
</P>
<P>
It appealed the government to take a temporary selective
measure to protect Lebanon from the illegal dumping and
introduce regulations on construction standards.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Libya today opened a joint gas and auto
service station in Sidi Barani on the Egyptian-Libyan borders.
</P>
<P>
It is the 5th of the 50 stations to be built by a joint
Egyptian-Libyan investment company in all parts of Egypt and on
the trunk roads between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The station was inaugurated by Egyptian Petroleum Minister
Hamdi Al-Banbi and Libyan Secretary of Energy Abdallah Al-Badri.
</P>
<P>
Banbi said that a 622-kilometer long oil pipeline will be also
constructed to pump 950,000 barrels of Libyan crude oil a day to
Egyptian oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The growth rate of Israel's industrial output
slacked up to only 2.4 percent in the January-July period, Israeli
Manufacturers Association said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure indicates there will be a 3 percent growth for the
whole year, the lowest in seven years, said Shuki Abramowitz, head
of the association's economics division.
</P>
<P>
According to a study the association conducted, the machinery
and equipment sector reported a slowdown of 6.3 percent in the
first six months of the year, whereas the textiles industry
experienced a 3.4 percent slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the rubber sand plastics sector had a 1.4 percent
slowdown and the non-metallic minerals industry slowed by 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with these figures, the electronics components
sector reported a growth of 10.8 percent, while the
telecommunications equipment grew by 10.5 percent and the metals
industry grew by 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The number of visa credit card holders reached 1.9
million in the Middle East region by the end of last June,
representing a 46 percent growth over that a year earlier, Beirut
Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Visa expenditure in the Middle East amounted to 5.8 billion
U.S. dollars, registering an increase of 103 percent during the
year ending last June, the paper quoted Tony Brogna, area manager
for the Middle East Business Development for Visa, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait had the
lion's share in the volume of visa credit card use in the Middle
East. Iranian banks are also increasingly dealing with the cards
with two Iranian banks operating visa policies, he added.

<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's official interest rates
are to stay on hold at seven percent, Britain's central bank the
Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee announced today.
</P>
<P>
The move will bring relief for millions of homebuyers and
businesses who have seen the base rate rise four times since the
general election in May.
</P>
<P>
The decision was as expected and came despite the fact that the
inflation rate is still above the government's 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
But industry has pointed to figures showing that economic
growth is still sluggish, reducing fears of inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany and France shocked global markets by raising
key rates, followed immediately by several other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Bundesbank raised its repo rate to 3.3 percent from
3.0 percent today and the Bank of France followed suit and lifted
its intervention rate to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that today's central bank fiscal signals marked
the first co-ordinated European interest rate action toward
European economic and monetary union.

NICOSIA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will participate in
"World Telefood," the first global television appeal by the Food

funds for food security projects and activities.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Minister of Agriculture,
Natural Resources and Environment Costas Petrides in his speech on

BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bundestag, the lower house of
the German parliament, today approved a bill to reduce state
retirement pensions from the present 70 percent of average net
wages to 64 percent during the period from the year 2015 to 2030.
</P>

However, the main opposition Social Democratic Party vowed to

</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government intends to keep the monthly
pension fund payments at its current level of 20.3 percent of
wages or salaries.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here said that the expenditure would rise to 20.8
percent next year unless the government further raises subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's government also considers raising value added tax to
16 percent from the current level of 15 percent to boost revenue
and offset the increase in pension contributions.

cooperation, while another agreement called for strengthening
cooperation in science, anti-drug war, military and defense.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said after the talks with Jumagulov that the
setting-up of the inter-governmental committee is the best way to
cooperate between Russia and Kirghizstan.
</P>
<P>
Jumagulov highlighted the importance of the inter-governmental
committee, saying the committee will supervise and coordinate the
implementation of bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin went on to say that though Russia and Kirghizstan
have no plan to form a union in the near future, the two countries
are both committed to integration at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the CIS is a good form of promoting
integration among member countries.
</P>
<P>
The CIS, which includes 12 of the 15 former Soviet republics,
was established as the Soviet Union dissolved at the end of
1991. It is intended to preserve and develop ties between the
republics.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang Documents Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Applause erupted when Aoyama
Keiji from Japan presented eight ancient Dunhuang documents to
Duan Wenjie, president of the Dunhuang Research Institute,
</P>
<P>
"This marks the first time a foreigner has returned intact
Dunhuang documents to China," said Duan, adding that an untold
number of Dunhuang relics remain scattered abroad.
</P>
<P>
Experts conducted a precise appraisal and concluded that the
aforementioned valuable documents, each of which dates back at
least 1,000 years, came from a cave in the Mogao Grottos in
northwest China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
Early this century, a Taoist priest by the name of Wang Yuanlu
quite unexpectedly discovered that a cave in Mogao was filled with
tens of thousands of ancient documents, Buddhist sutras and arts
and crafts.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the relics were seized by so-called 'western
explorers' within a short period of five years," said Duan.
</P>
<P>
A survey revealed that Dunhuang documents and relics are
currently in collections in 14-odd foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Chinese experts have called on the
countries in question to return Dunhuang relics to China, or to
otherwise return some for exhibitions. The experts note that their
appeals fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the importance of Dunhuang relics is enhanced when
they are returned to the place of their origin," said Aoyama
Keiji. The Japanese benefactor said that he inherited the
treasures from his father Aoyama Sanu, who had purchased them 10
years earlier in a Tokyo bookstore selling ancient documents.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Research Institute plans to hold a series of
activities in 1999 to mark the 100th anniversary of the discovery
of the cave which held priceless Buddhist sutras. Collectors known
to have Dunhuang documents will be invited to attend the
exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Remains Unchanged in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's jobless rate remained
at 9 percent in September, unchanged for the third consecutive
month, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's overall employment edged up slightly in the month,
bringing the gain, which started from February, to 293,000, the
federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
September saw more full-time employment with a growth of 72,000
and fewer part-time jobs with a fall of 56,000, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the month, employment in the private sector increased by
17,000, with a gain of 44,000 in employees and a decline of 27,000
in self-employment. The employment in the public sector remained
at the same level.
</P>
<P>
Since February this year, the country's private sector has
generated 331,000 jobs, with self-employment accounting for a
quarter of this growth.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, public sector employment has trended downwards,
with a loss of 38,000 jobs over the same period.
</P>
<P>
In September, most industries showed little employment change,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
While there was employment growth in the mining, quarrying and
oil well industry, this gain was partly offset by a loss in
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Probe Toxic Toy Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Health Department of Canada
will probe claims by Greenpeace that vinyl toys and other products
for children contain hazardous levels of lead and cadmium.
</P>
<P>
The products will be tested to determine if they contain toxic
levels of lead and cadmium, and if so, whether those metals are
released in a form that can be absorbed by human bodies, local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Test results are expected within two weeks, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace study found high levels of lead and cadmium in a
variety of Canadian products made from PVC plastic, also known as
vinyl. The products include toys, raincoats, backpacks and key
rings.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever there is lead in products we are always concerned," a
spokesman for the health department was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, parents of Canadian children under seven were warned
to get rid of mini-blinds made from PVC.
</P>
<P>
Lead has been linked to reduced intelligence, and cadmium can
cause kidney damage, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Suspected 1986 Berlin Disco Attacker Extradited to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan national suspected of a
link with the 1986 deadly bombing of a Berlin discotheque today
was extradited to Germany six weeks after being arrested in Italy,
local press reported here.
</P>
<P>
Musbah Eter, 40, fleeing Berlin last July after a warrant for
his arrest was issued, is accused of building the explosive device
which blew up on April 5, 1986 at the LaBella discotheque
frequented by U.S. soldiers, killing three people and injuring 260
others.
</P>
<P>
He will stand trial in Berlin on November 18 on charge of
involvement in the attack along with three other defendants --
Palestinian Yassir Chraidi, Ali Chanaa, a German national, and his
ex-wife Verena.
</P>
<P>
They are all charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan secret service was said to have plotted the 1986
attack in the discotheque, which was mainly visited by
U.S. soldiers stationed in west Berlin. But the Libyan government
has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, Washington ordered air strikes against the Libyan
cities of Tripoli and Benghazi the same year in which dozens of
people were killed.

<HEADLINE> Party Congress Expected to Promote Trade Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China's intent to accelerate
reforms and open wider to the outside world in the wake of the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will
provide new opportunities for economic and trade cooperation
between both sides of the Taiwan Straits, according to a senior
Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
The report Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), presented to the
15th Party Congress reiterated China's basic policy on Taiwan and
exhibited the mainland's sincere desire to promote trade
cooperation, according to Wang Hui, deputy director of the Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic cooperation fully accords with the objective
law of development despite the restrictions the Taiwan authorities
have placed on investments in the mainland of China. A new surge
of investment is bound to accompany increasing opportunities, said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
The cross-Straits trade volume has witnessed rapid development
since China introduced economic reforms in 1978. The trade volume
has grown by an annual average rate of 27 percent and soared from
7.4 billion US dollars in 1992 to 18.9 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investments have grown by 15.4-fold to 14.2 billion US
do over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of Taiwan investment to total overseas investments on
the Chinese mainland has jumped from 1.1 percent to seven percent,
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwan investors have expanded their scope of
investment from labor-intensive industries to the energy,
infrastructure and high technology sectors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged the Taiwan Authorities to refrain from blocking
economic cooperation between the two sides due to the divergence
of political opinions and to remove restrictions preventing local
industrial and commercial sectors from investing on the mainland.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
(parliament) President Chea Sim and First Deputy President Loy Sim
Chheag today called on exiled assembly members abroad to return
home for parliament sessions scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
An appeal, which was jointly signed by Chea Sim and Loy Sim
Chheag, warned that those who fail to return home before the
deadline of October 28 will lose their membership of parliament
automatically.
</P>
<P>
The appeal said it was understandable that some assembly
members temporarily left their home country before and after the
"July Incident" over worries about an imminent war in Cambodia or
possible violence threatening their personal safety.
</P>
<P>
"But now the tension in both the capital city of Phnom Penh and
other areas in the country has eased and life has returned to
normal," the appeal said. It urged the assembly members still
abroad to return home and fulfill their duties before October 28.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the general elections to be held as
scheduled in May next year, the Cambodian National Assembly will
discuss and pass the election law and party law by the end of
October, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
There are still 15 Cambodian assembly members from Funcinpec
Party and Khmer Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, living in exile
abroad, including National Assembly Second Deputy President Son
Sou Ber.

BAGHDAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The first group of Iranians
arrived in Iraq today across the Al Waleed border post to visit
Shiite Muslim holy shrines, an Iraqi official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, Sirowan Abdul Qader,
Chairman of the Iraqi Tourist Authority, said that other Iranian
groups would be arriving in Iraq successively in the coming few
days.
</P>

He said that the Iraqi Al Hoda company for religious tourism
would provide the necessary and best facilities to the Iranian
visitors to perform their prayers at the holy sites in Iraq.
</P>

countries broke out in 1980.

BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- German Economics Minister Guenter

Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps

<HEADLINE> Editorial to Hail Forthcoming World Petroleum Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
national newspaper, will carry an editorial tomorrow, hailing the
forthcoming 15th World Petroleum Congress and extending a warm
welcome to friends from throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the congress, the first of its kind to be held in
a developing country, will be held in China indicates the
increasing strength and rising international status of the
nation's petroleum industry, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The congress will also provide an excellent opportunity for
China to learn more about advanced technology and management in
other countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
The concerted efforts of all participants will ensure that the
congress will foster a new era for the world's petroleum industry,
and the industry will in turn make greater contributions to the
prosperity of the global economy and the progress of human
society, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has consistently placed great emphasis
on developing oil and gas resources since the founding of New
China in 1949 when the nation's annual crude oil production stood
at a mere 120,000 tons, it noted.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, however, China's 24 major oil and gas production
centers ranked fifth in the world with annual production of 157
million tons, and natural gas output of 20.1 billion cu.m., the
editorial pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China currently has more than 20 large petro-chemical
enterprises with a combined annual refining capacity of 230
million tons of crude oil, it said.

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates Rising Steel Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Projections call for China's
annual steel output of between 105-115 million tons by the end of
the century to basically meet the needs for domestic economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The steel industry will expand efforts to gain the lion's share
of the domestic market and will increase its competitiveness on
the international market, according to Niu Dongchun, an official of
the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The sector, which anticipates an influx of 300 billion yuan in
investments during the 1996-2000 period, will place priority on
upgrading existing enterprises, and producing steel and stainless
steel products for the automobile, petroleum, power generation
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage various qualified enterprises to
either establish ventures abroad in order to develop and produce
resources in short supply, including iron ore and pellets, or sign
long-term contracts with foreign countries for raw materials.
</P>
<P>
China's 1996 steel output of 101.23 million tons ranked the
country as the world's largest steel producer. Nonetheless, the
steel industry continues to lag far behind other countries in
terms of production technique and equipment.
</P>
<P>
China will need 110-120 million tons of steel by the end of the
century based on an expected average annual eight percent growth
in GDP.

cooperation ties with Chinese companies over the past 20 years and
more. He added that China's economic growth is important to his
company.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Three More Satellites This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China is to launch three more
satellites within this year, including one telecommunications
satellite and two iridium satellites, Wang Liheng, vice-president
of China Aerospace Corporation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing for the Second China International Aerospace
and Aviation Exhibition (China Airshow '98), due in November next
year, he said that China planned to launch a telecom satellite
with home-made Long March 3B rocket in about ten days.
</P>
<P>
The improved model of the Long March 2C has already been used
for the trial launching of an iridium satellite this year.
</P>
<P>
China this year has successfully sent the home-made
Dongfanghong-3 telecom satellite and FY-2 meteorological satellite
into the orbit. Also, the country sent off last August
Mabuhaysat, a telecom satellite made by the US-based Space System
for the Philippine Mabuhay Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the results were accomplished one year after
the first China Airshow '96.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the technical level of China-made satellites
have reached the international standards in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Also, China has developed its own Long March rocket family, of
which the propelling capacity of Long March 3B to send a
satellite into the geo-synchronous orbit has hit 5,000 kg. "That
can meet the demands of about 90 percent of the international
commercial launching," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China has also made progress in other applications, including
space seed-breeding, satellite disaster reduction and innovation
of traditional industries with space technologies. The seeds
cultivated in the space can increase 10 percent of per-unit grain
yield, contributing to China's plan to increase 50 billion kg of
grain in its Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> Manila, U.S. to Forge Accord on Status of Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United
States are expected to eventually forge a new Status of Forces
Agreement (SOFA) between them before the end of this year, a
senior Philippine diplomat said today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said the
conclusion of a new SOFA with the U.S. could even be materialized
this month if U.S. representatives will be able to come here to
finalize the draft agreement they have been working on since late
last year.
</P>
<P>
Severino, who just came back home from the U.S. where he had
another round of talks on the SOFA, said that both sides desire to
conclude an agreement but that they are yet unable to agree on the
remaining contentious points.
</P>
<P>
He declined to divulge the remaining points of disagreement,
but stressed they don't involve the issues of "immunity" and
"permanent presence of U.S. forces in the country or even U.S.
access to Philippine military bases."
</P>
<P>
The new SOFA accord, Severino explained, is based on the
existing Philippines-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT).
</P>
<P>
The regular annual joint military exercises have been
temporarily suspended pending the conclusion of the new SOFA
accord that will provide the exercises a legal basis.
</P>
<P>
Besides the United States, the Philippines has been negotiating
separately with Britain and some other countries on similar
accords on the status of foreign soldiers participating in joint
war games on the Philippine territory.
</P>
<P>
The old SOFA between the United States and the Philippines
ended with the termination of the Philippines-U.S. Bases Agreement
in 1991, under which American troops pulled out of Subic Naval
Base, the last U.S. base in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new SOFA accord, once finalized, will have yet to be
ratified by the Philippine Senate before it could be operational.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Denies US-Israeli-Jordanian Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official has
denied circulating reports about a U.S.-Israeli-Jordanian plot
against the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview carried by today's Tunisian newspaper
Al Shorouq, Mohammad Abas (Abu Mazen), Secretary General of
Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee and Arafat's
Deputy, said he was not aware of reports claiming that PNA
President Yasser Arafat, at a closed meeting of the Palestinian
Council, had revealed a "U.S.-Israeli-Jordanian plot" aimed at
bypassing the PNA.
</P>
<P>
He said such reports are not credible unless they directly
emanated from Arafat's office. No one else is empowered to make
such statements, he added.
</P>
<P>
On circulating reports that Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy was considering resignation on the grounds that he has been
ignored by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on many
occasions, Abu Mazen said that Netanyahu's differences with Levy
are overt and commonplace. But he doubted whether this could
actually lead to Levy's resignation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Levy complained about not being informed in
advance of the attempted murder attack on Hamas leader Khaled
Mashaal in Jordan last month.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Expands Cooperation with Chinese Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- AlliedSignal Aerospace on
Thursday announced a six million US dollar long-term agreement
with Air China.
</P>
<P>
The company also announced the delivery of flight management
systems (FMS) valued at 3.6 million US dollars to two other
Chinese airlines.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Air China grants AlliedSignal exclusive
rights to supply advanced auxiliary power units for Air China's
fleet of B737-300 aircraft. The auxiliary power units are designed
to provide electricity and pneumatic power for aircraft both on
the ground and in flight.
</P>
<P>
The contract resulted from AlliedSignal's commitment to become
a major supplier of aerospace products in China, according to Tom
Johnson, vice-president of the company's Commercial Auxiliary
Power Department.
</P>
<P>
China Eastern and China Northern airlines will replace older
systems with new FMS purchased from AlliedSignal, according to the
senior manager of AlliedSignal's communications and navigation
systems.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines plan to use the global positioning system's
receivers as the primary means of navigation on oceanic and remote
routes, and for approaches to airports in poor visibility.
</P>
<P>
A separate agreement calls for AlliedSignal to provide FMS
training to some 300 pilots and maintenance personnel in seven
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
AlliedSignal Aerospace, the world's largest supplier of
aerospace equipment and systems, has established three joint
ventures in China. AlliedSignal, the parent company, has invested
a total of some 150 million US dollars in China.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Nobel Peace Prize Goes to ICBL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 Nobel Peace Prize
today was awarded to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines
(ICBL) and its coordinator Jody Williams.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it made the decision as a
recognition of the co-winners' "work in the banning and clearing
of anti-personnel mines."
</P>
<P>
The ICBL and Jody Williams have made the ban on anti-personnel
mines from a vision to a feasible reality in a few years, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the ICBL's efforts, an international treaty against
landmines will be signed in Ottawa this December.
</P>
<P>
The ICBL is a network with over 1,000 member organizations,
"through which it has been possible to express and mediate a broad
wave of popular commitment in an unprecedented way."
</P>
<P>
Currently, over 100 million anti-personnel mines are scattered
over large areas of land on several continents.
</P>
<P>
Such mines pose a major threat to the safety of civilians as
well as the social and economic development of the countries
affected.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Nobel Committee calls for wider support for the
Ottawa process, viewing it as a model for similar processes in the
future.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Key Construction Market for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean overseas builders
are experiencing a second "golden time" from the early 1980s, with
China, Singapore and Indonesia having become its key overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Contractors Association of
Korea, South Korean companies won contracts amounting to 1.53
billion U.S. dollars from China during the January-September
period, up 157.7 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest number of contracts that South Korean
firms have ever earned from China in history.
</P>
<P>
South Korean companies received orders valued at 9.7 billion
dollars from abroad in the first nine months this year, a 45
percent increase over the same period last year, the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, domestic companies placed orders worth 1.44 billion
dollars and 1.03 billion dollars with Singapore and Indonesia in
the first nine months, up 100 percent and 124 percent from the
same period of last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, cooperation with India, the United States
and Malaysia have scaled down dramatically despite fertile
cooperation in the past.
</P>
<P>
India, the largest market for South Korea last year, have
fallen to the fourth place with 940 million dollars this year,
only 64.3 percent of that in last year.
</P>
<P>
Orders from the United States and Malaysia were also reported
declining this year, standing at only 296 million dollars and 126
million dollars, which increased 8.5 percent and 27 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Fischer's Visit to Malaysia Overshadowed By Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer's trade mission to Kuala Lumpur next week is overshadowed
by Malaysia's decision to overlook an Australia's bid for a 1.45
billion U.S. dollars defense contract.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is also trade minister, is due to sign a new
bilateral trade pact with Malaysia next week, replacing a 1958
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The visit will now follow the loss by Australia's Transfield
Defense Systems of a major bid to supply the Malaysian navy with
up to 27 new patrol ships.
</P>
<P>
Fischer expressed his disappointment over ABC Radio today that
Malaysia had chosen a German company over Transfield.
</P>
<P>
He blamed former prime minister Paul Keating's description of
Malaysia's leader Mahathir Mohamad as "recalcitrant" four years
ago, saying it may have contributed to the loss.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of foreign affairs and trade today
attempted to play down speculation that the old diplomatic row had
contributed to the loss, saying it was too early to tell what had
led to Malaysia's decision.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear the government is very disappointed at the
outcome but at the same time, it seems the decision has been taken
on commercial grounds. There is nothing to indicate to us
otherwise," officials were quoted by Australian Associated Press
as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were not sure if they could secure a
meeting between Fischer and Mahathir because the Malaysian leader
was preparing to announce his budget next Friday.
</P>
<P>
But they stressed that Australia had worked hard to improve
diplomatic ties with Mahathir and they were trying to make
arrangement for Prime Minister John Howard's first visit to the
country.
</P>
<P>
"It's simply a question of timing and more likely (to take
place) next year," they added.
</P>
<P>
A defense ministry spokesman in Kuala Lumpur was reported to
refused to comment on the patrol ships contract today, although a
shipping industry source said it had been awarded to an
unidentified company four days earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China will raise a fund of 830
billion yuan through every possible channel for 340 key projects
of its transportation industry in the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Li Duanshen, head of the transportation and energy department
of the State Planning Commission, said at a press conference here
today that China's cargo transportation volume will hit 16 billion
tons in the year 2000, and passenger transportation volume will
reach 17.5 billion people, with the annual growth amounting to 5.2
percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the industry grew at a high speed during the
1991-1995 period. Cargo transportation volume rose by 2.5 percent
to reach 12.7 billion tons in 1996, while the passenger
transportation volume scored 12.5 billion people, up 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state will continue to offer the sector preferential
policies and set up a special fund to increase its comprehensive
transportation capacity in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Burns 2.5 Million Fraud Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian authorities have burnt
2.5 million letters written by Advanced Fee Fraud plotters in
Lagos, the Punch newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that they burnt Tuesday the letters filling
150 mail bags, intercepted at the Lagos international airport
between January 1996 and March 1997, by the Telecommunications
and Post Offenses Task Force.
</P>
<P>
Chiroma Wandeo, an official of the task force, said the
letters were affixed with illegal franking stamps and forged
postage stamps valued at the 70 million Naira (about 850,000 U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Seventeen staff of the Nigerian Postal Services and the
National Cargo Handling Company have been arrested and are being
investigated for involvement in the offenses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Advanced Fee Fraud is also widely known as 419 crime for the
section 419 of the Nigerian Criminal Code against it. It has
become so rampant in the last few years that the government has
to introduce a special law against it in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The cheaters often send out thousands of letters to overseas
promising lucrative business opportunities in Nigeria and
persuade the victims to pay an advanced fee to get the money. In
one case, a victim was cheated five million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Consolidates After Strong Job Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today against the U.S. dollar, but traders said sentiment
remains positive and the currency is primed for moving higher.
</P>
<P>
The September labor force report released yesterday has
effectively capsized previous high expectations in the market that
the Reserve Bank of Australia would move to ease monetary policy
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Stronger than expected housing finance data posted today by the
 Australian Bureau of Statistics offered no cheer to the market.
Seasonally adjusted housing finance rose by 7.8 percent in August,
compared to average market expectations of a 4.7-percent advance.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 73.63 U.S. cents, down from 73.87
previously.
</P>
<P>
"It has consolidated fairly well around these sorts of levels,"
said a St. George Bank trader. "If anything we are looking for a
move up."
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, the currency jumped by nearly 1.5 U.S. cents on the
back of stronger than expected jobs data.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar has recovered on the back of the more
favorable growth outlook and the change in interest rate
sentiment," Citibank economists said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
"These trends, plus the prospect of further gains in commodity
prices, could drive the Australian dollar higher over the medium
term."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 88.71 Japanese yen, up from 88.49
yesterday, and at 1.2841 Deutsche marks, from 1.2921.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Denies U.S. Media Report on Kim's Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior South Korean government
official today denied a Los Angeles Times report that President
Kim Young-sam may have donated 50,000 U.S. dollars to
then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The report, which alleged the purpose of the donation as to
secure U.S. endorsement for Kim's candidacy in the South Korean
presidential race, is "totally groundless," said a top
presidential aide, under the customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"We have instructed the South Korean embassy in the United
States to look into the circumstances of that report," the aide
said, adding that the government plans to rebuke the Los Angeles
Times after receiving the embassy's report.
</P>
<P>
The government will file a formal protest against the newspaper
and demand correction of the inaccurate report, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. paper reported on Thursday that two Democratic
fund-raisers are prepared to testify that President Clinton's 1992
campaign had given an endorsement to a candidate for a political
office in Asia in exchange for a 50,000 dollar contribution.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted "investigators" as saying that the "candidate
for political office in Asia" may have been South Korean President
Kim Young-sam.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Stabilize This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Wool prices
stabilized after sharp drops last week, the Australian Council of
Wool Exporters said in its weekly market review today.
</P>
<P>
The eastern indicator rose six cents to close at 705 Australian
cents (518 U.S. cents) a clean kilogram while the western
indicator, catching up with last week's movements, dropped 18
Australian cents to finish at 642 Australian cents (472 U.S.
cents).
</P>
<P>
A total of 92,252 bales were offered at Sydney, Adelaide and
Fremantle with a pass-in rate of 12.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
"While the three centers selling this week were quite different
in terms of their composition of offerings and market environment,
the overall outcome for the week was as good, if not better, than
most exporters would have forecast at the start of the week," the
council said.
</P>
<P>
Competition remained widespread across most sectors of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
"It does appear, however, that the market is mainly supply
driven at present as quantities on offer are not exceptionally
large for what is traditionally the peak offering period for the
season," the council said.
</P>
<P>
In its wool weekly report, Wesfarmers Dalgety said the
stabilization provided an encouraging outlook for the next sales.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed to a smaller offering next week which
included stylish and fine clips in strong demand.
</P>
<P>
"The only possible dampening factor is the strength of the
Australian dollar which jumped a cent to 73.75 U.S. cents
yesterday," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, however, the outlook for next week's market is for
prices to remain firm if not increase," it added.
</P>
<P>
About 91,300 bales are rostered for sale next week at Goulburn,
Melbourne and Fremantle.

The committee has recommended that the maximum denomination of
the currency be progressively reviewed to reflect the trend of
inflation, the source said.
</P>

There has been a pressure on the government to issue bigger
notes, in view of the massive depreciation of Naira in the past
years and the higher costs it poses to business activities.
</P>

The maximum note now is 50 naira.

<HEADLINE> NAA Ponders on Wider Area of NATO Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 10 (Xinhua) -- NATO legislators have to
remind themselves of the probability of stretching the military
alliance's responsibility to outside the transatlantic area.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether NATO should define a wider area of
responsibility was asked when the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA)
session started today.
</P>
<P>
Jan Petersen, a Norwegian delegate to the annual meeting, told
participants that NATO in the next century should clarify what
risks outside the NATO treaty area might engage the 16-nation
alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot foresee future contingencies and whether the
alliance as a whole or only some members may choose to act," said
Petersen, hinting at such crisis-laden spots in non-NATO countries
as the Mideast and Africa.
</P>
<P>
NATO strategists are worried that as NATO shifts its strategic
focus from mainly defending its members from potential attacks to
crisis management, the alliance will have to look into problem
areas immediately outside NATO and far-flung places that are rich
in natural resources key to NATO members.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that NATO provides the natural core around
which a future European security order has to be built.
</P>
<P>
Petersen said at today's meeting that the North Atlantic
alliance has always been more than a mere insurance policy against
a threat from the east.
</P>
<P>
It is forging a transatlantic community of democracies and by
projecting the community eastward to include more central and
eastern countries helps shape a stable and democratic security
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian asked why NATO cannot perform collective security
tasks while maintaining a robust collective defense capability
thanks to its unique integrated military structure.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that NATO does not need a threat to justify its
existence or its enlargement, he urged the annual session to
consider spelling out NATO's mandate, its rationale and new
missions in a new strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
The previous such concept was drawn out in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Delegates shared the view that the Madrid summit, at which
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were invited to join the
alliance, was a significant yet incomplete step toward a "new
NATO." Further expansion is needed to make the security
integration complete for all Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Russia must also be part of this integration," said the
Norwegian.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the 16 NATO member states and 15 Central and
Eastern European countries are attending the Bucharest meeting,
which also drew observers from as far as Australia, Japan
alongside Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, Georgia, Finland,
Sweden, Canada and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Participating as associate countries in the four-day session
are Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Macedonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> One Fifth German Overweight, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- About one fifth of German adults
and 15 to 20 percent of German children are too fat mainly due to
irregular meals, too much fastfood as well as excessive time
watching TV, a German health expert said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Johannes Georg Wechsler, president of the German
Adipositas Association, overweight is a chronic disease that must
be treated seriously.
</P>
<P>
However, he also warned against quick diets and self medication
through intake of medicines like laxative or dehydration compound.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he recommended proper food and regular exercises.
"Intensive walking for one hour everyday is more successful than
jogging," he added.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) urged the Comoran separatists to abstain from
organizing a referendum for self determination on the island of
Anjouan before the international conference on the recent
situation of Comoros is convened.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued here today, the
central organ passed the decision at its 38th ordinary session
held here Thursday in order to consider the report of the OAU
secretary general on the situation in Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The press release said, the central organ warned the
separatists that it would not recognize the outcome of any such
referendum and appealed to all the Comoran parties to refrain
from any acts likely to further complicate the situation and
undermine the process of dialogue as well as national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
It requested the secretary general to move immediately so that
the conference could be convened as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
OAU also listened to a statement on the Congolese crisis by
Ambassador Victor Nimi, permanent representative of the Republic
of Congo. It welcomed the signing by President Pascal Lissouba
and Bernard Kolelas, of the ceasefire agreement proposed by the
international mediation.
</P>
<P>
It also urged all the Congolese parties concerned to
immediately end fighting.
</P>
<P>
The central organ called upon the secretary general to
intensify consultations with the United Nations and the African
countries for the speedy deployment of the proposed peace-keeping
force in the Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan FM Hails U.S. Ban Against LTTE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman kadirgamar said today that the U.S. decision to ban the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from entering and raising
fund in the United States was "one of the weapons to use in
combating international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"From now on, anybody who contributes to the LTTE in the U.S.
will be charged with criminal offenses," the minister told a news
conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The only way in combating international terrorism today is to
have a concerted international action, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that one of the wider consequences of the U.S. action
was "other governments would be requested by the Government of
U.S. to take due heed to this declaration and to take supportive
measures in their own countries."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madelene Albright on Wednesday
announced the LTTE, along with the other 29 organizations in the
world, was on the terrorist organization list that would be barred
from entering and raising fund in the United States.
</P>
<P>
She said members of the listed groups would be ineligible for
visas to enter the U.S. and that their funds would be frozen under
a new anti-terrorism law signed by American President Bill Clinton
in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar just concluded his visit to the United States on
Wednesday night. During his visit to the United States, the
foreign minister stressed Sri Lanka's request to the U.S. to
declare the LTTE as a terrorist organization while meeting with
Albright.
</P>
<P>
"The Tamil people in the north and east have suffered from the
war for 14 years. I believe there is a great hunger among the
Tamil people for peace," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Tamil compatriots in other countries to use
whatever financial resources they have to rebuild and reconstruct
the northern and eastern parts of the country that are affected by
war and not to use that money for bombs and bullets.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 14-year ethnic war in the north
and east of Sri Lanka for an independent state of their own. So
far the war has claimed 55,000 people of their lives.

<P>
HANOI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- One in every 50 Vietnamese are
currently subscribing to the telephone service, said the Vietnam
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (VNPT) today.
</P>
<P>
The recent 1.5 million telephone subscribers nationwide,
according to a report released by the state-owned VNPT, represent
a 100 percent increase over the country's total in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
The VNPT has digitalized over 90 percent of the country's
telecom network, including 2,900 communication channels available
via an undersea cable and 1,334 others through a satellite network.
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Digital Network (IDN) is expected to be replaced
next year by the Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN).
</P>
<P>
However, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) said
the current high growth rate has to continue into the year 2000 to
wire phone lines into the homes of 5-6 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the VNPT said Vietnam's post and telecommunications
industry needs an annual investment equivalent to 300-500 million
U.S. dollars through the end of this century to achieve the goal.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Fluoridize Drinking Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will publish
draft regulations on the fluoridation of drinking water next
month, local daily The Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
The regulations had been approved by the ministries of
environmental affairs, agriculture, and water affairs, Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma was quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zuma told the Sixth World Congress on Preventive
Dentistry being held in Cape Town that the introduction of
community water fluoridation was part of a drive to make
preventive dentistry a reality.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing fluoridation will go a long way towards improving
oral and dental health and is a great step forward for South
Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the cost of adjusting the existing fluoride
concentration in the country's water supply was about one Rand
(one U.S. Dollar equals to 4.70 Rand) per person a year.
</P>
<P>
This made fluoridation an attractive public health measure
because it was 18 times cheaper than using fluoridized
toothpaste, and 61 times cheaper than filling a tooth, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to a medical survey, more than 90 of every 100 South
Africans experienced some tooth decay by the time they reached
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
However, local dental experts believed that a small
concentration of fluoride in water could reduce tooth decay by
about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Millions of South Africans could benefit from this primary
preventive measure, particularly those communities who had
neither the access nor the resources to benefit from the
commercially available fluoride alternatives, they said.
</P>
<P>
Usuf Chikte, Chairman of the congress's scientific committee,
said South Africa was one of the first country in sub-Saharan
Africa to introduce fluoridation.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 major international health organizations,
including the World Health Organization and the International
Dental Federation, supported water fluoridation, and more than
300 million people worldwide benefit from community water
fluoridation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Optimistic About IMF Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
today that it is optimistic about getting financial assistance
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in overcoming the
rupiah's steady weakening.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here this afternoon, Finance
Minister Mar'ie Muhammad expressed the hope that Indonesia and IMF
could reach a consensus on long-term loans because the country's
economic fundamental is still strong.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie, who met with a team of IMF officials this morning, said
he briefed the officials on Indonesia's current economic situation
and the two sides discussed several issues related to IMF aid
Indonesia is seeking for.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Minister for Industry and Trade
Tungky Ariwibowo and Bank Indonesia (central bank) Governor
Soedradjad Djiwndono believed that it is possible for Indonesia, a
big country in Southeast Asia, to get IMF aid as the country has
closer cooperation ties with international financial institutions,
including IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie noted that the Indonesian rupiah has depreciated by
around 46 percent since January 1997. The rupiah has been
particularly hard hit in the regional monetary crisis which also
hit the Thai bath, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and
Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, he pledged that the rupiah will continue to float
although the government will take all necessary market-friendly
measures to avoid an excessive depreciation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize the rupiah, the Indonesian government has taken
several steps since mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The measures include revising the budget to keep it in balance,
boosting export and containing import in a GATT-consistent manner
and deferring some government- and state-owned enterprise
projects, as well as private-sector projects amounting to
approximately 35 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government also initiated structural measures, including
deregulation measures to enhance its efficiency and
competitiveness, to strengthen the financial sector and maintain
prudent monetary policies through appropriate liquidity and
interest rate policies.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Launch Police Database System This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will officially launch a system in
Singapore by the end of this year for cooperation among its member
police forces to fight international crimes, the Singapore police
chief said today.
</P>
<P>
The system, known as "Aseanapol Database System," is being
developed by a team comprising representatives of ASEAN member
police forces and staff of an international consultancy firm, Khoo
Boon Hui, who is on a visit here, told reporters after talks with
Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor.
</P>
<P>
He said the system would contain information on cross-border
criminal activities, which would enable the ASEAN police forces to
exchange criminal records and information on a regional basis,
thus marking an important step forward in fighting international
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The database will be vital in combating crimes such as drug
trafficking, forgery of travel documents and currency
counterfeiting, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has taken some time to get all the member nations to come
together to finance and develop the system and we will wait for
the other countries to get on board before we officially launch
the system," Khoo said. "I believe we should be able to get
everything together by the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN at present groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Khoo also said cooperation between Singapore and Malaysian
police has always been excellent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian police chief said relations between
the two police forces of the two neighbors have always been good
and a model for other countries.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahim told reporters that during their hour-long talks,
they covered expanding cooperation in crime prevention, police
training and education in both countries.

computer software professionals and its computer training
institute will start functioning in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Called the Institute of Computer Software Professionals of

There is currently a large floating population of
computer-literate workers, who require additional education and
training to become useful for employment in the software industry.
The institute would focus on tapping the potential of such people
and it is expected to produce 15,000 professionals annually by the

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Invited to Attend Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL)
Secretary-General Esmat Abdul-Meguid has received an official
invitation to attend the Middle East and North African Economic
Conference (MENA) to be held in Qatari capital Doha in November.
</P>
<P>
The invitation from Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin
Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani came during Abdul-Meguid's meeting here
Thursday night with Qatari Ambassador to Egypt and its chief
delegate to the Arab League Mane Al-Hajeri and Abdel Rahman
Attiya, an official at the Qatari Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Attiya said he discussed with the Arab
League chief the latest developments in the Middle East in
particular and the Arab region in general.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Attiya insisted that Qatar is not
deviating from the Arab stance vis-a-vis the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Despite the threat to boycott the conference by some Arab
countries, Qatar insists on hosting it on November 16. Saudi
Arabia and Syria flatly rejected the conference due to Israel's
participation, while Egypt had been saying that its participation
hinges on progress on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have
peace treaties with Israel, with which Qatar has limited trade
ties.
</P>
<P>
As a direct spinoff of the Mideast peace process, the annual
MENA conference had been held in Casablanca, Morocco; in Amman,
Jordan and in Cairo, Egypt since 1994. But peace prospects have been
largely deteriorated since then.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process came to a halt since
March when Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But a surprise summit early Wednesday between Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat might signal a new start in efforts to
save the peace process. It was their first meeting in eight
months.

<HEADLINE> Urbanization Means Change for East China's Rural Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Lin Youzeng and millions of
other rural residents have been swept up and are no longer farmers
in the tide of urbanization in some coastal areas of China.
</P>
<P>
"I have come to realize that to be an urban resident means more
than just the change of the job," said Lin, 55, a shop owner who
lives in Luqiao, a suburban area of Taizhou in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 Luqiao became an urban district of Taizhou. Lin and his
fellow rural villagers left their accustomed farmland and turn to
jobs in businesses or factories and workshops.
</P>
<P>
The change has required an increased awareness of such issues
as public safety, the environment and traffic, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In Zhejiang rapid urbanization has increased the number of
towns in the province from more than 100 in the 1970s to 965.
</P>
<P>
The increased urbanization has resulted in behavioral problems
of adjusting to city life such as spitting, littering, vulgar
language and traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
"We are not only to build streets, mansions and large stores,"
said Wang Tingge, a Luqiao city official, "but also to set up an
orderly city management system and foster citizens with good
social morality."
</P>
<P>
The Luqiao government has begun the process of education,
issuing booklets to 35,000 families on social moral conduct and
encouraging citizens from 16 to 55 to study in the Civilized
Citizens' School. School subjects range from humanities to the
geography and history of Luqiao, legal trading to ethics and
etiquette, and sanitation to traffic regulations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Communist Party members in the locality learn more
about political theories, party constitution, standard Chinese
pronunciation, English and computers.
</P>
<P>
Competition also thrives in Zhejiang in areas other than the
marketplace, Lin said. "We compete for which family can be elected
as the Family outstanding in socialist ethical and cultural
progress and which family has more members of higher education,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army imposed today a
general closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the coming
Jewish holiday Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), which will begin
tonight and last two days.
</P>
<P>
The closure will remain in effect until midnight Saturday,
and during the period Palestinians will be barred from entering
Israel. But the army said that for emergency humanitarian
reasons some Palestinians will be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces called on all the Palestinians working
in Israel to leave the country and return home by 2 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Israel has periodically sealed off the West Bank and Gaza for
security reasons since parts of the territories fell under
Palestinian self-rule in 1994 under its peace deals with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there have been clashes between Israeli soldiers
and Palestinians in recent days since Israel began demolishing
some Palestinian buildings in the Israel-occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinian merchants were arrested Tuesday when 20
merchants attempted to prevent their stalls from being
dismantled near Halhoul, southeast to Jerusalem. Witnesses
said that Israeli soldiers arrived in the area with a
bulldozer and demolished these stalls.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Private Traders Selling Farm Produce In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- some one million private
traders in central-south China's Hunan Province are now selling
fresh farm products not only locally but all across the country.
</P>
<P>
These traders already account for 95 percent of the aquatic
products sold, 80 percent of the vegetables, and 70 percent of the
fruit and pigs.
</P>
<P>
One rice market in Yiyang city near Dongting Lake has opened
270 rice processing factories that handle more than 100,000 tons
of rice annually that is bought from local farmers and sold all
over China.
</P>

And, while baskets, shoulder poles, and handcarts were the main
means of transport in the past, traders now rely on motor
vehicles, trains and even aircraft, allowing them to ship fresh
fish and vegetables.

<HEADLINE> FAO Highlights Participatory Approach to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The best approach to eradicate
poverty and hunger is to help the poor help themselves, Jacques
Diouf, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations has said.
</P>
<P>
"Our organization is helping those poor countries to produce
food instead of asking for food. It's better to teach people the
technique of fishing than give them fish," the FAO chief told
reporters upon his arrival at the Cairo airport Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking about FAO's Special Program For Food Security
which is designed to help low-income food-deficit countries,
faced with food shortfalls, limited funds to finance imports and
declining food aid, to increase food production and productivity
quickly and sustainably.
</P>
<P>
Diouf, coming here a week before the World Food Day, said
he will review with Egyptian leaders the developments on
agriculture and food production after the 1996 World Food Summit
when 186 countries pledged to halve the number of undernourished
people in the world by 2015.
</P>
<P>
Painting a bleak picture for food situation in Africa,
however, Diouf said 40 of the world's 86 lowest-food income
countries are in this continent which is habitated by merely 11
percent of the world people.
</P>
<P>
Diouf described Africa as the place with the most serious
problems of food because it is the only continent where
agricultural production per capita has gone down in the last 20
years and which has one of the highest rate of population versus
crops.
</P>
<P>
"Even the improvement in crop production (in Africa) this year
can be largely contributed to the good rain and good climate," he
lamented.
</P>
<P>
He urged African countries, where only 8 percent of arable land
has water control, to build their own system of water control to
secure stability in food provision and less dependency on climate.
</P>
<P>
The FAO has directed many activities in many parts of the
world with a view to helping them achieve productivity necessary
to overcome increase in population, according to the
U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FAO is advising governments on how to improve
their agricultural policies to create an environment more
favorable to investment in favor of farmers and address
constraint on infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, farmers choose and demonstrate selected
improved technologies to fellow farmers during a pilot phase. The
focus is on improved water control, intensification of crop
production through, for example, introduction of improved
varieties, diversification of production systems and analysis of
constraints faced by farmers.
</P>
<P>
Successful strategies are then made available during an
expansion phase.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO chief, by mid-1997 the food security
program was already operational in 19 countries including 10 in
Africa and being formulated in other 32 countries.
</P>
<P>
He cited a Special Program project under way in China's
Sichuan province as an excellent example of cooperation and one
of the best FAO programs implemented.
</P>
<P>
Yields of wheat, rice and maize in demonstration sites in
1995/96 were estimated to be higher by 19 to 27 percent than in
the preceding year in Sichuan province, before the introduction
of the Special Program, according to a FAO report.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO, 27 million people worldwide face food
emergencies because of man-made or natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The world's agricultural production has risen by 35 percent
since 1980, and by 68 percent in the developing world, but
because of population increases, the per capita figures are not so
positive, up by only 5 percent overall and 25 percent in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Projections suggest that by the year 2015, the world's
population will be around 8.3 billion. To feed this number of
people, world food production will have to be more than double
the present level.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Apologizes to Canada Over Forged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- In a move to amend the
damaged relations with Canada, Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has apologized to Canada for the use of forged Canadian
passports by two Israeli agents in an attack on a Hamas leader.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that Levy sent a message to his
Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy to offer the apology and
expressed the hope that this could ease the tension between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian external affairs official is due to arrive in
Israel next week to discuss the current crisis. Levy called for
the return of Canadian Ambassador to Israel David Burger, who was
recalled by Ottawa last week to protest the use of forged
Canadian passports by the two agents in the failed assassination
attempt on Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan last month.
</P>
<P>
The two Israeli agents attacking on Mashaal were arrested at
the scene by Jordanian police and later released under a
Jordanian-brokered bargain with Israel to exchange for the
release of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Canada was furious over the use of its passports in operations
against Islamic militants, saying this could lead to revenge
attacks against its citizens in the region.
</P>
<P>
Canada complained that it was not the first time that Israeli
agents used forged Canadian passports in operations. By
recalling its ambassador, the Canadian government demanded Israel
clarify the whole matter and promise to prevent such incidents
from occurring again.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Canada usually enjoy close relations, and there
has been good cooperation between security services of both
countries before the Mashaal affair. It was believed that it
would take time for both sides to amend the damaged relations.

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Differ on Economic Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean government predicted
an optimistic economy but private economic research institutes are
raising strong doubts about the government's "too rosy" economic
outlook.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), representing the
interest of large businesses, even cautioned that the government's
forecasts would send a false signal on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Three agencies - the state-run think-tank Korea Development
Institute (KDI), the Bank of Korea (BOK) and the Korea Institute
of Finance (KIF) - recently released their respective economic
predictions, all painting a bright picture of the national economy
for this year and the next.
</P>
<P>
KDI forecast that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP)
would grow 6.4 percent this year and 6.7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that the nation's current-account deficit
would narrow to 7.9 billion U.S. dollars next year from this
year's expected shortfall of 13.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The think tank said that the sluggish national economy, which
started in the final quarter of 1995, already bottomed out in the
third quarter of this year and is in a recovery phase.
</P>
<P>
The KIF said that the nation's GDP would grow 6.3 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
The three agencies based their rosy predictions on an
expectation of strong exports, helped by the continued strength of
the U.S. dollar, a continuation of brisk exports and a rapid
recovery of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Most private economic research institutes, however, said the
nation's economic conditions will be less bright than those predicted
by government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Given the minus growth this September in letters of credit (LC)
arrivals for the nation's three major export items - automobiles,
semiconductors and steel products - they hold a gloomy outlook on the
nation's overseas shipments next year.
</P>
<P>
They also question the government's forecast of strong exports next
year, citing that predictions of a weak dollar next year would hamper
South Korean exports.
</P>
<P>
They cite an expected rise in capital equipment imports next year
by companies after two years of sluggish capital investments.
</P>
<P>
The FKI said that it feels the nation's GDP grew a mere 2
percent in the first half of this year, compared with the 5.9
percent growth the government announced.
</P>
<P>
"The 3.9 percentage-point gap between real GDP and the trade
terms-adjusted GDP is the biggest since 1990, when we started to
compile data on the difference," said Park Chan-ho, director of the
Economic Research Department of the FKI.
</P>
<P>
Park said that the wide gap was the result of aggravated
corporate profitability resulting from a drop in unit export
prices.
</P>
<P>
The FKI warned that the government's positive economic outlook,
based on export volumes, may be somewhat misleading.
</P>
<P>
"The national economy is actually suffering from a high jobless
rate, high insolvency rate and low corporate profitability," Park
said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Urges to Eradicate Poverty Among Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Deputy resident representative
of United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Petra Lantz called
upon governments to embark on serious gender equality programs to
eradicate poverty among women.
</P>
<P>
She said Thursday that most of the people affected by poverty
were women, youth and other disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
"Women and youth lack access to fundamentals of decent life
such as food, safe water, reliable health care, shelter and basic
education and governments should be seen to address these
problems," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said to reduce poverty governments should emphasize
economic growth and adopt policies aimed at improving the lives
of women.
</P>
<P>
There should be good governance and political empowerment of
women, she said, adding that women should have access to economic
and social assets such as land, training and access to credit.
</P>
<P>
"Over 1.3 billion people in the world still live on less than
one U.S. Dollar per day and the majority of them are women," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out human security and sustainable development
would only be realized if poverty was completely eradicated among
disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
Poverty was no longer confined to the rural areas only but was
also growing very fast in urban areas, she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will mark the international day for the eradication
of poverty on October 17 in Harare.

<HEADLINE> Fertility Rate in Bangladesh Falls in Past 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The fertility rate in Bangladesh
declined by more than 50 percent over the last two decades with
the introduction of a home-visit system by Family Welfare
Assistants (FWA), FWA sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The rate in the country dropped to 3.3 children per woman of
childbearing age at present from 6.3 in 1975, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the home visit system by FWA contributed to
increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate to 49.2 percent from
7.7 percent in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The new approach has also helped change attitudes of women and
ensured wide participation in family planning approaches, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, there are more than 23,500 FWAs
working throughout the country and more than 10,000 additional
family planning field workers supported by non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The home-visit program is now being implemented in 18
sub-districts in nine districts in the country involving more than

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tamarisk Being Used To Prevent Sand Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- In Jiashi county in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 450 farm families have
moved to 10,000 ha of sandy land that is being held in place by
tamarisk trees.
</P>
<P>
The region has vast stretches of sandy land in the world's
second largest desert area, the Taklimakan Desert in the Tarim
Basin.
</P>
<P>
The county has organized tens of thousands of laborers to plant
tamarisk seeds every year, and has been able to add 8,000 ha of
farmland by stopping the sand from drifting in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The region's Academy of Sciences began to study how to fight
desertification by using tamarisk in the early 1980s and found
that tamarisk can serve as a shelter against wind and sand and
also helps lower the groundwater level to improve saline-alkali
soil.
</P>
<P>
Counties like Jiashi that are on the edge of the desert have
planted some 100,000 ha in tamarisks in the past few years, and
have had good results. They plan to introduce the method to other
areas because of its low cost and effectiveness in dealing with
desertification.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Western-influenced styles of
oil painting that were introduced into China a hundred years ago
will make their debut in a Shanghai auction.
</P>
<P>
The planners of Shanghai's Duoyunxuan autumn auction say they
plan to hold an oil painting auction in November.
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s and 30s, a group of Chinese oil painters like Xu
Beihong, Lin Fengmian, Wu Zuoren, Yan Wenliang and Zhou Bichu,
gained fame in Shanghai, the birthplace of the Chinese form of a
traditionally Western technique.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by both realism and impressionism, those painters
created unique cultural works for China.
</P>
<P>
The auction will include works of Xu Beihong, Zhou Bichu, Ding
Shaoguang, the Chinese-American Chen Yifei, and some by Pablo Picasso.
</P>
<P>
A touring exhibition is also scheduled for Beijing, Hong Kong
and Singapore in late October.

<HEADLINE> Somali Detains Kenyan Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A row has erupted between the
Kenyan authorities and a Somali strongman over three vehicles
hijacked by armed bandits in the past two weeks from eastern
Kenya's Garissa and Wajir districts bordering on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Seyyid Hussein Abdalla, a resident at Somalia's Dobley border
town, several kilometers from the Kenyan border town of Liboi,
Garissa, has asked for a ransom of 250,000 Shillings before he
can release a Mercedes Benz truck to its Kenyan owner.
</P>
<P>
The truck, belonging to a Mombasa businessman, was hijacked by
militiamen at the Garissa-Dadaab road one week ago after
delivering food to the Dadaab refugee camp, according to local
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two other vehicles together with an unspecified
number of cattle were also taken from border areas by armed
bandits.
</P>
<P>
These bandits were believed to be allies of Abdalla, who has
in the past been instrumental in the recovery of cattle and
vehicles taken from the Kenyan frontier districts, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
However, Abdalla turned back a delegation of Kenyan officials
on releasing the vehicles and the cattle earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Garissa District Commissioner Ali
Mbwarali on the border, Abdalla said he would only release the
truck after the ransom money was paid to him.
</P>
<P>
"He denied knowledge of the two other vehicles and the
cattle,"a source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Garissa police boss Alphonse Kalume said Abdalla should
know where the other vehicles and cattle were and Kenya would not
meet the Somali's ransom demand.
</P>
<P>
"We can't buy our truck twice," he said.

WUHAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The city of Yichang near the
Three Gorges on the Yangtze River has increased tourism by making
use of the Three Gorges Dam project, according to Vice-mayor Zhang
Jianyi.
</P>
<P>
The city is rich in scenic places, with its gorges and dams,
some remnants of the Three Kingdoms Period (220-265) in the east,
in the west, the Three Gorges, and in the north, the well-known
exploration spot of Shennongjia.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 people are involved in the tourism business,
which has fixed assets of one billion yuan (about 125 million US
dollars), said Zhang. The city has spent some 800 million yuan on
scenic resources and infrastructure for tourism.
</P>
<P>
The city has improved controls on the tourism business in the
past several years, and has penalized a number of tourist agencies
that have overcharged customers.
</P>
<P>
With improvements in the business, the number of visitors has
grown. Tourist arrivals have totalled 30 million in the past few

<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Preparations have been
completed for the 15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC) scheduled
for October 12-16 in Beijing, which is expected to draw 4,300
representatives from 88 countries.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao, chairman of the Chinese Organizing Committee of the
15th WPC, told a news conference today that attendance should be
the largest in the congress' history.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from 68 international and state petroleum companies
are expected to attend, as well as ministers of petroleum or
energy from 20 countries, senior officers of the WPC and
representatives from the World Energy Council and International
Gas Union.
</P>
<P>
Extensive discussions will focus on the theme of "Technology
and Globalization -- Leading the Petroleum Industry into the 21st
Century."
</P>
<P>
Wang said the five-day congress will consist of six plenary
addresses, 21 panel forums, 10 review and forecast reports and a
ministerial forum. In addition, 93 papers will be presented to the
congress and 238 papers will be offered for academic exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said that all reports and papers will focus on issues of oil
exploration, development and drilling, processing technology,
natural gas, oil and gas reserves, environmental protection and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts will conduct exchanges on the latest scientific and
technological results concerning oil production as well as the

in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the congress, the WPC organizing committee will hold an
international exhibition on oil, gas and
petrochemicals. Six-hundred companies and enterprises will display
their latest scientific and technological findings, equipment and
products.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the upcoming congress, China set up its WPC
organizing committee in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The WPC was established in London in 1933, with its first
congress held the same year. It now has 47 members, including the
world's major oil producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The WPC is held every three years. China, a member since 1979,

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Ready for Historical National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Three months after celebrating
Hong Kong's return to China and two weeks after the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, Shanghai is again in the
festive spirits to welcome the Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
From China's first street Nanjing Road to the narrow and dark
lanes, from the always-crowded Bund to the newly-built subway
platforms, colorful streamers and flashy lanterns decorated
everywhere in the financial hub of China, which is striving to
become an international finance and trade center.
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial games will raise its curtain here on Sunday,
with 13,000 athletes representing 45 delegations from China's
provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), the People's Liberation Army and
various professions.
</P>
<P>
"Being China's last national sports extravaganza of the
century, the Eighth National Games will demonstrate to the world
the country's social stability, the Chinese people's unity and
full confidence in the next century in the leadership of CPC with
Jiang Zemin as the core," Shanghai vice mayor Gong Xueping said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has spent 5.6 billion Yuans (about 700 million U.S.
dollars) in building stadiums and other sports facilities and
face-lifting the old ones.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built Shanghai "Barrel" Complex with a capacity of
80,000, which was festooned with colorful flags and banners, will
serve as the venue for the grand ceremony, bearing the theme of
Long Live The Motherland.
</P>
<P>
The complex, with an investment of 1.3 billion Yuans (about 170
million U.S. dollars), looks like a flying eagle from a birdview
and has become the symbol of the metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say it is the best in the world, but surely is one of
the toppest ones in the world," said Wu Shaozu, Minister of the
Chinese State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (SPCSC).
</P>
<P>
More historical colors will highlight the Games wherein HKSAR
will compete for the first time in the comprehensive sports meet
under the name of "Hong Kong, China" after China re-exercises its
sovereignty over the land on July 1.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa earlier encouraged the
Hong Kong athletes to win honors for HKSAR itself and their
motherland as well.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the National Games offered preferential rights to
Hong Kong athletes which allow them to skip the qualifying
tournaments for most of the individual sports.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 athletes will represent the HKSAR to compete in 22
sports in the two-week National Games.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, all non-Olympic sports but
China's traditional martial art (Wushu) are cancelled from the
National Games in order to attain more attention upon the Olympic
events.
</P>
<P>
Such an Olympic-oriented reform, as SPCSC Vice Minister Yuan
Weimin said, was believed to encourage Chinese athletes to achieve
better performance at the future Olympic Games.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo said today that he is in favor of the
regionalization of election for senators through charter changes.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo, an aspirant in next year's presidential election,
said a regional election for the senate would assure the people in
the southern Philippines of representation in laying down national
policies and laws.
</P>
<P>
"We have to face the fact that Mindanao needs people who will
speak on their behalf in the senate, carry on their ideals and
dreams of a progressive Mindanao. So far, they are being
represented by people who do not actually belong to them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao, warned earlier that they will boycott the 1998 national
elections if the constitution is not amended.
</P>
<P>
Misuari is also chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) which signed a peace agreement last year to end a
24-year-old war with government troops.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF chief warned that his forces are even willing to "go
back to the hills" and wage war anew against the government if no
amendment to the constitution is made to allow a regional election
for senators.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said any possible recurrence of disorder in Mindanao
would adversely affect the region's development and the country's
economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"We have already built up the confidence of the international
community about the ongoing peace development in Mindanao. At this
time, we cannot afford to disturb this process of transforming the
south into a rapidly growing economic zone in East Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the two sides laid down their arms, foreign investments
have kept coming to Mindanao, de Ocampo said, adding that the
government has just signed up 39 million U.S. dollars in loan
investments for the area.

SHANGHAI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China has not seriously
considering the possibility to launch a second bid for the Olympic
Games, a top Chinese sports official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, Minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports
Commission, said it demands careful and comprehensive
consideration for China to make another bid for the Olympics.

It has been widely reported in Western media that either
Shanghai or Beijing might step in to bid for the 2008 Olympic
Games after Athens won the rights in September to host the 2004
Games.
</P>

Beijing narrowly lost its bidding war for the 2000 Games to
Sydney by two votes in 1993. "It was due to the non-sports
factors," Wu said of the reason why Beijing failed to bring home

<P>
HARARE, October 10 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwean parliament yesterday
ratified five loan agreements between the government of Zimbabwe
and five international institutions worth 625.65 million Zimbabwe
Dollars (50 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa presented the loan
agreements and their terms amid very little resistance from the
legislators who earlier this year fought hard against loans to
finance the construction of the new Harare international airport
terminal.
</P>
<P>
The minister said none of the funds secured under the loan
agreements had been utilized as the government awaited the
approval of the house.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to assure you that the government continues to
be cautious of its debt service capitalization and hence we have
tried to source for very soft loans," said Murerwa, adding that
the money were part of the 1997/98 budget.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Have Floating Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will soon
have two prison ships anchored off the coast to house
awaiting-trial prisoners, local daily, the Citizen, reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela was quoted as
saying that he expected his department would sign an agreement
next week with a private company, which would buy hulls from
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"These hulls are originally built for floating hotels, but
that fell through. Now they are keen to sell, so the people who
buy them will get a very good price," Mzimela said.
</P>
<P>
The two ships would be used exclusively for awaiting-trial
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
There are about 35,000 awaiting-trial prisoners in South
Africa, judicial department officials said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is in the period of transformation period,
has been troubled with increasing violence activities and crimes
for years.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities said that by the end of last year, there
were more than 124,000 inmates in South Africa's jails, which
were designed for about 97,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition to floating prisons, the Department of
Correctional Services is also thinking of turning disused mine
shafts into maximum security prisons to prevent prisoners
escaping from prison. At least 1,015 prisoners escaped from
prisons in 1996.

<HEADLINE> German World Cup Team Troubled by Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A number of German key players
were tamed by injuries before the team prepares for Saturday's
World Cup Group Nine qualifier against Albania.
</P>
<P>
Germany's already extensive injury list grew by two names on
Thursday when Mathias Sammer and Ulf Kirsten, the keystones of
coach Berti Vogts' offensive and defensive blocks, pulled out of
the match.
</P>
<P>
They became players the sixth and seventh players to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Schalke veteran Olaf Thon will be called up again to fill
Sammer's shoes.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten, who scored a hat-trick against Albania last time,
couldn't recover from a pulled hamstring and will watch from the
stands as he and injured captain Jurgen Klinsmann are replaced by
the unusual attack pairing of Oliver Bierhoff and Fredi Bobic.
</P>
<P>
"Our injury misery certainly is remarkable," said Vogts.
</P>
<P>
"Things have not been worse since I took on this job in
1990. Others complain when one or two players are hurt. But what
about the problems I have been struggling with since 1996?"
</P>
<P>
With all six nations in Group Nine playing their final games
Saturday, Germany are on top, two points ahead of Ukraine and
three in front of Portugal but with a vastly superior goal
difference over both.
</P>
<P>
Albania are bottom with only four points from nine games. A
draw would be enough for Germany to book a passage to the finals
next year in France.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Divers Show Apathy for Springboards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Shedding the aura as a "Diving
Kingdom", China is unbelievably facing a break-down of echelons as
its women divers were developing a trend of apathy for the
springboard events.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that China would sacrifice its dominance on the
springboards unless authorities concerned unleashed unremitting
efforts to encourage its women divers to take on the traditional
sport with great enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
"To evaluate the Eighth National Games, we are not ready for
any celebration as the Games failed to produce any promising women
springboard divers, not even a batch of new faces of potentials,"
said international judge Xuan Zengyong.
</P>
<P>
The springboards for women have been the strong fortress for
China as both Gao Min and Tan Shuping combined to make a clean
sweep of all major international titles.
</P>
<P>
Gao Min was bestowed as "diving queen" prior to her retirement
after the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992 and Tan Shuping stepped
into her footsteps to take reign of the event in the succeeding
two years.
</P>
<P>
Yet, misfortunes plagued Tan Shuping time and again since 1994
and her injuries from shoulder to knees deprived her of daily
routine trainings, which fairly explained her drop-out from the
finals in the Atlanta Centennial Olympic Games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the retirment of Queen Gao, the Chinese diving officials
then pinned hopes upon another genious diver Fu Mingxia to switch
from platform to springboard who survived the pressure to win the
title in Atlanta in her debut in the 3-meter springboard.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Fu Mingxia submitted her retirement application right
after the Centennial Olympiad due to fatigue and injuries, forcing
the Chinese officials and coaches to cry for any hopefuls of great
potentials.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, coach Wu Guocun exploited his know-how
to help training injury-plagued Tan Shuping for a promising
recovery. Yet, Tan Shuping, a native of Guangxi, still faced a
menace of deteriorating her injuries which may eventully killed
her diving career, coach Wu lamented.
</P>
<P>
Even then, Tan Shuping, who was clearly not in her top form,
still enjoyed her up-onemanship in the National Games wherein no
chief rivals have the calibre to beat her with confidence.
</P>
<P>
The miserable but true fact can be well explained by the
experts who pinpointed out that "many a women divers are flocking
to platform wherein good scores and great feats are relatively
easier to be achieved compared to springboards."
</P>
<P>
The intriguing tricks justified the abnormal phenomenon of a
striking contrast between a flood of platform divers against the
drought of springboard trainees.
</P>
<P>
Judge Xuan Zengyong said that China still boasted of a pool of
almost 10 divers of great potentials for platform in the coming
Asian Games and the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But "where are our hopefuls for the springboards in the 2000
Sydney Games," the judge asked with concerns that locked between
his eyebrows.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Continues Promoting U.N. Principles: Official </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will continue to make
its sincere and earnest endeavor for the promotion of the
principles and purposes of the U.N. Charter and to strengthen and
reinforce the U.N. role, Foreign Secretary Mustfizur Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment to the U.N. and the principles and purposes of
its charter have been affirmed and reaffirmed a number of times,
beginning with our declaration of independence," Rahman was quoted
today by the national news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha as
saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our constitution specifically stipulates that our
international relations shall be based on the principles
enunciated in the U.N. Charter," he said in a lecture on
"Bangladesh and the United Nations" here.
</P>
<P>
He said it has always been Bangladesh's contention that it is
the smaller and more vulnerable group of countries that have the
most vital stakes in an effective and dynamic United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The main purposes of the United Nations include the maintenance
of international peace and security, the development of friendly
relations among nations, the promotion of higher living standards
and conditions for economic and social progress and development,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary stressed that the United Nations has been
playing a harmonizing role in the attainment of these goals.

<HEADLINE> Perkins's Last Hope for World Swimming Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The triple world record holder
and two-time Olympic champion Kieren Perkins over 1,500 meters
freestyle may fail to defend his title for next January's world
swimming champiosnhips as he finished only fourth in heats at
selection trials in Brisbane on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Only the top two swimmers are allowed to compete in individual
events at the championships in Perth next year. Unless Perkins
regains his form in Saturday's final, he will be thrown out of the
championships.
</P>
<P>
Perkins' heats time of 15 minutes 48.77 seconds was a far cry
from his own world record of 14:41.66 set in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Grant Hackett qualified fastest on Friday in 15:19.28 ahead of
Olympic silver medallist Daniel Kowalski and Jason Samuelson.
</P>
<P>
Perkins claimed he would switch his tactics in the final.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Perkins, who has failed to qualify for both the
200 and 400 meters freestyle this week, said he would aim at next
year's Commonwealth Games in Malaysia if he fails to qualify for
the world titles in Perth.

ISLAMABAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports declined
nearly two percent in September, 1997 over the corresponding

<HEADLINE> World Body Unveils Newest Asia-Pacific Forest Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund (WWF) for
nature study reveals that the Asia-Pacific region has already lost
88 percent of its original forest cover and only 5 percent of the
remaining forest area is currently protected.
</P>
<P>
The study also shows that within the next 25 years, only 10
percent of the Asia Pacific's original forest will be left, WWF
country representative Agus Purnomo said here Thursday when
launching the Asia Pacific forest map.
</P>
<P>
Of the 8.08 billion hectares of forests in the world 8,000
years ago, only 3.044 billion hectares remain today, according to
the forest map.
</P>
<P>
Tropical forests were being destroyed at a rate of 17 million
hectares a year, with similar losses in forest density across
Canada, Europe, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Asia lost the most compared to other regions," local press
today quoted Purnomo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new mapping project, developed by WWF in association with
the World Conservation Monitoring Center, studied forest cover and
forest protection in Africa, the Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin
America, North America and Russia to show the extent of forest
loss worldwide.
</P>
<P>
With Asia leading the way with its 88 percent forest loss,
Europe is not far behind with 62 percent. Africa has lost 45
percent of its forest cover, Latin America 41 percent, North
America 39 percent and Russia 35 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.5 million people in
Hainan province have risen above the poverty level during the past
nine years, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when Hainan was separated from Guangdong Province to
become a new province, 2.02 million people were considered
poverty-stricken. A concerted effort by Hainan residents and
government officials has reduced that number to 450,000 with a
goal of eliminating poverty by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, rich in tropical resources and arable land, has
established 212 agricultural production bases in its anti-poverty
drive. The province also has developed infrastructure facilities
in transportation, water supply, energy and housing.
</P>
<P>
In addition to building 992 kilometers of new roads and 1,100
kilometers of electric lines in rural areas, the provincial
government has earmarked a total of 15 million yuan annually for a
housing renovation project for ethnic minorities.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Develop Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will try to develop
the rural areas which "are the lifeline of the country," the
independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB) today quoted Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina as saying.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of a U.N.-sponsored project, the South Asia
Poverty Alleviation Program (SAPAP), Thursday, the prime minister
said, "The only target of the present government is to improve the
living condition of the people by ensuring massive economic
development, particularly in the rural areas."
</P>
<P>
"Economic activities in the rural areas will be accelerated if
government officials and employees fulfill their duties properly,"
said the prime minister, who asked the officials to work with
their utmost sincerity and dedication.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the government is to alleviate poverty in the
shortest possible time and ensure a better life for all, the prime
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is an agriculture-based country with more than 80
percent of its 120 million people living in the rural areas, where
more than 50 percent of farmers are living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Under the SAPAP project sponsored by the U.N. Development
Program with the help of some South Asian governments, various
steps are being taken to improve infrastructure facilities in the
country, the UNB said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Acknowledges Industrial Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A discussion paper prepared
by the union Industry Ministry marks the center's first
acknowledgment of a slowdown in industrial activity, local
economic paper Business Standard said here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper will be taken up for discussion at the prime
minister's meeting with industry, scheduled for October 14. The
government's deep concern is apparent in the discussion paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper points out that there is wide perception that demand
is slackening for basic goods like steel and cement, paper and
newsprint, and commercial vehicles. A cutback in production and
underutilisation of capacities have been reported in several
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributes the industrial slowdown to
underperformance of certain key sectors like power, fertilizers,
consumer durables, crude petroleum and certain segments of the
capital goods sector.
</P>
<P>
This deceleration is also perceived to be a cumulative effect
of many macroeconomic factors including lower capital expenditure
by the government, subdued export growth and a slowdown in
investment and consumer demand in the non-governmental sector.

<HEADLINE> Trilateral Economic Summit To Be Held in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of India,
Bangladesh and Pakistan will jointly inaugurate on November 23
this year an economic development summit in Bangladesh's capital
Dhaka, visiting Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Industrialists of the sub-continent along with heads of
principal chambers of commerce would deliberate on promotion of
investments in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi foreign minister came here on Thursday evening
to deliver the official invitation to Indian Prime Minister I. K.
Gujral for the summit. He is expected to go to Pakistan later for
the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The summit would be a unique event since the leading
industrialists of the sub-continent had never shared the same
platform to discuss economic development of the region, the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The three prime ministers will be present to help the
industrialists to act in a meaningful way "as facilitators," Azad
explained.
</P>
<P>
The idea for an economic summit was proposed at the Male summit
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in
mid May this year.
</P>
<P>
SAARC embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, The Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina volunteered to host
the economic summit in Dhaka when the idea of development
initiatives at the private level was discussed by the prime
ministers of the three countries.

<HEADLINE> EC Eases Condition For Bangladeshi Garment Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
accepted Bangladesh's plea for relaxed rule of origin to obtain
the General System Preference (GSP) for knitwear exports, thus
clearing ways for increased exports to Europe, the independent
United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The acceptance came at a meeting of the Committee of the Rules
of Origin of the EC on Thursday in Brussels, the headquarters of
the EC, the UNB said.
</P>
<P>
The derogation will come into effect starting October 15 after
formal approval by all the 20 EC commissioners of the 15 European
Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great achievement for the country," Bangladeshi
Commerce Minister Tofael Ahmed was quoted as saying, "A
long-standing problem related to export of knit-garments to the
European countries has been resolved."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the relaxation of condition concerning the
origin of exports would help Bangladesh increase its knitwear
exports to the EU, Bangladesh's second-largest export market from
where the country earns over 75 percent of its export income from
knitted-garments.
</P>
<P>
The acceptance of the EC, which expressed its satisfaction over
the Bangladeshi government's bold steps in dealing with the GSP
problem, would help the country increase its export income to 10
billion dollars in five years, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
With this relaxation, Bangladesh's knitwear producers will be
able to export their products made of imported yarn, the UNB said.
</P>
<P>
The EC accepted the Bangladesh appeal after many rounds of
negotiation, persuasion and correspondence with the leaders of the
EC and the officials of the EU countries since January, the UNB
said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Youth Less Athletic, Survey Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The physical strength and
athletic abilities of Japanese school students have continued to
decline, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
An annual survey released by the Education Ministry Thursday
showed the physical strength of students between the ages of 10-19
has deteriorated in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Students scored lower on tests of running, jumping, throwing
and grip strength than students tested 10 years ago in primary
grades, middle and high schools, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide survey, conducted between May and October last
year, covered some 77,000 people of various ages, ranging from
primary students to people in their fifties.
</P>
<P>
Fifth- and sixth-year primary school students were tested on
their abilities in 13 activities that included jumping sideways
repeatedly, running 50 meters, and throwing handballs.
</P>
<P>
Middle-school students and those older were tested in 12
similar activities.
</P>
<P>
Overall scores for each activity have been gradually
deteriorating over the years, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1986, 18-year-old boys recorded lower scores in
all 12 activities, while both boys and girls in high schools
scored lower in most activities.
</P>
<P>
Changes in lifestyle that result in a lack of physical exercise
and increased study for entrance exams may be responsible for the
poor results of the survey.

<P>
BANGKOK, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Virabongsa Ramangkura has proposed to put 18 infrastructure
projects on hold as part of the efforts to cut down the
government's fiscal 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
The 18 long-term projects would need a combined investment in
excess of 424 billion baht (11.6 billion US dollars). They include
a subway system, expressways, a high-speed railway, a cargo
transport airline, auxiliary facilities for the new Bangkok
airport and an inter-city motorway.
</P>
<P>
Most of these projects were scheduled to start next year.
</P>
<P>
The government is under pressure to cut the 1998 budget to help
meet the conditions necessary for the use of the 17.2 billion US
dollar stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
If Virabongsa's suspension plan is approved by the cabinet, it
will help the government slash its 923 billion baht (25 billion
dollar) 1998 budget by another 120 billion baht (3.28 billion
dollars).

<HEADLINE> IMF to Help Restore Confidence in Indonesia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A team of International
Monetary Fund (IMF) officials will draw up measures aimed at
restoring confidence in Indonesia's economy and foreign exchange
market, World Bank country director Dennis de Tray said.
</P>
<P>
De Tray said here Thursday the team will arrive here this
weekend and will start work next Monday, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia is experiencing a confidence crisis rather
than a financial crisis, and that the IMF team will assess the
country's economic fundamentals and provide recommendations on
measures the government has to take to overcome the continued
weakening of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF can come in, they have facilities and staff and within
a matter of weeks, do an analysis, come up with the program, up
together the funding package and get it into place," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Tray insisted that Indonesia was not in a financial crisis
and it has between 20 billion and 25 billion U.S. dollars in
reserves to underpin reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Wednesday
that Indonesia was seeking long-term loans from international
financial institutions, including the IMF and the World Bank, to
help overcome the rupiah's sustained weakness.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been depreciated by more than 33 percent in the
last three months and about 55 percent in this year alone. The
currency was badly hit compared to other currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Asked how much funding Indonesia might need, De Tray said there
had been no discussion of the level of funding, but stressed that
Indonesia was "not broken" and "not Thailand" and was just facing
a confidence crisis, not a financial crisis. Thailand got a 17.2
billion U.S. dollar bailout package put together by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Minister/State Secretary Drs. Moerdiono said
Indonesia is not worried about conditions that would accompany
financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund and
other nations to bail it out of its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"So far we've done our homework well. If we do our homework
well, there should be no conditions attached," he said.
</P>
<P>
But economists and analysts warned that financial assistance
from the IMF usually came with tough conditions attached to it and
Indonesia could have trouble in coping with them.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Muhammad said the IMF assistance was only a
"precautionary action."

<HEADLINE> Four Countries to Buy Thai Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Importers from Italy, Canada,
South Africa and Greece say they are prepared to buy rubber from
Thailand after comparing its quality against that of Malaysia and
Indonesia, according to Thailand's Rubber Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Today's press reports quoted Varaporn Kajornchaikoon, head of
the institute's research section, as saying that import
representatives from the four countries had arrived in Thailand
recently to study the institute's research and visit a rubber
testing laboratory.
</P>
<P>
She said they were impressed with the various measures in place
to control the quality of Thailand's rubber.
</P>
<P>
Some representatives said they would consider importing more
Thai rubber, while others who had not imported Thai rubber said
they would begin to do so.
</P>
<P>
Italy, which has highly advanced automobile industry, imports
Thai rubber worth 45 million U.S. dollars per year. Its annual
imports of Malaysian rubber are worth 75 million dollars, while
imports from Indonesia are worth 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Varaporn said South Africa was a potential market for many Thai
goods, especially rubber, as many car makers had located their
vehicle assembly plants there.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Greece had never bought Thai rubber but Varaporn
said both countries have expressed interest in buying smoked
rubber sheets and rubber locks from Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia President Meets Malaysian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia could boost its
development through cooperation with other nations, President
Soeharto told visiting Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet held here in honor of the Malaysian
King, the president said, "We are aware that all development
burdens and responsibilities lie on the shoulders of the nation
concerned. But experience has shown that cooperation among nations
can be very beneficial."
</P>
<P>
The president admitted that the forest fires and the monetary
turmoil that hit Indonesia and other Southeast Asian nations
lately have hampered the pace of Indonesia's development efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We have done our utmost to overcome repeated disturbances to
our national development effort," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Raging fires have destroyed about 300,000 hectares of forest
land and caused heavy losses to the country's economy in the past
three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the monetary crisis, which started in early July and
then spread to most parts of Southeast Asia, has forced a
depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah by 55 percent against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian king and his wife Tuanku Najihah arrived here
Thursday for a six-day official visit to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and the Malaysian king will hold talks this morning.
</P>
<P>
The king will also visit other places in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Romania and
Hungary were applauded by the foreign ministers of both countries
during a press conference following their talks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kavacs Laszlo said he was
satisfied with the practice of the Agreement on mutual
understanding, cooperation and good-neighborly relations
established between Hungary and Romania. His Romanian counterpart,
Andrian Severin, affirmed that the two countries will cooperate
and help each other on their way to NATO and European Union
membership.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier meeting between Kovacs and Romanian President
Emil Constantinescu, both sides said their governments will take
steps to combat any action that would spoil the national minority
issues between the two neighboring countries, the Rompres news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers on Wednesday attended the opening
ceremony of a mixed government committee, to enhance cooperation
and active-partnership relations between the two nations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Offers Italy Preferential Trading Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 9 (Xinhua) -- After offering Italy a
"preferential trade role," Iraq today renewed its condemnation of
Britain and the United States for preventing the easing of the
embargo against the country, which was imposed after the Gulf War
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The decision to grant Italy the preferential status was
announced by Iraqi diplomat Al-Yacoubi in Rome at a press
conference on the eve of the United Nations' decision not to ease
the embargo, which is reviewed every six months.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat illustrated the "tragic situation" in his country
as a result of the devastating U.N. sanctions, and named Britain
and the United States as the main culprits in enforcing the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
"The British and U.S. representatives at the U.N. block
everything so that the end of the embargo moves further and
further into the distance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Yacoubi noted that though funds for the sale of Iraqi oil
under the U.N. Oil for Food resolution have reached the target
amount, only 20 percent has reached Iraq in the form of medicine
with the rest being blocked.
</P>
<P>
He said Italians are "deeply aware of the suffering of Iraqi
people," adding that relations between the two countries are
excellent, with visits to Baghdad by Italian commercial and
business delegations occurring frequently.
</P>
<P>
"One of many problems that occur is that when the Iraqi
government manages to reach an agreement with an Italian company,
delivery to Iraq is in fact prevented," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has granted technical assistance of 1.1 million US dollars
to help improve Sri Lanka's urban environment and uplift the
quality of life of urban residents, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is aimed at preparing a project that will help
government strengthen the urban development sector, provide low
income housing and facilitate urban land development.
</P>
<P>
About 27 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million population live in
urban areas. Job opportunities and investment are mainly
concentrated in the capital city of Colombo, leaving small and
medium urban centers at a disadvantage, the Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
The government's goal is to provide essential service,
particularly for the poor, promote the growth of regions outside
Colombo and strengthen capabilities of local governments.
</P>
<P>
Urban infrastructure and services in Sri Lanka need to be
improved to promote the growth of small and medium urban centers.
</P>
<P>
The ADB assistance has two components, one dealing with the
urban development sector and the other with the low-income housing
and land management sector.

Ecuador over its claim of sovereign access to the Amazon River,
Peruvian Foreign Minister Ferrero Costa said today.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero said at a press conference that this claim is

the cession of territories that are its own," he said.

Peru and Ecuador held five rounds of talks on border problems

Ecuador raised its claim of sovereign access to the

Ferrero said that the Peruvian delegation rejected Ecuador's

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Sales of 12 major industrial
enterprises in Hefei, capital city of east China's Anhui province,
were 4.2 billion yuan in the first half of the year, accounting
for more than half of the total sales volume of the city's
important industrial businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Meiling Group, Rongshida Group, and Hefei Iron and Steel
Corp. had sales exceeding 600 million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
A city government official in charge of industry attributes
these enterprises' "pillar role" to the government's efforts to
promote growth in large ventures at a low cost.
</P>
<P>
The city government is also placing great importance on helping
these enterprises use a modern managerial system to strengthen
their position in the market.
</P>
<P>
The managerial system focuses on capital expansion. As a
result, one company, the Anhui Motorcycle Company became one of
the city's top ten enterprises with the largest pre-tax profits,
after merging with a watch manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The Rongshida Group increased its total capital to nearly two
billion yuan by getting 200 million yuan from overseas. Both
production and market share of its major product, a washing
machine, have maintained a leading position in China.

TIRANA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Albania's foreign trade volume
stood at 293.3 million U.S. dollars during the first half of this
year, equal to only 25 percent of last year's figure of 1.15
billion dollars for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the Albanian national bank show that
the import volume decreased to 221.5 million dollars from 920.5
million dollars, while export volume dropped to 71.8 million
dollars from 228.8 million dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The main cause was a national pyramid scheme, that wiped out
two billion U.S. dollars worth of Albanian's money and caused a
nationwide disturbance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Albania has experienced a large foreign deficit since 1994. The
export volume of the country in 1996 accounted for only 24.86
percent of the import volume.

situation may provide an easy way for some referees to cheat in
favor of their native provincess," Wu added.
</P>
<P>
To nip in the bud such illegal rulings, Wu said, the Chinese
State Physical Culture and Sports Commission decided to take this
historical action by introducing foreign referees into the
national games.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes have been training very hard for the quadrennial
games over the past four years," Wu said. "We must assure them of
an absolute arena of fair play."
</P>
<P>
The Eighth National Games, the last major sports gala held in
China in the century, will ring up its curtain on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> World Coffee Prices to Be Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The future
international prices for coffee will depend largely on the
harvests in main coffee producing countries, such as Brazil,
Indonesia, and the Central American nations, a Colombian expert
said today.
</P>
<P>
Cabriel Rosas Vega, president of Colombian Coffee Exporters
Association (Asoexport) said international coffee prices will
remain stable in the future, although exports of a few other
coffee-producing countries could modify projections.
</P>
<P>
Rosas Vega cautioned against the jump in output of countries
such as Mexico and Guatemala, which together have increased their
output by 2.4 million bags, each weighs 60 kilograms, in the last
two harvests.
</P>
<P>
Colombia reduced its production by 2.3 million bags in the same
period, going from 13 million to 10.7 million bags. The
preliminary forecasts of the Colombian harvest in the year 97-98
were 11.3 million bags.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the world main coffee producer, has also shown a
recovery in production.
</P>
<P>
According to Rosas Vega, Brazil's projections for the 1997-1998
season is a harvest of approximately 28 million bags, although the
country has a capacity to produce 35 million bags.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the world coffee production has reached 103
million bags, with 75 million for export and 24 million going to
domestic consumption, Rosas Vega said.
</P>
<P>
The figures show a global consumption of 99 million bags,
indicating equilibrium and a relative stability in the prices.
</P>
<P>
But quotations will depend to a high degree on harvests in
Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Central America, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Ancient City Opening up More to Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Taking the advantage of the
decision of the Chinese government to place greater importance on
developing western parts of the country, Xi'an, a famous ancient
city, has opened its door wider to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Feng Xuchu told Xinhua recently that 1,743
overseas-funded enterprises have been set up in Xi'an, a city with
a history of more than 3,100 years. Now the ancient city is the
capital of Shaanxi province in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
By July this year, Xi'an had drawn a total of 3.2 billion US
dollars in foreign investment, according to the mayor, and in
order to get more, it has held a number of trade and investment
fairs and press conferences in Hong Kong, Milan, Tokyo, Bangkok,
and other cities.
</P>
<P>
For seven straight years. the annual Xi'an Ancient Culture and
Art Festival, and Trade and Investment Fair have been organized in
the city. These activities have attracted many people, and large
international companies from 47 countries and regions have opened
businesses in the city, bringing 4.94 billion US dollars in
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign enterprises have been active in electronics,
telecommunications, machine building, and biochemicals and have
exported goods to 104 foreign countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Announces Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
announced his resignation this afternoon, bringing to an end his
17-month-old center-left government.
</P>
<P>
It came as a result of the Communist Refoundation Party's
refusal to soften its stance on rewriting the deficit-cutting
draft budget for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Unlike some of his predecessors, who tendered their
resignations after consulting the president, Prodi announced his
decision to quit before going to report his government's
difficulties to the president.
</P>
<P>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked the Prodi government to
stay on in a caretaker capacity.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro, intent on avoiding a protracted political deadlock,
wasted no time in announcing immediate consultations with party
leaders, parliamentary speakers and former heads of state to try
and seek a new government formation and avert early elections
three and a half years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's government depended on the Communist Refoundation Party
in the lower house to pass legislation. But the communists refused
to back the deficit-cutting budget because of cuts amounting to 5
trillion lire (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) in pensions and welfare
spending.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the proposed budget is vital for Italy to become
a member of the European economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The communist demands also include shortening the working week
from 40 hours to 30 hours and stimulating employment in the south,
where the unemployment rate is the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local media say the Prodi government has made great financial
and economic achievements since it took office in April 1996, and
it would take less time than before to resolve this government
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Li Fang Makes Miracle to Back to Tennis Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- To survive the injuries that
may ruin her career, Li Fang makes the miracle by backing to the
tennis court and regaining her prowess in her voyage towards the
pinnacle of the sport.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese woman tennis ace player has been winning flurry of
cheers when she was competing in the Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident of keeping my title in the country and I'm on
the way to make the second attempt to surge into the top 50 in the
world," said Li Fang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese woman made her professional debut in 1992 and
achieved her ever-best feat by ranking 49th in the world in 1995.
</P>
<P>
When all things went on her way to success, Li Fang was plunged
into the sea of sadness, all in a click of a second, as her tendon
was broken in her left knee in the early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Her doctors in Beijing recommended surgery twice and a whole
year rest for a full recovery, but Li Fang was in the eager mood
for competitions and returned to the court two months later by
choicing protective treatment instead.
</P>
<P>
But the injuries became worsen and hindered her movements since
then on before her knee totally betrayed her in March last year.
The Chinese player was thus kept away from the Centennial Olympic
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The injuries charged her very expensive as she slipped away
from the top 100 and then top 200 last year.
</P>
<P>
In a dilemma of to-do-or-to-die, Li Fang hesitated no moment to
stake her career on a risky operation in a hospital in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"I had no choice as the operation served as a lone springboard
for me to return to the court and to regain my prowess in the
sport," recalled Li Fang.
</P>
<P>
To break the old saying that misfortunes never come singly, the
lucky star beckoned upon the Chinese woman eventually, and smiles
crept upon her face as the surgery went into full success in last
October.
</P>
<P>
After an unbelievable short hiatus of five months, Li Fang
backed to the competition court in March and reapt four titles in
her 10 caps in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
In the Japanese Open last month, Li Fang bleezed past two
opponents, ranked in the top 70, and even stage tough challenges
against Vicario Arantxa Sanchez of Spain before bowing out of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Now, all the things went smoothly, even to my surprise. And I
may well be ahead of the 70th ranking should I have competed in
more meets," said Li Fang.

SAN JOSE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica registered a
negative inflation of 0.4 percent in September, the second in
seven years, said Economy Minister Jose Leon Desanti.
</P>
<P>
This negative inflation is a clear proof of the slowing down of
prices increase of a basket of 264 basic consumer products and
services.
</P>
<P>
But, Gilbert Brown, general secretary of the Rerum Novarum
labor union federation, said that the alleged retraction of the
inflation "are government figures. We feel our pockets emptier
with the high prices index."
</P>
<P>
The accumulated inflation in the first nine months of the year
reached 8.25 percent. Annual inflation, measured between October
of 1996 and September of 1997 is 12 percent, below the 17 percent
registered in the previous 12 months.

The government target is to close the year with a 12 percent
inflation for the year.

SHENYANG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Since China started its
reforms and opening up in the late '70s, the Chinese have become
more careful about their appearance and the people of northeast
China's Liaoning province are no exception.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 5,000 beauty parlors in the province, a
four-fold increase from five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Beauty parlors have now joined the ranks of major tertiary
businesses, along with restaurants and retail shops, according to
local officials. In order to increase and regulate the beauty shop
business, the provincial government has come up with a series of
laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Trade Department was given the job of governing
the sector, and a provincial commission has been established to
examine and classify local beauty parlors.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many local beauty shops have gone from a
mom-and-pop business to modern enterprises, with some using a
computerized management system.
</P>
<P>
And, overseas investors have even entered the industry by
setting up joint ventures or wholly-owned beauty parlors.

<P>
HAIKOU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Haikou, the capital of China's
island province of Hainan, has been using preferential policies to
improve its infrastructure facilities and is looking for
large-scale investment from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to a local leading official, the city has made
efforts to develop energy, traffic, transportation,
telecommunications, and water supply sectors over the past decade,
and the efforts have now paid off.
</P>
<P>
The city has abundant power and water supplies, the official
says. The Haikou Power Plant has an installed capacity of 750,000
kw, ten times the figure of ten years ago, and the city's water
supply has a daily capacity of 559,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, it has built 388 km of roads, and the
Dongxian and Haikou-Yangpu expressways are now in operation.

has issued an order to put into effect four sets of revised
regulations on interior service, discipline, formation drilling
and garrison concerning the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Original regulations were issued in the early 1990s, while the
new ones better carry out China's military strategy in the new
period and draw in the successful experience in the course of the
army building and reform over the past years, military sources
said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the new regulations will ensure the absolute
leadership of the Communist Party of China over the army, fully
implement the policies worked out at the just-ended 15th National
Party Congress, and raise the army's combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Li Peng said yesterday that overall Sino-Italian
relations have witnessed smooth progress in the political,
economic, cultural, educational, scientific and military areas
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1970.

Li hoped the development momentum can be maintained when he was
meeting with visiting Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
</P>
<P>
 China Daily

<HEADLINE> Increasing Overseas Investment in South Chinese City's Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- There has been more overseas
investment in industrial development in the capital of China's
island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
This can be attributed to an improved investment environment
and preferential policies for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has emphasized the development of
transportation, energy, and telecom sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992-1996 period, the province got more than three
billion US dollars in overseas funds. A Sino-ROK (the Republic of
Korea) tin sheet plant, valued at 66 million US dollars, was built
in Haikou, with an annual production capacity of 100,000 tons of
thin tin-coated sheet as the first large industrial project in the
city.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Singaporean brewery now has an annually production
capacity of 130,000 tons of "Tiger" beer, which has become a
popular brand name in the province.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, the province earned 34
million US dollars of foreign exchange from exports, a nearly 22
percent rise over the same period in 1996. A large number of
aquatic, electronic, and pharmaceutical products, garments, knit
gloves, and furniture have been shipped to Hong Kong, Japan, the
ROK, the US, and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Market Is Key To Narrowing China's East-West Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Market-oriented co-operation
has become a major means of correcting China's regional
inequalities, according to the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Five autonomous regions and provinces in northwest China signed
agreements on 4,000 co-operation projects last year, with 13.5
billion yuan in investment.
</P>
<P>
"The West has changed its former practice of offering
preferential policies and tax rebates in co-operating with the
East and now is using the new method of exchanging its resources
and property rights through shares, stock, acquisitions,
purchases, and leases for the East's technology and capital," said
Zhou Baoheng, director of the Ningxia region's Economic and
Technological Co-operation Office.
</P>
<P>
The Northwest's GDP increased 9.8 percent in 1996, higher than
the national average, thanks to the co-operation.
</P>
<P>
An ailing carbon black company in Tianjin, in the north, has
become the country's largest enterprise of its kind, by buying
into three other businesses in central and western
provinces. Another example is Ningxia's Yinchuan Diesel Engine
Plant. The plant was practically bankrupt when it reorganized its
assets with a business in Jiangsu province in the east, and it now
produces more than 100 million yuan worth of added value goods.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, has worked out
policies to encourage local enterprises to cooperate with the west
and will set aside 30 million yuan annually for the next three
years to develop markets, mainly in the west.

The Australian Financial Review
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Pentagon urged the Bosnian
Serbs today to turn over the Serbs accused of committing war
crimes during the Bosnian civil war to the war crimes tribunal in
the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Croatians and Muslims have complied with the Dayton
Accord by turning over the indicted, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon told a regular briefing, when referring to the hand-over of
ten people by the Croatians to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the non-Serb indicted war criminals have now been
round up, that is the Bosnians and the Croatians," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"So it puts more pressure on the Serbs to comply with the terms
of the Dayton Accord, since the Croatians and the Bosnians already
have done that," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I think the lesson is clear: that the international community
is serious about bringing indicted war criminals to justice," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"And we have been working hard with the formerly warring
parties to convince them to do that. And this is a sign that those
efforts are succeeding," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Bioengineering Crop to Raise Food Yields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Bioengineering crop could
increase food yields by up to 25 percent in the developing world,
where the population is growing while the cultivated land is
shrinking, said a report by a scientific panel convened by the
World Bank and the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
</P>
<P>
The report released today said that genes can be inserted into
the major food crops, including rice, corn, wheat, potatoes,
cassava and others to make them resistant to pests and diseases
without the need for chemicals, or make them resistant to drought,
cold, heat and other hostile conditions.
</P>
<P>
Genes can also be inserted to increase the food content of
crops, such as increasing the amount of starch in potatoes and
protein in rice, said the report "Bioengineering of Crop."
</P>
<P>
The scientists on the study stressed the urgency and importance
for the world to find new ways to increase food production as the
global population is growing by 3 billion over the next three
decades while the cultivated land has been shrinking rapidly.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the amount of cultivated land has decreased from
0.44 hectares per capita in 1961 to 0.26 hectares now and it is
expected to further decrease to 0.15 hectares by 2050 as a result
of increased population and erosion.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, increase in yields becomes a top priority in the
world and bioengineering provides one of the choices to meet the
demand, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
At the present stage, such research is conducted mainly in
industrial countries and progress has been made in some fields. In
the European Union, almost 2,000 biotechnology research projects
are underway, at least 1,300 of them using plants, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In the developing countries, trials are conducted, of which
about 40 percent are for virus resistance, 25 percent for crops
modified herbicide resistance, and another 25 percent for insect
resistance, it added.
</P>
<P>
The group of scientists predicted that by the year 2000, annual
farm sales of biotechnology-derived products are likely to total
some 10 billion U.S. dollars, with 70 percent based on seeds and
30 percent on veterinary and other products.
</P>
<P>
However, some people fear that the new technology may produce
risks such as that the plants could be changed in unforeseen ways
that would not be known until it was too late to reverse the
process.
</P>
<P>
A group of scientists from the panel told news reporters today
that further studies are required, but there should be solutions
to any problems to come. The important thing at present was to
provide more support on the agricultural science in the developing
countries to increase their production of food.
</P>
<P>
They called for collaboration and cooperation between the
international institutions and the developing countries in the
field.
</P>
<P>
The panel particularly recommended the World Bank provide more
support to the scientific research and training of scientists in
biotechnology methods in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the Bank to support an early warning system to
identify any troubles that arise and to introduce implements in
adapting new strains.
</P>
<P>
The panel suggested the World Bank increase its support of
research in biotechnology and related areas at international
agricultural research centers to ensure that the high-quality,
environmentally sustainable agricultural products and process are
developed and transferred to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Asks Army to Find Chance to Test Laser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen has asked the Army to find chance to test the laser
against a satellite, although two resent tries were canceled
because of weather and technical reasons, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said, testers at the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico may still be able to conduct the
experiment.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen has asked Army officials to
keep looking for a chance to try out the laser, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, the testers have several chances to test the laser in
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
But the target spacecraft, an Air Force satellite, is dying as
its batteries are losing power. It needs sunlight to recharge its
batteries via solar panels, and is receiving less and less
sunlight as the earth tilts.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the test drew criticism from weapons
control experts who feared the experiment could lead to a space
weapons race.

<HEADLINE> Supporters of Campaign Finance Reform Vow to Fight Anew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of campaign
finance legislation promised to renew their efforts Thursday in
spite successive setbacks in the U.S. Senate this week.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John McCain pledged to force a
straightforward vote on a leading overhaul bill he coauthored with
Democratic Senator Russell Feingold eventually, at least on a
stripped-down proposal to ban unregulated "soft money," if not on
the entire measure.
</P>
<P>
"We will not stop until we get the job done," said Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle at an appearance where he was joined
by House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt and other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The McCain-Feingold measure remained deadlocked in the Senate
during the day, trapped between two competing filibusters. One,
mounted by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and majority
Republicans, is aimed at preventing a vote on the campaign finance
bill itself. It survived on a vote of 52-48, eight shy of the 60
needed to bring it to a close.
</P>
<P>
The second by Democrats, is designed to prevent Lott from
passing a provision that would require unions to get permission
from their members before spending dues money for political
purposes. That vote was 51-48.
</P>
<P>
The bill would prohibit "soft money," or unlimited, unregulated
donations from unions, corporations and others, to the two parties
for general activities in federal elections. It also would impose
new restrictions on outside groups that mount costly, independent
advertising campaigns within 60 days of an election, provide
incentives for politicians to hold down their personal
contributions to their own campaigns and provide for new
disclosure requirements on campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
The measure also would give non-union members the ability to
block unions from using payments in lieu of dues for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
In the House, Gephardt threw his support behind an effort to
force Republican leadership to bring competing campaign finance
proposals to the floor before lawmakers adjourn for the year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Press Strongest Possible Action on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States would press
the United Nations to take "strongest possible action" against
Iraq for its curbing the inspections of a U.N. commission charged
with scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be in a position to discuss all the options,
except to say that we of course would want the strongest possible
action by the Security Council to back up the important work of
the U.N. special commission," State Department spokesman James
Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, the head of the U.N. commission, released a
report this week listing a series of incidents of Iraq's
interference with inspections of suspected weapons sites. the
Security Council intends to discuss the report on October 16.
</P>
<P>
"We will be working with our colleagues on the Security
Council to make sure the strongest possible message is sent to
Iraq that if they don't comply with these requirements, they
are never going to have the sanctions lifted," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mortgage Rates Hit 20-month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Mortgage interest rates in
the U.S. fell to the lowest level in nearly 20 months this week
but higher rates are expected in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages declined to
7.26 percent from 7.31 percent a week earlier, the lowest level
since February 15, 1996, U.S. Freddie Mac, the mortgage company,
reported today.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. economists are predicting that mortgage rates will
drift up this year and probably next year but not drastically.
</P>
<P>
That's because bond market rates -- which serve as benchmarks
for mortgages -- bounced higher Wednesday after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned investors of the risk of
higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are predicting that the mortgage rate would
increase to 7.5 percent by the end of the year and perhaps 7.75
sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates in the U.S. have fluctuated this year with
financial markets' nervousness about inflation. This year's peak
was 8.18 percent during the week ended April 3, after the Federal
Reserve tightened monetary policy on March 25.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,
averaged 6.82 percent this week, down from 6.87 percent and also
the lowest since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.49 percent, down from 5.52 percent and
the lowest in 10 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Urges U.S. to Play Decisive Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman on Thursday urged the United States to play a definite and
decisive part in revitalizing Israeli-Palestinian partnership so
that the stalled Middle East peace process could be pulled back on
track.
</P>
<P>
"I do think the United States has to be more definite and
decisive about the issue," Weizman told an audience at the
National Press Club at the end of a five-day visit to Washington.
"Definitely, the (U.S.) president has a role to play. Without
America we will not clinch deals."
</P>
<P>
Weizman cited U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as
having said during a visit to Israel last month that the United
States considered the Middle East an area of vital importance. and
she also described the United States as a "full partner" in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I ask you logically, if the area is an area of vital
importance... and you are a full partner, and two partners don't
get together, does a third party sit back and see the partnership
wither away?" Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who is from the Labor Party and has challenged Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's tough line, told the audience that
included Arab diplomats: "We are destined to live together."
