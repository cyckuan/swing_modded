views on Pakistan's Foreign Policy at the Pakistan Institute of
International Affairs (PIIA).

like Kashmir with which, he said, "we are concerned since our
independence."

Emphasizing that Pakistan must have good relations with
Afghanistan, he said that with Afghanistan one has to understand
Pakistan's national security concerns and this must be made clear
to every one, though not done earlier. He said no country in the
world can force any other country to give up its national security
interests.
</P>
<P>
"This is our national security interest and, therefore, we have
to accept this reality and then proceed further in resolving the
issue bringing peace to Afghanistan and dealing with the issue of
terrorism but the focus should be that we have Afghanistan on our
side," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Listed One of Most Competitive African Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is among the five most
competitive African economies in the year 2000, the News Agency of
Nigeria Friday quoted a report by an international research
institution as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based Center for International Development said that
Nigeria has seen a lift of its performance from "extreme
inefficiency" to "mild inefficiency" since the coming into power
of the civil administration in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Mozambique, Uganda, and Botswana are listed as
the other four most competitive economies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian economy is estimated to have had a 2.7 percent growth
last year and expected to have a future expansion by 3 percent in
2000, said the report, released at a world economic forum in
Durban of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, said the country' s infrastructure remains
lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
Despite the enhancement of the administrative efficiency,
widespread bureaucracy still takes toll, the report said, adding
that it usually takes about 25 days for imported goods to clear
customs in the country.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seizes Oil Tanker Violating U.N. Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's coast guard Saturday
intercepted an oil tanker on its way from Iraq's southern port of
Umm Qasr to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the interior ministry
announced.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, carrying 650 tons of diesel oil with 12 crewmen on
board, was seized by patrol boats inside the Kuwaiti territorial
waters for violating the U.N. sanctions against Iraq, said the
ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Kuwaiti coast guards seized two wooden
ships in May and June, with 19 Indian and Pakistani crew on board,
for violating the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq. The vessels
were reportedly carrying leather, lentils, wool and dates.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. economic sanctions since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the Gulf War. The
sanctions banned Iraq from conducting practically all trade until
limited oil sales were permitted in 1996 under the U.N. oil-for-
food program to allow Iraq to buy humanitarian supplies for its
people.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program was expanded last December to allow
virtually free oil sales, but still under U.N. supervision.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President, Israeli PM Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Saturday discussed the latest developments of the Middle East peace
process over telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation initiated by Barak, the two
leaders exchanged views on the contacts by the concerned parties on
the future of the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported. It did not give
further details.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have made little progress in
negotiating for a final peace agreement, planned for September 13,
on the thorniest issues including the status of Jerusalem and
Jewish settlements, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the
borders.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been trying to hold a summit between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton in a bid to seek ways to break the stalemate of the peace
talks. But Palestinian officials have ruled out its convocation at
the current stage, saying that Arafat will go to such a summit only
for the signing of a peace accord other than negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian media reported on Saturday that Arafat is
due to arrive in Cairo later in the day and meet with Mubarak
Sunday to coordinate stances ahead of a visit by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to the region later in the month.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Protests Against Israel Over Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government on Saturday
lodged a strong protest to Israel after four Jordanians sustained
injuries from gunshots by Israeli soldiers at the Israeli-Lebanese
border earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expressed its rage and displeasure over the attack by
Israeli soldiers and considered this incident an aggression against
defenseless Jordanian citizens, the government said in a sharply-
worded statement.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government deems this aggression inexcusable and
unacceptable under any condition and raises doubts in its
intentions, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The injured Jordanians were part of a delegation representing
the Jordanian Professional Associations visiting Lebanon as part of
celebrations after Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon
last month after 22 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
The government is in continuous contact with the Jordanian
embassy in Beirut and Lebanese authorities for results of the
investigation into the incident, Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately clear under what circumstances that
Israeli soldiers opened fire and if the soldiers knew there are
Jordanian citizens in the crowd at the Lebanese side of the border.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident was one of the few unhappy episodes
between Israel and Jordan after they signed a peace treaty in 1994.
Currently Jordan is one of the only two Arab countries, alongside
Egypt, to have reached peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since the treaty was signed.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Dismisses Three-Way Summit Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Wednesday dismissed the convening of a three-way summit between U.
S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders at present, saying such a
summit may lead to negative results.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have yet to bridge a
wide gap in their positions on the final-status issues, said
Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Qurei (also
known as Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has offered nothing to pave the way for the
holding of such a summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Qurei said in an interview with the Voice of Palestine
radio.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Palestinian refugees, he stressed the necessity
of recognizing their rights to return to their homeland and
offering compensations to those unable to go home.
</P>
<P>
He also renewed call on the Israeli side to pull out its troops
to the border lines prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
And the issue of settlements can be tackled in the context of
Palestinian sovereignty and national interest, and under relevant
international and Palestinian laws.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Unveils Budget Without "Corrective" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Saturday
unveiled for the first time in history a budget that contains no
extra burden in terms of spending cuts or tax increases.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the first budget without a "corrective," Premier
Giuliano Amato said Saturday here that "a phase is ending and a
new era is beginning after ten years of budget slashing and
counter-slashing."
</P>
<P>
"The year 2000 opens a new and different phase," he said,
illustrating the government's four-year economic plan, or DPEF, to
the so-called "social partners."
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Vincenzo Visco said unemployment
would fall below two figures next year thanks to the DPEF, which
the government will launch next week.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had been able to set up a "neutral"
budget because of the way the economy was growing.
</P>
<P>
Italian Finance Minister Ottaviano Del Turco said that "for ten
years we have launched budgets with spending cuts and fresh taxes;
this year we won't cut spending and we'll give back some taxes."
</P>
<P>
Del Turco said it was ironic that Italy's first zero-cost
budget was unveiled by Amato, the man who was premier in 1992,
after a serious crisis of confidence and with the lira dumped out
of the European monetary system. It was the first and biggest of a
serious of austerity budgets that helped get it back on track,
eventually confounding skeptics and joining the euro.
</P>
<P>
But this "neutral" budget and DPEF were not met with acclaim by
the employers whose leader Antonio D'Amato said it would not
increase Italy's competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Businessmen Reject U.S. Senate Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Some Peruvian businessmen
associations rejected Saturday in Lima U.S. Senate resolution 2522
that intends to impose economic sanctions upon Peru if the
government of President Alberto Fujimori does not improve the
democratic system.
</P>
<P>
Lima Chamber of Commerce (CCL) chairman Samuel Gleiser warned
that the U.S. Senate resolution is "a sword of Damocles" that
threatens non-traditional exports and endangers thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen's leader announced that Peruvian entrepreneurs
will take all the steps necessary to prevent the implementation of
that resolution that has been called by all Peruvian sectors an
intervention in the internal affairs of the country.
</P>
<P>
Gleiser said that these economic sanctions aim at conditioning
the participation of Peru in the benefits of the Law of Tariff
Preferences Act (ATPA) that guarantees the export with low customs
tariffs of Peruvian asparagus to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Teullet, Foreign Trade Society (COMEX) manager, said
that the solution of the political problems faced by the country
must come from the consensus of the involved groups themselves and
not to bend to external pressures that affect the productive
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Teullet said that the improvement of the democratic system is
in the hands of Peruvians themselves, as well as the reforms in
all the government institutions and in the judicial power.
</P>
<P>
Exporters Association (ADEX) president Carlos Castro said that
it is important to reestablish the democratic institutions in this
country, independently from being demanded by the U.S. Senate or
any other international organization
</P>
<P>
He added that if the Organization of American States (OAS)
promotes a rapprochement between the government and the opposition,
"favorable solutions for the country can be found" before the U.S.
Senate proposal is passed definitively.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate issued Thursday in Washington Resolution 2522,
approved by 94 votes against 4, that fixes its position in the
relations with several Latin American countries, and especially
with Peru.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate resolution which has very harsh expressions
against President Fujimori's government and his reelection, was
presented by legislators Paul Coverdall, Patrick Leahy, and Jesse
Helms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peaceful Voting Throughout Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- By 6 pm local time, an hour before
polls closed on Saturday, the first day of Zimbabwe's two-day
parliamentary election, the exercise had gone largely peacefully
in contrast to pre- election predictions that there would be
violence.
</P>
<P>
The predictions that sent many people, mostly whites, out of
the country with some companies closing, were based on the
campaign violence that left about 30 people dead, 300 injured, and
property worth millions of dollars destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The capital Harare's city centre was largely deserted on
Saturday but nothing unusual happened except long queues at most
polling stations where people cast their ballots in the country's
most fierce ever election where the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) which has been in power
since independence in 1980 faces its toughest challenge from the
main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).  The
election directorate, international observers and candidates all
congratulated Zimbabweans for voting peacefully and turning out in
high numbers countrywide.
</P>
<P>
There were, however, very few cases of irregularities and
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
There was also some confusion, with some of the monitors being
turned away either because they were not properly accredited or
were too many at one polling station where there should only be
four.
</P>
<P>
The European Union observer team reported minor cases of
violence but could not say where and who the perpetrators were.
</P>
<P>
There was also a record high turnout of white voters everywhere
in the country, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and President of the Zimbabwe
Union of Democrats Margaret Dongo said they will accept the poll
results whatever way they would go.
</P>
<P>
This election has attracted world attention and has been making
 headlines on international television and radio networks.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 candidates from 15 political parties are
contesting 120 seats on offer in the 150-member parliament.

ABU DHABI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is set to reopen its embassy
in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the coming few days after a
break of 10 years since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the official
news agency WAM reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's acting charge d'affaires to the UAE Abdul Razak Hamoudi

</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy will in the next few days reopen the embassy in
a temporary headquarters in Abu Dhabi until a permanent site is
found, said WAM.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the embassy is aimed at strengthening bilateral
relations in political, economic, commercial, cultural and
information fields as well as providing services to Iraqi
expatriates in the UAE, said the Iraqi diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He thanked UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan for
his continuous support for lifting the U.N. sanctions against Iraq
in force since 1990, and easing the sufferings of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the UAE for its efforts to restore Arab
solidarity and to hold an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
The UAE reopened its embassy in Baghdad on April 20, becoming
the fourth Gulf Arab country after Bahrain, Oman and Qatar to renew
diplomatic representation in the Iraqi capital.

BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers opened fire
Saturday on a Jordanian delegation visiting the Israeli-Lebanese
border, wounding four people, Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The official delegation of Jordanian union leaders were visiting

the head of the Jordanian Doctors Association Yarck Tahboub told

Deputy secretary-general of the Jordanian Engineers Association

like "Allahu Akbar," or God is Great, when Israeli soldiers emerged
from a military position on the Israeli side of the border. One of
them opened fire at a crowd of about 150, injuring the four people.
</P>
<P>
"All of us are astonished at this," Handy told reporters in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of 14 Jordanian unionists came to Lebanon to
celebrate Lebanon's victory of ousting Israeli forces from its
territory, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Israeli troops fired at foreigners
along the border after its withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli radio said Israeli soldiers opened fire at
several Lebanese who were trying to cut through the border fence
near the Fatima gate, wounding one of them. The soldiers were not
sure about whether those Lebanese were trying to cross the fence to
carry out an attack.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, Lebanese government accused Israel of delaying
resolving the border dispute. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
announced on Friday that Israel promised to resolve the problem "in
36 hours."

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for International Help in Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday called on the
international community to offer more cooperation and help to Iran
in fighting drug trafficking, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Like any other country, Iran cannot stand alone in combating
drugs and it has encountered many difficulties in the anti-drug
campaign, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on the
eve of the international anti-drug day, which falls on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The world community and those countries benefiting from Iran's
anti-drug campaign should seriously cooperate with and render more
services and aid to Iran, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that some 3,000 personnel of Iran's security forces
have lost their lives in this campaign, and millions of U.S.
dollars have been spent to curb the passage of smuggled drugs from
the country's eastern borders.
</P>
<P>
"We have had very close cooperation with the United Nations Drug
Control Program," though the aid extended to Iran by international
organizations has been quite minor, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's plan to burn 23 tons of narcotic drugs worth over 3
billion dollars on Sunday, Asefi said the move was aimed to mark
the international anti-drug day and show Iran's determination to
deal with the drug issue seriously.
</P>
<P>
Iran sits on a major route for smuggling narcotics from its
eastern drug-producing neighbors -- Afghanistan and Pakistan -- to
lucrative markets in the Persian Gulf and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The government launched a drug-combating campaign in 1989 after
the Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Informs Arab League of U.S., British Aggressions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Said Al-Sahaf has informed the Arab League (AL) of the continued
aggressions of the U.S. and British warplanes on Iraq, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to AL Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Sahaf
said that from June 9-16, the U.S. and British planes, from
airspaces of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, carried out 100 armed sorties
over the two no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq, bombing
civilian and service installations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British jets have been patrolling and bombing targets
inside the two no-fly zones, set up by the U.S.-led Western allies
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting
Kurds and Shiite Muslims from the forces of President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"The aggressions by the U.S. and Britain were aimed at
infringing on Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Sahaf
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government "absolutely" rejects the air exclusion
zones, imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and its allies "without a
legitimate basis," and demands compensation from the U.S. and
Britain for the humanitarian and property losses it suffered due to
the continued aggressions by the two allied countries, Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister urged the AL chief to intervene to stop the
aggressions on Iraq and make the U.S. and Britain pay respect to
Iraq's sovereignty as well as the international law.
</P>
<P>
Besides the AL, Iraq has also repeatedly asked the United
Nations Security Council to pressure the U.S. and Britain into
halting their aggressive acts on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that nearly 300 civilians have been killed and 860
others injured by the U.S. and British air raids over the no-fly
zones since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched the
Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Confident in Egypt's Efforts to Improve Living Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- As Egypt is gearing up towards a
well-studied privatization program and trade liberalization, the
World Bank has expressed confidence in the Egyptian government's
plans for seriously tackling the problems still plaguing the
ambitious reforms.
</P>
<P>
"There is a genuine desire on the part of the Egyptian
government to reduce unemployment and poverty, and assure an
educated and healthy population," Mahmoud Ayoub, director-designate
of the World Bank Mission in Egypt, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 8.3 percent of Egypt's 17 million
work force are unemployed. But independent sources put the figure
at about four percentage points higher. Meanwhile, about half of
the country's 64 million people are living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been engaging in reforms since 1991 in a bid to
improve economic performance and raise the people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
"There are all reasons to expect an expanding relationship
between Egypt and the World Bank,'' Ayoub said in an interview with
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency in Washington, where the
bank is based.
</P>
<P>
"I am very positive about the future relationship between Egypt
and the World Bank. This optimism comes from President Hosni
Mubarak's clear message that Egypt counts on the financial and
technical support of the World Bank, in ways and in quantities that
are determined by the Egyptians,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old international economist, a Pakistani, is due to
start his mandate as of October, to succeed Khaled Ikram.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on future cooperation between Egypt and the World
Bank, Ayoub said that two projects are currently in preparation:
the bank's aid for Egypt's higher education development and
professional training.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the World Bank maintain a close relationship. The
bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, helped chart
Egypt's economic reforms. The bank has also provided the country
with huge amount of soft loans for its development projects.

CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Three Egyptian teen-age cousins drank
poison in a group suicide attempt after one of the girls' parents
told her she would be married to a man she did not want, police
officials said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The father of the 16-year-old bride-to-be found his daughter and
her two 15-year-old cousins nearly unconscious Friday upon
returning to his home in the Cairo neighborhood of Giza, the state-
owned Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the girls, who were released from hospital on
Saturday, had decided to kill themselves after the 16-year-old was
told she must marry despite her objections. Her cousins joined her
in a show of solidarity, the officials said in condition of
anonymity.

<P>
ABU DHABI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is
keen on helping Lebanon with its reconstruction schemes after
Israel ended its 22-year occupation, said a UAE official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon needs heavy investments from the UAE's banking sector as
it has entered into a post-war construction period, said UAE

KUWAIT CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime
Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on Saturday reaffirmed
his government's support for convening a pan-Arab summit without
any pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah, also the country's foreign minister, made the pledge
in a statement issued after a meeting held by the National Assembly
(parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee, which reviewed the
situation in the Arab, regional and international arenas.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is not opposed to the convention of such a summit
meeting, he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
President of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan had called for convening such a summit, which is aimed to
mend the split within the Arab world, restore inter-Arab solidarity
and achieve a unified position in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Sabah promised his country's support to a decision
taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
to raise the cartel's oil production as of July 1.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Swiss Might Support U.N. Membership in Two Years: Ogi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Adolf Ogi told U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Saturday that he expects the Swiss
electorate to vote in favor of U.N. membership in two years,
according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
Ogi was speaking Saturday at the Children's World Festival in
Basel. He and Annan were the main guests of honor at the event
sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
Swiss voters rejected joining the U.N. by an overwhelming
majority 14 years ago. However, recent opinion polls show
attitudes toward the world body have undergone a sea change.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is expected to consult political parties on the
issue over the next few weeks, and if it receives a positive
response, it could ask parliament later this year to back the
membership bid. That would pave the way for a referendum, which
Ogi said could take place in 2002. U.N. supporters have also
collected enough signatures to force a vote.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Rejects $15 Billion Offer From Abacha's Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has rejected a 15 billion naira (150 million U.S. dollar) offer by
the family of the late former head of state General Sani Abacha to
keep his  government off their backs and legally bar the country
from prosecuting them if more looted funds are discovered.
</P>
<P>
Celebrated U.S. criminal case lawyer Johnnie Cochran disclosed
this at a recent meeting in New York, the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper, reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Several accounts in various parts of Europe, especially in
Britain, Luxembourg and Switzerland, have been traced to the
Abacha family, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Cochran had assured at the meeting that he would not help
defend the family.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said he had met with President Obasanjo and Mrs.
Maryam Abacha during a recent visit to Nigeria, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Abacha complained to us that she was not being treated as
a former first lady. And when we met President Obasanjo he said
he had approved to get Abacha's youngest child who broke his hand
to be flown abroad for medical treatment", said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Cochran said he could not see any sign of animosity from
President Obasanjo towards the Abacha family.
</P>
<P>
He said the president made it clear to him that all he wanted
was to recover Nigeria's money allegedly stolen by the Abacha
family.
</P>
<P>
"When I first spoke with President Obasanjo, he said he wants
to get back the money. He asked me to talk with the National
Security Adviser about it," Cochran added.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Obasanjo again in Montreal, Canada,
together with Cuban President Fidel Castro, Cochran stressed he
was not defending Abacha.

<HEADLINE> Most of African Research Findings not Commercialized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of
research findings by African universities are not made public in
any publication.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a week long workshop here said such a situation
does not encourage commercialization of research results in the
continent, local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Yossifov, director of Division of Infrastructure
Services and Innovation Promotion of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO), told African researchers that only a
few of universities have managed to commercialize.
</P>
<P>
"Some universities have however, managed to realize profits
after selling their technological innovations to industries of
their country," he said, noting that they include South Africa,
Botswana and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said such universities have reached levels of
commercialization of their research works by rewarding those who
made their researchers possible.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Science, Technology and Higher Education Raphael Kabende said that
many newly industrialized countries had accessed technological
knowledge and used it successfully.
</P>
<P>
He urged researchers and development organizations in Africa to
conduct research work useful to the existing market development.
</P>
<P>
The regional meeting on intellectual property system for
universities drew 60 academicians and researchers mostly from
African universities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting intended to address problems related to
intellectual property benefits following the fact that property
rights in the continent have not been fully safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
The participants said that there is an urgent need to establish
 innovation and invention support structures in universities in
order to protect the intellectual property rights,
</P>
<P>
Professor Mayunga Mkunya, chief academic officer of the
University of Dar Es Salaam, said that because of poor knowledge
on the benefit of intellectual property rights, universities in
developing countries have continued to lose recognition and
commercial rights of their scientific and technological
discoveries and inventions.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the situation is aggravated even further by
the little or complete inability of governments in developing
countries to invest in innovative research and development
activities at universities even at a minimum level.
</P>
<P>
"Not only university and research institutions which lose their
 intellectual rights in Africa, but also Musicians too," Mkunya
said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Embassy in Eritrea Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has accused Eritrea
of failing to protect its embassy in Asmara, capital of Eritrea,
from being attacked, local Walta Information Center (WIC)
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A group of violent perpetrators Friday broke into the premises
of the Ethiopian embassy in Asmara and burned the Ethiopian flag
that was hoisted in the embassy compound, the Ethiopian embassy in
Asmara said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrean security officers posted at the gate of the embassy
did not take any action to prevent the perpetrators from entering
the embassy compound, nor detain the culprits," the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy regretted that the Eritrean government has failed
to take all the appropriate steps to protect the premises of the
mission against intrusion and damage and prevent disturbance of
the peace of the mission or impairment of the Embassy's dignity.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the embassy requested Eritrean authorities to investigate into the
case and bring to justice the perpetrators of the action, to
appoint well disciplined Eritrean police to protect the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The embassy also brought the matter to the attention of the
international community through letters it sent to all diplomatic
missions and international organizations, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea did not sever their diplomatic relations
although they fought for two years since May 1998 over border
disputes. The two countries signed a cessation of hostilities
agreement last Sunday under the auspices of the Organization of
African Unity.

<HEADLINE> Peace Will Prevail in S.Leone: Information Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- With the government forces going
ahead with the deployment into the strategic positions and
regaining control of the diamond-producing areas of the country,
the long-yearned peace will come to Sierra Leone, Minister of
Information and Broadcasting Julius Spencer has said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua on Friday at his office
in the capital of Freetown, Spencer said the situation in Sierra
Leone is getting better with the government forces getting
upper-hand on the battleground after pushing back the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) fighters into the jungle in some
areas of the northern and eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the dead-locked peace process, Spencer said the
Sierra Leone government will continue to implement the Lome Peace
Accord, signed by President Tejan Kabbah and RUF leader Foday
Sankoh in Togo's capital Lome last July.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, some of the articles of the agreement had to
be revised because the RUF resumed military action against the
government in violation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Spencer pointed out that Sankoh would be dropped out of the
peace process and tried at a special court in Sierra Leone for his
direct involvement in the resumption of RUF's military attack and
taking the United Nations peacekeepers hostage in early May.
</P>
<P>
Describing Sankoh as an "incredible" person, Spencer said the
government would only deal with the new "alternative leadership"
of the RUF in implementing the Lome Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions about the role played by the United
Nations peacekeeping forces, known as UNAMSIL, the minister said
the UNAMSIL had been authorized by the UN Security Council to "use
force" to protect the Sierra Leone government and civilians.
</P>
<P>
After the hostage crisis, the Sierra Leone government had
proposed that the mandate of the UNAMSIL be changed from
peacekeeping to peace enforcement, said the minister, adding that
the "change of mandate" was discussed in the UN Security Council
but no resolution was made so far.
</P>
<P>
As to the diamond resources of the country, Spencer said the
RUF, which controls most diamond-producing areas in the west
African country, has been using the diamond to fuel the civil war.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sankoh, who was appointed chairman of the
management of the strategic mineral resources commission under the
Lome Peace Accord, has taken advantage of his position to exploit
diamond to finance the purchase of large quantity of armament.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that diamond has been a major cause of the
long-term conflict in Sierra Leone. Therefore, the government
would, with the help of the UNAMSIL, use every possible military
means to retake control of the diamond-producing areas if the RUF
did not withdraw voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government would strengthen the supervision of
the " diamond business" to crack down smuggling across the border,
said Spencer, adding that peace will come after the RUF was pushed
away from the diamond- producing areas.

<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- International observers Saturday
expressed satisfaction with the voting on the first day of
Zimbabwe's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
"The election is quite peaceful. The situation is calm, both
outside and inside polling stations. This is very encouraging,"
said Joycely Lucas from the Commonwealth Observer Mission.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received any complaints so far. The electorate is
proving to be mature and polling officials seem to be doing their
job well," said an observer from the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Spokesperson of the SADC observer team said, "There is nothing
out of order or irregular that we have seen so far."
</P>
<P>
Head of the European Union Observers Mission Pierra Schori said
his team' s reports all over the country so far indicated a
peaceful voting atmosphere and would make a final report a week
after the election which ended on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Election Directorate of Zimbabwe
Mariyawanda Nzuwah commended Zimbabweans for maintaining a
peaceful atmosphere on the first day of the parliamentary
election.
</P>
<P>
Nzuwah, who toured various constituencies, said it was clear
that the day was very quiet in contrast to predictions.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy the turnout is very high. We have no figures but
if the turnout is like this tomorrow, registered voters will have
exercised their right to vote," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)
complained that its polling agents were intimidated and attacked
by suspected war veterans and members of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union- Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at a press conference in Harare, MDC
election Director Ian Makoni said the intimidation and the attacks
of their agents were high on Friday night and in the early hours
of Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Makoni said the situation had improved in the later part of the
 afternoon as violence had become less.

state-owned industrial zones in a bid to bolster the industrial
efficiency and attract more foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The government is currently studying the possibility of allowing
the private sector to undertake the running of those industrial
zones.
</P>
<P>
The government has earmarked 200 million rials (519.5 million U.
S. dollars) for the development of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it is launching a drive aimed at diversifying the
sources of income, with crude oil accounting for 65 percent of the
total income.
</P>
<P>
Oman has introduced plans for privatizing some of the vital
sectors, including telecommunications and airports, and is planning
to privatize the postal services.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Commerce Ministry renewed on Friday a ban
imposed on importing foodstuffs from Belgium after the Saudi
security authorities seized and confiscated some foodstuffs and
fodders contaminated with the toxic Dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The ban covers all products of Belgian origin, said Minister of
Commerce Osama Ibrahim Faqih.
</P>
<P>
The renewal of the ban is issued pending an investigation in
Belgium on the discovery of some foodstuffs and fodders
contaminated with toxic Dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia imposed a ban on Belgian products in July 1999 and
stopped dealing with 10 Belgian companies, a French company and
another Dutch company involved in producing the contaminated
fodders.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Iranian Jews Accused of Spying Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The judge presiding over the trial
of 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel has formally closed
the case Saturday, with the court verdict to be issued within a
week, said a judiciary official.
</P>
<P>
The judge closed the files of 13 Jewish and four Muslim suspects
accused of spying for Israel after receiving a response to the last
court query, said Hossein Ali Amiri, the head of judiciary in
Iran's southern Fars Province.
</P>
<P>
Under Iran's public and revolutionary courts law, the court
verdict in the case would be issued within a week after the
announcement of the end of the legal proceedings, he was quoted as
saying by the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The court hearings for the 13 Iranian Jews, arrested in March
1999, started on April 13 in Shiraz, the capital city of Fars
Province. So far nine of the accused have reportedly confessed to
passing on classified information to Israel and having links with
its security service.
</P>
<P>
Altogether eight Muslims, believed to be state employees, have
been accused of spying for Israel, but the case for the other four
has not been completed.
</P>
<P>
"To observe the rights of the accused in custody, the judge
decided to issue the ruling for the accused whose case is
complete," Amiri said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the official dismissed speculation that the Jews
would be sentenced to death, saying they are not charged with "
mohareb" (waging war against God and the country), the only crime
carrying the death penalty in the case.
</P>
<P>
Resisting Western pressure to release the accused Jews, Tehran
insisted that their arrests had nothing to do with their religious
backgrounds, and that no foreign country should interfere in Iran's
internal affairs.

"The names will be offered for whatever price is required to

</P>
<P>
Wolford said Network Solutions has to pay a six-U.S.-dollar fee
to the master database maintained by a separate division of the
company, even for unpaid accounts.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest and most profitable Internet companies,
Herndon-based Network Solutions was bought by VeriSign Inc. this

<P>
Network Solutions plans to keep the money from the auction and

issued for fees of 15 to 35 dollars a year, depending on the
registrar, and sometimes are resold at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Customers and competitors of the company complained strongly
about the plan, saying Network Solutions should instead be
required to return all delinquent names to a public database where
any of several dozen other accredited registrars could offer for

<HEADLINE> Few cases of Violence in Zimbabwe's Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pierre Schori, head of the European
Union (EU) observer mission in Zimbabwe's parliamentary election,
Saturday said voting started peacefully in most parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
There were a few cases of violence in some areas countrywide,
Schori told reporters in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said some observers in certain areas in the country had
reported that people were being prevented from voting by groups of
youths. He could not name the areas which had experienced such
cases.
</P>
<P>
Schori, a Swedish national, who met Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe on Saturday morning, said he clarified to the president
that his organization was not sent by Britain as perceived in
some circles.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I told President Mugabe that Britain has not sent us.
 We represent 15 EU-member countries in observing the election."
</P>
<P>
A week after the election, which is regarded as the biggest
since 1980, he said he would present a report to Mugabe and other
parties concerned about the election on the EU's observations.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who has refused to accredit British observers for the
election, said they were biased against his Zanu-pf party because
of his controversial land redistribution program which seeks to
give mostly white owned land to the blacks.
</P>
<P>
Schori said he had also told Mugabe that the EU supported the
land redistribution program but wanted it to be done in a
peaceful and transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 white farms have been invaded by war veterans who
have complained that the land redistribution program was taking
too long to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 political parties and 566 candidates are taking
part in the polls.

<HEADLINE> Ince May Follow Shearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Paul Ince looks likely to follow
Alan Shearer's example and announce his retirement from
international football.
</P>
<P>
Ince, nicknamed the Guv'nor, started all three of England's
Euro 2000 games in Belgium and had been hoping to finish on a high
note.
</P>
<P>
But the Mirror newspaper claims the Middlesbrough midfielder
has now made up his mind to step down from the national stage.
</P>
<P>
The news will come as another huge blow to England coach Kevin
Keegan after a series of setbacks in a miserable week for the
England coach.
</P>
<P>
First came Tuesday's defeat at the hands of Romania, which
confirmed England's premature exit from the European Championships.
</P>
<P>
That defeat was followed by captain Shearer's confirmation of
his retirement from international football.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Football Association suggested Keegan should
take some tactical advice from FA technical director Howard
Wilkinson in the light of some naive England performances.
</P>
<P>
Defender Martin Keown then rubbed salt into the coach's wounds
by claiming England were "tactically inept" and said England's
failings were down to the failings of the coaching rather than the
players.
</P>
<P>
Keegan insists he would pick the same squad of players if
England were involved in another tournament within the next couple
of months.
</P>
<P>
That suggests the senior players in his squad all have a part
to play when the World Cup qualifying campaign kicks off against
Germany in October.
</P>
<P>
But Ince, whose wife is pregnant, wants to spend more time with
his family and is unlikely to add to his 53 England caps.
</P>
<P>
Question marks also hang over the heads of several more of
Keegan's elder statesmen.
</P>
<P>
Tony Adams, who missed two of England's three games in Belgium
due to injury, is considering his international future, as is
fellow Arsenal star David Seaman, who is facing mounting pressure
from Nigel Martyn for the goalkeeper's jersey.
</P>
<P>
Keown, who insists he has matured as an international player
under Keegan, is another Arsenal star whose England future is in
the balance, along with Chelsea midfielder Dennis Wise.
</P>
<P>
Keegan is under pressure to start bringing England's emerging
young players through, but knows that introducing too many too
soon could jeopardise England's hopes of qualifying for the World
Cup finals in two years' time.

<HEADLINE> Keown Blames 'Inept Tactics' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Martin Keown has blamed "inept
tactics" for England's early exit from Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan claimed the fundamental reason why
England failed to make the quarterfinals was the players'
inability to pass the ball well or keep possession.
</P>
<P>
But Arsenal defender Keown reckons England's tactical
shortcomings were responsible for defeats against Group A rivals
Portugal and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Keown told The Sun: "There is a need for honesty. The bottom
line is we were inept tactically. We were exposed against teams we
could have beaten."
</P>
<P>
Keegan was widely criticised for his tactics after England's 3-
2 defeat in their opening match against Portugal.
</P>
<P>
England, who went into the game with a 4-4-2 formation, took an
early 2-0 lead but were being overrun in midfield and Keegan's
failure to change tactics aided Portugal's comeback.
</P>
<P>
Keown added: "England's failings have nothing to do with
technical skill because I don't agree we're not good enough as
footballers. We simply did not gel as a team."
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there wasn't enough time for us to do that after a new
manager was appointed. The sides that are doing well look well-
oiled, they know instinctively where their teammates are. They all
play in a certain way. England are a bit behind in that respect as
we only just made it through the back door. Suddenly we were there
and the talk was of winning it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keown's outburst will come as a hammer blow to Keegan who
places great importance on the loyalty and support of his players.

Black broke back in the sixth game of the set and then had a 3-

Black broke Grosjean in the third game to lead 2-1. But it

<HEADLINE> Harsher Punishment for Drug Smugglers Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian officer on Saturday
urged the government to revise the anti-drug law to impose harsher
punishments on drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of the international anti-drug day on
Sunday, Deputy Commander of the Security Forces Brigadier General
Mohsen Ansari Ansari blamed the current anti-drug law for lacking
severe punishments on petty smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The law now in force, passed by the Majlis (parliament) in 1989,
only stipulates detention, whipping and cash penalty for petty
narcotics dealers, he complained. It provides the death penalty for
those caught with 30 grams of heroin or 5 kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Ansari called on governmental organs, including the Security
Forces and the Judiciary to "make utmost efforts" in the anti-drug
campaign, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The country should work out the strategy of anti-drug campaign
on preventing addiction and lowering demands for drugs, he said,
warning that as long as the problem of unemployment remains
unsolved in the country, the devastating disaster of narcotics will
not be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug addicts was officially declared at 1.2
million, while independent sources put the figure as high as 3
million in the country with a 60 million population.
</P>
<P>
Ansari cited deployment of more security forces in eastern
border areas, employment of technical equipment and sniffer dogs as
future measures to be taken by his forces to combat drugs.
</P>
<P>
During the past three months, the security forces arrested about
40,000 drugs distributors and addicts, and handed them over to the
judiciary, he said, and some 60 tons of various narcotic drugs were
confiscated in the period.
</P>
<P>
Ansari also complained that the production of about 5,000 tons
of narcotic drugs and the operation of 35 large organized drug
networks in Afghanistan are a major threat to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Currently 350 drug laboratories with a capacity of processing
120 tons of morphine are operating in Afghanistan near the Iranian
borders, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian mission to the United Nations announced
on Friday that Iran will set ablaze 23 tons of narcotic drugs worth
over 3 billion U.S. dollars in a public ceremony on Sunday to mark
the international anti-drug day.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the market value of drugs destroyed by Iran in
the part two years to a total of 10 billion dollars, the mission
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lost 3,000 soldiers in the fight against drug
traffickers since 1979 while thousands of others wounded or
disabled, it said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Tehran has spent about 1 billion dollars for
establishing fortifications, digging canals, installing barbed
wires, building roads in border areas and stationing 30,000 forces
on border posts to curb cross-border drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila considers Anti-money laundering bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it may seek to include some anti-money laundering
bills for passage in the Congress when it holds its special
session on July 17.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
there are two or three bills that might be taken up in the session.
</P>
<P>
"We'll call a special session and we might include that in the
agenda. The problem with the anti-racketeering bill is that it has
been discussed for some time now," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that of the two or three bills, one has reached the
plenary discussion stage, while the others are being discussed in
their respective committees.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also said passing the bills would not be easy since some
of them are very complex, noting that it took years for the U.S.
Congress to pass its own anti-racketeering bill.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the Philippines has been black-listed by
the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, an agency of
the group of industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government disputed the reports, saying the
Philippines remains cooperative with the international community
in the fight against money laundering and other transnational
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"contrary to these reports, the Philippines subscribes to the
principles and policies against money laundering. The Philippine
government is a signatory to the Vienna Convention against money
laundering, and the Philippines has imposed rules and regulations
in support of this," Press Undersecretary Michael Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government has put in place a number of
mechanisms to ensure that this practice will not prosper.
</P>
<P>
Such mechanisms include the expanded requirements by the
Central Bank of the Philippines on foreign exchange transactions
to include specifying the identity of the parties and purpose of
the transactions.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Operate Direct Flights to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will soon operate direct
flights to Bangladesh in a bid to improve the commercial and
economic ties between the two South Asian countries, diplomats and
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They said Sri Lankan Airlines will make its inaugural flight
from Colombo to the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka on July 1.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner for Bangladesh in Sri Lanka Ashraf Ud Doula
described the flight as an important chapter between the two
member states of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC). The two countries have close economic ties, especially in
the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the decision to establish air link was made at the
highest level between the two leaders, Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
It was mooted at the 10th SAARC summit held in Maldives in 1997."
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner explained that people had to fly via
Bangkok, New Delhi or Singapore to get to Dhaka over at least
eight hours. But with the new air link it will take only three and
a half hours to reach Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Bangladeshi Airlines will not fly to
Colombo in the near future due to shortage of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The new air link is expected to be commercially viable for the
Sri Lanka Airlines, according to the airline officials.
</P>
<P>
They said it will also enable Sri Lankan pilgrims to reach
Nepal without delay. It takes only 45 minutes to fly to Nepal from
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Victor Abeysekara, corporate communication manager of Sri
Lankan Airlines, said that the airline will operate weekly flights
to Dhaka on Mondays and Saturdays.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Province Under Dengue Alert Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The northern Philippine province of
Pangasinan has been placed under alert status following an initial
outbreak of dengue fever in two cities and two towns of the
province.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Provincial Health Office showed the disease
has killed five persons in the cities of Dagupan and San Carlos,
and in the towns of Calasiao and Malasiqui.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Health Officer Alyle Orchotorena said although the
situation has not yet reached alarming proportion, her office has
intensified its education and information drive, fogging operation
and environmental cleanup.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, which raged in Pangasinan last year, is being
transmitted to humans by a mosquito called Aedis Aegypti that
attacks at daytime or any other ordinary mosquito that carries the
dengue virus which it gets from a person afflicted with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
This kind of mosquito is prevalent during the rainy season and
breeds in stagnant pools of water.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of the disease are high fever, vomiting, drowsiness,
difficulty of breathing and the bleeding of nostrils, gums and
internal organs which eventually result in death.

wanted the election to be transparent and fair.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to send psychologist to Jolo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government will soon
send a psychologist to Jolo, the southern Philippines, to provide
mental health-related services to the 21 hostages held by the Abu
Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The plan was disclosed by the Foreign Ministry regional office
in the southern city of Zamboanga, which said the plan was relayed
to the Philippine government by the Malaysian embassy in Manila in
a letter dated June 14, the Philippine News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted regional office spokesperson Condy Cabaquit
as saying that Malaysian psychologist Mohd Daud Dalip will join
the other members of a Malaysian Red Crescent Team which has
remained in Jolo since June 9.
</P>
<P>
The office reportedly requested the assistance of the Southern
Command, through the Department of National Defense, to provide
the necessary security and facilitate the travel clearance for Dr.
Dalip and the other members of the Red Crescent for their trip to
Jolo, where the hostages were held by the Muslim extremist group.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that many of the hostages are suffering severe
psychological stress and some even have threatened suicide as the
hostage crisis entered its fourth month.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages -- nine Malaysians, three Germans, two French
Nationals, two Finns, two South Africans, two Filipinos and a
Lebanese-- were abducted from the Malaysian resort of Sipadan and
taken to Jolo island in Sulu on April 23.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government negotiating team has had only one formal
meeting with the Abu Sayyaf, which took place on May 27. The rebel
group has repeatedly raised new demands for the release of its
captives. Its demands include the creation of an independent
Islamic state in Mindanao, a total ban on commercial fishing in
the Sulu Sea, and a ransom of one million U.S. dollars for each of
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Philippine National Police Chief Panfilo Lacson said earlier
that the case is a simple kidnap for ransom operation and the Abu
Sayyaf's political demands are just being used to camouflage their
real intention.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House, by a margin of 215 to 183, voted Friday to

vigorously opposed by House Republican leaders.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A U.S. federal appeals court in Atlanta Friday refused to
reconsider its denial of a political asylum hearing for Elian
Gonzalez, and told his Miami relatives that only the U.S. Supreme
Court could now prevent his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Vladimir Putin's plan to reshape the
government took an important step forward Friday when the lower
house of parliament endorsed major changes in the makeup of the
upper chamber that will enhance the Kremlin's power.

The economic structure in the west should be adjusted, and the
non-govermental economy there should grow at a faster rate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given to solving the problem of water
shortages in the west in the construction of basic facilities.
Efforts should also be made to improve the environment, control
the increase of population, and train and attract talented people
to the area, especially high-quality managers, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
"We should pay attention to local religions, border security
and social stability, said Ye, who also called for intensified
efforts in terms of law construction and supervision mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenyuan, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and
the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society, noted that the
strategy of developing western China should be carried out in a
planned and systematic manner.
</P>
<P>
He said that both eastern and western China should use their
own advantages to promote common development, and western China
should take more measures to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC's duty is to hold consultations and discussions, make
comments, raise proposals and exercise democratic supervision. It
certainly has a role to play in the strategy of developing the
west, said Ye.
</P>

The participants in the meeting included leaders of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the State Council and

<HEADLINE> Overseas Funds Boost China's Building Materials Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China has so far introduced over
five billion U.S. dollars in overseas funds into its building
materials industry, and is trying to attract even more to
stimulate the sector.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds will be mainly used to produce new building
materials, inorganic non-metallic materials, and equipment to
manufacture building materials, according to Liu Jingzhou, deputy
head of the Building Materials Branch of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the State Administration of the
Building Materials Industry is asking overseas enterprises
involved to strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations, and
take account of the needs of and advice offered by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the use of overseas funds should take the
industry's product-mix readjustment and environmental protection
into consideration. All overseas-funded projects must meet
international environmental protection standards.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that funds will be introduced mainly for the
production of cement, glass and ceramics. The country is
encouraging the construction of large cement projects and
technology upgrading in small cement plants. In sanitary ceramics
production, the focus will be on improving product quality, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce More Cement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's annual demand for cement
will reach 648 million tons in the next three years, an increase
of 9.04 percent. This is expected to be a shot in the arm for
Chinese cement enterprises, which are now suffering a slump.
</P>
<P>
The rise in demand is said to be due to an increase in state
investment in the infrastructure sector, according to the State
Administration of the Building Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>
China will invest 750 billion U.S. dollars in developing
infrastructure in the next three years, with the annual growth
rate of fixed assets investment topping 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The investment will mainly go to the transportation sector,
residential housing, irrigation works and water conservancy
facilities. These construction projects will naturally need a
large amount of cement.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build more than 4,000 km of expressways, which
will also boost the demand for high-quality cement.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the 10th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee have voiced
their support for the central government's strategy to develop
western China.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and a
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, attended the
meeting, which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegates said that a report presented by Vice-Premier Li

to carry out the strategy. The report focused on the basic
situation of regional development in China, the importance of the
western China development plan, and new ideas and mechanisms for
carrying out the strategy.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of developing western China is of great
significance in achieving China's modernization, making all the
people of China prosperous, promoting national unity and ensuring
national security, said Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
"We should broaden our minds, and adopt a practical and

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- "Where is your PR (Public
Relations) plan?" and "Which PR firm do you use?"
</P>
<P>
These are two of the most common questions asked by a venture
capitalist when approached by a website company for support.
</P>
<P>
Such questions are spreading fast in China, too.
</P>
<P>
Internet, the new economy and China's pending accession to the
World Trade Organization are dramatically reshaping the landscape
for the country's young PR industry, and thus become the most
frequently uttered keywords at the China International PR Congress,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"China's PR industry, which grew from nothing 20 years ago to
a prestigious profession officially recognized today, is going to
enter a new era with challenges and opportunities posed by the WTO
and the Internet," said Li Daoyu, president of the China
International PR Association.
</P>
<P>
World Internet leaders like Yahoo, eBay and AOL have, in just a
few years, established their name brands, which win the same
recognition and respect from customers as Coca-Cola, which spent
100 years publicizing its name brand, said Carolyn Fazio,
president of the International PR Association, which has 78 member
countries.
</P>
<P>
PR work has played a significant role in the promotion of
Internet leaders, and this should serve as an example for China
too, she said.

Statistics show that the number of Internet users in China
skyrocketed from 2.1 million in 1998 to 8.9 million last year, and
is expected to reach 85 million in five years, which means China
will replace Japan as "the most wired country" in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The Internet age is having a ground-breaking impact on the
dissemination of information, and PR people will play an
irreplaceable role in organizing, analyzing and spreading
information, said Wang Zhiwen, general manager of the China Global
PR Co., China's first national enterprise specializing in public
relations services.
</P>
<P>
"China's PR industry needs to foster more high-quality
professionals to fulfill its role and standardize its professional
practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
His concern was echoed in a draft "Declaration of China's PR
Industry in the New Century" tabled at the congress for adoption,
which calls for PR people, when serving Internet-related clients,
to "take full advantage of modern media and network technology, to
readjust and innovate the means of PR communications and
management."
</P>
<P>
The draft also urged PR companies to draw lessons from the
experiences of other countries, conscientiously study the local
market, and reinforce the self-discipline of the profession and
business ethics.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 scholars, PR professionals and government
officials are attending the congress, which will last two days.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- There is no party which has gained any benefit from the
crisis that took place between the three ruling coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Motherland Party (ANAP), Mesut Yilmaz, was
acquitted of a corruption charge after a parliament vote Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
The danger of a government crisis was thus averted, but a
confidence rift may have taken root in the 57th coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Devlet Bahceli, deputy prime minister and chairman of the
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), did not attend the vote. However,
other MHP deputies voted in favor of sending Yilmaz to the Supreme
Court to face accusations of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, during his first visit to the
Turkish Cypriots-controlled area in northern Cyprus, lashed out at
what he termed as the "uncompromising attitude" of the Greek
Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
"Distorted mentality of the Greek Cypriots prevented the
solution while the solution was so obvious," he claimed. "As long
as the Greek Cypriot side continues to see themselves as the sole
owner of the island and regard Turkish Cypriots as minority, no
solution will emerge."
</P>
<P>
Sezer declared that "the only solution is a confederation of two
states."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- While the Turkish people expect the government to complete
the necessary amendments immediately in order to accelerate
Turkey's European Union accession process, the National Security
Council (MGK) is reportedly lukewarm over such legal amendments
that constitute part of the process.
</P>
<P>
The MGK reportedly felt disturbed by the preparations over the
amendments regarding human rights and issues involving the Kurdish
minority in southeast Turkey.

<P>
KAMPALA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has 18.4 percent of
adolescents suffering from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), a
study shows.
</P>
<P>
The study launched by Gender Minister Janat Mukwaya here has
found STDs more common among girls than boys, the New Vision daily
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The research team led by Professor James Ntozi, a population
expert at the Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics,
Makerere University, blamed the high rates of STDs on rampant
loose sex among the adolescents.
</P>
<P>
Mukwaya directed ministry officials to revise the budget to
cater for programs to reduce loose sex among adolescents, and
brief the Parliament on the findings.
</P>
<P>
"This is a national catastrophe, it needs urgent attention,"
Mukwaya was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by the United Nations Population Fund and the
 government, covered 2,483 adolescents in some districts of
Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is looking for
donors for the construction of a new airport in its designated new
capital of Dodoma in the center of the country, local newspapers
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new airport at Msalato area, about 10 kilometers east of
Dodoam, will be of a standard commensurate with the new capital
and safer than the present airport that is at the heart of the
municipality.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Communications and Transport Maua Daftari
told a budget session of the National Assembly in Dodoma that her
ministry is working on survey plans and laying beacons at the site
for the purpose of acquiring a title deed.
</P>
<P>
She said that Dodoma residents had invaded the land near the
present airport for the construction of houses, creating
insecurity to aircraft, passengers as well as residents during
landing and takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has reaffirmed many times that it is
determined to move the capital to the central city of Dodoma, 450
kilometers west of the present capital of Dar es Salaam, though it
is backward in social services.
</P>
<P>
With its economy reviving slowly, Tanzania invites donor
nations and agencies to fund the construction of Dodoma as a
national development project.
</P>
<P>
So far only the newly established Ministry of Local Governments
and Regional Administration, the headquarters of the parliament
and the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party had moved to Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Sitting at the heart of Tanzania at an altitude of 1,133 meters
above sea level, Dodoma has been designated as the new capital
since Tanzania got independence in early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Dodoma, formerly a small settlement of the Wa-Gogo Tribe, is
also a major stop of the Central Railway Line.

<HEADLINE> New Narcotics Control, Rehabilitation Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- As the International Day Against
Drug Abuse and Trafficking approaches, a narcotics control and
rehabilitation center has formally gone into operation in China.
</P>
<P>
Located in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, or some 40 km from
Beijing, the North China Narcotics Control and Rehabilitation
Center is financed by a farmer-turned-entrepreneur to the tune of
30 million yuan (about 3.61 million U.S. dollars). It covers an
area of ten ha, and capable of accommodating about 1,000 people.
The center is considered the largest private establishment of its
kind on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Guohua, the investor and head of the center,
the facility employs 60 medical workers, including a number of
professors and drug control experts.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to let more people to know about the harm
drugs do, and help more drug addicts give up the habit," Liu said,
explaining the motivation behind the setting up of the center.
</P>
<P>
Liu said he was saddened to learn that one of his best friends
had become addicted to drugs, which led to the breakup of the
friend's family. Liu financed his friend's treatment at a
narcotics control and rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
Before the formal operation of the center, medical workers
there had applied traditional Chinese and Western medicine to
treat more than 2,000 drug addicts, and had achieved encouraging
results, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
China was the biggest victim of the opium trade during the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911). Drug abuse was virtually wiped out in the
early years after the People's Republic of China was founded in
1949. However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, drug abuse
staged a comeback on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, the number of registered drug addicts on the mainland
amounted to 680,000, of whom 90 percent were young people below
the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have been sparing no efforts,
including the waging of publicity activities such as "treasure
your life by keeping away from narcotics," to warn young people of
the dangers and pitfalls of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the United Nations designated June 26 as the annual "
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Trafficking."

XINING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A rescue team went to the Hoh Xil
Nature Reserve in northwest China's Qinghai Province today to
search for an anti-poaching patrol trapped in the reserve's vast "
no-man's land" since June 18.
</P>
<P>
A truck carrying petrol, medicine, food and automobile spare
parts has already been dispatched to the reserve.
</P>
<P>
The rescue team includes seven reporters from Beijing, Shanghai

</P>
<P>
The 13-member anti-poaching squad got trapped when its vehicle
broke down and ran out of fuel at the juncture of Qinghai Province,
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous
Region, an area where the poaching of Tibetan antelopes is rampant.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Obtains Record Gross Shipping Register Tonnage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This puts us within reach of the 10 million gross registered
tonnage target set by the Financial Secretary in his 1999-2000
budget speech," Marine Department Director Tsui Shung-yiu said in
an article carried by the latest issue of Hong Kong Maritime News
journal.
</P>
<P>
Tsui said that Hong Kong has always had the enviable reputation
of being one of the best shipping centers in the world, a position
that the department has worked hard to maintain ever since the
Hong Kong Shipping Register was formed more than 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"More ships joining our shipping register will benefit not only
our shipping industry but also the local economy since this will
mean more business opportunities for local companies in insurance,
banking, legal and other types of support services that are
instrumental to this industry," the director said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis meant that many investors were being
careful with their budgets, but investor confidence had returned
to Hong Kong as people realized that the "one country two systems"
policy was running smoothly and efficiently, Tsui said.
</P>
<P>
"We lowered the first time registration fee by 85 percent, and
the Marine Department has also streamlined its administration
procedures allowing ships to be registered in just four hours,"
Tsui added.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of Flag State Quality Control system,
the Port State Control detention of Hong Kong registered ships has
declined from 16 in 1998 to 10 in 1999, an improvement of almost
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We already have the hardware in place in terms of the port and
terminals, which are well established and looked after by private
enterprise but there is definitely more we can do with our
software by providing more support services," the director noted.
</P>
<P>
"All of these initiatives are part of our continuous program to
show the industry that Hong Kong is leading the way in world
shipping," Tsui concluded.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 11 Injured in Delhi Mob Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mob attacked the Yamuna Pushta Police Post, burnt police
cars and rescued from police detention a man suspected to be in
connection with the recent twin blasts in the Indian capital, the
PTI quoted Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Mukund Upadhye as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The blasts, which occurred last Sunday at a bus stand near the
historical site of Red Fort, killed two persons and wounded a
dozen.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Ishaq Mullah, who was apprehended on Friday night
from a makeshift store opposite a mosque in north Delhi, was under
police questioning on Saturday morning when an armed mob pelted
stones on and ransacked the police post and finally rescued him,
the deputy commissioner told the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The police first fired at least 15 rounds of tear gas shells
and were later forced to fire eight rounds of gunshots after two
gunshots were fired by the crowd, Upadhye added.
</P>
<P>
One person's body was found on the scene later, Upadhye said,
adding that it was not immediately clear whether he died in the
police firing or in the clash between the mob and the police.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one people, most of them Bangladeshi nationals, have so
far been arrested on charges of rioting and preventing public
servants from performing their duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Three companies of police force were deployed in the riot area
to prevent any further incidents, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the local police have identified the people
who led the mob and have launched a manhunt to nab them.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Tribunal for Rwanda to Hold Eighth Plenary Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) will hold its eighth plenary session in
Tanzanian northern town of Arusha next week, sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The session will be followed by the hearing of an appeal by
former Rwandan prime minister Jean Kambanda who was sentenced to
life imprisonment on September 4, 1998 after pleading guilty to
all charges including genocide and conspiracy to commit genocide.
</P>
<P>
The nine judges of the ICTR and the five Appeals Court judges
who are based in the Hague, Netherlands will review the changes of
the Tribunal's rules made at an extraordinary plenary in February
this year to speed up judicial proceedings on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After the session, the Appeals Court will hear the appeal of
Kambanda who is now asking to retract his guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda's Dutch lawyer Tjarda Eduard van der Spoel claimed
that the ICTR was legally wrong to accept the validity of the
accord in which Kambanda agreed to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
He said the tribunal should not have done so without
investigating "the fact that the guilty plea was not voluntary,
and or was ill-informed and or was not explicit".
</P>
<P>
The defense is asking the Appeals Court to annul the guilty
verdict and order a new trial.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda was prime minister of the interim government that
presided over the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
His guilty plea became a cornerstone of prosecution strategy to
show that the genocide was planned and that other political
leaders at the time should be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR, created on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations
Security Council resolution 955, has the mandate to try persons
suspected to be responsible for genocide and other serious
violations of the international humanitarian law committed in the
territory of Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible for
such violations committed in the territory of neighboring states
during the 100- day massacre which claimed more than 800,000
civilians mostly the ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 29 indictments against 50
individuals, and a total of 44 indicted individuals are in custody
including several former senior cabinet ministers in the Interim
Government of Rwanda of 1994, former military commanders,
political leaders, journalists and senior businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The five detainees who have already been convicted by the Trial
Chambers of the Tribunal are still held in Arusha, pending outcome
of their appeals, but are kept apart from the other detainees to
whom the presumption of innocence applies.
</P>
<P>
Three of the convicts including Kambanda have been sentenced to
 imprisonment for life.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen Obed Ruzindana and Omar Serushago were sentenced to
25 years and 15 years of imprisonment respectively.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Becomes Arbitration Capital of Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its empathy with traditional mediation skills and blending the
best service providers from the East and West have turned Hong
Kong into the prime center in Asia for all arbitration matters,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has long been the international maritime capital of
Asia not only because of its excellent location supported by world-
class communications, transport and financial services, but
coupled with an enormous pool of experienced professionals in
shipping affairs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1985 by a consortium of leading businessmen and
professionals, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center has
since developed to become the focus for Asian dispute resolution,
offering a free information service together with a wide range of
literature relating to arbitration, and last year oversaw 257
cases.
</P>
<P>
With the growing popularity of using arbitration to resolve
international disputes, the center has adopted two new procedures
to assist parties with their maritime related difference,
according to the Marine Department.
</P>
<P>
One procedure relates to "Documents Only" disputes while the
other for "Small Claims," a procedure more suitable for use in
arbitration where neither the claim nor counterclaim exceeds the
sum of 50,000 U.S. dollars, the department said.

<HEADLINE> MILF to Study Government's Conditions for Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF disclosed Saturday that it had received five conditions
presented by the Philippine government for the extension of the
June 30 deadline for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu said that the MILF leadership could
not submit its comment yet, as the matter has to be discussed
first by its leaders, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The conditions set by the government, according to the report,
provide that the government and MILF come into an agreement on the
expanded autonomy in exchange for the MILF bid for an independent
Islamic state in Mindanao in the south.
</P>
<P>
The conditions also stipulate that the government stop military
actions against the MILF and implement an accord on the general
cessation of hostilities signed between the government and the
MILF in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the MILF is asked to condemn all its terroristic
activities, and negotiation panels from the two side are to
reconvene on 29 July to pursue the talks outside Philippine
territory.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who had earlier
set a deadline on June 30 for a peace deal with the MILF, put
forth three conditions for it: abandon its bid for independence,
stop terroristic activities and lay down its arms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said in
a radio interview here that informal talks between the government
and the MILF are going on.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said that back-channel talks would continue in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, where the government and MILF representatives
would attend the ministerial meeting of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) on June 27-29.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has been fighting for the creation of an
independent Islamic state in southern Philippines for two decades,
is lobbying for an observer status before the OIC meeting.

SINGAPORE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has given an impetus
to the development of life sciences industry by forming a
ministerial committee as well an executive committee to provide
leadership and coordination and setting forth its main development
thrusts.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo told a
press conference Saturday that the Life Sciences Executive
Committee was officially established this morning to assist the
Ministerial Committee which will be established under the
chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan with the ministers
of Health, Education and Trade &AMP; Industry as its members.

multi-disciplinary research programs and multi-institutional
collaboration cutting across the various disciplines after having
already funded several research programs in molecular biology,
bioinformatics and clinical medicine.
</P>
<P>
He announced the launch of the Singapore Genomics Program, a
national initiative to spearhead research into human genomics,
with particular focus on generating data reflective of the diverse
ethnic composition in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to industry development, George Yeo said that it is
critical to have a good combination of public and private R&AMP;D
funding for the industry and the private R&AMP;D tends to be more
focused because of its commercial orientation.
</P>
<P>
"We must encourage private sector R&AMP;D to be done here
especially by world-class Life sciences companies," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Singapore targets to build the life sciences into the fourth
pillar of its manufacturing sector to achieve the same level of
success as the other three pillars of electronics, chemicals and
engineering. Life sciences output hit 9.4 billion Singapore
dollars (about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, accounting for
17 percent of the total manufacturing of value-added and
representing 61 percent growth over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Economic Development Board plans to spend one billion
Singapore dollars over the next five years to develop life
sciences with 600 million Singapore dollars (about 350 million U.S.
dollars) on 245 life sciences scholarships in a bid to pave the
road for life sciences.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Furniture Industry Facing Labor Supply Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's furniture industry
is facing a number of uncertainties such as labour supply, the
Malaysian Furniture Industry Council (MFIC) President Anthony Yap
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The labour issue has turned out to be a pressing matter for
MFIC members as the current contracts of the foreign workers they
engage are due to expire and are not renewable while new
applications have yet to be approved, he told reporters after MFIC
' annual general meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the government to consider extending the terms of
the current foreign workers nearing expiry, he said MFIC feels
that failure to address the issue quickly could restrict the
industry's vast potential.
</P>
<P>
Dependency on foreign labour is inevitable as locals are not
attracted to work in the furniture industry, he said, adding the
locals perceive the furniture industry as unconducive.
</P>
<P>
The immediate requirement in the furniture industry is
estimated at 15,000 new workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The industry is growing every year and when it is expanding,
we need labour. If we don't have continued labour supply, how are
we going to get to the target of achieving 7 billion ringgit (1.84
billion U.S. dollars) in export sales by 2005," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia earned 4.9 billion ringgit (1.28 billion U.S. dollars)
in furniture exports last year and targets to earn about 5.5
billion ringgit 1.44 billion U.S.dollars) this year.

<HEADLINE> OIC Members Urged to Increase Cooperation in R&AMP;D </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) has been urged to increase cooperation
in research and development (R&AMP;D).
</P>
<P>
The 27th Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers (ICFM)
beginning here next Tuesday should discuss how the Islamic nations
can increase cooperation in the R&AMP;D field, Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Saturday when opening the
International Seminar on the Islamic Approach to
Institutionalizing R&AMP;D Culture here.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps with the OIC foreign ministers meeting, we can take
advantage from this and the Malaysian delegation could put forward
proposals on how we could bring together Muslim scientists to
improve the R&AMP;D," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the OIC should not just confine its discussions to the
traditional agenda of the plight, poverty and political issues
surrounding the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
It could also look into the scope of cooperation in R&AMP;D among
member countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Muslim countries have not made much progress in R&AMP;
D and it is time they look into ways of increasing it.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important for Muslim countries to acquire
knowledge to improve their well-being so that they could pull
themselves away from being dependent on the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He said as for Malaysia, since independence, the country has
given priority to R&AMP;D in various fields including the production
of rubber and palm oil which has contributed to the country's
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Capital to Meet Long Period of Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Kenya's capital
Nairobi will have to brace themselves up for a long period of
water shortage, Nairobi Town Clerk Godfrey Mate has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Saturday quoted the clerk as saying
this is due to the prolonged dry spell, which has resulted in a
drastic reduction of water levels in the reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press here Friday, Mate said the water levels
were too low, making it difficult for it to be pumped, adding that
it had become necessary to ration the little water available in
the reservoirs to enable it to sustain the town for the days to
come.
</P>
<P>
"Nairobi residents should understand that we have to use the
little water available with a lot of caution to avoid a serious
crisis," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He noted that disconnection of illegal water connection had
already begun, saying his council would try its best to supply
water to all city residents.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is experiencing a long-spell drought due to the failure
of the October-December short rains last year and the March-May
long rains this year.

<HEADLINE> SADC Mining Ministers Meet In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Ministers responsible for mining
operations in the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
have gathered here to discuss ways of resolving problems gripping
the sector in the region.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference for SADC ministers Friday, Zimbabwean
Minister of Mines, Environment and Tourism Simon Moyo said SADC
governments recognized the contributions of the mining sector to
rural development, foreign currency generation and employment
creation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "While there was a gradual recovery in some mineral
commodity prices in 1999, the same could not be said of gold,
which experienced declines largely due to banks in the European
Union offloading gold on to the market."
</P>
<P>
He said efforts by SADC member states in terms of lobbying the
World Bank not to follow suit achieved a slight increase in the
price but large gains were still required in order to ensure that
the gold mining industry did not decline significantly in the
short to medium-term.
</P>
<P>
The problems affecting the mining sector have been exacerbated
by poor macro-economic fundamentals in some countries, resulting
in increased operating costs and reduced profit margins, forcing a
number of marginal mines to close with the consequent reduction of
labor and contribution to the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said, "In order to minimize the impacts of the problems,
the fiscal regimes of our mining sectors need to be continuously
reviewed. We in Zimbabwe are currently reviewing our fiscal
regime in order to adequately cater for the industry and ensure
an acceptable return for investors in the mining industry."

<HEADLINE> 828 Tanzanians Commit Suicide in 15 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 828 Tanzanians
had committed suicide between January 1999 and March 2000,
according to a senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Minister for Home Affairs John Mgeja addressed the
National Assembly in the central town of Dodoma Friday that out of
these cases, men were 605 and women were 223, local newspapers
reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The victims died by either by overdosing themselves with drugs
or hanging themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mgeja said that 93 people made attempts to end their lives
without success, 56 of whom were male and 37 female in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the cases to problems that the victims felt they
could not handle like frustration and a feeling of hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
Mgeja explained that to attempt suicide was a criminal offence
and most of the offenders were given suspended sentences.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon persons facing serious psychological problems to
consult experts for counselling instead of hanging themselves.
Counselling restores a person's self-confidence and the ability to
cope with problems," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and

Echoing the same sentiment in his message to Jiang, President
Tito said that Kiribati is "equally committed" to continuing to
work cooperatively with the Chinese government in the New
Millennium in further promoting the bilateral relations and
cooperation.

The Kiribati president said, "On looking back on the 20 years
that our countries have entered into diplomatic relations, I am
pleased to note that such relations have progressed constructively.
"
</P>
<P>
Tito expressed appreciation over China's assistance and support
to Kiribati over the past 20 years, which have "contributed
meaningfully" to the improved livelihood of the Kiribati people.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country remains committed to the principle
embodied in the Communique on the establishment of diplomatic

<HEADLINE> Renewed Fighting Threatens Solomons Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Renewed fighting between elements
of the ethnic militias in the Solomon Islands has placed the peace
process in jeopardy, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There have been clashes in Marau Sound, on the far eastern tip
of the country's Guadalcanal Island, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted spokesman for the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF)
Andrew Nori as saying that two units of the MEF went ashore last
Wednesday to retake the government station at Manikaraku in Marau
Sound.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM) had moved one
hundred men into the station the day before.
</P>
<P>
He described Manikaraku as being under the MEF protective net
and claimed the IFM action amounted to an act of war.
</P>
<P>
Nori also claimed that there has been fierce fighting and that
the ceasefire talks that were supposed to be held Sunday on board
Australian navy's HMAS Tobruk may have to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who is in the
Solomons' capital Honiara, hoped to meet Nori Saturday afternoon,
the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Downer told reporters soon after arriving in the Solomons he
was keen to meet all sides.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to having discussions with a range of
different people, from the governor-general to some of the
different parties to this dispute here in the Solomon Islands," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We just hope that the progress that has been made over the
last week continues over the next few days," Downer said.

<HEADLINE> EU Mission Happy With Zimbabwe's Preparations for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) election
observer mission to Zimbabwe said on Friday it was satisfied with
preparations for the country's two-day parliamentary elections
beginning from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the EU observer mission Pierre Schori said he was
confident that his team of observers, working hand-in-hand with
other foreign observers and local monitors, will cover all
polling stations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 4,000 polling stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Schori told reporters at a press conference here that 305
foreign observers had been accredited for the elections and these
would follow the procedure all the way, adding that some "may
sleep next to the ballot box if it is necessary".
</P>
<P>
Resisting pressure by foreign reporters at the press conference
to declare that the elections will not be free and fair, he said
he would not comment on the elections before they are held.
</P>
<P>
He would only issue a preliminary report on Sunday evening and
a final report a week after the elections.
</P>
<P>
Schori said members of his team had been free to move around
since they arrived in the country early this month, but condemned
political violence which claimed close to 30 lives during the
run-up to the elections, saying this had no place in a democratic
society.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Drugs Tariffs to be Removed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is to remove
all tariffs and taxes on the importation of malaria drugs and
equipment, Deputy Health Minister Ernest Mwansa has said.
</P>
<P>
The government would remove all obstacles to accessing cost
effective interventions for malaria because the disease had
exerted a negative impact on the social economic development of
the country, Mwansa was quoted by Saturday's Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks here on Friday when he received malaria
equipment donated by the Japanese government whose aim is to
accelerate integrated malaria activities at the district level.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Ambassador to Zambia Yoshihiro Nakamura said the lack
of proper equipment to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment
of malaria had led to an increase in the number of reported
malaria cases.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while there were 121.5 cases of malaria for every
1,000 people in 1975, the figures had increased to 331.1 for every
1,000 cases by 1999 in the country.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that the initiative taken by the Zambian
government to prevent malaria would only succeed if it continued
to collaborate with its cooperating partners.

<HEADLINE> Boat Capsizing -- Liability Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The major boat capsizing on upper
reaches of the Yangtze River in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
Thursday was a liability accident, an investigation concluded.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinxiang, vice governor of Sichuan and also head of an
investigation group for the accident, told Xinhua that overloading,
venturing out in spite of a dense fog, and the captain's improper
operations were the main factors behind the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The accident also revealed the ineffectiveness of relevant
local departments in supervising safety, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the boat, with a loading capacity of 101
persons, was actually carrying 221 people, mostly farmers from
nearby villages. Of the 221 people, 120 are males and 101 are
females, including 19 children.
</P>
<P>
And rescuers recovered 17 bodies, a total of 114 people were
still missing, and only 90 people had been rescued from the river.
The search for the missing is still going on, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Three people, including Liang Rubing, owner of the boat, and
captain Zhou Shoujin, were all detained by local police.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Liu Shaoyou, a private boat owner,
was detained by the police today for not trying to save anyone at
the time when the boat capsized. Liu was plying his boat, running
away.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a 15-day detention, Liu was also revoked of his
boat operation license and was given a fine of 4,500 yuan (about
540 U.S. dollars) by the local port supervisory department.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Hostage Talks End in Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's hostage talks ended in
deadlock on Saturday but a military official said a new attempt to
reach agreement would start on Sunday afternoon, the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted military spokesman Filipo Tarakinikini as saying
that talks on the release of 31 hostages held in parliament by
George Speight's coup plotters had stalled over the issue of the
future presidency of the country.
</P>
<P>
He would not discuss the matter further, saying only that talks
would continue on Sunday, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Private secretary to former Vice President Ratu Josefa Iliolio,
Suliano Turagabeu said: "We are still working on the accord, we
haven't reached a final decision. We hope a final decision will be
agreed on tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was a deadlock, he said, "You could call it that.
"
</P>
<P>
All that is known of the agreement is its name, the Muanikau
Accord, and that the coup plotters have warned it will not result
in the immediate release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The military and Speight had been scheduled to sign an
agreement Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
But Tarakinikini said earlier that Saturday morning's meeting
with the coup leader would go ahead, but they would now only
review the draft accord.
</P>
<P>
He also said he could not say when a definitive agreement will
be signed.
</P>
<P>
Speight and his gunmen have held Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and his cabinet hostage since seizing Fiji's parliament
on May 19.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State Leaves Seoul for Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright left here for Poland Saturday, winding up her two-day
visit to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Before her departure, Albright met South Korean Unification
Minister Park Jae-kyu who briefed her in detail on last week's
inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Albright and South Korean Foreign Affairs
and Trade Minister Lee Joung-binn discussed issues on the summit
and cooperation in Korean peninsula affairs following the summit.
</P>
<P>
During their discussions, the two sides reconfirmed the vital
role of U.S. Korea Forces, sharing the view that any discussion of
the withdrawal or reduction of the 37,000 U.S. forces in Korea is
premature and inappropriate for regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Albright hoped agreements, reached between Seoul and Pyongyang,
like the reunion of the separated families, will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will do everything to make the agreement
between the two Koreas carried out," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, she also said "although the outcome of the recent
inter-Korean summit is hopeful and its outlook is also bright, all
problems are not resolved yet."
</P>
<P>
On the National Missile Defense system the U.S. government is
pushing, she claimed although the DPRK recently reconfirmed its
moratorium on missile launching tests, all problems related to the
DPRK are not resolved.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, South Korea President Kim Dae-jung met the U.S.
secretary, stressing that cooperation among South Korea, the
United States and Japan played a great role in making the summit
successful.
</P>
<P>
Close cooperation between Seoul and Washington should be
continuously maintained to establish peace on the Korean peninsula
and develop inter-Korean relations, the South Korean president
said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Hails S.Korea's Decision on Zero-Tariff Access for LDCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh hailed South Korea's
decision on granting zero-tariff access of 80 items from 48 least-
developed countries, including Bangladesh, The Independent
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Korean decision would help reduce the
existing trade imbalance, an official in the Export Promotion
Bureau (EPB) said the new facility should increase Bangladeshi
exports to Korean market.
</P>
<P>
"It totally depends on quality of Bangladeshi products which
lag behind very much," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said out of the total 80 items, Bangladesh would be able to
introduce only 10 new ones in the export basket to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Bangladesh's GSP (Generalized System of
Preferences) facility with 28 other countries, the EPB official
said those who give these facilities would never compromise on
quality because they have to ensure the right products to their
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"We have opportunities but we are lacking in its utilization
due to the quality of our products," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the United News of Bangladesh report, the facility
has been made effective retrospectively from January 1, 2000.
Under the Korean decision, products eligible for preferential
tariffs should be wholly produced or obtained in the exporting
country.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit between Bangladesh and Korea during the last
fiscal year (1998-1999) was 275.66 million U.S. dollars.
Bangladesh's exports worth only 10.99 million dollars, while
imported products worth about 286.65 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Welcomes US Court Ruling on Elian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government cautiously
welcomed a U.S. court ruling on Friday that rejected a request by
Elian Gonzalez's relatives for a rehearing of the case and urged
its citizens to keep up a nationwide campaign to bring the boy
home.
</P>
<P>
"The Atlanta court ruling is favorable for Elian and his
family," said a government statement broadcast on state television.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, a 12-member appeals court in Atlanta ruled
unanimously that it would not look at the case again and the order
barring the departure of the six-year-old Cuban boy and his father
will be lifted at 4 p.m. Wednesday and it will not grant any
further motions for their stay.
</P>
<P>
"Any further request for stays or for injunctive relief should
be directed to the Supreme Court," said the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
Elian's relatives in Miami and their ultra-right supporters in
the United States were certain to use the five days granted them
to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to delay and obstruct
Elian's return to Cuba, said the Cuban government statement.
</P>
<P>
"For that reason it is our elemental duty to continue the
struggle with more force and intensity than ever," it said.
</P>
<P>
A rally of 400,000 people has been scheduled for Sunday in the
eastern city of Holguin. The statement announced that rally would
go on.
</P>
<P>
Even when Elian finally returns to Cuba, the nation will
maintain its patriotic campaign to seek an end to U.S. hostile
immigration and sanction policies toward the island, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a migrant boat disaster last November in
which his mother and 10 others died, has been in the United States
after he was picked up by a fisherman off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
His father Juan Miguel Gonzalez wants to take his son back to
Cuba, but his relatives have been trying to prevent Elian from
being sent back to Cuba with the help of many anti-Cuba people in
Miami, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The relatives cared for Elian until he was seized from their
home on April 22 in a government raid and reunited in Washington
with his father.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government insists that Elian's tragedy resulted from
the U.S. immigration policy for Cubans and the long-running U.S.
economic embargo against Cuba. It has staged a seven-month
patriotic campaign of marches, rallies and TV programs to demand
the return of Elian to the Caribbean island.

To refute the prattling of the Dalai Lama clique that "Tibetan
Culture has become extinct," the Information Office of the State
Council released a White Paper on "The Development of Tibetan
Culture".
</P>
<P>
Detailing numerous facts and figures, the White Paper, which
runs in 12,000 Chinese characters, said that over the past four
decades and more, Tibet has made big headway in carrying forward
the fine aspects of its traditional culture, while maintaining
Tibetan cultural traits, and exposed the true political colors of
the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1959 Democratic Reform, Tibet was a local regime
practicing a system of feudal serfdom under a theocracy, and ruled
by a few upper-class monks and nobles, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper explained that throughout this period, a handful of
upper-class lamas and aristocrats monopolized the means of
production, culture and education and cultural and artistic
pursuits were regarded as their exclusive amusements, while the
serfs and slaves, who constituted 95 percent of the Tibetan
population, lived in extreme poverty and were not guaranteed even
the basic right of subsistence, let alone the right to enjoy
culture and education.

<HEADLINE> Military Expects to End Mindanao Conflict Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the Philippine
hopes to achieve all its objectives against the secessionist Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) this week, The Daily Tribune
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have overrun all MILF satellite camps. We expect military
operations to be almost complete within two to three days," armed
forces Chief of Staff Gen. Angelo Reyes was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the military's recent capture of Camp Rajamuda, the
MILF's second biggest base, has removed the MILF's capabilities.
Government troops are currently conducting clearing operations on
the camp.
</P>
<P>
Since late April when the military launched attacks on MILF's
encampments along the Narciso Ramos Highway in Maguindanao, the
military has seized more than 20 rebel camps in Mindanao in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Military offensives against the MILF, which has been fighting
for an independent Islamic state in Mindanao for two decades, have
reportedly caused the evacuation of at least 500,000 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Estrada, who had earlier set a deadline on
June 30 for a peace deal with the MILF, set three conditions for
it: drop its campaign for independence, stop terroristic
activities and lay down its arms.

<HEADLINE> Study Indicates Mars Has Earth-like Oceans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists reported Friday
that they had found early Martian oceans were salty.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the July issue of the Journal Meteoritics and
Planetary Science, scientists from Arizona State University and
Los Alamos National Laboratory said they came to this conclusion
after studying chunks of rock that fell from Mars to Earth as
meteorites.
</P>
<P>
A recent analysis of the 1.2 billion-year-old meteorite known
as the Nakhla Meteorite, which fell on Egypt in 1911, showed the
presence of water-soluble ions thought to have been deposited in
cracks by evaporating brine.
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that we have extracted salts that were
originally present in Martian water," said Carleton Moore, the
leading author of the paper. "The salts we found mimic the salts
in Earth's ocean fairly closely."
</P>
<P>
The only significant difference Moore found between the ionic
elements found in the Martian rock and those found in Earth ocean
water was the abundance of calcium, which was significantly higher
in the Nakhla meteorite than in sea water.
</P>
<P>
The lower calcium concentration in seawater may be due to the
mineral being removed biologically by plants, corals and shellfish,
Moore pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To Moore, the finding is interesting because it implies not
just a chemical similarity between the planets that may improve
the likelihood of finding life on Mars, but also because it
provides a window into the Earth's own past.
</P>
<P>
"There was apparently a uniformity between the planets," Moore
said. "The inference that the early Martian ocean was very similar
to our current ocean also implies that the early Earth's ocean may
have been very similar to what it is today. This is a clue to what
it might have been."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Rejects Appeal by Elian's Relatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. court rejected a request
by Elian Gonzalez's relatives Friday for a rehearing of the case,
paving the way for the Cuban boy to return to Cuba next week.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
ruled unanimously that it would not look at the case again.
</P>
<P>
"Any further requests for stays or for injunctive relief should
be directed to the Supreme Court," said the court's ruling,
written by Circuit Judge J.L. Edmondson.
</P>
<P>
The court said the order barring the departure of the six-year-
old Cuban boy and his father will be lifted at 4 p.m. (2200 GMT)
Wednesday and it will not grant any further motions for their stay.
</P>
<P>
While Elian's father expressed his relief for the ruling, a
spokesman for Elian's Miami relatives said they will file an
appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a three-judge panel ruled in favor of
Elian's father and denied a political asylum hearing for Elian as
requested by his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives appealed to the full 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta on June 15, calling for a reversal of
the decision that would allow the 6-year-old boy to return to Cuba
with his father.
</P>
<P>
A decision to grant a rehearing before the full court had to be
approved by seven of the 12 judges, but none of the 12 even asked
for a vote on the question.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez wants to take his son back
to Cuba, but his relatives have been trying to prevent him from
being sent back to Cuba with the help of many anti-Cuba people in
Miami, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a migrant boat disaster last November in
which his mother and 10 others died, has been in the United States
after he was picked up by a fisherman off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives cared for him until he was seized from
his relatives' home on April 22 in a government raid and reunited
in Washington with his father.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has
acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing," Attorney
General Janet Reno said in response.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the court has conclusively upheld our decision, I am
hopeful that this father and son will soon be able to move on with
their lives together," she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are the highlights
of major environment news stories Xinhua released from June 18 to
23:
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to inject 100 billion yuan in the
next 10 years to recover the once high vegetation coverage rate of
48 percent along the Yangtze River valley from the present 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
From the 1960s, the eco-system along the river has
deteriorated due to decreasing acreage of forests. As a result,
470 million tons of silt along the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze River has washed away annually.
</P>
<P>
China has begun construction of its largest botanical garden to
house 10,000 plant varieties bred from the more than 4,000 types
of plants in Xishuangbanna in southwestern Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
This is another major step adopted by China in protecting its
diversified biological resources. The garden will collect plant
species from tropical and subtropical zones worldwide and protect
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's Board of Executive Directors Wednesday
approved an environment loan of 349 million U.S. dollars to China
that will bring health benefits to all residents in urban Beijing
by adding facilities for air pollution control and wastewater
disposal.
</P>
<P>
The "second Beijing environment project" will beef up the city
government's effort to alleviate air and water pollution in
Beijing by converting coal-burning boilers to natural gas-burning
boilers, promote energy conservation heating system, provide
wastewater collection and treatment to the entire Liangshi River
basin.
</P>
<P>
A release from the World Bank's Resident Mission in China said
the loan is also partially supplemented by a 25-million U.S.
dollars equivalent grant from the Global Environment Facility.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has also approved a loan of 200 million U.S.
dollars to protect drinking water and provide wastewater
management services to improve the living conditions of three
million people in urban Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
According to the WB's Resident Mission in China, the Chongqing
Urban Environment Project will work to raise the quality of life
for people in southwest China's Chongqing, Fuling, Wanzhou and
Nanbin by supporting basic urban services of wastewater management.
</P>
<P>
The drinking water supplies in Chongqing and Fuling will be
protected and the water supply will be increased to cities of
Nanbin and Wanzhou, according to the WB.

Soil erosion is the most serious problem now troubling
northwest China, according to noted Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The experts, who have been doing research about the area's
environmental conditions for several years, said that soil erosion
had affected an area of 454,000 sq km in the Loess Highlands,
resulting in creeping desertification, posing a great threat to
the local economy.
</P>
<P>
There are only some 100,000 sq km of oases in 2.88 million sq
km of arid land around the inland rivers in northwest China, they
said.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to curb the deteriorating natural environment
on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the world third longest,
have paid off, satellite remote sensing studies show.
</P>
<P>
A satellite investigation of the area shows that the soil
erosion in provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, and Chongqing
Municipality has markedly eased.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, Sichuan and Chongqing, which are located in the valleys
of the Jinsha River and Jialing River, and the Three Gorges
Reservoir area respectively, suffer the most serious soil erosion,
or 90 percent of the total on the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Changchun, capital city of northeast China's Jilin Province,
this year plans to dismantle more than 100 chimneys in industrial
and heating facilities, thus reducing smoke and dust emissions by
nearly 9,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the move will also help reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions by 3,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
More than six billion yuan (about 720 million U.S. dollars)
will be used in the next ten years to protect the Chinese capital
from sandstorms, according to the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4.3 million hectares will be afforested and
protected in this region, according to a State plan.

Infestation of red tide over the past few weeks has dealt a
heavy blow to the fisheries industry in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Dead fish, shrimps, crabs and clams could be seen all along the
coast, and the economic losses were estimated to be in millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province,
can now only have water for seven hours a day due to a severe
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The water volumes in the city's 10 major reservoirs have been
reduced by half compared with last year's level. The Wolongshan
Reservoir, which supplied water to the city, has dried up.
</P>
<P>
The shortage will last till the end of the month when the rainy
season sets in, according to the local meteorological station.
</P>
<P>
China plans to plant another 46 million hectares of trees in
the next 30 years, said Li Yucai, deputy director of the State
Forestry Administration Monday at a national working conference on
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
He said priority would be given to the upper reaches of the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers and regions surrounding Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China will pay more attention to ecological factors than
economic returns in afforestation, and efforts will be made to
ensure a sound eco-system in the western region, as China is
preparing to boost the economy of the region.
</P>
<P>
The fifth national survey on forest resources reveals that some
2.16 million hectares of forest land are abused or overtaken for
other purposes each year.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Forestry conducted the survey last
year in 200-plus counties and uncovered 1,124 cases involving land
abuse.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will investigate the sources of polluted water in a
move to improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
Industrial pollution in this metropolis has been reduced
through years of reform, but pollution is still on the increase.
</P>
<P>
Livestock farms in the upper part of the city pose threats to
water sources, said an environment official. The municipal
government will conduct a four-month survey about the sources of
pollution.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Accord Signing Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The signing of an agreement to
end Fiji's five-week-old hostage crisis has delayed yet again, the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The military and coup leader George Speight were scheduled to
sign an agreement Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted military spokesman Filipo Tarakinikini as saying
Saturday morning's meeting with the coup leader will go ahead, but
they will now only review the draft accord.
</P>
<P>
He also said he can not say when a definitive agreement will be
signed.
</P>
<P>
All that is known of the agreement is its name, the Muanikau
Accord, and that the coup plotters have warned it will not result
in the immediate release of the hostages, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Speight and his gunmen have held Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and his cabinet hostage since seizing Fiji's parliament
on May 19.

<HEADLINE> Jones, El Guerrouj Head IAAF World Rankings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- World athletics governing body,
IAAF, have announced that Morrocan Hicham El Guerrouj and American
Marion Jones are the top male and female athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
The results were announced following the unveiling of a new
computerized rankings system which lists 64,569 athletes and
results from 19,070 competitions.
</P>
<P>
Jones, a former basketball player who will compete for five
medals at the Sydney Olympics, including the 100 meters, 200
meters and long jump, is currently on 1429.74 points. Romanian
distance runner Gabriela Szabo is four points behind and Jones'
compatriot Inger Miller a further seven points back.
</P>
<P>
El Guerrouj was four points ahead of American sprinter Maurice
Greene, on 1487.00 with 400m world record holder Michael Johnson
28 points behind.
</P>
<P>
The new system is at an experimental stage but IAAF president
Lamine Diack hopes that it will only be a matter of time before it
is used as a means of ranking athletes.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to use this system experimentally this year, but
we believe the IAAF council will very soon approve it and see to
it that it is universallly accepted and applied," said Diack.
</P>
<P>
The governing body plans to update the list of the top 1,000
male and female athletes once a week with the results then
published on its website.
</P>
<P>
The rankings are based on the five best results obtained by the
athletes in the previous year, both in scores and placings and
extra points will be awarded for world records.

<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- English soccer club Ipswich Town
have signed striker Martin Reuser from Dutch first division
Vitesse Arnhem with an agreed fee of one million pounds (about 1.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According a Reuters report, Ipswich, which had newly been
promoted to the premier league, will have to pay an extra 250,000
pounds (about 375,700 U.S. dollars) if they stay in the top flight.
</P>
<P>
Reuser was on-loan at Ipswich for the final three months of
last season and scored the last goal in the 4-2 first division
play-off win against Barnsley that gained Ipswich promotion.
</P>
<P>
Ipswich manager George Burley said: "I'm thrilled we have
finally agreed everything with Martin and he has signed a three-
year contract."

PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) released on Friday the inaugural world rankings,
with American woman sprinter Marion Jones and Moroccan middle-
distance runner Hicham El Guerrouj leading the women's and men's
divisions.
</P>
<P>
Just like the tennis and golf rankings systems, the IAAF will
announce overall standings for the top 1,000 men and women every
Tuesday, along with the leading 100 athletes in each individual
event.
</P>
<P>
The ranking system is based on a complicated formula developed
by Bojidar Spiriev that will depend on two main criteria,
performance and results.
</P>
<P>
An athlete will receive points, from a pre-determined table,
for both the time or distance they recorded in a competition and
their placing.
</P>
<P>
The two amounts will be added together with the total
determining the athlete's overall score.
</P>
<P>
The top five performances in a 12-month period will be averaged
to determine the athlete's ranking.
</P>
<P>
Other factors will also affect the points total such as wind,
hand-held or electronic timing and the quality of the meeting.
Competitions such as the Golden League will be given a higher
score than national championships.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's Olympic judo team
has been doubled in size with the inclusion of Tim Slyfield and
Brendon Crooks for the Sydney Games in September, the New Zealand
Press Association reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Olympic Committee and Judo New Zealand have
confirmed Slyfield (under-81kg) and Crooks (under-60kg) in the
team alongside Daniel Gowing and Fiona Iredale, who were announced
as the team members in April.
</P>
<P>
Slyfield and Crooks were chosen after a decision by the Judo
Federation of Australia not to use spots reserved for host country
competitors, opening up gaps for the New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
Arguably the pair should have been in the field as they had
beaten their Australian rivals in recent competitions.
</P>
<P>
Slyfield won the Oceania championships in Sydney in March,
beating Australia's world No 9 Daniel Kelly in the final.
</P>
<P>
Crooks finished third at the championships, beating Australia's
national champion Frank Serrano.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Follow Pro-active Fiscal Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government will
continue to follow a pro-active fiscal policy to offset the impact
of inadequate domestic demand and other factors, said an article
in the 26th issue of the weekly news magazine "Outlook", which
will hit the newsstand Monday.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have been following a pro-active fiscal
policy over the past two years as well as adopting a number of
measures.
</P>
<P>
The weekly listed four existing conditions for further carrying
out the pro-active policy.
</P>
<P>
-- The inadequate domestic demand and low economic growth rate
calls for the pro-active policy.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1999, the financial deficits of the Central Government
accounted for 2.19 percent of the GDP, lower than the
internationally recognized bottom line of three percent.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1997, debts accounted for only 8.1 percent of GDP in
China, while the figure was 49.8 percent in the United States;
</P>
<P>
-- Surplus of products and materials has also provided the
condition for expansion of financial expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Appropriate policies on fiscal revenue, currency and financial
supervision should be adopted to facilitate the pro-active fiscal
policy, the weekly suggests.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cities Fight Imminent Water Shortage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's cities are now facing
mounting pressure as growing population and limited water
resources threaten severe water shortages, according to the 26th
issue of the weekly news magazine "Outlook", which will hit the
newsstand Monday.
</P>
<P>
China's water resources per capita are about 2,300 tons, making
up 25 percent of the world's average. The United Nations has
listed China among the 13 nations in the world with water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, some 400 of China's 668
cities are facing water shortages, and of the 400, more than 100
are facing serious water shortages.
</P>
<P>
With per capita water resources of 760 tons, Shanghai has been
listed as one of the world's cities suffering from serious water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, per capita water resources are only 600 tons and
300 tons in Shenzhen and Beijing respectively.
</P>
<P>
Despite the serious situation, public awareness about
protecting water resources and conserving water need to be
improved.
</P>
<P>
A primary student from Beijing has conducted a voluntary
investigation and found out that the car washing businesses in the
Xicheng District in Beijing would use 1.314 million tons of water
each year. Car washing business in Beijing would dry up the
Kunming Lake, a big lake in the city, in a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
A survey conducted by this student showed that a dripping water
tap would waste 36 tons of water a year.
</P>
<P>
Low price of tap water is another factor bringing about waste
of water. For instance, an aquatic product businessman in a local
free market only pays 100 yuan per month no matter how much water
he uses. In most cases, however, they never turned off their taps.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that because of poor quality of tap water pipes
and other facilities, 60 per cent of tap water in the city is
wasted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already started to seriously tackle
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Beijing issued 26 measures on protecting water
resources. For instance, water recycling drive will take place in
all industries in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city government will gradually phase out old-type water
taps. The new water-saving taps can be turned on and off easily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a water quota system has been enforced in some
enterprises and residential areas in the city.
</P>
<P>
Water saving measures does not necessarily mean that the living
standard will decline. Some developed countries including the U.S.,
Italy and Israel have taken various measures to encourage water
saving.
</P>
<P>
By adopting current applicable techniques and means, the
agricultural sector will save 10-50 percent of water and the
industry sector will save 40-90 percent, with no negative effects
on the economy and quality of living.

<HEADLINE> Keegan to Have Say on Wilkinson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan will have the final say on whether he gets help from
technical director Howard Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
According to FA chief executive Adam Crozier, there are no
plans to dilute Keegan's position as coach of the national side.
</P>
<P>
"Any changes to Kevin Keegan's back-up team are ultimately his
responsibility," said Crozier.
</P>
<P>
"Crucially, Kevin has had, and will continue to have, full
responsibility for selecting the England team, its tactics and its
performance on the pitch," he said.
</P>
<P>
FA chairman Geoff Thompson had indicated that Keegan needed
help on the tactical side of the game and suggested handing
technical director Wilkinson a more prominent role.
</P>
<P>
"I think Kevin may need a little bit of help in that department
and he would accept that himself," said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
But Crozier insisted that: "Everybody at Lancaster Gate already
has the job of helping Kevin, not least the members of Howard
Wilkinson's technical department. We are all 100% behind Kevin
because he is the best person for the job. His ability, charisma
and inspiration command the support of us all."

The three clay court specialists have written to the ATP Tour
complaining that the All England Club had ignored their world

They are now threatening not to turn up to the Championships

"The ATP requires us to play in Wimbledon but it does not
oblige Wimbledon to respect the ATP rankings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero and Costa are ranked 13 and 15 respectively - 16
players are seeded in the Wimbledon singles.
</P>

"There has been a lot of nonsense that we don't understand and
we ask for a new draw, otherwise we think we will not play," said

TUNISIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Saturday blamed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for being
reluctant to conclude the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks under
way.
</P>
<P>
Barak refused to give the Israeli negotiators the go-ahead to
wrap up the peace talks under way, and this was the main reason why
the talks have so far made no headway, said Arafat after a meeting
with
Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali here Saturday.

He also cited Israeli military threats and schemes to judaize
holy sites from Jerusalem to Bethlehem as the main hurdles on the
way to peacemaking between Israel and the Palestinians, the

Arafat renewed his complaints about Israel's Jewish settlement
expansion activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying that
the number of those settlements have tripled under Barak's 11-month

Arafat thanked the Tunisian president for maintaining the

support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Castro Warns Delay in Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
Saturday warned the possibility of a further delay in the return
to the island of boy Elian Gonzalez, who has been retained in the
United States since November 1999.
</P>
<P>
Castro in a message alerted the Cuban people to the resolution
at a plenum of 12 magistrates of the Atlanta Court of Appeals that
threw out a recourse of interdiction filed by Elian's relatives in
Miami, and acknowledged the right of Juan Miguel Gonzalez to
determine the future of his son.
</P>
<P>
The president's message was relayed to the people during a
protest demonstration that put in the streets Saturday morning
some 400,000 persons in the eastern city of Holguin, some 750
kilometers east of Havana, attended by First Vice President Raul
Castro.
</P>
<P>
Castro called the last news encouraging, but said that there
are still impending risks that cannot be underestimated "because
the criminal mafia of Miami and its allies in the United States
extreme right have still a lot of power and maneuvering space."
</P>
<P>
Castro referred in this way to the announced intention of the
Miami relatives to file an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court of
Justice, a recourse for which they have five days, according to
the last decision of the Atlanta Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Castro warned that the approval of the request of interdiction
(a legal recourse that would bar the exit of the boy from U.S.
territory) by one single magistrate of the Supreme Court would be
enough to extend for months the permanence of Elian in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"This judicial process should have never been started in the
United States, whose courts did not have jurisdiction for it,"
said Castro, commenting on the legal mechanism that started in
November 1999 when the boy survived a wreckage of illegal
emigrants.
</P>
<P>
Castro called on Cubans "not to rest a single minute" even if
Elian returns because they must continue "fight without asking for
quarters" against the Cuban Adjustment, Helms-Burton, and
Torricelli laws, as well as against the trade embargo maintained
for more than four decades by Washington against the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban president also lashed against the execution last
Thursday of Shaka Sankofa, a young Afro-American condemned to
death in Texas for assassination, and whose trial was full of
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity with the cause of Sankofa is for Castro an
internationalistic retribution because "90 percent of the United
States Afro-American citizens" defended the rights of Elian and
his father.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Sankofa case "has shown to the
world the bitter fruits of a social system in which the
differences between the richest and the poorest are infinite and
where individualism, egotism, and violence rule as a philosophical
foundation."
</P>
<P>
"It is a generalized notion in the United States and in all the
world that he was sentenced to the capital penalty simply because
he was black," said Castro.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan, Honduran Military Chiefs Get Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Understanding between the
Nicaraguan and Honduran armies has as its fundamental goal to
prevent a military conflict, said General Javier Carrion McDonough,
chief of the Nicaraguan army, who was quoted by local radio
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the mechanism of the memorandum of understanding
or the role of the Organization of American States (OAS) have not
been depleted, and we can say that military tensions have eased"
between the two countries, said Carrion.
</P>
<P>
Carrion made these statements at the end of a meeting of the
Nicaraguan and Honduran military chiefs Friday at the border post
of Las Manos, 250 kilometers northeast of Managaua, the Nicaraguan
capital.
</P>
<P>
This is the first bilateral military meeting of the heads of
the two Central American countries' army chiefs since the
governments of the two nations signed on February 7 in Washington
a memorandum of understanding to find a solution to the tensions.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the relations between Nicaragua and Honduras
started seven months ago when the Honduran Congress ratified in
November 1999 the Ramirez-Lopez treaty signed with Colombia, which,
according to the Nicaraguan government, deprives it 130,000 square
kilometers of its maritime platform.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government responded to that decision by
imposing "a sovereignty tax" of 35 percent to the commodities
imported from Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to Carrion, the Nicaraguan and Honduran military
chiefs analyzed during their meeting the possibility of uniting

<HEADLINE> Putin Meets European Leaders on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
met here Saturday with a delegation of the Council of Europe, with
the situation in the breakaway Chechen republic top on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Putin said Moscow sees its relations with the Council of Europe
as "a key element in our foreign policy and in Russia's
integration with the world community," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting in the Kremlin with Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini, who heads the CE ministerial council, CE Secretary
General Walter Schwimmer, and Italy's State Secretary for Foreign
Affairs Umberto Ranieri, Putin stressed that Russia, while
insisting on its national interests, would heed Western opinions
on its military campaign against rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Even though "some issues are arguable, this does not mean that
we are indifferent toward the view of the CE ministerial council
and PACE (Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe)."
</P>
<P>
"We will always insist on our national interests but we attach
importance to the CE view on respect for human rights, on which we
have grounded and will ground our foreign and domestic policy,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the European delegation would
consider Moscow's arguments "attentively and impartially."
</P>
<P>
However, Schwimmer, the CE secretary general, indicated that
the PACE, at its upcoming session next Monday, would be unlikely
to reverse its decision last April recommending the start of
procedures of suspending Russian membership in the organization.
</P>
<P>
"I think they (parliamentarians) will take some positive steps
(of Russia in Chechnya) into consideration, but they wait for a
political dialogue and a political solution to the Chechen crisis
to start. That's the thing that matters most," Schwimmer told
reporters after his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Deputies Oppose Parlacen Dissolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan President Alfonso
Portillo's proposal to dissolve the Central America Parliament (
Parlacen) unleashed the criticism of the Nicaraguan deputies
regarding that regional organization.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Ernesto Somarriba, Parlacen president, quoted
Saturday by the local press, said he was surprised and called as "
mysterious" President Portillo's plan to eliminate Parlacen.
</P>
<P>
Somarriba said he had contacted his colleagues of El Salvador
and Panama, who said that the presidents of the two countries had
said that there is an agreement of all the presidents of the
isthmus to restructure the integration organizations, especially
the Parlacen.
</P>
<P>
"We are the first to think that Parlacen must be restructured
and we are the first to want linking functions for the parliament,
" said Somarriba.
</P>
<P>
Somarriba said that on June 27 the Parlacen deputies will
discuss the theme that has caused a political upheaval in all the
area, and he did not dismiss a confrontation with President
Portillo.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo said Thursday that there
is a consensus among the Central American presidents to eliminate
the Parlacen because of its ineffectivity and enormous economic
cost of 20 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan deputy to Parlacen Tomas Borge admitted that
Parlacen is costly and that it is possible to discuss the lowering
of those costs by reducing the present number of deputies, which
are 20.
</P>
<P>
But Borge, also deputy general secretary of the National
Liberation Sandinista Front (FSLN), asked himself what is costlier:
Parlacen, or the generalized administrative corruption of the
Central American governments.
</P>
<P>
"With just what the Central American governments rob, it would
be possible to maintain 10 Central American parliaments," said
Tomas Borge.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of Parlacen, in the opinion of the legendary
Sandinista leader, would be a crime because its mere existence is
a hope for the integration of the area.
</P>
<P>
Borge considered it strange that President Portillo had made
that proposal, because when Portillo was a candidate for the
presidency of his country, he promised to several Central American
legislators, including Borge himself, the consolidation of that
regional forum.
</P>
<P>
"He promised us the sky and its stars, but now Portillo says
that Parlacen is a garbage bin. Either the Guatemalan president is
a demagogue or what the press dispatches say are lies," said Borge.
</P>
<P>
Parlacen was created in July of 1991 as the result of dialogue
among Central Americans to pacify their region in the decade of
the 80's known as Esquipulas II.
</P>
<P>
The forum is made up of 20 deputies elected by popular vote in
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, and each
one of the deputies of the Chamber receives a monthly salary of 1,
200 dollars, plus 2,800 dollars for traveling allowances.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Opposition Rejects Buyoya's Transitional Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of Burundian
pro-Hutu opposition parties Saturday rejected the suggestion that
President Pierre Buyoya lead a transitional government following a
peaceful settlement to a seven-year-old bloody ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
Seven main opposition parties, namely the CNDD, Frodebu,
Frolina, Palipehutu, PL, PP and RPB, taking part in the on-going
peace talks in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha said in a
declaration that the president during the transitional period will
be drawn from them.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not accept Buyoya or anybody from this cabinet to lead
the transition. We'll nominate the candidate," the declaration
said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said that they had already briefed peace
facilitator, former South African president Nelaon Mandela on
their stand, which they claimed was an reaction to the silent
lobbying by Buyoya for the position.
</P>
<P>
They also urged unconditional release of all alleged political
prisoners and early dismantling of the forced regroupment camps in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also called for a new national army with
Tutsis, who dominate the current army, accounting for 40 percent
and Hutu rebel forces the rest 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders who signed the declaration were Leonard
Nyangoma (CNDD) , Dr Jean Minani (Frodebu), Joseph Karumba
(Frolina), Antoine Sezoya (Palipehuta), Gaetan Nikobamye (PL),
Shadrack Niyonkuru (PP) and Balthazar Bigirimana (RPB).
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 19 parties in the Arusha talks have been meeting
here since Monday to draft a document on implementation and
guarantees of a peace accord which is expected to be signed in
July.
</P>
<P>
The civil war between Tutsi-led government and Hutu rebels in
the tiny central African country has killed more than 200,000
people, displaced more than a million and confined hundreds of
thousands in "regroupment camps".
</P>
<P>
The war started when the first democratically elected ethnic
Hutu president Melchior Ndadaye was murdered by Tutsi soldiers in
1993.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants To Create a Vietnam in L.America: Colombian Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) guerrilla leader Manuel Cardona said Saturday in
Santiago that the United States plans to create a new Vietnam in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Cardona, a member of the FARC international policy commission,
said that the United States prepares "a new Vietnam in Latin
America with all the consequences and horrors this would mean for
our people and for the countries of the region, but also for the
invader."
</P>
<P>
Cardona traveled to Chile to relay to political representatives
of this country the FARC version about the status of the process
of dialogue of this rebel group with the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is the largest rebel group in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate passed Thursday an assistance fund of around
one billion dollars to finance the Plan Colombia, which the
guerrilla defines as "a plan of war designed by the Pentagon
against the Colombian people that marks the start of a new Vietnam
in Latin America."
</P>
<P>
The aid package totaled 934 million dollars, including hardware,
an armada of 60 helicopters and funds for the U.S. military to
train counter-narcotics brigades in the Colombian army and
national police.

summit" with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Arnoldo Aleman, to
discuss the San Juan River limits conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican president told the press after attending the

negotiations after the incident to find a solution to the problem,
but they have not had a positive result so far.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica agreed to present a proposal to solve the problem
during the last summit of Central American presidents on June 17
in Panama.
